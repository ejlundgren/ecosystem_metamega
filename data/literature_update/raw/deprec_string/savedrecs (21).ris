AB  - Background: Development of safe, effective products to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV remains a priority. Prior to clinical testing, the products must undergo strict safety evaluations to avoid mucosal drug toxicity, inflammation, and vaginal microbiome (VMB) shifts. Based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, we designed a study to measure the inflammatory markers and VMB changes after intravaginal treatment with products that have been associated with toxicity, with the objective to develop a Gram stain slide scoring system, similar to Nugent scoring, correlated with the proinflammatory cytokines in sheep.Methods: Non-pregnant Dorset ewes (n = 34) were randomized to receive 5 ml intravaginal 4% nonoxynol-9 (N9) contraceptive gel, positive control (0.2% benzalkonium chloride), placebo control [hydroxethyl cellulose (HEC)], or no application daily for 10 days, with 11-day post-treatment follow-up. The vaginal swabs were collected for the cytokines, VMB, and Gram-stained slides. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-8, CXCL10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was used to determine inflammatory state of the sample. Vaginal microbiome community types (CT) were utilized to create five equivalent slide subsets for iterative development of a Gram-stained slide scoring system with comparisons with inflammatory state based on the cytokine levels.Results: Digital images of the Gram-stained slides were scored based on Gram staining and morphology of bacteria, presence of sheep epithelial cells, and immune cells. The scoring system was modified in an iterative fashion with weighting based on cytokine categorization of inflamed samples, with three of four cytokine values above the mean indicating that the sample was inflamed. The parameters in the final version of the scoring system included mature epithelial cells, Gram-negative rods, and Gram-positive diplococci indicating normal and immune cells indicating inflammation. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was 0.725 (ROC AUCs range between 0.5 and 1.0) with a greater area indicating higher diagnostic ability of a test with a binary outcome: inflamed or normal.Conclusion: The scoring system, derived from the advanced VMB and cytokine analyses, provides a validated, practical method for quantification of Gram-stained slides that can be performed in most laboratories, increasing the potential for standardization. The training plan can assist laboratories to determine the safety of intravaginal products in their sheep studies or the methodological approach can be applied to other animal models where such data are also needed.

AB  - Lamb enteritis constitutes an economic burden on sheep production worldwide. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Salmonellae among diarrheic lambs at Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt and to detect the associated clinical, hematologic, biochemical, and antioxidant parameters. Fifty diarrheic and twenty apparently healthy control lambs were examined clinically, and hematologically. Diarrheic lambs had a significant elevated body temperature, respiratory and pulse rate, most of hemogram parameters, total proteins and albumin, oxidative stress markers malonaldiahyde and nitric oxide levels, liver enzymes, urea and creatinine than control group. On the other hand, these diarrheic lambs had significant reduction in total leukocyte count and lymphocytes, antioxidant biomarkers super oxide dismutase activities and reduced glutathione than control lambs. E. coli and Salmonella spp. were isolated from 32.00% and 16.00% of diseased lambs, respectively. Serotyping and biochemical tests of examined samples identified 16 E. coli isolates belonged to 10 different serotypes; O6, O8, O26:H11, O75, O84:H21, O103:H2, O114:H4, O121:H7, O128:H2 and O163:H2. All isolates are STEC as they harbor either Shiga-toxin 1 or Shiga-toxin 2 genes or both. One isolate carries intimin gene (eaeA) and classified as EHEC; O26:H11. The obtained nine isolates of Salmonella carry enterotoxin (Stn) genes, eight of them carry hyper-invasive locus (hilA) gene, all isolates belonged to six serotypes; S. Enteritidis, S. Heidelberg, S. Tsevie, S. Typhimurium, S. Essen, and S. Infantis. Lamb diarrhea was prevalent in the studied area and might constitute a veterinary and public health threat. Alteration in hemato-biochemical parameters and oxidative-anti-oxidant balance could help adopt appropriate treatment regimens. (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary To protect animal and human health, it is important to detect disease early and prevent spreading. Other common aims of animal health surveillance are disease monitoring and proving freedom of disease. In a good surveillance system, representative information of farmers and veterinarians from the entire country should be collected. Our study focused on the validity of the Dutch passive surveillance components based on veterinary helpdesk and postmortem data. We examined whether data was received from the entire country and represented the swine and cattle sector in the Netherlands. The difference between the region with the highest and lowest contact rate was 12.8 and 6.1 fold for cattle and pigs, respectively; for postmortem, this was 4.0 and 38.3. Part of the differences could be explained by the distance to the postmortem facility and farm density. We found that veterinary practices serving few farms and veterinary practices serving many cattle farms had fewer contacts compared to other practices. Although this study found regions and practices with lower-than-expected contacts and postmortems, information was obtained from all regions and most veterinarians. The results can be used to improve the coverage and representativeness by an increased focus on specific regions, farms or veterinary practices. Common aims of animal health surveillance systems are the timely detection of emerging diseases and health status monitoring. This study aimed to evaluate the coverage and representativeness of passive surveillance components for cattle and swine in the Netherlands from 2015-2019. The passive surveillance components consisted of a telephone helpdesk for veterinary advice and diagnostic and postmortem facilities. Spatial analysis showed heterogeneity (range in RR = 0.26-5.37) of participation across the Netherlands. Generalized linear mixed models showed that distance to the diagnostic facility and farm density were associated with the number of contacts of farmers with the helpdesk and postmortem examination. The contact rate of veterinary practices was associated with their number of clients, ranging in RR from 0.39 to 1.59. We concluded that the evaluation indicated differences in coverage of the passive surveillance components across regions, farms and veterinary practices. Due to the absence of emerging infections in the study period, we were unable to estimate the consequences of the observed differences for the early detection of disease. Nevertheless, regions and veterinary practices with low participation in passive surveillance might be a risk for early detection, and consequently, further understanding of the motivation to participate in passive surveillance components is needed.

AB  - Tigecycline is a last-resort antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. The emergence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance genes is posing a serious threat to food safety and human health and has attracted worldwide attention. In this study, we characterized six tigecycline-resistant Escherichia fergusonii strains from porcine nasal swab samples collected from 50 swine farms in China. All the E. fergusonii isolates were highly resistant to tigecycline with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 16-32 mg/L, and all contained the tet(X4) gene. In addition, 13-19 multiple resistance genes were identified in these isolates, revealed by whole-genome sequencing analysis. The tet(X4) gene was identified as being located in two different genetic structures, hp-abh-tet(X4)-ISCR2 in five isolates and hp-abh-tet(X4)-Delta ISCR2-ISEc57-IS26 in one isolate. The role of efflux pumps in tigecycline resistance was evaluated by using inhibitor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The MIC values of tigecycline showed a 2- to 4-fold reduction in the presence of CCCP, indicating the involvement of active efflux pumps in tigecycline resistance in E. fergusonii. The tet(X4) gene was found to be transferable to Escherichia coli J53 by conjugation and resulted in the acquisition of tigcycline resistances in the transconjugants. Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) and phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship of five isolates originating from different pig farms, suggesting the transmission of tet(X4)-positive E. fergusonii between farms. In conclusion, our findings suggest that E. fergusonii strains in pigs are reservoirs of a transferable tet(X4) gene and provide insights into the tigecycline resistance mechanism as well as the diversity and complexity of the genetic context of tet(X4) in E. fergusonii.

AB  - Magnesium (Mg2+) is a crucial nutrient for the growth and development of Camellia sinensis and is closely related to the quality of tea. However, the underlying mechanisms responding to low-Mg 2+ stress in tea plants remain largely unknown. In this study, photosynthetic parameters, metabolomics, and transcriptomics were utilized to explore the potential effects of low Mg2+ on the growth and metabolism of C. sinensis. Low-Mg2+ treatment increased the ratio of shoot dry weight to root dry weight but decreased the photosynthesis of C. sinensis. Forty and thirty metabolites were impacted by Mg2+ shortage in C. sinensis shoots and roots, respectively. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed the possible reasons for the decreased contents of chlorophyll and catechins and the increased theanine content in C. sinensis roots. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis indicated that the Mg2+ transport system was essential in the regulation of Mg2+ homeostasis in C. sinensis, in which CsMGT5 was identified to be the key regulator according to CsMGT5-overexpressing and complementary assays in Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, silencing of CsMGT5 in vivo reduced the content of chlorophyll in C. sinensis shoots. In addition, CsMGT5 might collaborate with ammonium transporters to keep the amino acid content steady, suggesting its potential application for tea quality improvement. All these findings demonstrate the key roles of CsMGTs for Mg2+ homeostasis in C. sinensis, providing a theoretical basis for Mg2+ efficient utilization in plants.

AB  - Agricultural injuries are a valuable social sustainability indicator. However, current methods use sector-scale production data, so are unable to assess the impact of changes in individual farming practices. Here, we developed a method that adopts a life cycle approach to quantify the number of serious injuries during agricultural production processes and assess the potential impact of changes in agricultural practices. The method disaggregates agricultural production into operations and estimates the contribution each operation makes to the frequency of different types of injuries. The method was tested using data collected by survey during an expert workshop in which sixteen participants were asked to estimate the parameters related to typical dairy cattle and pig farms. Parameter estimates for specific operations varied considerably between participants, so normalized values were used to disaggregate sector-scale statistics to production operations. The results were in general agreement with the results from other studies. Participants found it challenging to quantify the potential effect of new technologies. Provided suitable empirical statistical data are available, the method can be used to quantify the risk of injury associated with individual products and provide an ex-ante assessment of future developments in farming practices.

AB  - There are several links between insulin resistance and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. However, the direct influence of insulin signaling on abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulation-a hallmark of Parkinson's disease-remains poorly explored. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to investigate the direct effects of insulin signaling on pathological alpha-synuclein accumulation induced by the addition of oc-synuclein preformed fibrils in primary dopaminergic neurons. We found that modifying insulin signaling through (1) insulin receptor inhibitor GSK1904529A, (2) SHIP2 inhibitor AS1949490 or (3) PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic failed to significantly affect alpha-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to the aggregation-reducing effects observed after the addition of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Subsequently, we tested different media formulations, with and without insulin. Again, removal of insulin from cell culturing media showed no effect on alpha-synuclein accumulation. We observed, however, a reduced alpha-synuclein aggregation in neurons cultured in neurobasal medium with a B27 supplement, regardless of the presence of insulin, in contrast to DMEM/F12 medium with an N2 supplement. The effects of culture conditions were present only in dopaminergic but not in primary cortical or hippocampal cells, indicating the unique sensitivity of the former. Altogether, our data contravene the direct involvement of insulin signaling in the modulation of alpha-synuclein aggregation in dopamine neurons. Moreover, we show that the choice of culturing media can significantly affect preformed fibril-induced oc-synuclein phosphorylation in a primary dopaminergic cell culture.

AB  - Rapid population growth is leading to an increase in the demand for high-quality protein such as fish, which has led to a large increase in aquaculture. However, fish feed is dependent on fishmeal. It is necessary to explore more sustainable protein alternatives that can meet the needs of fish. Insects, due to their high protein content and good amino acid profiles, could be a successful alternative to fishmeal and soybean meal traditionally used in sectors such as aquaculture. In this work, seven species of insects (Hermetia illucens, Tenebrio molitor, Acheta domestica, Alphitobius diaperinus, Gryllodes sigillatus, Gryllus assimilis, and Musca domestica) approved by the European Union (UE) for use as feed for farmed animals (aquaculture, poultry, and pigs) were studied. Their proximate composition, hydrolysis of organic matter (OMd), hydrolysis of crude protein (CPd), degree of hydrolysis (DH/NH2 and DH/100 g DM), and total hydrolysis (TH) were analyzed. The results showed that Tenebrio molitor had digestibility similar to that of fishmeal, while Acheta domestica and Hermetia illucens provided similar digestibility to that of soybean meal. The acid detergent fiber (ADF) data were negatively correlated with all protein digestibility variables. The differences in the degree of hydrolysis (DH) results and the similarity in total hydrolysis (TH) results could indicate the slowing effects of ADF on protein digestibility. Further in vivo studies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUNDInsect pest resistance to insecticides and societal pressure to reduce pesticide load has increased oilseed rape (OSR) farmers' motivation to protect and exploit parasitoids for pest control. However, parasitoid presence and parasitism must be made visible to influence farmers' spraying decisions. Parasitism of cabbage seed weevil (CSW) (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham)) reduces damage to OSR immediately, making them a good case for demonstrating conservation biocontrol to farmers. We assessed the occurrence and activity of CSW parasitoids in 84 OSR fields over 2 years and identified the impact of associated local landscape factors. RESULTSMean cabbage seed weevil infestation rates were 11% and 10% in 2020 and 2021, and parasitism rates were high in both years (75% and 74%, respectively). Temporal and spatial dynamics of OSR in the landscape surrounding the focal fields were important for both CSW and parasitoid numbers, suggesting a dilution effect for increasing OSR area since the previous year. A multimodel inference analysis showed that OSR-related factors were important predictors for both the infestation rate of CSW and the number of parasitoids. For parasitoids, protected nature areas and hedgerows were important. Parasitism rates were high and largely unaffected by landscape factors. CONCLUSIONCSW and its parasitoids respond similarly to interannual changes in the OSR resource; in addition, parasitoids benefit from uncropped areas in the surrounding landscape. The complexity of the pest and parasitoid response to landscape factors limits the prospect of designing landscapes for improved pest control by the parasitoids. Parasitoids of CSW may be present as local populations in agricultural landscapes with the potential for consistent and substantial parasitism. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND The rice stalk stink bug Tibraca limbativentris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is one of the most important rice pests in Brazil. The search for cultivars that tolerate insect injury is necessary to complement other less aggressive methods of pest suppression. The combination of integrated pest management tactics will reduce insecticide applications and improve the safety of food production. Here, we tested the tolerance response of Xingu, Canela de Ferro and Primavera rice genotypes in glasshouse experiments. In addition, we measured tolerance expressed in a variety of physiological responses, including gas exchange rates, leaf chlorophyll content and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification.
   RESULTS The results showed that the tolerance of the Primavera genotype to rice stalk stink bug damage was higher, due to (a) a lower reduction of photosynthetic activity, (41% reduction only 96 h after infestation) compared to Xingu and Canela de Ferro (56 and 65% reduction at 24 and 48 h after infestation, respectively); (b) the capacity to maintain the chlorophyll content after infestation, while Xingu and Canela de Ferro reduced their chlorophyll content to 20% and 25% at 72 and 48 h after infestation, respectively; (c) the antioxidative defense system being activated in the first 12 h after infestation, in which superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed an increase of 61% in its activity, and (d) the maintenance of its grain yield, number of panicles per plant, number of filled grains, and spikelets sterility.
   CONCLUSION Rice genotypes tolerant to herbivory can be identified by measuring the effect of injury and the plant's physiological response by evaluating attributes such as grain yield and its components, gas exchange, chlorophyll content and ROS detoxification. Therefore, the use of rice genotypes tolerant to stalk stink bugs as a component of integrated pest management has the potential to reduce upland rice yield loss.

AB  - Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) coated with magnetite and an imidazolium-based ionic liquid (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (HMIMPF6)) core/shell nanoparticles (NPs) (nZVI@Fe3O4@HMIMPF6) were successfully green synthesized for the first time using industrial iron waste. Polyphenols were extracted from dried leaves of Camellia sinensis and applied as the reducing agent for nZVI synthesis. Synthesized NPs were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, VSM, BET, SEM, TEM, and mapping analysis. According to the results, NPs were in the size range of less than 30 nm and the values of alpha(s) , BET =3.5975 m(2)g(-1), V-m (BET monolayer capacity) = 0.8265 cm(3)(STP)g(-1), C = 47.378, total pore volume (p/p(0) = 0.990) = 0.14998 cm(3)g(-1) and mean pore diameter =16.68 nm were obtained. These NPs were used for the Cr (VI) removal from aqueous samples. Taguchi orthogonal array design was used to optimize the various affecting variables on the efficiency of Cr (VI) removal. Results showed that about 90.0% of Cr (VI) were removed at the optimum conditions. Kinetic and isotherm studies were conducted, and the pseudo-second order kinetic model was determined as the most appropriate kinetic model. The equilibrium data displayed proper linearity with the Freundlich isotherm model (R-2 =0.9697), and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 56.49 mg g(-1) (in terms of CrO42- ions). Also, Redlich-Peterson, Sips, and Toth as three-parameter isotherm models were compared to two-parameter models using MATLAB's fmincon function. Thermodynamic studies showed negative Delta G degrees, Delta H degrees = 50.255 kJ mol(-1), and Delta S degrees = +0.1799 kJ mol(-1) K-1 indicating spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process. According to the results, the nZVI@Fe3O4@IL NPs can be recovered by an external magnet and exhibit good applicability for Cr (VI) removal from real samples.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most challenging infectious disease of pig populations causing devastating economic loss to swine industry. Reverse genetics allow to engineer modified viruses such attenuated strains for vaccine development. Some reverse genetic systems were described for PRRSVs but, due to genome complexity of PRRSVs, construction and modification of such systems remain laborious and time-consuming.
   In this study, we described a reverse genetics approach based on the "Infectious-Subgenomic Amplicons" (ISA) method to rescue infectious PRRSV particles. Permissive cells were transfected with 4 overlapping synthetic DNA fragments covering the entire genome of PRRSV which allowed the rapid reconstruction of the complete virus genome and the subsequent generation of infectious wild-type particles within days.
   The ISA method represent a rapid alternative of conventional reverse genetic systems. This method will help to generate genetically modified and attenuated strains for the development of sanitary countermeasures in the future. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has gained great importance as a promising therapy for a myriad of diseases. Of particular interest is the therapy of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure or atrial fibrillation using selective cardiac VNS. However, there is still a lack of organ-specific anatomical knowledge about the fascicular anatomy and topography of the cardiac branch (CB), which diminishes the therapeutic possibilities for selective cardiac neuromodulation. Here, we established a topographical and anatomical map of the superior cardiac VN in two animal species to dissect cervical and cardiac VN morphology.Methods: Autonomic nerves including superior CBs were harvested from domestic pigs and New Zeeland rabbits followed by imaging with microcomputed tomography (mu CT) and 3D rendering. The data were analyzed in terms of relevant topographical and anatomical parameters.Results: Our data showed that cardiac vagal fascicles remained separated from other VN fascicles up to 22.19 mm (IQR 14.02-41.30 mm) in pigs and 7.68 mm (IQR 4.06-12.77 mm) in rabbits from the CB point and then started merging with other fascicles. Exchanges of nerve fascicles between sympathetic trunk (ST) and VN were observed in 3 out of 11 nerves, which might cause additional unwanted effects in unselective VNS. Our 3D rendered digital model of the cardiac fascicles was generated showing that CB first remained on the medial side where it branched off the VN, as also shown in the mu CT data of 11 pig nerves, and then migrated towards the ventromedial site the further it was traced cranially.Conclusion: Our data provided an anatomical map of the cardiac vagal branches including cervical VN and ST for future approaches of selective cardiac neurostimulation, indicating the best position of selective cardiac VNS just above the CB point.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis injects bacterial effector proteins into human epithelial cells to facilitate the establishment of new infections. The chlamydial type III secreted effector translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) has been shown to nucleate and bundle actin filaments. It is also believed to initiate new signaling pathways via an N-terminal phosphorylation domain. A comprehensive understanding of the host pathways that are controlled by Tarp to aid in the establishment of a successful infection remains incomplete. To gain further insight into the cell signaling regulated by Tarp, we generated transgenic fruit flies engineered to express the N-terminal domain of Tarp. As many signaling pathways are conserved between flies and mammals, we hypothesized that expression of the Tarp N domain in the fruit fly might disrupt key pathways, resulting in developmental defects. Tarp N-domain expression in the fruit fly resulted in a mechanosensory bristle duplication phenotype similar to a previously characterized fly phenotype found to be a consequence of defects in the Hippo pathway. Tarp dependent disruption of the Hippo pathway was confirmed in a C. trachomatis tissue culture infection model. The capability of Tarp to alter Hippo pathway signaling in infected epithelial cells is a previously unrecognized pathway commandeered by chlamydia and likely contributes to the establishment of chlamydia's intracellular niche.

AB  - Although allogenic meniscus grafting can be immunologically safe, it causes immune rejection due to an imbalanced tissue supply between donor and recipient. Pigs are anatomically and physiologically similar to adult humans and are, therefore, considered to be advantageous xenotransplantation models. However, immune rejection caused by genetic difference damages the donor tissue and can sometimes cause sudden death. Immune rejection is caused by genes; porcine GGTA1, CMAH, and B4GLANT2 are the most common. In this study, we evaluated immune cells infiltrating the pig meniscus transplanted subcutaneously into BALB/c mice bred for three weeks. We compared the biocompatibility of normal Jeju native black pig (JNP) meniscus with that of triple knockout (TKO) JNP meniscus (alpha-gal epitope, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and Sd (a) epitope knockout using CRISPR-Cas 9). Mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages were found to have infiltrated the transplant boundary in the sham (without transplantation), normal (normal JNP), and test (TKO JNP) samples after immunohistochemical analysis. When compared to normal and sham groups, TKO was lower. Cytokine levels did not differ significantly between normal and test groups. Because chronic rejection can occur after meniscus transplantation associated with immune cell infiltration, we propose studies with multiple genetic editing to prevent immune rejection.

AB  - Studies have shown that there were associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and anxiety. Nonylphenol (NP) is an EDC with weak estrogen activity. This study aimed to clarify whether subchronic exposure of NP at environmental concentrations induces anxiety-like behavior, and effects of NP on the regulators (NMDAR2B, PSD-95, Synapsin1) expressions of synaptic plasticity in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vivo, 40 male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (each with 10 rats): low dose (0.4 mg/kg/day, L-NP), middle-dose (4 mg/kg/day, M - NP), high-dose (40 mg/kg/day, H-NP) and corn oil (Control) groups. In vitro, HT22 cells were divided into a control group (Control), NP group (NP, 20 mu M), glutamine acid receptor inhibitor group (MK-801, 10 mu M) and MK-801 + NP group. The concentration of NP in the hippocampus rised with the increase of NP exposure concentration in the treatment groups (F = 7.542, P = 0.001). Compared with the control group, the residence time in the dark box after NP exposure had extended (F = 117.927, P < 0.01). The duration (F = 112.054, P < 0.01) and the number of times (F = 13.514, P < 0.01) to enter the closed arm in the NP exposure group significantly increased. There were more neurons degeneration and nuclear shrinkage in the M - and H- NP groups, while the average number of shrinked neurons increased with the increasing dose of NP exposure. The protein expressions of PSD-95 (F = 97.723, P < 0.01), Synapsin1 (F = 41.797, P < 0.01) and NMDAR2B (F = 3.440, P = 0.036) in the NP group were lower than those of the control. Simultaneously, the expressions of PSD-95, Synapsin1 and NMDAR2B in the hippocampus were down-regulated; the mRNA expression of PSD-95 (F = 19.950, P < 0.01), Synapsin1 (F = 3.498, P = 0.035) and NMDAR2B (F = 9.293, P < 0.01) genes in the hippocampus decreased in the M - and H-NP groups. In vitro, the trend of the fluorescence intensity expressed by PSD-95 (F = 2.606, P = 0.124) and Synapsin1 (F = 20.573, P < 0.01) among the groups was: MK-801 + NP group < MK-801 < NP group. The protein expressions of PSD-95 (F = 5.699, P = 0.022), Synapsin1 (F = 10.820, P = 0.003) and NMDAR2B (F = 6.041, P = 0.019) were down-regulated. These results suggested that subchronic exposure to environmental concentrations of NP induced anxiety, and reduced the protein and/or mRNA expressions of regulators of synaptic plasticity (PSD-95, Synapsin1, NMDAR2B).

AB  - Aging is commonly associated with cognitive decline, particularly in memory, and is linked to neuronal hyperexcitability and disrupted sleep-related oscillations in key brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Melatonin has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to counteract age-related cognitive impairments. In this study, 24-month-old male Wistar rats were treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 30 days. Local field potentials were recorded from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex to assess neuronal activity. Memory performance was evaluated using the novel object recognition test, and qPCR measured expression levels of inflammatory and amyloidogenesis markers. Melatonin treatment significantly reduced neuronal hyperexcitability, enhanced delta and theta oscillations, and increased sleep spindle amplitude, which were associated with improved memory performance. Additionally, melatonin attenuated the expression of pro-inflammatory markers without affecting the expression of amyloidogenesis-related genes. These findings suggest that melatonin may enhance cognitive function in aging by modulating neuronal excitability, sleep oscillations, and neuroinflammatory processes.

AB  - Highly stretchable, adhesive and conductive triblock hydrogel was synthesized and utilized as a flexible and stable bioelectrocatalytic sensing layer of enzyme-based amperometric glucose biosensor. The hydrogel was prepared through one-pot polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid, methacrylamide, and hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The physical and chemical properties of the hydrogel were characterized with Xray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. Glucose oxidase (GOx) and chitosan (CTS) embedded hydrogel was drop-coated on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and screen printed graphite electrode (SPGE). The resulting GOx/CTS/hydrogel-GCE and GOx/CTS/hydrogel-SPGE exhibited excellent mediated bioelectrocatalytic oxidation current for glucose. The calibration curve of glucose by the GOx/CTS/hydrogel-GCE showed the linear range from 0.25 to 15 mM with the sensitivity of 27.0 mu A mM- 1 cm- 2 . This GOx/CTS/hydrogel-based sensing layer coated on the SPGE was stable against bending, and the response to glucose was almost same irrespective of the bending angles (0, 30, 60, and 90 degree). In addition, the response to glucose was not interfered by various organic and inorganic interfering species, allowed to detect glucose in goat serum. Furthermore, the GOx/CTS/ hydrogel-GCE kept its original activity of 99.64 % during 30 days' storage under dry state in refrigerator.

AB  - Hydroxyapatite (HAp) was used in the sorption study for three different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ring structures (Naphthalene (NAP), Anthracene (ANT), and Chrysene). HAp powders were produced from Camelus bone as an eco-friendly and inexpensive source. Three distinct surface areas (66.56, 94.88, and 94.35 m2/g) at three different temperatures (500, 650, and 900 degrees C), were applied to prepare the HAp500, HAp650, and HAp900 samples after passing CO2 at 700 degrees C. It was obvious that the surface area of HAp was greatest at 650 degrees C as compared to 500 degrees C with a very small variation in uptake between HAP650 and HAP900. Furthermore, for ANT, HAp900 provides the best uptake. In addition, HAp650 is the best since calcining at 650 degrees C is less expensive than calcining at 900 degrees C. The effect of shaking time on the sorption of NAP, ANT, and CHR dissolved in n-hexane was carried out using HAp650. The impacts of sorbent amount, concentration, and temperature were studied. The study indicated that the uptake was 66.89, 69.49, and 19.67 mg/g after 120 min of equilibration. It was observed that the uptake of NAP, ANT, and CHR increased as the temperature increased up to 35 degrees C. A slight increase was obtained from 35-55 degrees C, indicating that the adsorption occurring on the HAp650 surface is endothermic. The positive values of Delta H demonstrated the endothermic nature of the adsorption process. Furthermore, the positive entropy of adsorption represents the adsorbent material's affinity for NAP, ANT, and CHR. In addition, several isotherm models were used to deduce an adsorption mechanism. The adsorption system's R2 values were 0.9615 for NAP, 0.8666 for ANT, and 1.00 for CHR. These values agree well with the Langmuir isotherm.

AB  - Hippocampal neuronal activity generates dendritic and somatic Ca2+ signals, which, depending on stimulus intensity, rapidly propagate to the nucleus and induce the expression of transcription factors and genes with crucial roles in cognitive functions. Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta Os), the main synaptotoxins engaged in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, generate aberrant Ca2+ signals in primary hippocampal neurons, increase their oxidative tone and disrupt structural plasticity. Here, we explored the effects of sub-lethal A beta Os concentrations on activity-generated nuclear Ca2+ signals and on the Ca2+-dependent expression of neuroprotective genes. To induce neuronal activity, neuron-enriched primary hippocampal cultures were treated with the GABA(A) receptor blocker gabazine (GBZ), and nuclear Ca2+ signals were measured in A beta Os-treated or control neurons transfected with a genetically encoded nuclear Ca2+ sensor. Incubation (6 h) with A beta Os significantly reduced the nuclear Ca2+ signals and the enhanced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) induced by GBZ. Likewise, incubation (6 h) with A beta Os significantly reduced the GBZ-induced increases in the mRNA levels of neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 4 (Npas4), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ryanodine receptor type-2 (RyR2), and the antioxidant enzyme NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqo1). Based on these findings we propose that A beta Os, by inhibiting the generation of activity-induced nuclear Ca2+ signals, disrupt key neuroprotective gene expression pathways required for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes.

AB  - Within the evolving regulatory landscape of the European Union concerning animal by-product (ABP) management within the circular economy framework, this study explores the concurrent objectives of safeguarding public health and environmental integrity and maximizing final product value. Anaerobic digestion (AD) emerges as a holistic solution for ABP management, addressing sanitation concerns while enhancing end-product quality. Through laboratory-scale experimentation, the AD process applied to four substrates-poultry manure, swine manure, cattle manure, and food waste-is scrutinized. Prior to AD, pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 60 min ensures microbial safety. Subsequently, four experimental AD cycles compare pasteurized and unpasteurized substrates. Results highlight the efficacy of pasteurization in sanitizing final products across all substrates, emphasizing its pivotal role in product safety. However, pasteurization's impact on system performance varies. While enhancing biogas yield from animal waste notably, its influence on food waste biogas production is less pronounced, indicating substrate-specific dynamics. This study offers insights into optimizing ABP management strategies, emphasizing the interplay between pasteurization, substrate characteristics, and AD performance. Such insights are crucial for advancing sustainable practices in the circular economy paradigm, balancing environmental stewardship with economic viability.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is recognized as a zoonotic pathogen with an increasing threat to livestock and poultry. However, research on K. pneumoniae of animal origin remains limited. To address the gap, a comprehensive investigation was carried out by collecting a total of 311 samples from the farms of four animal species (dairy cow, chicken, sheep, and pig) in selected areas of Xinjiang, China. Isolates were identified by khe gene amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Genotyping of K. pneumonia isolates was performed using wzi typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). PCR was employed to identify virulence and resistance genes. An antibiotic susceptibility test was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer method. The findings revealed an isolation of 62 K. pneumoniae strains, with an average isolation rate of 19.94%, with the highest proportion originating from cattle sources (33.33%). Over 85.00% of these isolates harbored six virulence genes (wabG, uge, fimH, markD, entB, and ureA); while more than 75.00% of isolates possessed four resistance genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, oqxA, and gyrA). All isolates exhibited complete resistance to ampicillin and demonstrated substantial resistance to sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and enrofloxacin, with an antibiotic resistance rate of more than 50%. Furthermore, 48.39% (30/62) of isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, with a significantly higher isolation rate observed in the swine farms (66.67%) compared to other farms. Genetic characterization revealed the classification of the 62 isolates into 30 distinct wzi allele types or 35 different sequence types (STs). Notably, we identified K. pneumoniae strains of dairy and swine origin belonging to the same ST42 and wzi33-KL64 types, as well as strains of dairy and chicken origin belonging to the same wzi31-KL31-K31 type. These findings emphasize the widespread occurrence of drug-resistant K. pneumoniae across diverse animal sources in Xinjiang, underscoring the high prevalence of multidrug resistance. Additionally, our results suggest the potential for animal-to-animal transmission of K. pneumoniae and there was a correlation between virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, the current study provides valuable data on the prevalence, antibiotic resistance, and genetic diversity of K. pneumoniae originating from diverse animal sources in Xinjiang, China.

AB  - BACKGROUND Plant resistance to insects can be reduced by crop domestication which means their wild ancestors could provide novel sources of resistance. Thus, crossing wild ancestors with domesticated crops can potentially enhance their resistance against insects. However, a prerequisite for this is identification of sources of resistance. Here, we investigated the response of three wild potato (Solanum stoloniferum Schltdl.) accessions and cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) to aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) herbivory. RESULTS Results revealed that there was a significant reduction in aphid survival and reproduction on wild potato accessions (CGN18333, CGN22718, CGN23072) compared to cultivated (Desiree) potato plants. A similar trend was observed in olfactometer bioassay; the wild accessions had a repellent effect on adult aphids. In contrast, among the tested wild potato accessions, the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) was significantly attracted to volatiles from CGN18333. Volatile analysis showed that wild accessions emitted significantly more volatiles compared to cultivated potato. Principal component analysis (PCA) of volatile data revealed that the volatile profiles of wild and cultivated potato are dissimilar. beta-Bisabolene, (E)-beta-farnesene, trans-alpha-bergamotene, d-limonene, (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT), and p-cymen-7-ol were the main volatiles contributing to the emitted blends, suggesting possible involvement in the behavioural response of both M. persicae and D. rapae. CONCLUSION Our findings show that the tested wild accessions have the potential to be used to breed aphid-resistant potatoes. This opens new opportunities to reduce the aphid damage and to enhance the recruitment of natural enemies. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Due to the high rate of spontaneous abortion (SAB) in porcine pregnancy, there is a major interest and concern on commercial pig farming worldwide. Whereas the perturbed immune response at the maternal-fetal interface is an important mechanism associated with the spontaneous embryo loss in the early stages of implantation in porcine, data on the specific regulatory mechanism of the SAB at the end stage of the implantation remains scant. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools to analyze the healthy and arresting endometrium on day 28 of pregnancy. We identified 639 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and 2357 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the end stage of implantation, and qRT-PCR was used to verify the sequencing data. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated weaker immune response activities in the arresting endometrium compared to the healthy one. Using the lasso regression analysis, we screened the DELs and constructed an immunological competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network related to SAB, including 4 lncRNAs, 11 miRNAs, and 13 genes. In addition, Blast analysis showed the applicability of the constructed ceRNA network in different species, and subsequently determined HOXA-AS2 in pigs. Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that the SAB events at the end stages of implantation is associated with the regulation of immunobiological processes, and a specific molecular regulatory network was obtained. These novel findings may provide new insight into the possibility of increasing the litter size of sows, making pig breeding better and thus improving the efficiency of animal husbandry production.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that individual differences in infant fear memory positively predict adulthood anxiety-like behavior and conditioned fear expression. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this relationship and the effect of environmental (e.g., social) influences on the stability of this relationship have not been explored. In the present study, we examined whether individual differences in infant fear memory predict levels of endogenous fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2; a biomarker of fear/anxiety) in adulthood, and whether the mean memory retention of a rat's cagemates predicts conditioned fear expression and FGF2 in adulthood. We conditioned infant rats to associate a white noise with shock, and tested their memory of the association 1 week later. They were then weaned and randomly assigned to cage/cagemates. In adulthood, rats received weak context conditioning (i.e., a single shock) and were tested for fear of the context the following day. Rats were then euthanized and their brains extracted to measure levels of hippocampal FGF2 protein. Across 2 experiments, an individual rat's fear memory during infancy positively predicted their own fear expression in adulthood, but the mean memory retention of their cagemates did not predict fear expression. In contrast, the mean memory retention of a rat's cagemates during infancy negatively predicted hippocampal FGF2 protein in adulthood, but an individual rat's memory retention did not predict their own levels of FGF2. These data support the idea that variations in the fearfulness of a rat's cagemates predict individual differences on physiological measures in adulthood.

AB  - Camellia oleifera C.Abel, commonly known as tea-oil camellia, is a type of significant woody oil crop that is widely cultivated in southern China. During 2017-2021, a fungal foliar disease was detected in routine surveys in Hainan. However, diseases of tea-oil camellia are seldom reported in Hainan. In this study, 51 Colletotrichum spp. isolates were obtained from the symptomatic samples of tea-oil camellia, collected from three production sites located in Hainan. A polyphasic approach was applied to distinguish Colletotrichum species. All 51 isolates were primarily characterized morphologically, and six gene regions, including an internally transcribed space of ribosomal DNA (ITS), chitinsynthase (CHS-1), fi-tubulin (TUB), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and manganese-superoxide (SOD2), were sequenced for each isolate. By combining morphological characterization with multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the six genes, the fungal isolates were identified, representing three Colletrotrichum species: C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. cordylinicola. The most predominant species was C. fructicola. In pathogenicity tests on the tea-oil camellia cultivar (Reyan1), all collected isolates were pathogenic on tea-oil camellia leaves and were reisolated from symptomatic leaves. Colletotrichum fructicola was the most aggressive species on the attached leaves. This is the first report of C. cordylinicola affecting tea-oil camellia anthracnose worldwide. These results will improve our understanding of the pathogens and provide important insights on the diagnosis and efficient disease management of tea-oil camellia anthracnose.

AB  - Weed management has been one of the major challenges in camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] production owing to the limited options for selective herbicides. The aim of this study was to evaluate and screen camelina-safe herbicides and establish an effective weed management program combining pre- and post-emergence herbicide application in camelina. There were 22 herbicides (6 herbicides registered as pre- and 16 herbicides registered as post-emergence herbicides) with various modes of action tested in this study. Greenhouse evaluation showed that, of the 22 herbicides tested, post-application of s-metolachlor and prodiamine (registered as pre-emergence herbicide), and clethodim, fluazifop-p, clopyralid, and quinclorac (registered as post-emergence herbicide) possessed adequate safety (similar to x4 of recommended doses) when used on the two camelina genotypes (CamC1 and CamK3) by evaluation of plant visual efficacy, seed weight, and plant biomass yield per plant. Herbicides from the ALS (e.g., flumetsulam), HPPD (e.g., mesotrione), IPP (e.g., clomazone), PPO (e.g., oxyfluorfen), and PS II (e.g., bentazon) groups caused severe camelina growth suppression and mortality. Field evaluation with greenhouse-selected herbicides demonstrated the superior weed control efficacy of sequential application combining pre- (s-metolachlor) and post-emergence (clethodim, fluazifop-p, or clopyralid) herbicides (84-90% reduction in weed biomass in camelina plots relative to untreated control) than the single application of those herbicides (68-83%). Clethodim and fluazifop-p provided good post-emerged grass weed control (e.g., crabgrass), whereas clopyralid effectively controlled the broadleaf weeds, such as common vetch and shepherd's purse. Camelina seed yields from s-metolachlor following clethodim, fluazifop-p, or clopyralid application were statistically comparable to the yield of the weed-free treatment (hand weeding) and were significantly greater than those of the untreated control, indicating the effective weed control efficacies provided by those herbicides. Sequential application of the above herbicides did not affect camelina seed oil content, the principal UFA concentrations (e.g., C18:1 similar to 3), UFA/SFA, and MUFA/PUFA. In summary, sequential application combining pre- (s-metolachlor) and post-emergence (clethodim, fluazifop-p, or clopyralid) herbicides shows effective weed control in camelina, thus providing a great opportunity to increase camelina production through herbicide-based weed management.

AB  - Background: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction remains a major problem after heart transplantation and may be associated with brain death (BD) in a donor. A calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus was recently found to have beneficial effects on heart function. Here, we examined whether tacrolimus might prevent BD-induced RV dysfunction and the associated pathobiological changes. Methods: After randomized tacrolimus (n = 8; 0.05 mg & BULL;kg(-1)& BULL;day(-1)) or placebo (n = 9) pretreatment, pigs were assigned to a BD procedure and hemodynamically investigated 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after the Cushing reflex. After euthanasia, myocardial tissue was sampled for pathobiological evaluation. Seven pigs were used as controls. Results: Calcineurin inhibition prevented increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and RV-arterial decoupling induced by BD. BD was associated with an increased RV pro-apoptotic Bax-to-Bcl2 ratio and RV and LV apoptotic rates, which were prevented by tacrolimus. BD induced increased expression of the pro-inflammatory IL-6-to-IL-10 ratio, their related receptors, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in both the RV and LV. These changes were prevented by tacrolimus. RV and LV neutrophil infiltration induced by BD was partly prevented by tacrolimus. BD was associated with decreased RV expression of the & beta;-1 adrenergic receptor and sarcomere (myosin heavy chain [MYH]7-to-MYH6 ratio) components, while & beta;-3 adrenergic receptor, nitric oxide-synthase 3, and glucose transporter 1 expression increased. These changes were prevented by tacrolimus. Conclusions: Brain death was associated with isolated RV dysfunction. Tacrolimus prevented RV dysfunction induced by BD through the inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation activation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a type of biological control agent (BCA), Bacillus velezensis possesses the efficacy of inhibiting pathogenic microorganisms, promoting plant growth, and overcoming continuous cropping obstacles (CCOs). However, there is limited reporting on the optimization of the cultivation conditions for such biocontrol agents and their role as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) delivery vectors. RESULTS: In this study, a Bacillus velezensis strain HS-3 was isolated from the root zone of tomato plants with in vitro anti-Botrytis cinerea activity. The investigation into active compounds revealed that HS-3 predominantly employs proteins with molecular weights greater than 3 kDa for its antifungal activity. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis identified various proteases and chitosanase, further suggesting that HS-3 most likely employs these enzymes to degrade fungal cell walls for its antifungal effect. To optimize the production of extracellular proteins, fermentation parameters for HS-3 were systematically optimized, leading to an optimized medium (OP-M). HS-3 cultured in OP-M demonstrated enhanced capacity to assist tomato plants in withstanding CCOs. However, the presence of excessive nematodes in diseased soil resulted in the disease severity index (DSI) remaining high. An RNA interference mechanism was further introduced to HS-3, targeting the nematode tyrosine phosphatase (TP) gene. Ultimately, HS-3 expressing dsRNA of TP in OP-M effectively assisted tomatoes in mitigating CCOs, reducing DSI to 2.2% and 17.8% of the control after 45 and 90 days of growth, respectively. CONCLUSION: The advantages of Bacillus velezensis in crop disease management and the mitigation of CCOs become even more pronounced when utilizing both optimized levels of endogenous enzymes and introduced nematode-targeting dsRNA.

AB  - Exposure to early adversity (EA) is associated with long-lasting dysregulations in cognitive processes sustained by brain regions that are sensitive to stress hormones: the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex. The Life Cycle Model of Stress highlights the importance of considering the timing at which EA began, as these brain regions follow distinct developmental trajectories. We aimed to test this hypothesis by assessing whether adults exposed to EA exhibit different cognitive patterns as a function of the age at which they were first exposed to EA. Eighty-five healthy men and women aged 21-40 years old (y/o) exposed to EA, as assessed by the Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire, were grouped based on the age of first exposure to EA: 0-2 y/o ("Infancy": hippocampal development), 3-7 y/o ("Early childhood": amygdala development) and after the age of 8 ("Childhood/Adolescence": frontoamygdala connectivity development). Declarative memory, attentional bias to threat and emotion regulation were measured. Results revealed increased attentional bias to threat in women first exposed to EA after 8 years. This result is in line with the Life Cycle Model of Stress and highlights the importance of considering the age at exposure to EA when investigating the effects of EA on cognitive processes.

AB  - Hippo signaling plays a crucial role in the cellular response to various stressors, such as mechanical stress, metabolic stress, and hypoxic stress. However, its physiological significance in copper (Cu) stress remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated aberrant activation of Hippo-YAP signaling in sheep pancreas and pancreatic organoids exposed to excessive Cu, accompanied by significant pathological changes, elevated levels of oxidative stress, and impaired mitochondrial structure and function. The inhibition of Hippo signaling or overexpression of YAP protected against Cu-induced damage by improving mitochondrial function and maintaining cellular Cu homeostasis. YAP interacted with TEAD and upregulated the expression of Cu chaperone ATOX1, a key regulator of intracellular Cu homeostasis. ATOX1 restored mitochondrial function under Cu stress by reducing mitochondrial superoxide levels, increasing ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, our findings confirmed that ATOX1 indirectly bound to the PPA2 promoter and increased its transcription. Notably, the restoration of ATP production in mitochondria mediated by PPA2 overexpression facilitated efficient intracellular Cu efflux, allowing rapid and precise reestablishment of intracellular Cu homeostasis under Cu stress. Collectively, Hippo-YAP signaling alleviates Cu-induced oxidative damage by restoring mitochondrial function through activation of PPA2 transcription depending on ATOX1, thereby ensuring cellular Cu efflux and enhancing antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Collagen peptides, as a natural source of peptides, possess multiple advantages such as anti-aging, anti-inflammatory properties, tissue repair, and the ability to inhibit melanin production. In this study, type I collagen extracted from pig skin was hydrolyzed with 1% and 3% hydrochloric acid, yielding collagen peptides CPH1 and CPH3. The melanin content and tyrosinase activity in B16F10 cells were compared via direct and paracrine action when CPH1 and CPH3 were used to interfere with melanogenesis. It was found that CPH3 significantly inhibited melanogenesis in B16F10 through the paracrine action involving HaCaT keratinocytes. The intracellular melanin content was measured at 65.23 +/- 1.30%, and the mRNA levels of tyrosinase and microphthalmia transcription factor in cells were 55.77 +/- 6.09% and 50.70 +/- 8.18% of the negative control, respectively. Furthermore, pigment deposition assays in zebrafish showed that, at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL, CPH3 significantly inhibited melanogenesis compared to the negative control. Finally, tyrosinase inhibitory peptides were identified from CPH3 through peptide segment sequence identification and molecular dynamics simulation. The peptides of Nona-AGPPGFPGA, Octa-APGPVGPA, and Octa-GLPGPPGP have a double effect on the inhibition of tyrosinase and melanin content in B16F10 cells.

AB  - Local field potential (LFP) deflections and oscillations define hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), one of the most synchronous events of the brain. SWRs reflect firing and synaptic current sequences emerging from cognitively relevant neuronal ensembles. While spectral analysis have permitted advances, the surge of ultra-dense recordings now call for new automatic detection strategies. Here, we show how one-dimensional convolutional networks operating over high-density LFP hippocampal recordings allowed for automatic identification of SWR from the rodent hippocampus. When applied without retraining to new datasets and ultra-dense hippocampus-wide recordings, we discovered physiologically relevant processes associated to the emergence of SWR, prompting for novel classification criteria. To gain interpretability, we developed a method to interrogate the operation of the artificial network. We found it relied in feature-based specialization, which permit identification of spatially segregated oscillations and deflections, as well as synchronous population firing typical of replay. Thus, using deep learning-based approaches may change the current heuristic for a better mechanistic interpretation of these relevant neurophysiological events.

AB  - Similar to most Psittaciformes, the blue-fronted parrot (Amazona aestiva) lacks sexual dimorphism. In this way, sexing methods have been investigated to assist in the reproductive management and medical care of these birds. This study aimed to assess head and radiographic biometry for sex identification of blue-fronted parrots. Six head measurements and 23 radiographic measurements of 52 carcasses (24 males and 28 females) were taken. Males exhibited higher mean values than females for most of the measurements. For head biometry, the proposed discriminant equation containing rhinotheca length and head plus rhinotheca length allowed for correct sexing of 60% of males and 88% of females, while for radiographic biometry the discriminant equation containing head heigh and right alula length allowed the discrimination of 84.6% of males and 66.7% of females. This is the first study evaluating the use of radiographic biometry for sexing psittaciforms. Both biometric methods are suitable for sexing blue-fronted parrots when DNA sampling is not possible, since they are low-cost, provide immediate results, and are non-invasive techniques.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the exact mechanism of action and why effects can take several weeks to manifest is not clear. The hypothesis of neuroplasticity is supported by preclinical studies, but the evidence in humans is limited. Here, we investigate the effects of the SSRI escitalopram on presynaptic density as a proxy for synaptic plasticity. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study (NCT04239339), 32 healthy participants with no history of psychiatric or cognitive disorders were randomized to receive daily oral dosing of either 20 mg escitalopram (n = 17) or a placebo (n = 15). After an intervention period of 3-5 weeks, participants underwent a [11C]UCB-J PET scan (29 with full arterial input function) to quantify synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) density in the hippocampus and the neocortex. Whereas we find no statistically significant group difference in SV2A binding after an average of 29 (range: 24-38) days of intervention, our secondary analyses show a time-dependent effect of escitalopram on cerebral SV2A binding with positive associations between [11C]UCB-J binding and duration of escitalopram intervention. Our findings suggest that brain synaptic plasticity evolves over 3-5 weeks in healthy humans following daily intake of escitalopram. This is the first in vivo evidence to support the hypothesis of neuroplasticity as a mechanism of action for SSRIs in humans and it offers a plausible biological explanation for the delayed treatment response commonly observed in patients treated with SSRIs. While replication is warranted, these results have important implications for the design of future clinical studies investigating the neurobiological effects of SSRIs.

AB  - Gelsemium elegans (Gardn. & Champ.) Benth is a toxic flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae used to treat skin diseases, neuralgia and acute pain. The high toxicity of G. elegans restricts its development and clinical applications, but in veterinary applications, G. elegans has been fed to pigs as a feed additive without poisoning. However, until now, the in vivo processes of the multiple components of G. elegans have not been studied. This study investigates the excretion, metabolism and tissue distribution of the multiple components of G. elegans after feeding it to pigs in medicated feed. Pigs were fed 2% G. elegans powder in feed for 45 days. The plasma, urine, bile, feces and tissues (heart, liver, lung, spleen, brain, spinal cord, adrenal gland, testis, thigh muscle, abdominal muscle and back muscle) were collected 6 h after the last feeding and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Five natural products in plasma, twelve natural products and five metabolites in urine, and three natural products in feces were characterized, suggesting that multiple components from G. elegans were excreted in the urine. However, ten natural products and four metabolites were detected in bile samples, which suggested that G. elegans is involved in enterohepatic circulation in pigs. A total of seven of these metabolites were characterized, and four metabolites were glucuronidated metabolites. Ten natural products and six metabolites were detected in the tissues, which indicates that G. elegans is widely distributed in tissues and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Among the characterized compounds, a highly toxic gelsedine-type alkaloid from G. elegans was the main compound detected in all biological samples. This is the first study of the excretion, metabolism and tissue distribution of multiple components from G. elegans in pigs. These data can provide an important reference to explain the efficacy and toxicity of G. elegans. Additionally, the results of the tissue distribution of G. elegans are of great value for further residue depletion studies and safety evaluations of products of animals fed G. elegans.

AB  - Realizing a visual flying environment in various scenarios is an instrumental key to establishing visual hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for flying UAVs. To simulate a desired UAV flying mission for a specific building landing in arbitrary geodetic coordinates, a new approach is presented. The approach fulfills the UAV landing HIL via three key elements: Building, Training, and Servoing. Building a flying dynamic scene which is not limited to a certain scenario, but can be utilized for generating different aerial remote sensing scenes according to desired geodetic coordinates (location-free), flying mission, perspective angles, and approaching velocities. The dynamic scene is constructed via RHINO graphics software based on georeferenced images taken at different altitudes. Training a deep detection framework on the extracted dataset from each constructed scene to localize a specific building as a landing platform. Servoing a pan-tilt camera on an embedded system by a pure image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method to coincide the detected building center with the acquired frame center during the flight. Tiny-YOLOv4 is picked as a light detector that runs on Nvidia nano with a servo kit and achieves a satisfactory result even with two wind disturbances models in a real-time condition. Thus, verifying a successful UAV landing on a specific building approach is accomplished.

AB  - BACKGROUND: N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a common messenger RNA (mRNA) modification that affects various physiological processes in stress responses. However, the role of m(6)A modifications in plants responses to herbivore stress remains unclear. RESULTS: Here, we found that an infestation of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) female adults enhanced the resistance of rice to N. lugens. The m(6)A methylome analysis of N. lugens-infested and uninfested rice samples was performed to explore the interaction between rice and N. lugens. The m(6)A methylation mainly occurred in genes that were actively expressed in rice following N. lugens infestation, while an analysis of the whole-genomic mRNA distribution of m(6)A showed that N. lugens infestation caused an overall decrease in the number of m(6)A methylation sites across the chromosomes. The m(6)A methylation of genes involved in the m(6)A modification machinery and several defense-related phytohormones (jasmonic acid and salicylic acid) pathways was increased in N. lugens-infested rice compared to that in uninfested rice. In contrast, m(6)A modification levels of growth-related phytohormone (auxin and gibberellin) biosynthesis-related genes were significantly attenuated during N. lugens infestation, accompanied by the down-regulated expression of these transcripts, indicating that rice growth was restricted during N. lugens attack to rapidly optimize resource allocation for plant defense. Integrative analysis of the differential patterns of m(6)A methylation and the corresponding transcripts showed a positive correlation between m(6)A methylation and transcriptional regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe role of plant flavonoids in direct defences against chewing and sap-sucking herbivorous insects has been extensively characterized. However, little is known about flavonoid-mediated tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivorous insects and natural enemies. In this study, we investigated how flavonoids modulate plant-insect interactions in a tritrophic system involving near-isogenic lines (NILs) of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) with high (line NIL-purple hypocotyl [PH]) and low (line NIL-green hypocotyl [GH]) flavonoid levels, with a generalist herbivore whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and its predatory bug (Orius sauteri). RESULTSBy contrasting levels of tomato flavonoids (direct defence) while manipulating the presence of predators (indirect defence), we found that high production of flavonoids in tomato was associated with a higher inducibility of direct defences and a stronger plant resistance to whitefly infestation and stimulated the emissions of induced volatile organic compounds, thereby increasing the attractiveness of B. tabaci-infested plants to the predator O. sauteri. Furthermore, suppression of B. tabaci population growth and enhancement of plant growth were mediated directly by the high production of flavonoids and indirectly by the attraction of O. sauteri, and the combined effects were larger than each effect individually. CONCLUSIONOur results show that high flavonoid production in tomato enhances herbivore-induced direct and indirect defences to better defend against herbivores in tritrophic interactions. Thus, the development of transgenic plants may present an opportunity to utilize the beneficial role of flavonoids in integrated pest management, while simultaneously maintaining or improving resistance against other pests and pathogens. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - As a means of environmental enrichment, music environment has positive and beneficial effects on biological neural development. Kunming white mice (61 days old) were randomly divided into the control group (group C), the group of D-tone (group D), the group of A-tone (group A) and the group of G-tone (group G). They were given different tonal music stimulation (group A) for 14 consecutive days (2 h/day) to study the effects of tonal music on the neural development of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice in early life and its molecular mechanisms. The results showed that the number of neurons in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice increased, with the cell morphology relatively intact. In addition, the number of dendritic spines and the number of dendritic spines per unit length were significantly higher than those in group C, and the expressions of synaptic plasticity proteins (SYP and PSD95) were also significantly elevated over those in group C. Compared with group C, the expression levels of BDNF, TRKB, CREB, PI3K, AKT, GS3K beta, PLC gamma 1, PKC, DAG, ERK and MAPK genes and proteins in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice in the music groups were up-regulated, suggesting that different tones of music could regulate neural development through BDNF and its downstream pathways. The enrichment environment of D-tone music is the most suitable tone for promoting the development of brain nerves in early-life mice. Our study provides a basis for screening the optimal tone of neuroplasticity in early-life mice and for the treatment of neurobiology and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - To investigate developmental changes in immunity and different responses to weaning stress of piglets from different breeds during suckling and weaning periods, a total of 30 litters of Taoyuan black (TB) piglets, Xiangcun black (XB) piglets, and Duroc (DR) piglets (ten litters per breed) were selected at 1, 10, 21, and 24 days of age, respectively. The results showed that the liver index of TB piglets was higher at 10 days of age than that of the other days of age and breeds. Regardless of the days of age, TB and XB piglets had a higher plasma IgA level and lower ileal IgM level than in the DR piglets, and XB piglets had a lower plasma IgG level than the other breeds. TB and XB piglets had a higher IL-6 level and lower IL-17 level in plasma at 24 days of age than DR piglets, regardless of the days of age. The ileal levels of IL-2, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha were lower in the TB and XB piglets at 24 days of age than in the DR piglets. The ileal expression levels of IRAK1, CD14, MyD88, and NF-kappa B were down-regulated in the TB and XB piglets at 24 days of age compared to those in the DR piglets. These findings suggest that there were differences in the development of immune function among different pig breeds. Moreover, TB and XB piglets presented stronger resistance to weaning stress than the DR piglets, which may be related to the immune regulation mediated by the MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - The content of veterinary drugs in manure is usually estimated by the amount of residues determined in its solid or liquid phase, individually, which previously required a separation step. As an alternative, a multiresidue method for the analysis of 48 veterinary drugs and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in swine raw manure as a whole has been developed and in-house validated in this work. The impact of several experimental factors during ultrasound assisted extraction was assessed. Hence, the use of alumina seemed to especially decrease the matrix effect and improve the overall recovery of drugs, mainly those with a high octanol-water partition coefficient. CECs in the extracts were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in tandem. A standard addition-matrix matched calibration was used for quantification. Application of the method to two related samples (raw manure and farm centrifuged raw manure) from a facility revealed that the concentrations of CECs determined in the raw manure by the comprehensive methodology were higher than those calculated by adding the concentrations measured in the solid and liquid phases, separately. This was attributed to the loss of CECs adsorbed on fine particles in the suspension during the sample preparation procedure of the liquid-phase. Furthermore, the decrease of residues in the raw manure when this is centrifuged in the farm to yield compost is shown.

AB  - While researchers interested in the evolution of human intelligence have traditionally focused on the psychology of other primates, a growing field aims to understand how similar cognitive abilities emerge in evolutionarily distant taxa. Here, we briefly review what we know, and why we do not know more, about the 'mind' of one such animal - the elephant - as well as its relevance to understanding convergent cognitive evolution across species. We also discuss the importance of studying animals such as elephants in the wild to better identify expressions of cognitive flexibility in human-impacted environments. Finally, as researchers invested in the study of an endangered species, we emphasize the need to contribute to the management of conservation-related problems from novel, cognitive perspectives.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV), known to infect pigs and found in various species, including humans, shows zoonotic potential. This study identified vimentin (VIM), a highly conserved intermediate filament protein expressed in multiple mammalian species and tissues, as a universal receptor for PRV infections in human and porcine cells. The adsorption of PRV is positively correlated with the level of VIM expressed in different cells. Overexpression and knockdown of VIM significantly increase and decrease PRV adsorption in cells, respectively. Dot blot assay and VOPBA showed that purified VIM can directly bind to PRV virions efficiently in a dose-dependent manner. PRV and VIM are co-localized at the cell membrane of PRV-infected cells. Moreover, PRV mainly binds to host VIM via its conserved amino acid residues in PRV gD (W98, G 162 , Y 164 , C 205 ) and gH (C439) and the Rod domain (residues 96-404) of VIM. In addition, regulating the expression of VIM also influences the entry, replication, and release of PRV, which has a similar result to the adsorption. These results demonstrate that VIM, as a universal receptor, can facilitate PRV infection in multiple stages in human and porcine cells, highlighting the zoonosis characteristics of PRV and the need for more attention.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of morbidity in children with both short- and long-term neurological, cognitive, cerebrovascular, and emotional deficits. These deficits have been attributed to ongoing pathophysiological cascades that occur acutely and persist post-injury. Given our limited understanding of the transcriptional changes associated with these pathophysiological cascades, we studied formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from the frontal cortex (FC) and the hippocampus + amygdala (H&A) regions of swine (N = 40) after a sagittal rapid non-impact head rotation (RNR). We then sequenced RNA to define transcriptional changes at 1 day and 1 week after injury and investigated the protective influence of cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified into five temporal patterns (Early, Transient, Persistent, Intensified, Delayed, or Late). DEGs were more abundant at 1 week than 1 day. Shared significant gene ontology annotations in both regions included terms associated with neuronal distress at 1 day and neurorecovery at 1 week. CsA (20 mg/kg/day) infused for 1 day (beginning at 6 h after injury) accelerated 466 DEGs in the FC and 2794 DEGs in the H&A, such that the CsA-treated transcriptional profile was associated with neurorecovery. Overall, our data reveal the effects of anatomic region and elapsed time on gene expression post-mTBI and motivate future studies of CsA treatment.

AB  - Background: Neonatal mortality due to preterm birth and low birthweight remains a significant challenge in Pakistan. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a unique, low-cost intervention proven to reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity and increase exclusive breastfeeding rates. However, KMC has not been attempted in community settings in Pakistan. We aim to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based KMC package to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality among preterm and low birthweight (LBW) infants, which will provide evidence for policy development and the large-scale implementation of KMC across the country.
   Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to reduce neonatal mortality among preterm and LBW infants. The secondary objectives are growth (measured as weight gain), reduced incidence of possible serious bacterial infection, and increased exclusive breastfeeding and continued breastfeeding practices.
   Methods: We designed a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial in one rural district of Pakistan. Stable, LBW babies (weighing 1200 grams to 2500 grams) are included in the study. The community KMC package, consisting of the KMC kit, information and counseling material, and community mobilization through KMC champions (village volunteers), was designed after preliminary research in the same geographical location and implemented in intervention clusters. The standard essential newborn care is offered in the control clusters. Infants are recruited and followed up by independent teams of data collectors. Data are collected on the duration of skin-to-skin contact, growth, breastfeeding practices, morbidities, neonatal mortality, and neurodevelopment status. Data analysis will be conducted based on the intention to treat principle. The Cox regression model will be used to assess the primary outcome of neonatal mortality. The secondary outcomes will be evaluated using linear or logistic regression.
   Results: The Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University, Pakistan, approved the study protocol in February 2017. Data collection began in August 2019 and will be completed in December 2021. Data analyses are yet to be completed.
   Conclusions: This intervention may be effective in preventing sepsis and subsequently improve survival in LBW newborns in Pakistan and other low-income and middle-income countries worldwide.

AB  - Resistance to insecticides and acaricides is a major impediment to effectively controlling insect pests worldwide. These pests include the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (T. T. urticae), ), which exists globally. This polyphagous herbivore causes major agricultural problems and can develop resistance to the agents above. Therefore, the continuous development of acaricides with new modes of action is important to circumvent the resistance of insects to pesticides. Acynonapyr is a novel class of acaricides containing an azabicyclo ring. In this study, we determined the activity of acynonapyr and its analogs on calcium-activated potassium (KCa2) C a 2) channels in two-spotted spider mites using electrophysiological techniques (patch-clamp). We also examined their acaricidal efficacy against mites in the laboratory. The acynonapyr and analogs blocked T. urticae KCa2 Ca 2 (TurKCa2) Ca 2) channels in a concentration-dependent manner. A comparison of acaricidal activity against T. urticae with inhibitory activity against TurKCa2 C a 2 revealed that TurKCa2 C a 2 channels are the primary toxicological targets. Finally, we examined the effect of acynonapyr on Homo sapiens KCa2 Ca 2 (HsaKCa2.2) C a 2.2) channels and demonstrated that the compound at 10 mu M had a limited effect on the activity of this channel.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. The hygienic status of arable soils in most developed countries has been unknown. In the presented study, a preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine the contamination with eggs of parasitic nematodes in the soil of arable fields in Poland. The aim of the study was to determine whether such contamination is common enough to constitute a significant problem and what factors may influence it.
   Materials and method. The study was conducted in 5 Polish provinces from autumn 2021 to spring 2022. The provinces differed significantly in terms of the area of agricultural land, agricultural suitability, type of soil, scale of cattle and pig breeding, production of manure and slurry, and the use of manures and organic fertilizers for fertilization. A total of 133 soil samples were collected. Parasitological examination of soil samples was carried out using the PN-Z-19006 method [1], with confirmed high sensitivity.
   Results. Parasite eggs were found in a total of 67 samples, of which 56 samples contained eggs of roundworms of the genus Ascaris (an average of 3.29 eggs/100 g of soil), 23 contained eggs of whipworms (an average of 1.22 eggs/100 g), and 3 contained eggs of Toxocara (1 egg/100 g).
   Conclusions. Differences in the percentage of positive samples were found depending on the period in which the samples were taken. The percentage of positive samples collected in autumn (53.57%) was higher than the percentage of positive samples collected in spring (48.05%). Similarly, the average number of eggs of in positive samples collected in autumn (3.43 eggs/100 g) was higher than the average number of eggs in samples collected in spring (2.90 eggs/100 g). Differences in the percentage of positive samples were also found depending on the region of origin of the samples.

AB  - Simple Summary The African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a DNA virus belonging to the Asfivirus genus and Asfarviridae family. In recent years, ASF has grown to be a significant concern for the pig industry worldwide. The ever-growing handling of ASFV pathological material in laboratories, for either diagnostic or research activities, requires particular caution to avoid accidental virus release from laboratories with consequent detrimental economic and environmental effects. This paper aims to describe the Italian National Reference Laboratory (NRL) efforts to develop a biological containment tool for ASF laboratories and animal facilities. The easy-to-apply recommendations focusing on the risk assessment system and internal audits used for enhancing Italian biosafety and biosecurity measures are reported.Abstract The African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family, Asfivirus genus. It is responsible for massive losses in pig populations and drastic direct and indirect economic impacts. The ever-growing handling of ASFV pathological material in laboratories, necessary for either diagnostic or research activities, requires particular attention to avoid accidental virus release from laboratories and its detrimental economic and environmental effects. Recently, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/689 of 17 December 2019 repealed the Commission Decision of 26 May 2003 reporting an ASF diagnostic manual (2003/422/EC) with the minimum and supplementary requirements for ASF laboratories. This decision generated a regulatory gap that has not been addressed yet. This paper aims to describe the Italian National Reference Laboratory (NRL) efforts to develop an effective and reliable biological containment tool for ASF laboratories and animal facilities. The tool consists of comprehensive and harmonized structural and procedural requirements for ASF laboratories and animal facilities that have been developed based on both current and repealed legislation, further entailing a risk assessment and internal audit as indispensable tools to design, adjust, and improve biological containment measures.

AB  - Simple Summary The quality and yield of pork are significantly affected by the development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle. To identify the genetic factors that underlie this biological process, we initiated a study focusing on transposable elements (TEs). Due to their capacity of self-replication and relocation within the host genome, TEs play an important role in shaping the genome regulatory landscape. By utilizing extensive transcriptomic data spanning 27 developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle, we created a comprehensive atlas of TE expression, revealing the intricate relationship between active TEs and epigenetic modifications. Through gene co-expression network analysis and the integration of multi-omics data, we uncovered a TE-mediated genetic regulatory network governing the development and growth of skeletal muscle. This research not only identifies valuable candidate genes for the genetic improvement of the economic traits of pork but also introduces an innovative TE-centric approach for dissecting the genetic factors contributing to complex traits.Abstract The development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle determine pork quality and yield. While genetic regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development has been extensively studied using various omics data, the role of transposable elements (TEs) in this context has been less explored. To bridge this gap, we constructed a comprehensive atlas of TE expression throughout the developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle. This was achieved by integrating porcine TE genomic coordinates with whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data from 27 developmental stages. We discovered that in pig skeletal muscle, active Tes are closely associated with active epigenomic marks, including low levels of DNA methylation, high levels of chromatin accessibility, and active histone modifications. Moreover, these TEs include 6074 self-expressed TEs that are significantly enriched in terms of muscle cell development and myofibril assembly. Using the TE expression data, we conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified a module that is significantly associated with muscle tissue development as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the signals of pig meat and carcass traits. Within this module, we constructed a TE-mediated gene regulatory network by adopting a unique multi-omics integration approach. This network highlighted several established candidate genes associated with muscle-relevant traits, including HES6, CHRNG, ACTC1, CHRND, MAMSTR, and PER2, as well as novel genes like ENSSSCG00000005518, ENSSSCG00000033601, and PIEZO2. These novel genes hold promise for regulating muscle-related traits in pigs. In summary, our research not only enhances the TE-centered dissection of the genetic basis underlying pork production traits, but also offers a general approach for constructing TE-mediated regulatory networks to study complex traits or diseases.

AB  - Deguelin is a natural flavonoid extracted from plants belonging to the Lonchocarpus, Derris, or Tephrosia genera. It inhibits AKT activity in tumors and has the potential to be used as a treatment for malignant tumors. However, the risks associated with the use of deguelin on male fertility have not yet been explained in detail. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of deguelin on sperm functions during capacitation. First, boar spermatozoa were exposed to different concentrations of deguelin (0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 & mu;M). Next, sperm functional assessments, such as sperm motility, capacitation status, intracellular ATP level, and cell viability, were performed. The expression levels of PI3K/AKT-related proteins and the phosphorylation of their tyrosine residues were also evaluated by western blotting. No significant difference was observed in cell viability; however, deguelin considerably decreased sperm motility and motion kinematics in a dose-dependent manner. Although no significant difference was observed in the capacitation status, acrosome reaction decreased at high concentrations of deguelin (50 and 100 & mu;M). Furthermore, intracellular ATP levels were significantly decreased in all deguelin treatment groups compared with those in the control group. Results of western blotting revealed that deguelin substantially diminished tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, in contrast to previous studies showing that deguelin inhibits AKT activity, our results showed that it increased the expression of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that deguelin exerts negative effects on sperm functions due to abnormal PI3K/AKT signaling activation. We believe that this is the first study to provide evidence that deguelin can regulate sperm functions independent of PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. Furthermore, its detrimental effects on male fertility should be considered while developing or using deguelin as a therapeutic agent.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that prenatal stress (PS) can potentially contribute to depression-like behavior in offspring and that this effect may be moderated by cross-fostering. However, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains to be determined. This study aimed to determine the effect of cross-fostering on the expression of EAAT2 and the SNARE complex in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex of PS offspring rats and to demonstrate functional effects on depression-like behavior. The impacts of cross-fostering were functionally assessed using the sucrose preference test (SPT), the forced swimming test (FST) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine changes in the expression of EAAT2 and SNAREs mRNA in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex of offspring rats. PS offspring rats showed significantly decreased sucrose preference and prolonged immobility time, while cross-fostering effectively increased sucrose preference and shorten the time of immobility. The expression of EAAT2 mRNA in PS offspring rats was markedly reduced, whilst the core mRNA expression of the SNARE complex increased. Our results provide strong evidence demonstrating that cross-fostering can alleviate depression-like behavior and regulate the abnormal expression levels of EAAT2 mRNA and SNARE complex in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex of PS offspring rats. Our findings contribute to further understanding of the pathogenesis of PS-induced depression and may help to inform the future development of novel treatment approaches.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with neurological disorders often display altered circadian rhythms. The disrupted circadian rhythms through chronic jetlag or shiftwork are thought to increase the risk and severity of human disease including, cancer, psychiatric, and related brain diseases. ResultsIn this study, we investigated the impact of shiftwork or chronic jetlag (CJL) like conditions on mice's brain. Transcriptome profiling based on RNA sequencing revealed that genes associated with serious neurological disorders were differentially expressed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). According to the quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, several key regulatory genes associated with neurological disorders were significantly altered in the NAc, PFC, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum. Serotonin levels and the expression levels of serotonin transporters and receptors were significantly altered in mice treated with CJL. ConclusionOverall, these results indicate that CJL may increase the risk of neurological disorders by disrupting the key regulatory genes, biological functions, serotonin, and corticosterone. These molecular linkages can further be studied to investigate the mechanism underlying CJL or shiftwork-mediated neurological disorders in order to develop treatment strategies.

AB  - A promising strategy for combating bacterial infections involves the development of agents that disarm the virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, thereby reducing their pathogenicity without inducing direct lethality. Sortase A, a crucial enzyme responsible for anchoring virulence factors to the cell surface of several pathogenic bacteria, has emerged as a possible target for antivirulence strategies. A series of hippocastanum species (Aesculus pavia, A. parviflora, Aesculus x carnea, and A. hippocastanum) were used to prepare ethanol- and water-based extracts for assessing their effect on Staphylococcus aureus sortase A. The extracts were characterized through HPLC analysis, and their polyphenols content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The specific toxicity profile was evaluated in Daphnia magna using the median lethal concentration (LC50) and against the fibroblast MRHF cell line. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values on sortase A, determined after 30 min of incubation, ranged from 82.70 to 304.31 mu g/mL, with the A. pavia water extract exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect. The assessment of the A. pavia water extract on human fibroblasts revealed no significant signs of toxicity, even at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. This reduced toxicity was further validated through the Daphnia assay. These findings highlight the low toxicity and the potential of this extract as a promising source of future development of bacteria antivirulence solutions.

AB  - Mass rearing herbivorous insects used as biological control agents requires a steady supply of optimal host plant material. This often necessitates the use of pesticides to minimise infestations and damage from generalist herbivores. Knowing the efficacy persistence of the pesticide is critical to prevent non-target effects on reared agent populations. We determined the amount of time for an abamectin foliar spray to degrade such that there were minimal impacts on the mass rearing of Pseudophilothrips ichini (Hood), a biological control agent for Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi) in Florida. Abamectin was applied to plants at the label concentration (0.31 ml/L) for controlling mites. Groups of three plants were brought into our quarantine facility 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 d after application and were then each infested with 40 founding adult thrips. Founding adult survival was not impacted by the delay, i.e. interval between application and thrips infestation, with at least 75% recovered alive regardless of the delay. However, delaying infestation had a significant effect on the number of offspring produced, with, on average, only 50 produced when waiting 1 d, between 250 and 364 for the intermediate wait times, and 688 produced when waiting 14 d. Waiting 14 d after treatment before infesting new plants would achieve optimal colony yields but waiting as little as 7 d may still be a reasonable balance between timely production operations and colony yields. Those developing insect mass rearing programmes should consider all variables specific to their procedures that may impact pesticide persistence.

AB  - Proper integration of different inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs) is critical for associative learning and recall. Dendritic Ca2+ spikes have been proposed to perform associative computations in other PC types by detecting conjunctive activation of different afferent input pathways, initiating afterdepolarization (ADP), and triggering burst firing. Implementation of such operations fundamentally depends on the actual biophysical properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes; yet little is known about these properties in dendrites of CA3PCs. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings and two-photon Ca2+ imaging in acute slices from male rats, we report that, unlike CA1PCs, distal apical trunk dendrites of CA3PCs exhibit distinct forms of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Besides ADP-type global Ca2+ spikes, a majority of dendrites expresses a novel, fast Ca2+ spike type that is initiated locally without bAPs, can recruit additional Na+ currents, and is compartmentalized to the activated dendritic subtree. Occurrence of the different Ca2+ spike types correlates with dendritic structure, indicating morpho-functional heterogeneity among CA3PCs. Importantly, ADPs and dendritically initiated spikes produce opposing somatic output: bursts versus strictly single-action potentials, respectively. The uncovered variability of dendritic Ca2+ spikes may underlie heterogeneous input-output transformation and bursting properties of CA3PCs, and might specifically contribute to key associative and non-associative computations performed by the CA3 network.

AB  - Growing evidence supports the concept that bidirectional brain-gut microbiome interactions play an important mechanistic role in aging, as well as in various neuropsychiatric conditions including depression. Gray matter volume (GMV) deficits in limbic regions are widely observed in geriatric depression (GD). We therefore aimed to explore correlations between gut microbial measures and GMV within these regions in GD. Sixteen older adults (>60 years) with GD (37.5% female; mean age, 70.6 (SD = 5.7) years) were included in the study and underwent high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI scanning and stool sample collection. GMV was extracted from bilateral regions of interest (ROI: hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens) and a control region (pericalcarine). Fecal microbiota composition and diversity were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. There were significant positive associations between alpha diversity measures and GMV in both hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Additionally, significant positive associations were present between hippocampal GMV and the abundance of genera Family_XIII_AD3011_group, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, and Oscillibacter, as well as between amygdala GMV and the genera Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Oscillibacter. Gut microbiome may reflect brain health in geriatric depression. Future studies with larger samples and the experimental manipulation of gut microbiome may clarify the relationship between microbiome measures and neuroplasticity.

AB  - Developmental defects in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos are principally attributable to incomplete epigenetic reprogramming. Small-molecule inhibitors such as histone methyltransferase inhibitors (HMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been used to improve reprogramming efficiency of SCNT embryos. However, their possible synergistic effect on epigenetic reprogramming has not been studied. In this study, we explored whether combined treatment with an HMTi (chaetocin) and an HDACi (trichostatin A; TSA) synergistically enhanced epigenetic reprogramming and the developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos. Chaetocin, TSA, and the combination significantly increased the cleavage and blastocyst formation rate, hatching/hatched blastocyst rate, and cell numbers and survival rate compared to control embryos. In particular, the combined treatment improved the rate of development to blastocysts more so than chaetocin or TSA alone. TSA and combined chaetocin/TSA significantly reduced the H3K9me3 levels and increased the H3K9ac levels in SCNT embryos, although chaetocin alone significantly reduced only the H3K9me3 levels. Moreover, these inhibitors also decreased global DNA methylation in SCNT embryos. In addition, the expression of zygotic genome activation- and imprinting-related genes was increased by chaetocin or TSA, and more so by the combination, to levels similar to those of in vitro-fertilized embryos. These results suggest that combined chaetocin/TSA have synergistic effects on improving the developmental competences by regulating epigenetic reprogramming and correcting developmental potential-related gene expression in porcine SCNT embryos. Therefore, these strategies may contribute to the generation of transgenic pigs for biomedical research.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of biochar and manure additions to growth performance, nutrient value, in vitro digestibility, and rumen fermentation characteristics of Pennisetum purpureum cv. Mott grown in soil remaining after nickel-mining activities. The goat manure and iron wood biochar were used in this study. Treatments were arranged 4 x 2 factorially in a completely randomized block design. The factors were four levels of biochar (0, 5, 10, and 15 metric ton/ ha) and two levels of manure (0 and 10 metric ton/ha). The plants were harvested at 70 days after sowing (first harvest), 128 days (first ratoon) and 193 days (second ratoon). Results showed that at first and second ratoon, plant height and tillering number were increased after 5 metric ton/ha biochar and 10 metric ton/ha manure additions (p < 0.05). Manure treatment resulted in higher crude protein content (p < 0.05) than controls at first and second ratoon stages. Combinations of biochar (p < 0.01) and manure ( p = 0.09) improved in vitro gas production from the insoluble fraction (b). The study concludes that treatment with 5 metric ton/ha biochar and 10 metric ton/ ha manure fertilizers on post-nickel-mining soil increases tillering number, height, CP content and in vitro digestibility of P. purpureum cv. Mott at ratoon stages.

AB  - The reproductive function of animals is often affected by climatic conditions. High-temperature conditions can cause damage to oocyte maturation and embryonic development in a variety of ways. The purpose of this study was to prove that supplementation idebenone (IDB) to the maturation medium can improve the maturation and development of porcine oocytes after heat stress (HS). Porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in the maturation medium with different concentrations of IDB (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M) for 44 hr at either 38.5 degrees C or under the HS conditions. The cumulus oophorus expansion, nuclear maturation and blastocyst rate after parthenogenetic activation (PA) were measured. We found that HS (in vitro maturation 20-24 hr, 42 degrees C) exposure significantly reduced cumulus expansion index and maturation rate of oocytes and the blastocyst rate of PA embryos, while IDB supplementation significantly improved oocyte maturation and development to the blastocysts stage after PA. Moreover, the addition of IDB decreased the intracellular level of ROS and increased GSH content, hence enhancing the antioxidant capacity of oocytes under HS. Meanwhile, IDB treatment also obviously improved the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis of oocytes under HS conditions. Furthermore, IDB treatment increased the expression of GDF9 and BMP15 in IVM oocytes which attribute to improve the quality and outcome of IVM oocytes and the development competence of PA embryos in pigs. In summary, we demonstrated that IDB supplementation into the maturation medium exerted protective effects and improved the ability of maturation and developmental competence of porcine oocytes exposed to HS.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tarchonanthus camphoratus L. complex has numerous medicinal uses amongst the sub-Saharan African populace, including treatment for bronchospasm. This study focused on providing scientific rationale for the traditional use of the extracts of T. camphoratus and T. parvicapitulatus. T. camphoratus L. complex has been published under diverse names by various taxonomists. Tarchonanthus parvicapitulatus was one of the newly described taxa, leaving Tarchonanthus camphoratus L. sens. strict. as a homogenous taxon. However, some of the morphological characters used tend to overlap, making it difficult to identify the different taxa. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the bronchodilatory, antioxidant and toxicological properties of the leaves of T. camphoratus L. and T. parvicapitulatus. This study also aimed to use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess the differences between T. camphoratus L. and T. parvicapitulatus.
   Materials and methods: Thin layer chromatography (TLC) with vanillin as visualizing agent was used to qualitatively compare the phytoconstituents of the plant acetone extracts. The free radical scavenging antioxidant qualitative assay was done by spraying TLC plates with DPPH free radical. The bronchodilatory effects of the aqueous extracts were assessed using pre-contracted guinea pig trachea. The effects of the extracts of T. camphoratus L. and T. parvicapitulatus on superoxide and ATP production was also investigated on isolated human neutrophils. A micromorphology study was done using scanning electron microscopy to study the leaves.
   Results: Different compounds were visualized on the TLC plates with more than 40 compounds of intermediate polarity. The TLC plates sprayed with DPPH revealed the presence of 20 and 23 antioxidant compounds for T. camphoratus and T. parvicapitulatus respectively. Upon pre-contraction of the tracheal smooth muscles, the aqueous extracts of T. parvicapitulatus significantly relaxed the trachea while the relaxation observed for T. camphoratus was not significant. All the tested concentrations had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on superoxide production. The crude extract of T. parvicapitulatus at the highest concentration (10 mg/ml) significantly decreased ATP production while a non-significant increase in ATP production was observed for T. camphoratus at the highest concentration (10 mg/ml) when compared with the control. The micromorphology study was useful in revealing the presence of trichomes on the upper leaf surface of the studied taxa.
   Conclusions: The results obtained from this study showed that the studied plant extracts had bronchodilatory effects on contracted guinea pig trachea and could also inhibit the production of free radicals including superoxide anions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the bronchodilatory activity of T. camphoratus and T. parvicapitulatus. The micromorphological studies were useful in distinguishing between the two species, confirming that T. camphoratus L. and T. parvicapitulatus are different taxa. This study provides evidence to support the traditional use of T. camphoratus and T. parvicapitulatus in managing bronchospasm.

AB  - Background: Computational models of the heart built from cardiac MRI and electrophysiology (EP) data have shown promise for predicting the risk of and ablation targets for myocardial infarction (MI) related ventricular tachycardia (VT), as well as to predict paced activation sequences in heart failure patients. However, most recent studies have relied on low resolution imaging data and little or no EP personalisation, which may affect the accuracy of model-based predictions. Objective: To investigate the impact of model anatomy, MI scar morphology, and EP personalisation strategies on paced activation sequences and VT inducibility to determine the level of detail required to make accurate modelbased predictions. Methods: Imaging and EP data were acquired from a cohort of six pigs with experimentally induced MI. Computational models of ventricular anatomy, incorporating MI scar, were constructed including bi-ventricular or left ventricular (LV) only anatomy, and MI scar morphology with varying detail. Tissue conductivities and action potential duration (APD) were fitted to 12-lead ECG data using the QRS duration and the QT interval, respectively, in addition to corresponding literature parameters. Paced activation sequences and VT induction were simulated. Simulated paced activation and VT inducibility were compared between models and against experimental data. Results: Simulations predict that the level of model anatomical detail has little effect on simulated paced activation, with all model predictions comparing closely with invasive EP measurements. However, detailed scar morphology from high-resolution images, bi-ventricular anatomy, and personalized tissue conductivities are required to predict experimental VT outcome. Conclusion: This study provides clear guidance for model generation based on clinical data. While a representing high level of anatomical and scar detail will require high-resolution image acquisition, EP personalisation based on 12-lead ECG can be readily incorporated into modelling pipelines, as such data is widely available.

AB  - Conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the scrapie form (PrPSc) is the leading step to the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), still incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Interaction of PrPC with cellular and synthetic ligands that induce formation of scrapie-like conformations has been deeply investigated in vitro. Different nucleic acid (NA) sequences bind PrP and convert it to beta-sheet-rich or unfolded species; among such NAs, a 21-mer double-stranded DNA, D67, was shown to induce formation of PrP aggregates that were cytotoxic. However, in vivo effects of these PrP-DNA complexes were not explored. Herein, aggregates of recombinant full-length PrP (rPrP(23-231)) induced by interaction with the D67 aptamer were inoculated into the lateral ventricle of Swiss mice and acute effects were investigated. The aggregates had no influence on emotional, locomotor and motor behavior of mice. In contrast, mice developed cognitive impairment and hippocampal synapse loss, which was accompanied by intense activation of glial cells in this brain region. Our results suggest that the i.c.v. injection of rPrP:D67 aggregates is an interesting model to study the neumtoxicity of aggregated PrP in vivo, and that glial cell activation may be an important step for behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in prion diseases.

AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is one of the most important modulators of neural circuitry and has a critical role in neural development and functions. Previous studies indicated that changes in serotonergic system signaling in early life critically impact mental health, behavior, the morphology of hippocampal neurons, and cognitive functions across the lifespan. The enriched environment (EE) has indicated beneficial effects on behavior and cognitive functions in the developmental period of life, but its impacts on cognitive impairments and behavioral changes following postnatal serotonin depletion are unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the influences of the EE housing (postnatal days [PNDs] 21-60) following postnatal serotonin depletion (by para-chlorophenylalanine [PCPA], 100 mg/kg, s.c, in PNDs 10-20) on anxiety-related behaviors, cognitive functions, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in the hippocampus of male rats. Memory and behavioral parameters were examined in early adulthood and after that, the hippocampi of rats were removed to determine the BDNF mRNA expression by PCR (PNDs 60-70). The findings of the present work indicated that adolescent EE exposure alleviated memory impairment, decreased BDNF levels, and anxiety disorders induced by experimental depletion of serotonin. Overall, these results indicate that serotonergic system dysregulation during the developmental periods can be alleviated by adolescent EE exposure.

AB  - Global warming poses new challenges for insects to adapt to higher temperatures. Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects and plays an important role in energy metabolism and stress resistance. The transmembrane transport of trehalose mainly depends on the trehalose transporter (TRET1). Plutella xylostella (L.) is a worldwide agricultural pest; however, the effects of the trehalose transport mechanism and trehalose distribution in tissues on the development, reproduction and temperature adaptation of P. xylostella have yet to be reported. In this study, PxTret1-like was cloned and analyzed regarding its expression pattern. It was found that the expression of PxTret1-like was affected by ambient temperature. The knockout mutation of PxTret1-like was generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 system by targeted knockout. The trehalose content and trehalase activity of mutant P. xylostella increased at different developmental stages. The trehalose content increased in the fat body of the fourth-instar P. xylostella, and decreased in the hemolymph, and there was no significant change in glucose in the fat body and hemolymph. Mutant strains of P. xylostella showed a significantly reduced survival rate, fecundity and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. The results showed that PxTret1-like could affect the development, reproduction and temperature adaptability of P. xylostella by regulating the trehalose content in the fat body and hemolymph.

AB  - In the kidney, prostaglandins formed by cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) play an important role in regulating renal blood flow. In the present study, we report our observations regarding a unique modulatory effect of renal microsomal preparation on COX-1/2-mediated formation of major prostaglandin (PG) products in vitro. We found that microsomes prepared from pig and rat kidneys had a dual stimulatory-inhibitory effect on the formation of certain PG products catalyzed by COX-1 and COX-2. At lower concentrations, kidney microsomes stimulated the formation of certain PG products, whereas at higher concentrations, their presence inhibited the formation. Presence of kidney microsomes consistently increased the K-m values of the COX-1/2-mediated reactions, while the V-max might be increased or decreased depending on stimulation or inhibition observed. Experimental evidence was presented to show that a protein component present in the pig kidney microsomes was primarily responsible for the activation of the enzyme-catalyzed arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the formation of certain PG products.

AB  - Improving the farming system to attain the household level self-sufficiency, land utilization efficiency and sustainable livelihood security depends on better socio-economic and ecological aspects of the systems practiced by the small farmers in the semiarid regions of India. The higher sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) in the integrated crops-livestock system helps to restore economic and ecological sustainability. The aim of this study was to analyze how various modules of farming in different combinations have interacted with the diversification of existing systems. We used the ecological security index (ESI), economic efficiency index (EEI), and social equity index (SEI) to produce a SLSI of improved integrated farming system (IFS) compared with benchmark farming in semiarid regions. In this study, different existing IFS comprising of seven modules (field crops, dairy, goats, poultry, horticulture, fishery, and apiary) in different combinations were examined. Results revealed that 72.5% farmers preferred to integrate two modules, where as 95% of farmers adopted field crops + dairy (FC + D) in preference to other modules. The sustainability indicators: ESI (+43.3%), EEI (+16.0%), SEI (+11.6%), and SLSI (+6.0%) were improved in the FC + D farming system to a greater degree than other IFS module combinations. Similarly, improved IFS interventions also increased sustainability indicators over benchmark farming. Based on large scale household studies over 5 years, our findings suggest that the improved IFS succeeded in providing a wider array of livelihood security than existing practices. Hence, the paradigm shift from component approach to an IFS-based resilient system, which is economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially acceptable, is needed for development of semiarid regions.

AB  - Depression triggered by harmful stress in adolescents is a common phenomenon that can lead to serious social problems. Its treatment is still frustrating in the clinic. We reported the phenomenon that a 12-day chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), starting on postnatal day 28, led to a significant decrease in the number of microglia in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in adult mice. Reversing this decline with a single injection of low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a classical immunostimulant, could rapidly reverse the depression-like behavior induced by 12 days of CUS stimulation during adolescence. In the dose-dependent experiment, a single injection of LPS at doses of 75 and 100 mu g/kg, but not at doses of 25 and 50 mu g/kg, produced an antidepressant effect in mice exposed to 12-day CUS during adolescence. The time-dependent experiment showed that the antidepressant effect of the single injection of LPS (100 mu g/kg) occurred at time points 5 and 8 h, but not 3 h after LPS injection. The antidepressant effect of the single LPS injection (100 mu g/kg) lasted for at least 7 days, and 14 days after the single LPS injection, a repeated injection could still induce the stressed mice to develop an antidepressant phenotype. Furthermore, inhibition of microglia by minocycline or depletion of microglia by PLX3397 was found to prevent the antidepressant effect of the single LPS injection. These results suggest that reversing the decline of microglia in the dentate gyrus may be a potential strategy for the treatment of depression induced by harmful stress in adolescents.

AB  - Seizures are common in preterm newborns and are associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Current anticonvulsants have poor efficacy, and many have been associated with upregulation of apoptosis in the developing brain. Apigenin, a natural bioactive flavonoid, is a potent inhibitor of hyaluronidase and reduces seizures in adult animal models. However, its impact on perinatal seizures is unclear. In the present study, we examined the effect of apigenin and S3, a synthetic, selective hyaluronidase inhibitor, on seizures after cerebral ischemia in preterm fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation (98-99 days, term similar to 147 days). Fetuses received sham ischemia (n = 9) or ischemia induced by bilateral carotid occlusion for 25 min. Immediately after ischemia, fetuses received either a continuous infusion of vehicle (0.036% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 8) or apigenin (50 mu M, n = 6). In a pilot study, we also tested infusion of S3 (2 mu M, n = 3). Fetuses were monitored continuously for 72 h after ischemia. Infusion of apigenin or S3 were both associated with reduced numbers of animals with seizures, total seizure time, and mean seizure burden. S3 was also associated with a reduction in the total number of seizures over the 72 h recovery period. In animals that developed seizures, apigenin was associated with earlier cessation of seizures. However, apigenin or S3 treatment did not alter recovery of electroencephalographic power or spectral edge frequency. These data support that targeting brain hyaluronidase activity with apigenin or S3 may be an effective strategy to reduce perinatal seizures following ischemia. Further studies are required to determine their effects on neurohistological outcomes.

AB  - The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is essential for osmoregulation in tetrapod vertebrates. There are four ENaC-subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) which form alpha beta gamma- or delta beta gamma-ENaCs. While alpha beta gamma-ENaC is a 'maintenance protein' controlling sodium homeostasis, delta beta gamma-ENaC might represent a 'stress protein' monitoring high sodium concentrations. The delta-subunit emerged with water-to-land transition of vertebrates. We examined ENaC evolution in Cetartiodactyla, a group including even-toed ungulates and cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) which returned to marine environments in the Eocene. Genes for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC are intact across Cetartiodactyla. While SCNN1D (delta-ENaC) is intact in terrestrial Artiodactyla, it is a pseudogene in cetaceans. A unique fusion of SCNN1D exons 11 and 12 is observed in the Antilopinae. Transcripts of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC are present in kidney, lung and skin tissues of Bottlenose dolphins, underscoring alpha beta gamma-ENaC's maintenance role. Bottlenose dolphins and Beluga whales do not show behavioural differences between sodium-containing and sodium-free stimuli, supporting a function of delta-ENaC as a sodium sensing protein which might have become obsolete in high-salinity marine environments. Consistently, there is reduced selection pressure or pseudogenisation of SCNN1D in other marine mammals. Erosion of SCNN1D might therefore be a consequence of environmental transition in marine mammals.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of our study was to address the research gap in the molecular taxonomy of Sri Lankan bats. The accurate identification of animals plays a major role in observing them in their natural environments and hence understanding possible disease-transmitting pathways from animals to humans. Being a tropical country, Sri Lanka has a high density of animals. There are 30 different species of bats described in Sri Lanka. Until now, the animals have been identified by observing their physical features. However, the visual identification of animals is not accurate because closely related animal groups may show similar physical features. During our study, we accurately differentiated five bat groups living in one of the largest caves in Sri Lanka by using a more sophisticated laboratory technique. Using molecular techniques, we were able to provide more accurate results than by the visual identification of the bats. The results from our study are stored in the NCBI database as a baseline for a repository of Sri Lankan bats. With the new sequence data provided here, we filled the gap concerning the molecular taxonomy of bat species of the entire region and we contributed to the future conservation and systematic studies of these mammals.
   This is the first report on the molecular identification and phylogeny of the Rousettus leschenaultii Desmarest, 1810, Rhinolophus rouxii Temminck, 1835, Hipposideros speoris Schneider, 1800, Hipposideros lankadiva Kelaart, 1850, and Miniopterus fuliginosus Kuhl, 1817, bat species in Sri Lanka, inferred from analyses by mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene sequences. Recent research has indicated that bats show enormous cryptic genetic diversity. Moreover, even within the same species, the acoustic properties of echolocation calls and morphological features such as fur color could vary in different populations. Therefore, we have used molecular taxonomy for the accurate identification of five bat species recorded in one of the largest cave populations in Sri Lanka. The bats were caught using a hand net, and saliva samples were collected non-invasively from each bat by using a sterile oral swab. Nucleic acids were extracted from the oral swab samples, and mitochondrial DNA was amplified by using primers targeting the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene. This study reports the first molecular evidence for the identification of five bat species in Sri Lanka. Our findings will contribute to future conservation and systematic studies of bats in Sri Lanka. This study will also provide the basis for a genetic database of Sri Lankan bats which will contribute significantly to the investigation of potentially zoonotic bat viruses.

AB  - Stink bugs represent an increasing risk to soybean production in the Midwest region of the United States.The current sampling protocol for stink bugs in this region is tailored for population density estimation and thus is more relevant to research purposes. A practical decision-making framework with more efficient sampling effort for management of herbivorous stink bugs is needed. Therefore, a binomial sequential sampling plan was developed for herbivorous stink bugs in the Midwest region. A total of 146 soybean fields were sampled across 11 states using sweep nets in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The binomial sequential sampling plans were developed using combinations of five tally thresholds at two proportion infested action thresholds to identify those that provided the best sampling outcomes. Final assessment of the operating characteristic curves for each plan indicated that a tally threshold of 3 stink bugs per 25 sweeps, and proportion infested action thresholds of 0.75 and 0.95 corresponding to the action thresholds of 5 and 10 stink bugs per 25 sweeps, provided the optimal balance between highest probability of correct decisions (>= 99%) and lowest probability of incorrect decisions (<= 1%). In addition, the average sample size for both plans (18 and 12 sets of 25 sweeps, respectively) was lower than that for the other proposed plans. The binomial sequential sampling plan can reduce the number of sample units required to achieve a management decision, which is important because it can potentially reduce risk/cost of management for stink bugs in soybean in this region.

AB  - Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder, but its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remains incomplete. As a member of the bromodomain-containing protein (BCP) family, BRD7 has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression. However, the role of BRD7 in epilepsy in vivo is still poorly understood. In the present study, we found that pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epilepsy increased hippocampal BRD7, which was mainly localized in neurons. In addition, the enhanced expression of hippocampal BRD7 was normalized by using the anti-epilepsy drug valproic acid (VPA). Furthermore, we identified that the BRD7 inhibitor BI-9564 could dose dependently alleviated the seizure behavior in PTZ treated mice, which was also validated in pilocarpine mouse model. Mechanistically, the anti-seizure effect of BI- 9564 might be due to its negative-regulation of hippocampal TRPV4 that downregulated neuronal over-excitability. Importantly, BRD7 blockade retained its antiepileptic activity over chronic dosing that was not related to psychomotor or cognitive effects. To our knowledge, these results are the first evidence to demonstrate that BRD7 inhibitor can down-regulate neuronal over-excitation caused by epilepsy possible by regulating TRPV4. Targeting BRD7 through the development of selective inhibitors may lead to disease-modifying therapies that reduce seizure behavior.

AB  - Emotional memory deficit is often accompanied by Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. It is important to do what is possible to alleviate or rescue emotional memory deficit in aging to improve the quality of older adults. Hesperetin is a flavonoid and an aglycone of hesperidin, it easily passes through the blood-brain barrier into the brain and exerts neuroprotective effects. However, little is known about its neuroprotective effect on emotional memory in aging. To address this issue, we examined the role of hesperetin in the regulation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), surface expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) including glutamate receptor 1 subunit-containing AMPAR (GluA1) and glutamate receptor 1 subunit-containing AMPAR (GluA2), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, and associative fear memory in aged rats. We found that aged rats exhibited impaired emotional memory and LTP. Furthermore, we also found oral administration of hesperetin ameliorated the impairment of emotional memory and LTP. Finally, we demonstrated hesperetin rescued impaired LTP possibly via enhancing AMPAR trafficking and oxidant-antioxidant balance in aged rats. These results imply a pivotal role for hesperetin in synaptic plasticity and associative fear memory in aged rats and suggest that hesperetin is a potential candidate for treating emotional memory deficit in aging.

AB  - Introduction: Existing strategies to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) are not completely effective and require alternative approaches. Although intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses are more resilient to transplacental PRRS virus-2 (PRRSV2) infection compared to normal fetuses, the exact mechanisms are unknown. The objective of this research was to assess abundance and localization of a subset of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the maternal-fetal interface and any alterations that may affect the movement of nutrients or PRRSV2 across the epitheliochorial placenta.
   Methods: Paraffin-embedded samples of placenta from non-infected control (CTRL) and PRRSV2 infected fetuses (IUGR, non(N)-IUGR, meconium-stained (MEC) (n = 6 per group) were randomly selected from a large challenge trial and immunostained for claudins (CLDN) 1, 3, 4, 7 and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1). Immunostaining intensity was semi-subjectively scored by region.
   Results: Intensity of CLDN1 was lower in placenta of IUGR, MEC, and N-IUGR fetuses compared to CTRL, mainly in fetal epithelium and maternal endothelial cells (MECL). CLDN4 intensity was lower in MECL of IUGR compared to CTRL and MEC fetuses. TJP1 intensity was lower in maternal and fetal epithelia of placenta within IUGR, MEC, and N-IUGR fetuses versus CTRL.
   Discussion: Differences were mainly observed between PRRSV2 infected and non-infected groups indicating TJ integrity was affected by PRRSV2 infection. These results provide insights into the potential mechanisms of transplacental transmission of PRRSV2; however, since only CLDN4 differed amongst the infected groups, PRRSV2 induced changes in TJ integrity do not appear to explain variation in fetal outcomes after infection.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by severe mitochondrial dysfunction, which is an intracellular process that is significantly compromised in the early stages of AD. Mitophagy, the selective removal of damaged mitochondria, is a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, augmented autophagy and mitigated cognitive impairment. Our study revealed that rapamycin enhances cognitive function by activating mitophagy, alleviating neuronal loss, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction in 5 xFAD mice. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of rapamycin in AD were negated by treatment with 3-MA, a mitophagy inhibitor. Overall, our findings suggest that rapamycin ameliorates cognitive impairment in 5 xFAD mice via mitophagy activation and its downstream PINK1-Parkin pathway, which aids in the clearance of amyloid-beta (A beta) and damaged mitochondria. This study reveals a novel mechanism involving mitophagy regulation underlying the therapeutic effect of rapamycin in AD. This study provides new insights and therapeutic targets for rapamycin in the treatment of AD. However, there are still some shortcomings in this topic; if we can further knock out the PINK1/Parkin gene in animals or use siRNA technology, we can further confirm the experimental results.

AB  - Depression is a common mental disease that can lead to suicide when severe. Exposure to prenatal stress (PS) can lead to depression-like behavior in offspring, but the mechanism is unclear. RhoA (Ras homology family member A) plays an important role in stress-induced changes in synaptic plasticity, participating in the development of depression by activating the downstream effector ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase). This study explored the influence in the expression of RhoA and downstream molecules ROCK1/2 in prenatally stressed rats, and the effect of RhoA inhibitor simvastatin on depression-like behavior induced by PS. Depression-like behavior in offspring was detected by sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and open-field test. The mRNA and protein expression of RhoA and ROCK1/2 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of offspring rats were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Our results showed that PS causes depression-like behavior in offspring rats, associated with elevated expression of RhoA, ROCK1/2 in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. After administration of simvastatin to PS rats, the expression of RhoA and ROCK2 was significantly reduced, alleviating depression-like behavior. Our study demonstrated that RhoA participates in the depression-like behavior in prenatally stressed offspring rats, which may be a potential target for antidepressant therapy.

AB  - Recent models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that neuropathological changes of the medial temporal lobe, especially entorhinal cortex, are preceded by degenerations of the cholinergic Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). Evidence from imaging studies in humans, however, is limited. Therefore, we performed an activation-likelihood estimation meta-analysis on whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) MRI data from 54 experiments and 2581 subjects in total. It revealed, compared to healthy older controls, reduced gray matter in the bilateral NbM in AD, but only limited evidence for such an effect in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which typically precedes AD. Both patient groups showed less gray matter in the amygdala and hippocampus, with hints towards more pronounced amygdala effects in AD. We discuss our findings in the context of studies that highlight the importance of the cholinergic basal forebrain in learning and memory throughout the lifespan, and conclude that they are partly compatible with pathological staging models suggesting initial and pronounced structural degenerations within the NbM in the progression of AD.

AB  - Integrin_K+ Channel_Complexes (IKCs), are implicated in neurodevelopment and cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through mechanisms that were poorly understood. Here, we investigate the function of neocortical IKCs formed by voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels Kcnb1 and alpha 5 beta 5 integrin dimers in wild-type (WT) and homozygous knock-in (KI) Kcnb1R312H(+/+) mouse model of DEE. Kcnb1R312H(+/+) mice suffer from severe cognitive deficit and compulsive behavior. Their brains show neuronal damage in multiple areas and disrupted corticocortical and corticothalamic connectivity along with aberrant glutamatergic vesicular transport. Surprisingly, the electrical properties of Kcnb1R312H(+/+) pyramidal neurons are similar to those of WT neurons, indicating that the arginine to histidine replacement does not affect the conducting properties of the mutant channel. In contrast, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, biochemistry, and immunofluorescence, reveal marked differences in the way WT and Kcnb1R312H(+/+) neurons modulate the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, a key player in the processes underlying neurodevelopment. Together these results demonstrate that Kv channels can cause multiple conditions, including epileptic seizures, through mechanisms that do not involve their conducting functions and put forward the idea that the etiology of DEE may be primarily non-ionic.

AB  - Simple Summary BPIV3 is a common pathogen causing respiratory disease in cattle and a significant contributing factor to BRDC; however, data on the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 are still scarce in China. The current study sought to investigate the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 in BRDC-affected beef cattle and yaks in China, and the findings suggest that BPIV3 genotype C strains, the dominant strains in China, have a broad geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of the HN and genomic sequences reveals Chinese strains with some unique genetic characteristics, which enhances our knowledge of the prevalence and genetic variation in BPIV3. Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is a common respiratory pathogen that causes respiratory illness in cattle and makes a major contribution to the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC); however, data on the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 are still scarce in China. To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of BPIV3 in China, between September 2020 and June 2022, 776 respiratory samples were received from 58 BRDC-affected farms located in 16 provinces and one municipality. Those were screened for BPIV3 using a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay. Meanwhile, the HN gene and complete genome sequence of strains from different provinces were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The tests showed that 18.17% (141/776) of samples tested were positive for BPIV3, which originated from 21 farms in 6 provinces. Moreover, 22 complete HN gene sequences and 9 nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from the positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on the HN gene and complete genome sequences revealed that the sequences were clustered in one large clade for all Chinese BPIV3 genotype C strains, while overseas strain sequences of BPIV3 genotype C clustered into other clades. Moving beyond the known complete genome sequences of BPIV3 in GenBank, a total of five unique amino acid mutations were found in N protein, F protein, and HN protein in Chinese BPIV3 genotype C strains. Taken together, this study reveals that BPIV3 genotype C strains, the dominant strains in China, have a broad geographical distribution and some unique genetic characteristics. These findings contribute to our understanding of the epidemiological characteristics and genetic evolution of BPIV3 in China.

AB  - In this study, peridynamics topology optimization (PD-TO) framework is implemented to reduce the total weight of ship structures and increase their structural endurance against cracks. PD-TO is a general nonlocal optimization strategy that performs the minimization of strain energy density as the objective function and uses predefined volume fractions as optimization constraints. To analyze ship structures herein, both the optimality criteria (OC) algorithm and the proportional (PROP) approach are implemented into the PD-TO solver. As the initial design domain, a reference bulkhead geometry of trailing suction hopper dredger (ship) is modeled. This web frame is optimized according to critical wave/loading conditions such as hogging and sagging. Different volume fractions are investigated to obtain lighter designs based on OC and PROP methods. In addition, different cracked scenarios are created by locating the cracks into various positions on the reference ship cross-section. Optimized results for cracked cases shows that the proposed method can create alternative web frames for specific definitions of the possible damaged regions on the board. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, maximum displacements and compliance of the reference and optimized structures are compared. The results proves that topologically optimized designs offered stiffer structures as compared to conventional designs under the same loading conditions. Finally, some of the optimized results are smoothed to demonstrate the practical utility of the PD-TO for manufacturing. Overall, it is revealed that the PD-TO can be effectively utilized to design marine structures to achieve a higher strength/weight ratio while considering critical operation conditions and possible damaged regions.

AB  - The single-celled parasite Toxoplasma gondii uses mice as a vector to reach its definitive host, the cat, where it can accomplish its sexual reproduction and produce oocysts, which will contaminate the environment. In this study, we have captured 103 feral house mice (Mus musculus) on Kangaroo Island, Australia. We have measured the level of exposure to T.gondii serologically with the Modified Agglutination Test and conjointly with a T.gondii B1 gene PCR. We have included stringent quality control steps in the molecular analysis to reduce the risk of false positivity and false negativity. Our results indicated a low seroprevalence of 0.97%, 95%CI [-0.36; 0.58] associated with the detection of T.gondii genetic material in 51.46%, 95%CI [41.93, 60.88] of mice brains. Neither sex nor mice body weight had an effect on the PCR outcome. We postulate that both the transmission route, horizontal or vertical, and natural selection processes could lead to this discordance which has been observed elsewhere in wild mice. The question of the biological mechanisms allowing the chronic infection of wild mice in the absence of a measurable humoral immune response remains. Our findings indicate that serological studies should not be used to measure the level of exposure to T.gondii in feral house mice.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is a key mechanism of neural plasticity involved in learning and memory. A reduced or impaired synaptic plasticity could lead to a deficient learning and memory. On the other hand, besides reducing hipocampal dependent learning and memory, fimbria-fornix lesion affects LTP. However, we have consistently shown that stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 15 min after water maze training is able to improve spatial learning and memory in fimbria fornix lesioned rats while also inducing changes in the expression of plasticity-related genes expression in memory associated brain regions like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In this study we test that hypothesis: whether BLA stimulation 15 min after water maze training can improve LTP in the hippocampus of fimbria-fornix lesioned rats. To address this question, we trained fimbriafornix lesioned rats in water maze for four consecutive days, and the BLA was bilaterally stimulated 15 min after each training session.Our data show that trained fimbria-fornix lesioned rats develop a partially improved LTP in dentated gyrus compared with the non-trained fimbria-fornix lesioned rats. In contrast, dentated gyrus LTP in trained and BLA stimulated fimbria-fornix lesioned rats improved significantly compared to the trained fimbria-fornix lesioned rats, but was not different from that shown by healthy animals. BLA stimulation in nontrained FF lesioned rats did not improve LTP; instead produces a transient synaptic depression. Restoration of the ability to develop LTP by the combination of training and BLA stimulation would be one of the mechanisms involved in ameliorating memory deficits in lesioned animals.

AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) contain abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins, which spread within components of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory circuit in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used quantitative immunohistochemistry to determine the density of posttranslational oligomeric (TOC1 and TNT1), phosphorylated (AT8), and late truncated (TauC3) tau epitopes within the MTL subfields including entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II, subiculum, Cornu Ammonis (CA) subfields, and dentate gyrus (DG) in subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. We also examined whether alterations of the nuclear alternative splicing protein, SRSF2, are associated with tau pathology. Although a significant increase in TOC1, TNT1, and AT8 neuron density occurred in the EC in MCI and AD, subicular, DG granule cell, and CA1 and CA3 densities were only significantly higher in AD. TauC3 counts were not different between connectome regions and clinical groups. SRSF2 intensity in AT8-positive cells decreased significantly in all regions independent of the clinical groups examined. CA1 and subicular AT8, TauC3, and oligomeric densities correlated across clinical groups. EC AT8 counts correlated with CA subfields and subicular and DG values across clinical groups. Oligomeric and AT8 CA1, EC, and subicular density correlated with Braak stage. Decreased nuclear SRSF2 in the presence of cytoplasmic phosphorylated tau suggests a dual-hit process in NFT formation within the entorhinal hippocampal connectome during the onset of AD. Although oligomeric and phosphorylated tau follow a stereotypical pattern, clinical disease stage determined density of tau deposition and not anatomic location within the entorhinal-hippocampal connectome.

AB  - To examine the role of estradiol in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in women, 86 female undergraduates were tested in a virtual Morris water task (VMWT), a virtual radial arm maze (VRAM), and a mental rotation task (MRT) within a single daily session. The VMWT and RAM were also administered 24 h later to examine the effects of estradiol on memory consolidation. Women on oral contraceptives (OCs) or those who were naturally cycling and exhibited low estradiol (LE) or high estradiol (HE), as determined by salivary assays, were included. At the start of day two, the HE group showed superior spatial reference memory on the VMWT relative to the LE group, as evidenced by significantly shorter distances navigating to the hidden platform. The LE group also had the poorest probe trial performance at the start of day two compared to both other groups. There were no group differences in performance on the RAM or MRT. These results provide support for estradiol's role in the consolidation of spatial reference memory in women, and emphasize the differential sensitivities of various virtual memory tasks in assessing spatial memory function in women.

AB  - The increasing demand for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics has propelled the interest in bioplastics. A few papers reported on the effects of plastics on crustaceans, but no indication about biodegradable polymers is available. Hippolyte inermis Leach, 1816 is a protandric shrimp commonly living on leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, in the Mediterranean Sea. This crustacean is typically chosen as a model to study sex differentiation processes. Here, we demonstrated its convenience as a model organism to study the effects of biodegradable polymers (BPs). Five BPs were studied: polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutylene succinate-cobutylene adipate (PBSA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly-3-hydroxybutyrates (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA).Larvae of H. inermis were exposed to three concentrations of each BP (1, 5 and 10 mg/L, respectively) for ten days. After exposure, the expression levels of eighteen genes involved in stress response and detoxification processes, retrieved from a H. inermis transcriptomic library, were validated by Real Time qPCR. This study is the first using a molecular approach to detect H. inermis responses to contaminants and in particular to biodegradable polymers, through the evaluation of functional gene's pathways.

AB  - The therapeutic effects of alpha lipoic acid (LA) and/or caffeine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (CCNPs) on obesity-induced memory impairment were evaluated in the present study. Rats were divided into control rats, obese rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) and obese rats treated with LA and/or CCNPs. Obesity was confirmed by measuring the body mass index (BMI). Memory and cognitive functions were evaluated by novel object recognition test (NORT). The levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), lipid peroxidation (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin (LEP) and ghrelin (GHR) and the activities of monoamine oxidase (MAO), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and Na+,K+,ATPase were determined in the cortex and hippocampus. The cerebral histopathological alterations were examined in obese rats. Obese rats showed impaired memory and exhibited significant neurochemical changes, including decreased levels of 5-HT, DA, GSH, GHR, and Na+,K+-ATPase activity, as well as an increase in AchE, MAO, MDA, NO, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and LEP. LA and/or CCNPs treatment reduced BMI and improved memory. LA or CCNPs alleviated the cortical and hippocampal neurochemical changes and histopathological changes induced by obesity. Furthermore, LA and CCNPs exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which likely contributed to their effects. However, no synergistic effect was observed between LA and CCNPs. These findings suggest that LA or CCNPs may be a potential therapy against obesity and its adverse effects on memory, mediated by their ability to restore monoamine levels and exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Transdermal Administration of Volatile Oil from Citrus aurantium-Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae Alleviates Constipation in Rats by Altering Host Metabolome and Intestinal Microbiota Composition

AB  - Background. The Citrus aurantium- (ZhiShi, ZS-) Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (BaiZhu, BZ) pairs are often found in herbal formulas for constipation. The volatile oils of ZS and BZ (ZBVO) have good pharmacological activity against constipation, but the mechanism for treatment of slow transit constipation (STC) remains unclear. Method. A rat model using diphenoxylate tablets was constructed to investigate if transdermal administration of ZBVO would mediate intestinal microorganisms and fecal metabolites and improve STC symptoms. The regulatory effects of ZBVO at 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mL kg(-1) d(-1) on STC rats were assessed by measuring fecal water content, intestinal propulsion rate, histopathology, expression of gastrointestinal hormones, brain and intestinal peptides, and inflammatory factors. The changes in intestinal flora of STC rats were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Moreover, the untargeted fecal metabolomics analysis was performed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) technology. Results. The results showed that ZBVO had a modulating effect on STC by increasing the fecal water content and intestinal propulsion rate. Transdermal administration of ZBVO decreased serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and increased the levels of gastrin (GAS) and substance P (SP). In addition, ZBVO increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in colon and hippocampus tissues. The results of intestinal microbiota showed that ZBVO improved the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota and changed the community composition by decreasing Romboutsia and increasing Proteobacteria, Allobaculum, and Ruminococcaceae. And the feces metabolomics found that nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, purine metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), pyruvate metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis were modulated. Conclusion. These findings suggest that ZBVO can alleviate STC symptoms by promoting intestinal peristalsis, increasing fecal water content, regulating gastrointestinal hormone level, reducing the inflammatory response, and regulating brain and intestinal peptides after transdermal administration.

AB  - Sleep benefits motor memory consolidation in young adults, but this benefit is reduced in older adults. Here we sought to understand whether differences in the neural bases of encoding between young and older adults contribute to aging-related differences in sleep-dependent consolidation of an explicit variant of the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Seventeen young and 18 older adults completed two sessions (nap, wake) one week apart. In the MRI, participants learned the SRTT. Following an afternoon interval either awake or with a nap (recorded with high-density polysomnography), performance on the SRTT was reassessed in the MRI. Imaging and behavioral results from SRTT performance showed clear sleep-dependent consolidation of motor sequence learning in older adults after a daytime nap, compared to an equal interval awake. Young adults, however, showed brain activity and behavior during encoding consistent with high SRTT performance prior to the sleep interval, and did not show further sleep-dependent performance improvements. Young adults did show reduced cortical activity following sleep, suggesting potential systems-level consolidation related to automatization. Sleep physiology data showed that sigma activity topography was affected by hippocampal and cortical activation prior to the nap in both age groups, and suggested a role of theta activity in sleep-dependent automatization in young adults. These results suggest that previously observed aging-related sleep-dependent consolidation deficits may be driven by aging-related deficiencies in fast learning processes. Here we demonstrate that when sufficient encoding strength is reached with additional training, older adults demonstrate intact sleep-dependent consolidation of motor sequence learning.

AB  - In rodent behavior research, observer-independent methods, such as the IntelliCage, enhance data collection in a social, and thus stress-reduced, environment. The IntelliCage system allows experimenters to create cognitive challenges for mice motivated by rewards. Given the extensive and diverse data from IntelliCage, there is a high demand for automated analysis. Here, we introduce IntelliR, a free and standardized pipeline for analyzing IntelliCage data, including a cognition index for performance comparison across challenges. IntelliR supports the automatic analysis of three challenges that cover spatial, episodic-like, and working memory with their reversal tests and can also be adapted for other designs. Results from three cohorts of adult female C57B6 mice showed improved task proficiency over time. To validate cognitive impairment detection, we used adult female NexCreERT2xRosa26-eGFP-DTA mice after neuron ablation in cortex and hippocampus, in which we observed reduced learning capabilities. IntelliR integrates easily into research, improving time management and reproducibility.

AB  - Background: Chronic aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure may increase the risk of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Stress is considered one of the main contributors to major depressive disorder. Whether and how chronic AFB1 exposure affects vulnerability to stress is unclear. Methods: Mice were exposed for three weeks to AFB1 (100 mu g/kg/d) and/or chronic mild stress (CMS). The vulnerability behaviors in response to stress were assessed in the forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), and tail suspension test (TST). Microglial pyroptosis was investigated using immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and western blot assay in the hippocampus of mice. Hippocampal neu-rogenesis and the effects of AFB1-treated microglia on proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) were assessed via immunofluorescence in the hippocampus of mice.Results: Mice exposed to CMS in the presence of AFB1 exhibited markedly greater vulnerability to stress than mice treated with CMS or AFB1 alone, as indicated by reduced sucrose preference and longer immobility time in the forced swimming test. Chronic aflatoxin B1 exposure resulted in changes in the microglial morphology and increase in TUNEL+ microglia and GSDMD+ microglia in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. When mice were exposed to both CMS and AFB1, pyroptosis-related molecules (such as NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and interleukin-1 beta) were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus. These molecules were also significantly enhanced by AFB1 in primary microglial cultures. AFB1-treated mice showed decrease in the numbers of BrdU+, BrdU-DCX+, and BrdU-NeuN+ cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, as well as the percentages of BrdU+ cells that were NeuN+ in the presence or absence of CMS when compared with vehicle-treated mice. The combination of AFB1 and CMS exacerbated these effects to an even greater extent. The number of DCX+ cells correlated negatively with the percentage of ameboid microglia, TUNEL+ microglia and GSDMD+ microglia in the hippo-campal dentate gyrus. AFB1-treated microglia suppressed the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSPCs in vitro.Conclusion: Chronic AFB1 exposure induces microglial pyroptosis, promoting an adverse neurogenic microen-vironment that impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, which may render mice more vulnerable to stress.

AB  - The Istrian (IS) and the Pag sheep (PS) are local Croatian breeds which provide significant income for the regional economy and have a cultural and traditional importance for the inhabitants. The aim of this study was to estimate some important population specific genetic parameters in IS (N = 1293) and PS (N = 2637) based on genome wide SNPs. Estimates of linkage disequilibrium effective population size (N-e) evidenced more genetic variability in PS (N-e = 838) compared to IS (N-e = 197), regardless of historical time (both recent and ancient genetic variability). The discrepancy in the recent genetic variability between these breeds was additionally confirmed by the estimates of genomic inbreeding (F-ROH), which was estimated to be notably higher in IS (F-ROH>2 = 0.062) than in PS (F-ROH>2 = 0.029). The average FROH2-4, FROH4-8, FROH8-16, and F-ROH>16 were 0.26, 1.65, 2.14, and 3.72 for IS and 0.22, 0.61, 0.75, and 1.58 for PS, thus evidencing a high contribution of recent inbreeding in the overall inbreeding. One ROH island with > 30% of SNP incidence in ROHs was detected in IS (OAR6; 34,253,440-38,238,124 bp) while there was no ROH islands detected in PS. Seven genes (CCSER1, HERC3, LCORL, NAP1L5, PKD2, PYURF, and SPP1) involved in growth, feed intake, milk production, immune responses, and resistance were associated with the found autozygosity. The results of this study represent the first comprehensive insight into genomic variability of these two Croatian local sheep breeds and will serve as a baseline for setting up the most promising strategy of genomic Optimum Contribution Selection.

AB  - BackgroundPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex psychiatric condition that emerges following exposure to trauma and significantly affects daily functioning. Current research is focused on identifying effective treatments for PTSD. Advances in bioinformatics provide opportunities to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of PTSD.MethodsRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using GEO2R. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to examine gene correlation patterns. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed for functional annotation and enrichment analysis, respectively. The MCODE plugin in Cytoscape software was utilized to analyze the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Anxiety and depression in a mice stress model were assessed using the open-field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and forced swimming test (FST). Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to validate key genes in stress-exposed models.ResultsA total of 157 common upregulated DEGs and 53 common downregulated DEGs were identified in the amygdala (AMY) and the hippocampus (HIP). Notably enriched pathways included neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, nicotine addiction, and dopaminergic synapse. The PPI network identified four hub genes, with key pathways associated with nicotine addiction and dopaminergic synapse. qRT-PCR validation confirmed that the expression trends of these four genes were consistent with microarray data. Behavioral tests (OFT, EMPT, and FST) revealed significant changes.ConclusionThis study utilized bioinformatics and in vitro experiments to identify genes and pathways potentially crucial for PTSD development. Key genes were validated in a mouse model, providing insights into potential target genes for PTSD treatment.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the behavioral and energy metabolism parameters in female mice subjected to obesity and offspring deprivation (OD) stress. Eighty female Swiss mice, 40 days old, were weighed and divided into two groups: Control group (control diet, n = 40) and Obese group (high-fat diet, n = 40), for induction of the animal model of obesity, the protocol was based on the consumption of a high-fat diet and lasted 8 weeks. Subsequently, the females were subjected to pregnancy, after the birth of the offspring, were divided again into the following groups (n = 20): Control non-deprived (ND), Control + OD, Obese ND, and Obese + OD, for in-duction of the stress protocol by OD. After the offspring were 21 days old, weaning was performed and the dams were subjected to behavioral tests. The animals were humanely sacrificed, the brain was removed, and brain structures were isolated to assess energy metabolism. Both obesity and OD led to anhedonia in the dams. It was shown that the structures most affected by obesity and OD are the hypothalamus and hippocampus, as evidenced by the mitochondrial dysfunction found in these structures. When analyzing the groups separately, it was observed that OD led to more pronounced mitochondrial damage; however, the association of obesity with OD, as well as obesity alone, also generated damage. Thus, it is concluded that obesity and OD lead to anhedonia in animals and to mitochondrial dysfunction in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, which may lead to losses in feeding control and cognition of the dams.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a crop of high economic value, yet it is particularly susceptible to various diseases and pests that significantly reduce its yield and quality. Consequently, the precise segmentation and classification of diseased Camellia leaves are vital for managing pests and diseases effectively. Deep learning exhibits significant advantages in the segmentation of plant diseases and pests, particularly in complex image processing and automated feature extraction. However, when employing single-modal models to segment Camellia oleifera diseases, three critical challenges arise: (A) lesions may closely resemble the colors of the complex background; (B) small sections of diseased leaves overlap; (C) the presence of multiple diseases on a single leaf. These factors considerably hinder segmentation accuracy. A novel multimodal model, CNN-Transformer Dual U-shaped Network (CTDUNet), based on a CNN-Transformer architecture, has been proposed to integrate image and text information. This model first utilizes text data to address the shortcomings of single-modal image features, enhancing its ability to distinguish lesions from environmental characteristics, even under conditions where they closely resemble one another. Additionally, we introduce Coordinate Space Attention (CSA), which focuses on the positional relationships between targets, thereby improving the segmentation of overlapping leaf edges. Furthermore, cross-attention (CA) is employed to align image and text features effectively, preserving local information and enhancing the perception and differentiation of various diseases. The CTDUNet model was evaluated on a self-made multimodal dataset compared against several models, including DeeplabV3+, UNet, PSPNet, Segformer, HrNet, and Language meets Vision Transformer (LViT). The experimental results demonstrate that CTDUNet achieved an mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 86.14%, surpassing both multimodal models and the best single-modal model by 3.91% and 5.84%, respectively.

AB  - Advanced maternal age (AMA) has become more common in the last decade and is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Neurocognitive and emotional development is associated with synaptic structural and functional plasticity. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between AMA and synapse plasticity in the offspring. We examined the synaptic ultrastructure, synapse-related proteins and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring of Sprague-Dawley female rats aged 12 months (AMA group) and 3 months (Control group) on postnatal (P) days 7, 14, 28 and 60. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed decreases in the expression of neurofilament 200 (NF200) and axon length in the AMA group compared with the control group at P14. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYP) was reduced in the immature offspring of the AMA group at P7. Transmission electron microscopy showed decreased thickness of the PSD and increased length of the active zone (AZ) in the offspring of the AMA group. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices revealed impaired LTP in the AMA offspring. Our data suggest that AMA impairs the synaptic plasticity of offspring, which may underlie the mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Model organism research is essential for discovering the mechanisms of human diseases by defining biologically meaningful gene to disease relationships. The Rat Genome Database (RGD, (https://rgd.mcw.edu )) is a cross-species knowledgebase and the premier online resource for rat genetic and physiologic data. This rich resource is enhanced by the inclusion and integration of comparative data for human and mouse, as well as other human disease models including chinchilla, dog, bonobo, pig, 13-lined ground squirrel, green monkey, and naked mole-rat. Functional information has been added to records via the assignment of annotations based on sequence similarity to human, rat, and mouse genes. RGD has also imported well-supported cross-species data from external resources. To enable use of these data, RGD has developed a robust infrastructure of standardized ontologies, data formats, and disease- and species-centric portals, complemented with a suite of innovative tools for discovery and analysis. Using examples of single-gene and polygenic human diseases, we illustrate how data from multiple species can help to identify or confirm a gene as involved in a disease and to identify model organisms that can be studied to understand the pathophysiology of a gene or pathway. The ultimate aim of this report is to demonstrate the utility of RGD not only as the core resource for the rat research community but also as a source of bioinformatic tools to support a wider audience, empowering the search for appropriate models for human afflictions.

AB  - Non-surgical embryo recovery (NSER) is usually preceded by a cervical relaxation in ovine donors, based on estradiol benzoate (EB), prostaglandin (PGF), and oxytocin (OT). However, it is hypothesized that, due to poorly understood mechanisms, EB can result in embryotoxic actions. To evaluate this, 20 min before NSER super-ovulated sheep were induced to cervical relaxation with 0.0 (G0.0), 0.5 (G0.5), or 1.0 mg (G1.0) of EB associated with 37.5 mu g of PGF 16 h before NSER and 50 IU of OT. In doing so, the efficiency and duration of the NSER procedure showed no compromise (P > 0.05). Additionally, the presence of EB did not affect (P > 0.05) the embryo's morphological quality, the development dynamics, or the abundance of transcripts associated with embryonic quality (OCT4 and NANOG), cellular stress (HSP90 and PRDX1), and apoptosis (BCL2 and BAX). A similar result (P > 0.05) was also observed when comparing embryonic cryosurvival at 24 (52.0, 52.0, and 54.0) and 48 h (60.0, 54.0, and 58.0) of in vitro culture (G0.0, G0.5, and G1.0, respectively). Thus, we can conclude that EB use does not compromise embryonic quality and cryoresistance.

AB  - Simple Summary Weaning is a highly stressful period in the pig production cycle, often resulting in digestive dysfunction, reduced performance and economic losses. Feeding strategies pre- and post-weaning can be used to modulate gut development and function, thereby reducing the risk of gastrointestinal disorders. The current study investigated whether offering creep feed to the suckling piglet or supplementing high levels of phytase post-weaning could reduce stress and support piglet adaption to weaning. Results suggest that while these approaches did not directly reduce stress, they can improve feed efficiency in weaning piglets by enhancing gastric function, phytate breakdown and myo-inositol provision. Therefore, application of these practices may allow piglets to better adapt to weaning and promote performance thereafter. A total of 64 piglets were used in a 35-day study to evaluate whether creep feeding piglets on the sow or super-dosing phytase to piglets post-weaning can be used as a tool to reduce stress and support adaption to weaning. Treatments consisted of creep or no creep feed being offered pre-weaning and with or without phytase supplementation at 2000 FTU/kg post-weaning. Blood samples were collected from eight piglets per treatment on days 0 (weaning), 7 and 21 post-weaning to determine plasma cortisol and myo-inositol concentrations. Four piglets per treatment (n = 16) were administered Heidelberg pH capsules 1 week prior to weaning, on the day of weaning, as well as 7 days and 21 days post-weaning, with readings monitored over a 3 h period. In the first week post-weaning, creep-fed piglets had higher daily gains (0.23 vs. 0.14 kg/d, p < 0.05) and a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR, 0.99 vs. 1.35, p < 0.01), compared to non-creep-fed pigs. At 21 days post-weaning, irrespective of creep feed, phytase supplementation reduced FCR (1.10 vs. 1.18, p = 0.05) of piglets. Average real-time stomach pH was lower in creep-fed piglets at 1 week prior to weaning (pH 3.2 vs. 4.6, p < 0.001) and on day of weaning (pH 3.1 vs. 3.7, p < 0.01). Following weaning, phytase reduced average stomach pH of piglets at days 7 (pH 2.6 vs. 3.3, p < 0.001) and 21 (pH 2.2 vs. 2.6, p < 0.01). Both cortisol and myo-inositol concentrations in plasma decreased with age; however, cortisol levels were unaffected by either treatment. Plasma myo-inositol concentrations were higher in creep-fed piglets at day of weaning (p < 0.05) and with phytase super-dosing on day 21 (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that both creep feeding and phytase super-dosing are useful practices to encourage better adaption to weaning and support piglet performance. This response was not related to reduced stress in piglets, as determined by cortisol levels, but instead appears to relate to improved gastric conditions for digestion, phytate degradation and myo-inositol provision in piglets.

AB  - Long-term spaceflight has been proved to cause physical impairments such as motor, cardiovascular and endocrine functions in astronauts. But psychological effects such as mood and social interaction are less well understood. Besides, there are conflicting accounts of their effects on cognitive function. Thus in this study, we exposed mice (18-21 g) to 28-day simulate microgravity and social isolation (SM+SI) and examined its effects on mood, social interaction and cognitive function. We found that four weeks of SM+SI exposure resulted in emotional and specific social barriers, which may be associated with loss of neurons and decreased dendritic spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex. Unexpectedly, SM+SI enhanced the short and long-term cognitive abilities of mice, which may be related to the anti-apoptotic effect of SM+SI regulating the level of apoptotic factors in the hippocampus. These results indicates that SM+SI, as chronic stressor, can induce the body to establish effective coping strategies to enhance individuals' cognitive ability; on the other hand, long-term exposure to SM+SI causes emotional/social barriers. This study further demonstrates SM+SI causes different effects in a brain-region specific manner. Current findings provide a theoretical basis for understanding how SM+SI acts on the brain structure to influence mental health, and may be useful for designing effective prevention for those, including the astronauts, exposed to microgravity.

AB  - Pathogens play a key role in insect population dynamics, contributing to short-term fluctuations in abundance as well as long-term demographic trends. Two key factors that influence the effects of entomopathogens on herbivorous insect populations are modes of pathogen transmission and larval host plants. In this study, we examined tritrophic interactions between a sequestering specialist lepidopteran, Euphydryas phaeton, and a viral pathogen, Junonia coenia densovirus, on its native host plant, Chelone glabra, and a novel host plant, Plantago lanceolata, to explore whether host plant mediates viral transmission, survival, and viral loads. A two-factor factorial experiment was conducted in the laboratory with natal larval clusters randomly assigned to either the native or novel host plant and crossed with either uninoculated controls or viral inoculation (20% of individuals in the cluster inoculated). Diapausing clusters were overwintered in the laboratory and checked weekly for mortality. At the end of diapause, all surviving individuals were reared to adulthood to estimate survivorship. All individuals were screened to quantify viral loads, and estimate horizontal transmission postmortem. To test for vertical transmission, adults were mated, and the progeny were screened for viral presence. Within virus-treated groups, we found evidence for both horizontal and vertical transmission. Larval clusters reared on the native host plant had slightly higher horizontal transmission. Survival probability was lower in clusters feeding on the native host plant, with inoculated groups reared on the native host plant experiencing complete mortality. Viral loads did not differ by the host plant, although viral loads decreased with increased sequestration of secondary compounds on both host plants. Our results indicate that the use of a novel host plant may confer fitness benefits in terms of survival and reduced viral transmission when larvae feeding on it are infected with this pathogen, supporting hypotheses of potential evolutionary advantages of a host range expansion in the context of tritrophic interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary The present research is about Lymphocystic Disease Virus (LCDV) infection in Amphiprion ocellaris and Amphiprion clarkii. Detection of LCDV depended on histopathological study, electron microscope observation of virus particles and gene sequence analysis from the MCP region. Symptoms of LCDV were sparse, multifocal, white, stiff, papilloma-like nodules on the body, skin, gills and fins. The viral particle present were virions 18-230 nm in diameter, hexagonal in shape with an inner dense nucleoid under transmission electron micrographs. The ML polygenetic tree constructed based on the MCP region of LCDV showed the LCDV genotype in the present study is closely related to LCDV from the paradise fish, Macropodus opercularis (KJ408271) (pairwise distance: 92.5%) from China. This is the first report of lymphocystis disease in A. clarkii in Taiwan. Lymphocystic disease affects over 150 species of marine and freshwater fish worldwide. In this study, the lymphocystis pathogen was found in 2 (Amphiprion ocellaris and Amphiprion clarkii) of the 9 species of clownfish. Detection of lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) was based on histopathological study, electron microscope observation of virus particles and gene sequence analysis from the MCP region. Infected A. ocellaris hosts showed sparse, multifocal, white, stiff, papilloma-like nodules on the body, skin, gills and fins; while, on A. clarkia, nodules were found on the operculum skin. Histopathologic study showed lymphocystic cells with an irregular nucleus, enlarged cytoplasm and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies surrounded by the cell membrane. The viral particle presents virions 180-230 nm in diameter, hexagonal in shape with an inner dense nucleoid under transmission electron micrographs (TEM). From the ML polygenetic tree, the clownfish LCVD genotype was closely related to the LCDV strain from paradise fish, Macropodus opercularis (KJ408271) (pairwise distance: 92.5%) from China, then followed by the strain from Spain (GU320726 and GU320736) (pairwise distance: 90.8-90.5%), Korea (AB299163, AB212999, AB213004, and AB299164) (pairwise distance: 91.5-80.5%) and lastly Canada (GU939626) (pairwise distance: 83%). This is the first report of lymphocystis disease in A. clarkii in Taiwan.

AB  - Fertilization capacity and embryo survival rate are decreased in postovulatory aging oocytes, which results in a reduced reproductive rate in female animals. However, the key regulatory genes and related regulatory mechanisms involved in the process of postovulatory aging in oocytes remain unclear. In this study, RNA-Seq revealed that 3237 genes were differentially expressed in porcine oocytes between the MII and aging stages (MII + 24 h). The expression level of FOXM1 was increased at the aging stage, and FOXM1 was also observed to be enriched in many key biological processes, such as cell senescence, response to oxidative stress, and transcription, during porcine oocyte aging. Previous studies have shown that FOXM1 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, such as oxidative stress, DNA damage repair, mitochondrial function, and cellular senescence, which suggests that FOXM1 may play a crucial role in the process of postovulatory aging. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of FOXM1 on oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, DNA damage, and apoptosis during oocyte aging. Our study revealed that aging oocytes exhibited significantly increased ROS levels and significantly decreased GSH, SOD, T-AOC, and CAT levels than did oocytes at the MII stage and that FOXM1 inhibition exacerbated the changes in these levels in aging oocytes. In addition, FOXM1 inhibition increased the levels of DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell senescence in aging oocytes. A p21 inhibitor alleviated the effects of FOXM1 inhibition on oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and DNA damage and thus alleviated the degree of senescence in aging oocytes. These results indicate that FOXM1 plays a crucial role in porcine oocyte aging. This study contributes to the understanding of the function and mechanism of FOXM1 during porcine oocyte aging and provides a theoretical basis for preventing oocyte aging and optimizing conditions for the in vitro culture of oocytes.

AB  - Estradiol (E2) is involved in the regulation of emotional behavior, cognitive function, and neuroplasticity. However, peripheral E2 and central E2 levels do not always fluctuate together. The relationships of peripheral and central E2 with cognitive function are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether peripheral E2, hippocampal E2, or both play a critical role in novel object recognition (NOR), and whether Kalirin-7, an important regulator of spine plasticity, is involved in the modulation of E2 on cognitive behavior. Our results showed that ovariectomy (OVX) significantly reduced serum E2 levels in the 14 weeks following the procedure. However, hippocampal E2 levels did not decrease in the OVX group compared to the sham group until after 14 weeks. Consistent with the changes in hippocampal E2 levels, the investigation ratio in the NOR test and hippocampal Kalirin-7 expression was also not lower in the OVX group than in the sham group until 14 weeks after the 4 procedure. To confirm the relationship between hippocampal E2 levels and NOR ability, we inhibited the production of hippocampal E2 via microinj ection of letrozole (LTZ; an aromatase inhibitor) into the hippocampi of rats in the control group and 8-week OVX group. The data indicated that a reduction in E2 levels in the hippocampus significantly impaired NOR ability and simultaneously decreased Kalirin7 levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our study strongly demonstrates that hippocampal E2, but not peripheral E2, plays a critical role in NOR ability and that Kalirin-7 may be involved in this mechanism.

AB  - Simple Summary Rabbit sperm cryopreservation efficiency is still suboptimal. Post-thawing qualities, such as motility and membrane integrity, are severely impaired after the cryopreservation procedure. One strategy to increase cryopreservation efficiency is the use of novel extender components with cryoprotective effects. In the current study, we aim to test the use of honey, coenzyme Q10, and & beta;-carotene/& alpha;-tocopherol as novel additives for rabbit-sperm cryopreservation. Additionally, we used, for the first time, proAKAP4 as a molecular marker candidate for sperm quality in rabbits. Our results demonstrated that adding 2.5% honey to the semen extender improved the post-thawing rabbit-sperm motility compared to higher concentrations of honey. In contrast, coenzyme Q10 was harmful to sperm motility after cryopreservation. Furthermore, the & beta;-carotene/& alpha;-tocopherol neither improved nor worsened the post-thawing sperm motility compared to the base extender media. In conclusion, the cryopreservation protocols used in this study failed to preserve the fresh-sperm parameters, paving the way for additional studies to improve rabbit sperm cryopreservation protocols. The effectiveness of rabbit-sperm cryopreservation is still below average compared to other domestic species. After the sperm cryopreservation process, post-thawing parameters like motility and membrane integrity are significantly compromised. The use of new extender constituents is an approach that can be used to improve the effectiveness of cryopreservation. Accordingly, we used honey (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10%), coenzyme Q10 (100 and 200 & mu;M), and & beta;-carotene/& alpha;-tocopherol (500 & mu;M/620 & mu;M and 250 & mu;M/310 & mu;M) as candidate components for rabbit-sperm extenders during cryopreservation. Ejaculates from commercial adult rabbit bucks (n = 5) were cryopreserved using conventional freezing. Several post-thawing sperm parameters were assessed, including total motility, membrane integrity, viability, nuclear membrane integrity, acrosome reaction, and mitochondrial membrane potential and activation. Additionally, we performed hormonal analyses of the seminal plasma. Moreover, we analyzed the post-thawing levels of a molecular marker of sperm quality, proAKAP4, which was used in rabbits for the first time. Our findings showed that the 2.5% honey supplementation increased the post-thawing sperm motility (13.75 & PLUSMN; 3.75%) compared to the greater concentrations employed. However, the post-thawing motility was negatively affected by the coenzyme Q10 (0%, in both groups) but was not affected by the & beta;-carotene/& alpha;-tocopherol supplementation (22 & PLUSMN; 18.15%, and 11.67 & PLUSMN; 10.17%). In conclusion, the cryopreservation protocols of this study did not help to maintain the sperm parameters after thawing. Further studies are required to identify novel protocols to mitigate the damage caused to rabbit sperm during cryopreservation.

AB  - The nectar provision hypothesis predicts that the introduction of nectar-producing plants in agroecosystems benefits parasitoid populations in the field and enhances biological control. Intercropping is a common crop diversification scheme that may bring complementary nectar sources for parasitoids and increase herbivore pest control. For instance, intercropping cereals with faba beans introduces nectar sources in usually sugar-devoid systems (i.e. cereal single crops). However, the nectar provision hypothesis has never been evaluated at the field scale in such intercropping systems. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated if sugar is a limiting factor for Aphidius parasitoids in single triticale crops and if their nectar feeding activity increases in faba bean-triticale intercrops. Aphidius feeding patterns were evaluated from their sugar profiles, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In parallel, aphid density and parasitism rates were estimated at the edge and in the centre of single crops and intercrops. Sugar analyses revealed that honeydew was always the main sugar source for parasitoids, and although a significant proportion of parasitoid populations were recorded to feed on nectar, this proportion did not increase in intercrops. Besides, parasitism rates did not increase in intercrops, nor were aphid populations reduced. Thus, our results do not support the nectar provision hypothesis, but rather suggest that although nectar provision benefits parasitoid populations in some systems, its effects on biological control are highly context-dependent. They also confirm that honeydew can be a major food source for parasitoids, which may not necessarily be sugar limited at the field scale.

AB  - Testing-culling is a very effective measure for the prevention and control of animal diseases. In this paper, based on sheep brucellosis control policies and animal testing characteristics and considering the limitation of culling resources, a dynamic model is established to study the impact of testing-culling measure. Theoretical analysis reveals that the model may have one or three positive equilibria. The equilibrium in the middle is always unstable, and the model shows saddle-node bifurcation, generalized Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Moreover, the theoretical results are verified via numerical analysis. These results reveal that testing and culling strategies can induce complex transmission dynamics that can help us develop appropriate prevention and control measures for animal brucellosis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the total concentration and speciation variation of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn) during composting and vermicomposting of industrial sludge with different addition rations of rice husk biochar. Results indicated that pH, EC, total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) were increased and total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were decreased during the composting of industrial sludge with biochar compared with the control (sludge without biochar). The addition of earthworm to the biochar-amended sludge further decreased pH and TOC but highly enhanced the EC, TN, TP and TK. Comparatively lower concentrations of total and DTPA-extractable heavy metals were observed in biochar-amended sludge treatments mixed with earthworm in comparison with the biochar-amended sludge treatments without earthworm or the control. Sequential extraction methods demonstrated that vermicomposting of sludge with biochar converted more metals bound with exchangeable, carbonate and organic matter into the residual fraction in comparison with those composting treatments of sludge with biochar. As a result, the combination of rice husk biochar and earthworm accelerated the passivation of heavy metals in industrial sludge during vermicomposting. Rice husk biochar and earthworm can play a positive role in sequestering the metals during the treatment of industrial sludge. This research proposed a potential method to dispose the heavy metals in industrial sludge to transform waste into resource utilization.

AB  - Human-environment interactions and spatio-temporal organization of the activities are of prime importance to decipher Paleolithic way of life. To address this topic, ungulates teeth offer a valuable tool to understand seasonality and extent of site occupation. In this paper, we present the results of the integrated application of two methodologies, dental wear analyses and cementochronology, to molars from cervids (Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Megaloceros giganteus) exploited by the Neanderthal groups at Fumane Cave, in the Italian eastern Alps. By focusing on the diet-related meso- and microwear patterns on the teeth's occlusal surface and comparing them with samples from extant ungulates, dental wear analyses characterized the main exploited taxa as browser. This finding carries significant implications for understanding both the paleoenvironmental conditions of the area and Neanderthal subsistence strategy. Notably, the results align with the idea that the Italian peninsula served as a refugium during particularly harsh climatic periods. Moreover, the microwear signal yielded promising results in determining the duration of site occupation and cementum analysis sheds light on seasonality of the human frequentation. These findings shed light on the complexity of animal resource management practiced by Neanderthal groups, highlighting the varied strategies they employed to exploit different taxa. Furthermore, the present study served as a crucial testing ground to assess the reliability of a new multiproxies technique that integrates tooth wear analyses and cementochronology. Combining cementochronology and dental wear analysis enhances data resolution by integrating two complementary approaches. Cementochronology allows us to determine the exact season of death, which is often challenging to ascertain solely from microwear analysis - especially when the variability in microwear signals is low. On the other hand, dental wear analysis provides insights both into the functional aspects of teeth over time and into the duration of the mortality event (i.e. the hunting event in anthropogenic contexts). This combined approach allowed us to doublecheck and validate the results and obtain higher resolution data, overcoming potential gaps in information that may arise from relying on a single technique.

AB  - The dorsal subiculum (DSub) has reciprocal connections with the dorsal hippocampus, and these regions play a role in spatial representation in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Recently, we used AP5 and muscimol infusions to show that the DSub is required for CFC consolidation. The CFC component can be present in other learning tasks, such as step-through inhibitory avoidance (ST IA), which requires the dorsal hippocampus for acquisition and consolidation. This suggests that the DSub may be also involved in ST IA if the CFC component of the protocol is strong enough. Therefore, this study tested whether the DSub participates in ST IA acquisition and consolidation in male Wistar rats. Our data showed that pre-or posttraining infusions of AP5 or muscimol into the DSub did not affect ST IA acquisition and consolidation. We discuss the present results in relation to our previous findings, which showed the involvement of the DSub in CFC consolidation, and highlight some reasons that may explain the divergent results between the tasks. First, we note the possibility to escape from the unconditioned stimulus that occurs in ST IA, but not in CFC. We also suggest that the instrumental component of ST IA seems to be more prominent than the CFC one. Finally, we consider the possible influence of aspects of anxiety present in the ST IA, but not in CFC. These possible interpretations provide a broad framework in respect of the present results and raise new questions that demand further studies exploring the DSub function in inhibitory avoidance.

AB  - Trunk recognition is a critical technology for Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting robots, as it enables accurate and efficient detection and localization of vibration or picking points in unstructured natural environments. Traditional trunk detection methods heavily rely on the visual judgment of robot operators, resulting in significant errors and incorrect vibration point identification. In this paper, we propose a new method based on an improved YOLOv7 network for Camellia oleifera trunk detection. Firstly, we integrate an attention mechanism into the backbone and head layers of YOLOv7, enhancing feature extraction for trunks and enabling the network to focus on relevant target objects. Secondly, we design a weighted confidence loss function based on Facol-EIoU to replace the original loss function in the improved YOLOv7 network. This modification aims to enhance the detection performance specifically for Camellia oleifera trunks. Finally, trunk detection experiments and comparative analyses were conducted with YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv7 and improved YOLOv7 models. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an mAP of 89.2%, Recall Rate of 0.94, F1 score of 0.87 and Average Detection Speed of 0.018s/pic that surpass those of YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 models. The improved YOLOv7 model exhibits excellent trunk detection accuracy, enabling Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting robots to effectively detect trunks in unstructured orchards.

AB  - BackgroundHigh fat consumption is a known risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have been found to possess anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, the cognitive effects and mechanisms of SGLT2is on female mice fed with a high-fat diet remain unknown.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the impacts of dapagliflozin on metabolism, cognition, neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and microglial activation in female mice fed a HFD.MethodsDapagliflozin (1 mg/kg) was administered to HFD-fed mice for 24 weeks. Body weight, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance were assessed. Additionally, all mice were subjected to the Morris water maze (MWM) and one-trial Y-maze tests. The levels of metabolic hormones and cytokines were analyzed using ELISA kits. The levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein in the hippocampus were measured. Microglia, insulin receptors, NLRP3, and IL-1 beta in the hippocampus of mice were evaluated by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining.ResultsAs anticipated, dapagliflozin improved insulin resistance and glucose metabolism and reduced cognitive impairment in female mice fed with a HFD. In the hippocampus, dapagliflozin alleviated microglial activation yet did not reduce the secretion of inflammatory chemokines. Furthermore, it increased the expression of insulin receptor in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice and decreased the expression of p-tau.ConclusionsOur results provide a foundation for the clinical application of SGLT2is as an adjuvant to slow down the progression of central degenerative diseases related to metabolic disorders, such as AD.

AB  - As a traditional drug-food homologous plant, Dendrobium officinale is widely recognized for its nutritional and medicinal value. Specifically, D. officinale polysaccharide (DOP) has garnered attention as a potential prebiotic for its protective effects on gut microbiota and the nervous system. However, the underlying mechanism by which DOP improves cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study intends to elucidate the beneficial effects of DOP on AD mice from the perspectives of metabolomics and the intestinal microbiome. The results showed that DOP significantly ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage and A beta plaque deposition, and restored intestinal barrier integrity in AD mice. The antibiotic-cocktail-induced germ-free mouse model confirmed that the neuroprotective effect of DOP was dependent on gut microbiota. Further investigations demonstrated that DOP influenced the composition of gut microbiota and restored its diversity. Additionally, DOP reshaped metabolic profile disorders in AD mice and increased the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content. Correlation analysis further highlighted that specific gut microbiota was associated with the metabolism of AD mice. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the positive impact of DOP in reshaping the gut microbiota and enhancing cognitive function, offering important perspectives for the possible advancement and utilization of DOP.

AB  - One important step toward the commercialization of microbial-derived colorants is the reproducibility of the cultivation stage in bench-scale bioreactors as well as improving the hydro-dynamic design in bioreactors. Aiming to address these technical barriers, Talaromyces amestolkiae was cultivated in a 4 L stirred-tank bioreactor using two types of impellers (Rushton turbine (RT) and Elephant ear (EE) impellers) and aeration modes (cascading and constant airflow) to assess their effects on red colorant production. The results showed that EE under constant airflow (4.0 L min-1) promoted the maximum red colorant formation (28.7 UA500nm), thus improving the reproducibility of the process. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient of culture broth was correlated to cell morphology, which was a result of the impeller geometry of EE through the shear conditions impacting the fungi cells. The hairy pellet morphology favored nutrient and oxygen uptake and allowed an improvement in the colorant's synthesis. Life cycle assessment was also carried out to identify opportunities for improving the best process design from an environmental sustainability perspective. For example, the total climate change and primary energy demand were estimated at 31.11 kg CO2 eq./g red colorant and 830.7 MJ/ g red colorant, respectively, with the cultivation stage contributing with 65 and 63% of these impacts. The electricity consumption was identified as the main hotspot in this stage, a trend that was observed across all other impact categories. This can be improved by optimizing cultivation lengths combined with the use of low carbon electricity sources. These findings ensure a step forward toward the scaling-up at the industrial scale of the T. amestolkiae cultivation for the production of bio-based colorants in an environmentally sustainable way.

AB  - Astronauts on the Artemis missions to the Moon and Mars will be exposed to unavoidable Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR). Studies using male rats suggest that GCR exposure impairs several processes required for cognitive flexibility performance, including attention and task switching. Currently no comparable studies have been conducted with female rats. Given that both males and females will travel into deep space, this study determined whether simulated GCR (GCRsim) exposure impairs task switching performance in female rats. Female Wistar rats exposed to 10 cGy GCRsim (n = 12) and shams (n = 14) were trained to perform a touchscreenbased switch task that mimics a switch task used to evaluate pilots' response times. In comparison to sham rats, three-fold more GCRsim-exposed rats failed to complete the stimulus response stage of training, a high cognitive loading task. In the switch task, 50% of the GCRsim-exposed rats failed to consistently transition between the repeated and switch blocks of stimuli, which they completed during lower cognitive loading training stages. The GCRsim-exposed rats that completed the switch task only performed at 65% of the accuracy of shams. Female rats exposed to GCRsim thus exhibit multiple decrements in the switch task under high, but not low, cognitive loading conditions. While the operational significance of this performance decrement is unknown, if GCRSim exposure was to induce similar effects in astronauts, our data suggests there may be a reduced ability to execute task switching under high cognitive loading situations.

However, it is not yet clear whether they will affect brain development in the fetal stage. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential effects of nanoplastics on the development of fetal rat brains. To assess the allocation of NPs (25 nm and 50 nm) in various regions of the fetal brain, pregnant rats were exposed to concentrations (50, 10, 2.5, and 0.5 mg/kg) of PS-NPs. Our results provided evidence of the transplacental transfer of PS-NPs to the fetal brain, with a prominent presence observed in several cerebral regions, notably the cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. This distribution bias might be linked to the developmental sequence of each brain region. Additionally, we explored the influence of prenatal exposure on the myelin development of the cerebellum, given its the highest PS-NP accumulation in offspring. Compared with control rats, PS-NPs exposure caused a significant reduction in myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) expression, a decrease in myelin thickness, an increase in cell apoptosis, and a decline in the oligodendrocyte population. These effects gave rise to motor deficits. In conclusion, our results identified the specific distribution of NPs in the fetal brain following prenatal exposure and revealed that prenatal exposure to PS-NPs can suppress myelin formation in the cerebellum of the fetus.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is widely cultivated worldwide as one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverage crops. Cladosporium, the dominant endophytic genus of leaves, possesses a variety of biotransformation and metabolic abilities to promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites. However, Cladosporium species in tea leaves remain unexplored. In this study, a total of 79 Cladosporium isolates were obtained from the leaves of several tea varieties in China. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis and morphological characteristics revealed six known species, namely, C. angulosum, C. anthropophilum, C. halotolerans, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum and C. xanthochromaticum, and one novel species named C. camelliae. C. angulosum was the most dominant species, and the other six species were newly recorded in tea plants. Pathogenicity tests showed no obvious symptoms of disease in tea leaves caused by 13 representative strains of these seven Cladosporium species. Subsequently, three frequently used fungicides were tested, including chlorothalonil, pyraclostrobin and thiophanate-methyl. The EC50 values against C. tenuissimum were 19.14, 0.548 and 3.796 mu g/mL, respectively. Based on these EC50 values, the inhibition effects of the three fungicides on six strains from six species (C. angulosum, C. anthropophilum, C. camelliae, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum and C. xanthochromaticum) were further compared. Pyraclostrobin had the strongest inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of Cladosporium, followed by thiophanate-methyl, and chlorothalonil showed the weakest inhibitory effect. The results provide a basis for understanding endophytic Cladosporium fungi in tea leaves.

AB  - Tinidazole is a second-generation nitroimidazole compound that is used as an antimicrobial to treat anaerobic bacterial and protozoal infections in humans and, less frequently, in veterinary medicine. However, metronidazole, another second-generation nitroimidazole, is more commonly used. Nonetheless, tinidazole has proven to be a superior therapy for parasitic infections in humans, particularly in the treatment of giardiasis. Furthermore, in chinchillas, metronidazole has been shown to cause a clinically relevant reduction in food intake after oral administration at published dosages. This study's objective was to evaluate the effect of orally administered tinidazole on food intake in healthy chinchillas. In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, crossover studies, tinidazole was evaluated at 2 single high doses (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg PO, n = 9) and a repeated dosing schedule at a lower dose (20 mg/kg PO q12h for 10 doses, n = 12). Food intake was measured over 24-h periods before and after drug administration. The single-dose treatment groups both displayed significantly reduced food intake (200 mg/kg: -26 +/- 21%; 100 mg/kg: -9 +/- 21%, P < 0.01) as compared with the control group during the first 24 h after drug administration. Food intake returned to pretreatment values within 4-5 d. Repeated administration at 20 mg/kg q12h was not associated with any significant changes in food intake. No other adverse effects were noted during this study. Tinidazole administration at single higher doses resulted in an acute self-limiting reduction in food intake. In comparison, repeated administration of lower doses (20 mg/kg PO q12h) had no significant effects on food intake in healthy chinchillas. Therefore, tinidazole may be a more suitable drug for treating Giardia and anaerobic bacterial infections in this species than the more commonly used metronidazole.

AB  - Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer care for many tumor types, but their potential long-term cognitive impacts are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated in mouse models that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for both central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS cancers impaired cognitive function and induced a persistent CNS immune response characterized by white matter microglial reactivity, microglial chemokine expression, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and chemokines. Consequently, oligodendroglial homeostasis and hippocampal neurogenesis were disrupted. Single-nucleus sequencing studies of human frontal lobe from patients with or without previous CART cell therapy for brain-stem tumors confirmed reactive states of microglia and oligodendrocytes following treatment. In mice, transient microglial depletion or CCR3 chemokine receptor blockade rescued oligodendroglial deficits and cognitive performance in a behavioral test of attention and short-term memory function following CAR T cell therapy. Taken together, these findings illustrate targetable neural-immune mechanisms underlying immunotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Most of the diversity of extant southern true seals (Phocidae: Monachinae) is present in the Southern Ocean, but a poor fossil record means that the origin of this fauna remains unknown. Australia represents a large gap in the record bordering the Southern Ocean that could possibly inform on the origins of the extant Antarctic monachines, with most known fossils remaining undescribed. Here we describe the oldest Australian fossil pinniped assemblage, from the Late Miocene to the Early Pliocene of Beaumaris. Two fossils are referrable to Pinnipedia, five (possibly six) to Phocidae and a humerus is referrable to Monachinae. The humerus is not referrable to any extant tribe, potentially representing an archaic monachine. The description of this assemblage is consistent with the Neogene pinniped fauna of Australia being exclusively monachine before the arrival of otariids (fur seals and sea lions). The Beaumaris humerus, along with other Neogene phocids from the Southern Ocean margins, were smaller than their extant Antarctic relatives, possibly driven by longer food chains with less energy efficiency between trophic levels. This suggests that small archaic phocids potentially used the Southern Ocean as a means of dispersal before the arrival of extant Antarctic monachines.

AB  - Toxoplasma (T.) gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite with a worldwide distribution. Congenital infection can lead to severe pathological alterations in the brain. To examine the effects of toxoplasmosis in the fetal brain, pregnant guinea pigs are infected with T. gondii oocysts on gestation day 23 and dissected 10, 17 and 25 days afterwards. We show the neocortex to represent a target region of T. gondii and the parasite to infect neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons and astrocytes in the fetal brain. Importantly, we observe a significant reduction in neuron number at end-neurogenesis and find a marked reduction in NPC count, indicating that impaired neurogenesis underlies the neuronal decrease in infected fetuses. Moreover, we observe focal microglioses to be associated with T. gondii in the fetal brain. Our findings expand the understanding of the pathophysiology of congenital toxoplasmosis, especially contributing to the development of cortical malformations.

AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) is the causative pathogen of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory disease in the pig industry. The increasingly severe antimicrobial resistance in APP urgently requires novel antibacterial alternatives for the treatment of APP infection. In this study, we investigated the effect of tea polyphenols (TP) against APP. MIC and MBC of TP showed significant inhibitory effects on bacteria growth and caused cellular damage to APP. Furthermore, TP decreased adherent activity of APP to the newborn pig tracheal epithelial cells (NPTr) and the destruction of the tight adherence junction proteins & beta;-catenin and occludin. Moreover, TP improved the survival rate of APP infected mice but also attenuated the release of the inflammation-related cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-& alpha;. TP inhibited activation of the TLR/MAPK/PKC-MLCK signaling for down-regulated TLR-2, TLR4, p-JNK, p-p38, p-PKC-& alpha;, and MLCK in cells triggered by APP. Collectively, our data suggest that TP represents a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of APP infection.

AB  - Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a common disease of Camellia oleifera. In this study, a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain, GZY63, was isolated from fruit of the anthracnose-resistant cultivar of Ca. oleifera "Ganzhouyou7." Plate confrontation assays and field experiments demonstrated the strong inhibitory effect of GZY63 on anthracnose, and this strain exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to nine pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. This strain shows potential as a fungicide alternative, but genetic information on this strain is critical for its optimal use. Combining Illumina and Nanopore sequencing, we assembled a high-quality circular genome of GZY63 that contained no plasmids. The GZY63 complete genome was approximately 3.93 Mb and had an average guanine-cytosine content of 46.5%. The genome comprised 4,024 predicted coding sequences and 12 types of gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite production. This genome information provides insights into the mechanism underlying the antagonistic impact of the GZY63 strain on anthracnose and its symbiotic relationship with Ca. oleifera.

AB  - Long bristles facilitate seed dispersal and protect seeds from herbivores. Early domesticated Setaria italica cultivars had long bristles, but most of the modern cultivars have short bristles. Little is known about the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the bristle length trait of S. italica. We generated a segregating population derived from a cross between a long bristle (Z-45) and a short bristle (Z-47) cultivars. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified at 35-40 Mb on chromosome 1 using QTL-seq. In addition, we found that 351-bp transposable element insertion in the Seita.1G316900 promoter was linked to the short bristle trait, which can be used in marker-assisted selection in crop breeding. In addition, some evidences were also found for Seita.1G338900 to play a role in regulation of bristle length. In summary, we hypothesize that Seita.1G316900 and Seita.1G338900 could be candidate genes for bristle length in S. italica. But further functional analysis of these genes are required.

AB  - Simple Summary The growth and development of skeletal muscle influences the efficiency of animal production. ZBED6 knockout accelerated the growth and development of pig and mice by regulating its target gene Igf2. However, the effect of, as well as detailed information about, the molecular mechanism of Zbed6 single-allele knockout on regulating muscle growth and development is still limited. In this study, a model of Zbed6 single-allele knockout mice prepared by gene-editing technology was used to study the effect and molecular mechanism of Zbed6 single-allele knockout on mice. Phenotypes and the RNA-seq results of muscle from Zbed6 single-allele knockout and wild-type mice showed that Zbed6 single-allele knockout promoted skeletal muscle weight and muscle fiber area via another target gene, instead of Igf2. This study may help to further explore the function of ZBED6 and its other target genes that have not been studied. ZBED6, a key transcription factor, plays an important role in skeletal muscle and organ growth. ZBED6 knockout (ZBED6(-/-)) leads to the upregulation of IGF2 in pig and mice muscle, thereby increasing muscle mass. However, the effects and mechanism of Zbed6 single-allele knockout (Zbed6(+/-)) on mice muscle remain unknown. Here, we reported that Zbed6(+/-) promotes muscle growth by a new potential target gene rather than Igf2 in mice muscle. Zbed6(+/-) mice showed markedly higher muscle mass (25%) and a markedly higher muscle weight ratio (18%) than wild-type (WT) mice, coinciding with a larger muscle fiber area (28%). Despite a significant increase in muscle growth, Zbed6(+/-) mice showed similar Igf2 expression with WT mice, indicating that a ZBED6-Igf2-independent regulatory pathway exists in Zbed6(+/-) mice muscle. RNA-seq of muscle between the Zbed6(+/-) and WT mice revealed two terms related to muscle growth. Overlapping the DEGs and C2C12 Chip-seq data of ZBED6 screened out a potential ZBED6 target gene Barx2, which may regulate muscle growth in Zbed6(+/-) mice. These results may open new research directions leading to a better understanding of the integral functions of ZBED6 and provide evidence of Zbed6(+/-) promoting muscle growth by regulating Barx2 in mice.

AB  - A methanol extract of the flowers of Jasminum sambac (L.) Aiton (Oleaceae) exhibited hepatoprotective effects against D-galactosamine (D-GalN)/lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury in mice. Five previously undescribed oligomeric secoiridoid glycosides, jasminumosides A-E (1-5), were isolated from the extract, along with 19 known compounds (6-24). The structures of 1-5 were determined based on their spectroscopic properties and chemical evidence. Among the isolates, three oligomeric secoiridoid glycosides, sambacoside A (6) and molihuasides C (10) and D (11), exhibited hepatoprotective effects at doses ranging between 12.5 and 25 mg/kg, p.o.

AB  - The culture of seahorses Hippocampus erectus in captivity represents a window of opportunity for the diversification of the aquaculture activity in the ornamental industry. In this study, we have constructed a bioeconomic model to evaluate the optimal harvest time (OHT) over a culture period of 562 days. The bioeconomic model was integrated with three submodels: biological, technological, and economic. Three different mortality rates were used for different periods in culture, registering a higher survival in the period from 0 to 60 days with a rate of 53.4%. The sensitivity analysis showed that the mortality rate in this period was the parameter with the greatest influence on the benefits. The Von Bertalanffy growth model was indicated to describe the growth of H. erectus given its statistical significance using Theil's inequality coefficient, registering parameters of (L-infinity = 141.62 mm) and (k = 0.0049 month-1). The bioeconomic model determined the OHT in the 4th month of culture, the time when the maximum profit is recorded. It is concluded that the culture presents challenges to be addressed although the bioeconomic model allows for demonstrating the OHT.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential of supplementing sheep diets with cobalt (CoNPs), iron (FeNPs) nanoparticles, or Spirulina platensis (SP) to tackle the adverse impacts of heat stress by assessing growth performance, oxidative status, metabolic pathways, immune parameters, gene expression, and hormone levels in sheep exposed to hot environmental conditions. A total of 32 Rahmani male lambs were randomly divided into four equal groups (n = 8). The CON group was fed the control diet or supplemented with 2 mg/kg of CoNPs (CoNPs group), 50 mg/kg of FeNPs (FeNPs group), or 1 g of SP/kg (SP group) diet for 3 months. The average size of nanozymes CoNPs and FeNPs were 41 and 44 nm, respectively. The temperature humidity index (THI) was 81.99 overall the study period. All nanozyme or SP treatments significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced growth performance, including final and average body weight, and dry matter intake. Nanozyme treatments also achieved the best results regarding hematocrit (P < 0.01) and platelets (P < 0.01). All supplemented groups exhibited lower WBC and lymphocyte counts, and higher globulin levels in comparison to stressed sheep. Total protein levels were significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in the FeNPs and SP groups compared to the remaining groups. Rams fed CoNPs or SP had notably (P < 0.001) higher TC and TG levels, while the FeNPs group showed the lowest TC levels (P < 0.05), as well as the lowest VLDL and LDL levels (P < 0.05). The levels of blood immune markers, specifically lysozyme, IgG, and IgM, were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in all supplemented groups in comparison to the untreated group. Furthermore, rams receiving FeNPs demonstrated higher (P < 0.05) values for TAC, CAT, SOD, and GPX, and lower MDA levels than the other groups. Additionally, the supplemented group exhibited greater (P < 0.05) leptin and testosterone levels than the stressed group. Further, serum concentrations of zinc, selenium, and iron were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the nano-feed additives and SP groups compared to the HS group. Dietary supplementation with nanozymes or SP notably (P < 0.05) upregulated GPX1 and HSP70 expression and downregulated TNF-alpha mRNA levels (P < 0.05). In summary, dietary supplementation with nanozymes or microalgae robustly bolstered sheep's immune-antioxidant capacity, improved growth performance, and promoted health under heat stress conditions relevant to global warming.

AB  - The reproductive performance of sows is critical to pork industry productivity. However, genetic improvement of reproductive and litter traits remains challenging due to low heritability and unfavourable genetic correlations. Integrating small non-coding (sncRNA) biomarkers to supplement existing selection protocols may enhance female pig reproductive potential selection. This study aimed to compare circulating serum sncRNA profiles between infertile (INF; nonpregnant after two consecutive artificial inseminations, n = 30) and high reproductive potential (HRP; average lifetime live litter size >= 13 piglets, n = 50) female pigs and identify candidate miRNA biomarkers associated with reproductive potential. Small RNA sequencing revealed 19 significantly (P <0.05) different expressed sncRNAs (12 upregulated and 7 downregulated in INF) and 13 significantly (P <0.05) different expressed miRNAs (8 upregulated and 5 downregulated in INF). Many of the identified DEmiRNAs have known roles in female reproduction and infertility, however, whether these differences are causal or compensatory responses of female pig reproductive potential level remains unclear. Using a complementary feature selection approach, 22 candidate miRNA biomarkers were selected, including miR-140-3p, miR215-5p, and miR-7142-3p. The trained support vector machine (SVM) classified female pig reproductive potential with high accuracy (91 %), sensitivity for HRP (96 %) and specificity for INF (83 %), supporting its potential to improve selection efficiency of reproductive potential in the breeding herd. Validation of these 22 candidate miRNA biomarkers and model in a larger, independent cohort of female pigs is necessary to determine generalizability and use for practical application in on-farm breeding herd selection.

AB  - The objective was to determine the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) of food sources using the pig model and in vitro procedures. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in white rice, wheat, pea protein concentrate (PPC), soy protein isolate (SPI), and skim milk powder (SMP) were determined in pigs. Twelve barrows with an initial body weight of 28.4 kg (standard deviation = 4.0) equipped with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were allotted to a replicated 6 x 5 incomplete Latin square design with six diets and five periods. Five experimental diets contained each ingredient as the only source of AA. Additionally, a nitrogen-free diet was prepared to measure the basal endogenous losses of AA for the calculation of the SID of AA. The in vitro ileal disappearance (IVID) of crude protein (CP) in the five food sources was also determined using the conventional flask procedure and the multi-sample simultaneous in vitro procedure employing the Daisy(II) incubator. The DIAAS values for white rice were 42, 50, and 60 for infants, children, and adults, respectively. For wheat, the DIAAS values were 46, 56, and 66, respectively. The DIAAS values for PPC were 47, 58, and 69 for infants, children, and adults, respectively. For SPI, the values were 61, 74, and 87, respectively. The DIAAS for SMP were 82, 112, and 131 for infants, children, and adults respectively. The IVID of CP in SMP was greater (p < 0.05) than that in other sources. The DIAAS calculated based on IVID of CP were similar to those determined based on the SID of AA in pigs. In conclusion, white rice, wheat, pea protein concentrate, and soy protein isolate were observed to have DIAAS values less than 100, indicating that these ingredients need to be combined with other protein sources to meet the indispensable AA requirements. Skim milk powder had a DIAAS greater than 100 for children and adults.

AB  - The results of our study demonstrate that the PRRS eradication program applying the herd depopulation-repopulation approach led to a considerable improvement of the productivity of the Hungarian pig herd. This result also demonstrates that, independently of the PRRS eradication, it is still necessary to consider investments in the individual production units to increase efficiency, and to carry out herd depopulation-repopulation in cases where the current genetics limits improvements in productivity.
   Background: The Hungarian national eradication program of PRRS was successfully completed between 2014 and 2022. There were doubts about the efficiency of the eradication program in Hungary from the beginning to the tune that it might only be carried out efficiently through depopulation-repopulation of the infected herds, which is a very costly procedure. In our study, we investigated the impact of the depopulation-repopulation procedure, which played a prominent role in the PRRS eradication program on the productivity of the Hungarian swine sector-namely, on the number of slaughter pigs per sow per year and the total live slaughter weight per sow per year. Material and Methods: Since 2014, we monitored the evolution of the PRRS eradication through the depopulation-repopulation approach on the large-scale breeding herds in Hungary. Most producers replaced their herds with animals that were free of PRRS and other infectious diseases (mycoplasmosis, actinobacillosis, swine dysentery, atrophic rhinitis, etc.). On this basis, we evaluated the change in the number of slaughter pigs per sow per year as a consequence of depopulationrepopulation of the herds being carried out. In the statistical analysis linear regression was used. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate that the PRRS eradication program with the herd depopulation-repopulation approach led to a considerable improvement of the productivity of Hungarian pig farming. This result also demonstrates that, independent of the PRRS eradication, it is still necessary to consider investments into the individual production units to increase efficiency, and to carry out herd depopulation-repopulation in cases where the current genetics limits improvements in productivity.

AB  - Exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) in utero significantly elevates the risk of developing schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders. To understand the biological mechanisms underlying the link between MIA and increased risk, preclinical animal models have focussed on specific signalling pathways in the brain that mediate symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as cognitive dysfunction. Reelin signalling in multiple brain regions is involved in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation, and has been implicated in cognitive deficits. However, how regulation of Reelin expression is affected by MIA across cortical development and associated cognitive functions remains largely unclear. Using a MIA rat model, here we demonstrate cognitive deficits in adolescent object-location memory in MIA offspring and reductions in Reln expression prenatally and in the adult prefrontal cortex. Further, developmental disturbances in gene/protein expression and DNA methylation of downstream signalling components occurred subsequent to MIA-induced Reelin dysregulation and prior to cognitive deficits. We propose that MIA-induced dysregulation of Reelin signalling contributes to the emergence of prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive deficits through altered NMDA receptor function, resulting in inefficient long-term potentiation. Our data suggest a developmental window during which attenuation of Reelin signalling may provide a possible therapeutic target.

AB  - RoundUp (R) (RUp) is a comercial formulation containing glyphosate (N-(phosphono-methyl) glycine), and is the world's leading wide-spectrum herbicide used in agriculture. Supporters of the broad use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) claim they are innocuous to humans, since the active compound acts on the inhibition of enzymes which are absent in human cells. However, the neurotoxic effects of GBH have already been shown in many animal models. Further, these formulations were shown to disrupt the microbiome of different species. Here, we investigated the effects of a lifelong exposure to low doses of the GBH-RUp on the gut environment, including morphological and microbiome changes. We also aimed to determine whether exposure to GBH-RUp could harm the developing brain and lead to behavioral changes in adult mice. To this end, animals were exposed to GBH-RUp in drinking water from pregnancy to adulthood. GBH-RUp-exposed mice had no changes in cognitive function, but developed impaired social behavior and increased repetitive behavior. GBH-Rup-exposed mice also showed an activation of phagocytic cells (Iba-1-positive) in the cortical brain tissue. GBH-RUp exposure caused increased mucus production and the infiltration of plama cells (CD138-positive), with a reduction in phagocytic cells. Long-term exposure to GBH-RUp also induced changes in intestinal integrity, as demonstrated by the altered expression of tight junction effector proteins (ZO-1 and ZO-2) and a change in the distribution of syndecan-1 proteoglycan. The herbicide also led to changes in the gut microbiome composition, which is also crucial for the establishment of the intestinal barrier. Altogether, our findings suggest that long-term GBH-RUp exposure leads to morphological and functional changes in the gut, which correlate with behavioral changes that are similar to those observed in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Many axial and appendicular skeleton bones are subjected to repetitive loading during daily activities. Until recently, the structural analysis of fractures has been limited to 2D sections, and the dynamic assessment of fracture progression has not been possible. The structural failure was analyzed using step-wise micro-compression combined with time-lapsed micro-computed tomographic imaging. The structural failure was investigated in four different sample materials (two different bone surrogates, lumbar vertebral bodies from bovine and red deer). The samples were loaded in different force steps based on uniaxial compression tests. The micro-tomography images were used to create three-dimensional models from which various parameters were calculated that provide information about the structure and density of the samples. By superimposing two 3D images and calculating the different surfaces, it was possible to precisely analyze which trabeculae failed in which area and under which load. According to the current state of the art, bone mineral density is usually used as a value for bone quality, but the question can be raised as to whether other values such as trabecular structure, damage accumulation, and bone mineralization can predict structural competence better than bone mineral density alone.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Depression is one of the most common mood disturbances worldwide. The Si-ni-san formula (SNS) is a famous classic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) widely used to treat depression for thousands of years in clinics. However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of SNS in improving depression-like behaviors following chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) remains unknown.Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate whether SNS alleviates depression-like behaviors in CUMS mice by regulating dendritic spines via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in vitro and in vivo.Study design and methods: In vivo, mice were exposed to CUMS for 42 days, and SNS (4.9, 9.8, 19.6 g/kg/d), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/d), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (30 mg/kg/d), rapamycin(1 mg/kg/d), and deferoxamine (DFO) (200 mg/kg/d) were conducted once daily during the last 3 weeks of the CUMS procedure. In vitro, a depressive model was established by culture of SH-SY5Y cells with corticosterone, followed by treatment with different concentrations of freeze-dried SNS (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/mL) and rapamycin (10 nM), NCOA4-overexpression, Si-NCOA4. After the behavioral test (open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), dendritic spines, GluR2 protein expression, iron concentration, and ferritinophagy-related protein levels (P62, FTH, NCOA4, LC3-II/LC3-I) were tested in vitro and in vivo using immunohistochemistry, golgi staining, immunofluorescence, and Western blot assays. Finally, HEK-293T cells were transfected by si-NCOA4 or GluR2-and NCOA4-overexpression plasmid and treated with corticosterone(100 mu M), freeze-dried SNS(0.01 mg/mL), rapamycin(25 nM), and 3-MA(5 mM). The binding amount of GluR2, NCOA4, and LC3 was assessed by the co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) assay.Results: 3-MA, SNS, and DFO promoted depressive-like behaviors in CUMS mice during OFT, SPT, FST and TST, improved the amount of the total, thin, mushroom spine density and enhanced GluR2 protein expression in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, treatment with SNS decreased iron concentrations and inhibited NCOA4-mediated fer-ritinophagy activation in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, 3-MA and SNS could prevent the binding of GluR2, NCOA4 and LC3 in corticosterone-treated HEK-293T, and rapamycin reversed this phenomenon after treatment with SNS.Conclusion: SNS alleviates depression-like behaviors in CUMS mice by regulating dendritic spines via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy.

AB  - Mood disorders caused by chemotherapy have become more important as the survival of cancer patients increases, and new studies in this field will contribute to the prevention of this disorder. For this purpose, we used methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent frequently preferred in oncological cases. Mtx was administered as a single dose of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally to male Wistar albino rats. Since oxidative stress plays an important role in chemotherapy-induced emotional impairment, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, was administered at 500 mg/kg in two doses before Mtx administration. We evaluated anxiety and depression-like behaviors 24 h after Mtx administration, as well as some oxidative and inflammatory markers in blood serum and hippocampal tissue, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release in hippocampal tissue. In rats, Mtx induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors as well as abnormalities in oxidative and inflammatory markers in blood serum and hippocampal tissue, increased AChE activity in hippocampal tissue, and decreased BDNF release. NAC treatment was found to ameliorate Mtx-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, increase antioxidant capacity, reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and regulate AChE activity and BDNF release. In conclusion, the fact that NAC treatment of Mtx was effective is important for revising the treatment strategies for individuals suffering from this disorder, and this effect is thought to be related to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power of NAC.

AB  - Trachyspermum ammi is widely used among the people in the Arabian Peninsula to treat general respiratory problems including bronchoconstriction. In this study, the fruit extracts and its fractions and purely isolated components obtained from the T. ammi were investigated for their possible bronchodilator potential in an ex vivo model using guinea pig trachea. It was observed that the ethanol extract (TAT) of the plant and its hexane (TAH) and chloroform (TAC) extract fractions completely inhibited carbachol (CCh, 1 mu M)-induced contractions at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. As a result of the biological activity-guided purification studies of the chloroform extract (TAC), in which the highest activity was observed, eight sub-fractions were obtained between A-H. Of these, fractions A, D, G were found to have significant activity for tracheal relaxation with 100%, 55 +/- 5% and 31 +/- 3%, respectively, while the other five fractions were found not to have any activity. Three monoterpene compounds were isolated from the fractions with high activity and their structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectrometric techniques as well as by simple chemical derivatization. In this study, it was determined that the bronchodilator effect of compound 1 (thymol) was demonstrated by the activation of different subtypes of K + channels. Reported data herein, demonstrated the scientific justification for the traditional use of T. ammi species against asthma and bronchitis.

AB  - Social monogamy is a reproductive strategy characterized by pair living and defense of a common territory. Pair bonding, sometimes displayed by monogamous species, is an affective construct that includes preference for a specific partner, distress upon separation, and the ability of the partner to buffer against stress. Many seahorse species show a monogamous social structure in the wild, but their pair bond has not been well studied. We examined the gene expression of lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) during and after the process of pairing in the laboratory as well as color change (luminance), a potential form of social communication and behavioral synchrony between pair mates. When a seahorse of either sex was interacting with its pair mate, their changes in luminance ("brightness") were correlated and larger than when interacting with an opposite-sex stranger. At the conclusion of testing, subjects were euthanized, RNA was extracted from whole brains and analyzed via RNA sequencing. Changes in gene expression in paired males versus those that were unpaired included processes governing metabolic activity, hormones and cilia. Perhaps most interesting is the overlap in gene expression change induced by pairing in both male seahorses and male prairie voles, including components of hormone systems regulating reproduction. Because of our limited sample size, we consider our results and interpretations to be preliminary, and prompts for further exploration. Future studies will expand upon these findings and investigate the neuroendocrine and genetic basis of these behaviors.

AB  - Simple Summary Dairy products have a key role in the human diet due to different healthy traits. At the same time, they can contain different environmental pollutants, representing a risk to human health. The dairy characteristics influencing the risk-benefit ratio are affected principally by animal diet. This paper investigates typical stretched cheese, which is obtained from the milk of the Cinisara cattle breed, mainly raised on pasture integrated with various feed, depending on pasture availability. The present study investigated the fatty acid profile and the persistent organic pollutants content in cheeses made by six typical farms, two of which adopted an organic system. The cheeses were made in winter, spring, and summer. The aim of research was to assess the risk and benefits to human health due to cheese consumption. The results showed a better fatty acids profile of cheeses made in spring, for the presence of some fatty acids deriving from grazing fresh forage; higher contaminants were found in products made in winter, especially in those from non-organic farms. The consumption of different cheeses could represent human health risks, mainly from polychlorinated-biphenyl contents. Further studies should be conducted to identify the pollutants' pathways and transfer routes due to ingestion. Dairy products represent an important source of beneficial substances for humans. At the same time, they can expose the consumers to environmental contaminants ingested by animals through their diet, influencing their health negatively. This experiment aims to evaluate the risk and benefits related to the consumption of typical stretched cheeses, considering their fatty acid (FA) profile and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) content. Six representative farms, two of them organic, raising Cinisara cattle were selected, considering the typical extensive management systems, based on feeding of natural pasture integrated with concentrate and hay depending on the availability of forage on pastures. A total of 18 cheeses produced in winter, spring and summer with bulk milk of each farm were sampled and analyzed. The chemical composition of cheeses was influenced by farm management, and the FA profile mainly by the season. In particular, cheeses made in spring showed a healthier FA profile with the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), of omega3-PUFA and omega6/omega3 ratio pair to 7.29%, 1.44% and 1.32, respectively, while in winter 5.44%, 0.98% and 2.55, respectively, and in summer 4.77% 0.49% and 3.04, respectively. Due to high levels of feeding integration, cheese made in winter presented unhealthier characteristics compared to the cheeses made in spring and summer, showing high levels of saturated FA (66.2%, 64.2% and 65.5%, respectively), and large contents of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (57.07 ng/g fat, 36.25 ng/g fat and 10.22 ng/g fat, respectively) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (36.19 ng/g fat, 4.68 ng/g fat and 3.73 ng/g fat, respectively), mainly in those from non-organic farms. Levels of PCBs considered to be hazardous to human health were found in nine samples.

AB  - Introduction Dopamine system dysfunction is closely associated with nervous system diseases such as Parkinson's disease and psychiatric disorder. Current research is limited to the individual application of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-related agents, and the systematic effects of combined dopamine D1/D2 receptor inhibition on neural function remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of co-DR1/2I (combined administration of dopamine receptor 1 inhibitor SCH39166 and dopamine receptor 2 inhibitor raclopride) on oxidative stress, learning, memory, emotion, and motor function in the substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus of mice.Methods After administering varying doses of co-DR1/2I through gastric tubes to male C57BL/6 mice, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Behavioral changes were assessed, using open field, rotarod, and water maze tests. Tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons were labeled with immunofluorescence, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were detected by Western blot (WB) assay.Results Low-dose co-DR1/2I significantly increased MAO-B and ROS levels (p < 0.01) and decreased SOD activity (p < 0.01) in the substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. MAO-B activity positively correlated with ROS (r = 0.916, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with SOD (r = -0.685, p < 0.001), whereas ROS negatively correlated with SOD (r = -0.661, p < 0.001) in co-DR1/2I-treated mice. The medium- and high-dose groups exhibited spatial memory impairment (longer escape latency, p < 0.05) in the water maze and more anxiety-like behavior (reduced central zone time, p < 0.01) in the open field test; however, no abnormalities in motor coordination were observed in the rotarod test (p > 0.05). Immunofluorescence and WB confirmed a reduction in the dopaminergic neuron count after co-DR1/2I.Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that co-DR1/2I triggers cognitive and emotional dysfunction by exacerbating oxidative stress and dopaminergic neuronal damage, thereby advancing our understanding of the neurotoxic mechanisms of dopamine receptor antagonists. Future studies are needed to explore targeted antioxidant therapies and receptor-selective modulation strategies to reduce the side effects.

AB  - Successful navigation depends critically upon two broad categories of spatial navigation strategies that include allocentric and egocentric reference frames, relying on external or internal spatial information, respectively. As with older adults, aged rats show robust impairments on a number of different spatial navigation tasks. There is some evidence that these navigation impairments are accompanied by a bias toward relying on egocentric over allocentric navigation strategies. To test the degree to which young and aged animals utilize these two navigation approaches, a novel behavioral arena was used in which rats are trained to traverse a circular track and to stop at a learned goal location that is fixed with respect to a panorama of visual cues projected onto the surrounding walls. By instantaneously rotating the cues, allocentric and egocentric reference frames were put in direct and immediate conflict and goal navigation performance was assessed with respect to how accurately young and aged animals were able to utilize the rotated cues. Behavioral data collected from nine young and eight aged animals revealed that both age groups were able to update their navigation performance following cue rotation. Contrary to what was expected, however, aged animals showed more accurate overall goal navigation performance, stronger allocentric strategy use, and more evident changes in behavior in response to cue rotation compared to younger animals. The young rats appeared to mix egocentric and allocentric strategies for ICR task solution.

AB  - BACKGROUNDMare milk has often been considered a food product with potential functional properties. However, the bioactive compound composition of mare milk, including vitamins and other minor bioactive compounds, as well as factors affecting this composition have scarcely been studied. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize the changes during lactation in the content of water- and fat-soluble vitamins and total polyphenols, and the total antioxidant capacity of mare milk from semi-extensive farms. A total of 310 individual milk samples from 18 mares belonging to three commercial farms and 12 lactation times were analyzed. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), nicotinic acid and niacinamide (vitamins B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxal and pyridoxine (vitamins B6), folic acid (vitamin B9), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), tocopherols and tocotrienols (vitamin E) and retinol and retinyl esters (vitamin A) were quantified using liquid chromatography. Total polyphenols and antioxidant capacity assays were analyzed using spectrophotometry.RESULTSThe concentration of most bioactive compounds tended to decline as lactation progressed, with the exception of polyphenols and the total antioxidant capacity that oscillated during lactation. On the other hand, the effect of the different semi-extensive management of the farms was only significant for vitamin B3 content.CONCLUSIONTo the best of our knowledge, the present study provides the most in-depth description of the vitamin profile of mare milk as well as new insights into polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of mare milk.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic roles of Tetrandrine (TET) on traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the underlying mechanism. Method Traumatic injury model of hippocampal neurons and TBI mouse model were established to evaluate the therapeutic effects. The expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Caspase 3, and Caspase 12 was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, ERS markers (GADD34 and p-PERK), IRE1 alpha, CHOP, JNK, and p-JNK were evaluated by western blot. Flow cytometry was used to determine the apoptosis of neurons. Brain injury was assessed by Garcia score, cerebral water content, and Evan blue extravasation test. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to determine the morphological changes of hippocampal tissue. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Result In traumatic injury model of hippocampal neurons, TET downregulated NSE, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, GADD34, p-PERK, IRE1 alpha, CHOP, and p-JNK expression. TET reduced Caspase 3 and Caspase 12 cleavage. Apoptosis rate was inhibited by the introduction of TET. TET improved the Garcia neural score, decreased the cerebral water content and Evans blue extravasation, and reduced NSE, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B, TRAF1, IRE1 alpha, CHOP, and p-JNK expression in mice with TBI, which was significantly reversed by Anisomycin, a JNK selective activator. Conclusion TET alleviated inflammation and neuron apoptosis in experimental TBI by regulating the IRE1 alpha/JNK/CHOP signal pathway.

AB  - Tea is a vital beverage crop all over the world, including in China. Low temperatures restrict its growth, development, and terrestrial distribution, and cold event variability worsens cold damage. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms of Camellia sinensis under shade in winter remain unclear. In our study, tea leaves were utilized for physiological attributes and transcriptome analysis in November and December in three shading groups and no-shade control plants. When compared to the no-shade control plants, the shading group protected tea leaves from cold damage, increased photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and soil plant analysis development (SPAD), and sustained chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents by physiological mean. Then, transcriptome analysis revealed 20,807 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and transcription factors (TFs) in November and December. A comparative study of transcriptome resulted in 3,523 DEGs and many TFs under SD0% vs. SD30%, SD0% vs. SD60%, and SD0% vs. SD75% of shading in November and December. Statistically, 114 DEGs were downregulated and 72 were upregulated under SD0% vs. SD30%. SD0% vs. SD60% resulted in 154 DEGs, with 60 downregulated and 94 upregulated. Similarly, there were 505 DEGs of which 244 were downregulated and 263 were upregulated under SD0% vs. SD75% of shading throughout November. However, 279 DEGs were downregulated and 105 were upregulated under SD0% vs. SD30%. SD0% vs. SD60% resulted in 296 DEGs, with 172 downregulated and 124 upregulated. Finally, 2,173 DEGs were regulated in December, with 1,428 downregulated and 745 upregulated under SD0% vs. SD75%. These indicate that the number of downregulated DEGs in December was higher than the number of upregulated DEGs in November during low temperatures. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of differentially expressed genes were highly regulated in the photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. However, qRT-PCR and RNA-seq relative expression of photosynthetic (DEGs) Lhcb2 in both November and December, plant hormone (DEGs) BRI1 and JAZ in November and IAA and ERF1 in December, and key DEGs of MAPK signal transduction FLS2, CHIB, and MPK4 in November and RBOH, MKK4_5, and MEKK1 in December in three shading groups and no-shade control plants responded to tea cold tolerance. The enhanced expression of light-harvesting photosystem I gene Lhca5, light-harvesting photosystem II gene Lhcb2, and mitogen-activated protein kinases MEKK1 and MPK4/6 enhance the cold-tolerance mechanism of C. sinensis. These comprehensive transcriptomic findings are significant for furthering our understanding of the genes and underlying regulatory mechanisms of shade-mediated low-temperature stress tolerance in horticultural crops.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of behavioral reactivity on maternal behavior of ewes and early postnatal behavior and growth in lambs until weaning. The study was carried out with 100 multiparous Norduz ewes and 30 lambs. The study began by performing arena and scale tests and determining the test cortisol level in ewes during the anestrus period. Then, ewes were divided into two groups according to test reactivity as either "reactive" or "proactive" by using hierarchical cluster analysis. On the 50th day after mating, 15 reactive and 15 proactive gestating ewes of similar live weight, body condition and age (54.5 +/- 0.58 kg, 3.19 +/- 0.023 points and 4.07 +/- 0.089 years, respectively) and carrying a single fetus each were selected and placed in one of two groups. Behavior of ewes and lambs from each group were monitored for a 3 -h period post-partum and the ewe-lamb separation test was performed within first 3 days postnatal. Ewes were phenotyped according to grooming duration, number of bleats, leaving lamb, preventing sucking etc., while lambs were phenotyped based on number of successful sucks, bleats, total suck duration, etc. Growth was determined by recording live weights of lambs at 2-week intervals until the 90th day. The whole trial lasted a total of 9 months. Ewes grazed entirely on rangeland with no extra feed supplementation. Ewes were fed with alfalfa hay and gradually supplemented with barley and concentrate during the winter. Serum cortisol levels were found significantly different in reactive and proactive ewes (1.57 ng/ml and 0.86 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001). During the early postnatal period, more high-pitched bleats were counted for proactive ewes, who also left their lambs alone more often than reactive ewes (p < 0.01), whereas reactive ewes had higher scores for following during ewe-lamb separation tests (p < 0.05). Lambs of reactive ewes had a higher total number of successful sucks, longer sucking duration (p < 0.05), and better growth performance at day 30 and day 45 (p < 0.05) as compared to lambs of proactive ewes. However, the weaning weights of reactive and proactive lambs were found similar as 30.3 +/- 1.01 vs 30.2 +/- 0.71 kg, respectively. In sum, the results of the present study indicated that some early postnatal ewe-lamb behaviours, ewe-lamb separation test score and lamb growth may be associated with behavioral reactivity. Given these findings, it was concluded that behavioral reactivity has potential use in efforts to improve maternal care and lamb welfare.

AB  - Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, which is almost exclusively sexually transmitted, causes genital herpes. Although this lifelong and incurable infection is extremely widespread, currently there is no readily available diagnostic device that accurately detects HSV-2 antigens to a satisfactory degree. Here, we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical device that detects HSV-2 antigens within 9 min and costs just $1 (USD) to manufacture. The electrochemical biosensor is biofunctionalized with the human cellular receptor nectin-1 and detects the glycoprotein gD2, which is present within the HSV-2 viral envelope. The performance of the device is tested in a guinea pig model that mimics human biofluids, yielding 88.9% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 95.0% accuracy under these conditions, with a limit of detection of 0.019 fg mL-1 for gD2 protein and 0.057 PFU mL-1 for titered viral samples. Importantly, no cross -reactions with other viruses were detected, indicating the adequate robustness and selectivity of the sensor. Our low-cost technology could facilitate more frequent testing for HSV-2.

AB  - Acidification through plasma treatment technology presents a potential solution to mitigate nitrogen losses throughout the manure management chain, offering a dual benefit of atmospheric nitrogen incorporation into manures while inducing acidification. This study evaluated the use and effectiveness of plasma treatment technology as a one-time acidification strategy for digested slurry during long-term storage, its effects on slurry nitrogen (N) availability and subsequent release in the soil. A digestate from a full-scale anaerobic digester was separated using a decanter centrifuge, and the resultant liquid fraction (LF) was plasma treated to achieve three different initial pH levels (4.27, 5.03 and 5.42). After that, a storage experiment was set up for 180 days to monitor the evolution in pH and changes in NH4+, NO3- and NO2- . Concurrently, a soil incubation experiment was conducted to study the N turnover for 80 days after incorporating the organic materials (Liquid fraction, plasma-treated liquid fractions, digestate and raw slurry). Plasma treatment significantly increased total N and the proportion of inorganic N in the slurries by fixing atmospheric N as NO3- and NO2- and reduced the slurry pH depending on the treatment duration. After six months of storage, pH increased by 0.91 pH units in the plasma-treated liquid fraction with the highest initial pH (LFpH-5.42). Plasma treatment significantly increased net inorganic N release in soil by 5-14 % compared to a non-treated liquid fraction. Unexpected prolonged inhibition of NH4+ nitrification in soil for over 80 days after applying plasma-treated slurries was observed. In conclusion, plasma treatment emerges as a promising alternative to acid- and bioacidification strategies, offering prolonged low slurry pH stabilisation, improved fertiliser value and delayed NH4+-N nitrification in soil.

AB  - Simple Summary The production of high-quality pigs starts with sow nutrition. In this study, we tested the effect of feeding the live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 to sows and their piglets on litter performance and some immunity parameters of piglets vaccinated against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Our results indicate that feeding lactating sows with the live yeast improves litter growth and weaning weight. For that reason, the pigs are likely better prepared for the challenges they are going to encounter after weaning. The piglets from supplemented sows show higher mucosal protection and less inflammation in the lung after the vaccine, explained by the gut-lung axis, which is defined as the cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the lung. The aim of this study was to assess the effect that feeding Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 (LSB) to lactating sows and their progeny has on inflammatory response and mucosal immunity after vaccination against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Sixty-seven Danbred sows were allotted into two treatments when they entered the farrowing room seven days before the expected farrowing date: control (CON: lactation diet) and LSB (CON + 12 x 10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/d until weaning). At weaning, piglets were equally allotted into two experimental diets according to sow diet: control (CON: 2-phase post-weaning diets) and LSB (CON + 2 x 10(9) CFU/kg and 1 x 10(9) CFU/kg in phases 1 and 2, respectively). The piglets were vaccinated at days 26 and 49 post-weaning. Growth performance and number of IgA producing cells and cytokine's gene expression in lung, lymph node, and intestine samples at day 70 post-weaning were assessed and analyzed in SPSS Statistics 26: performance with a general linear model with sex, room, sow diet, piglet diet, and their interactions as main effects, and immunity with a Kruskal-Wallis test for k unrelated samples. Piglets from LSB-fed sows displayed a higher average daily gain (ADG; p < 0.01) and a heavier body weight (BW; p < 0.05) during lactation, tended (p < 0.1) to be heavier at day 49, and to have a higher ADG between days 26 and 49; had fewer number of IgA producing cells in the lymph node (p < 0.05); and all the cytokines studied were significantly under-regulated (p < 0.05) in the lung. It is concluded that feeding Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 to sows improved piglet performance during lactation and showed a clear reduction in the inflammatory status of the lungs after vaccination against A. pleuropneumoniae, suggesting that there was a maternal imprinting effect on mucosal protection and a cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the lung.

AB  - Zearalenone (ZEA) has an estrogenic effect and often causes reproductive damage. Pigs are particularly sensitive to it. Lycopene (LYC) is a type of fat-soluble natural carotenoid that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-cardiovascular and detoxifying effects. In this study, piglet sertoli cells (SCs) were used as research objects to investigate the mechanism of ZEA induced damage to piglet SCs and to evaluate the protective effect of LYC on ZEA induced toxic damage to piglet SCs. The results showed that ZEA damaged the cell structure and inhibited the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nucleus, which down regulated the relative mRNA expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and decreased the activity of HO-1, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), resulting in an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. ZEA down regulated the relative mRNA and protein expression of bcl-2 in piglet SCs, promoted cell apoptosis, and upregulated the relative mRNA and protein expression of LC3, beclin-1, and bax. After 3 h LYC-pretreatment, ZEA was added for mixed culture. The results of pretreatment with LYC showed that LYC could alleviate the cytotoxicity of ZEA to porlets SCs. Compared with ZEA group, improved the cell survival rate, promoted the expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus, upregulated the relative mRNA expression of HO-1 and GPX1, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced the levels of MDA and ROS. Moreover, after pretreatment with LYC, the mRNA expression of bcl-2 was upregulated, the apoptosis rate was decreased, the relative mRNA and protein expressions of LC3, beclin-1 and bax were downregulated, and autophagy was alleviated. In conclusion, LYC alleviated the oxidative damage of SCs caused by ZEA by promoting the expression of Nrf2 pathway and decreased autophagy and apoptosis.

AB  - The NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a proven mitochondrial metabolic stress sensor. It has been linked to the regulation of the mitochondrial acetylome and activation of several metabolic enzymes (e.g., manganese superoxide dismutase [MnSOD]) to protect mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis, which are vital for survival, excitability, and synaptic signaling of neurons mediating short- and long-term memory formation as well as retention. Eighteen-month-old male and female wild-type (WT) and Sirt3(-/-) mice were behaviorally tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in a Morris water maze paradigm. Cognitive impairment was displayed during the probe trial by female and male Sirt3(-/-) mice but not WT mice. Upon sacrifice, brains were fixed, and morphological assessments were conducted on hippocampal tissues. Both female and male Sirt3(-/-) mice demonstrated impaired spatial memory retention implying that SIRT3 plays a role in long-term memory function. Golgi-staining studies revealed decreased dendritic arborization and dendritic length in the hippocampi of male Sirt3(-/-) compared to WT animals. Sirt3 deletion significantly increased NR1, NR2A, and NR2B expression in the hippocampus of female mice only. Enzymatic activity of MnSOD, a major mitochondrial deacetylation target of SIRT3, was significantly decreased in both female and male Sirt3(-/-) mice. Similarly, both female and male Sirt3(-/-) mice demonstrated a significant decrease in their respiratory control ratio during Complex I-driven respiration, which was apparent only in female Sirt3(-/-) mice during Complex II-driven respiration.

AB  - Plants exhibit a remarkable capacity to discern between self-inflicted damage, herbivore attacks, and mechanical harm through pattern recognition, detecting specific signals associated with each type of damage. Mechanical damage significantly influences plant defence responses against herbivorous insects. This study aimed to artificially activate the plant defence system and observe the performance of aphid (Myzus persicae Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and their parasitoid (Diaeretiella rapae M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on brassica plants. Mechanically damaged and undamaged plants were subjected to aphid infestation, and various parameters related to aphid and parasitoid performance, including adult survival, fecundity, aphid settlement, and oviposition behavior, were measured. Results revealed that plants with artificial damage exhibited greater resistance to aphids than undamaged plants. In the cage bioassay, there was a notable 17% reduction in aphid larviposition on damaged plants, with no significant impact on adult mortality. The aphid settlement bioassay demonstrated a significant 33% reduction in aphid settlement on damaged plants compared to undamaged ones. Conversely, mechanical damage increased parasitism behavior, leading to a substantial 32% increase in parasitoids' oviposition preference on damaged plants. These findings highlight the significance of considering mechanical damage as a crucial factor in altering plant-insect interactions. The study suggests that mechanical damage could be a potential tool for plant protection in agricultural settings by significantly suppressing aphid performance and enhancing parasitoid behaviour.

AB  - Acoustic communication signals are inevitably challenged by ambient noise. In response to noise, many animals adjust their calls to maintain signal detectability. However, the mechanisms by which the auditory system adapts to the adjusted pulses are unclear. Our previous study revealed that the echolocating bat, Hipposideros pratti, increased its pulse intensity in the presence of background white noise. In vivo single-neuron recording demonstrated that the auditory midbrain neurons tuned to the second harmonic (H2 neurons) increased their minimal threshold (MT) to a similar degree as the increment of pulse intensity in the presence of the background noise. Furthermore, the H2 neurons exhibited consistent spike rates at their best amplitudes and sharper intensity tuning with background white noise compared with silent conditions. The previous data indicated that sound intensity analysis by auditory midbrain neurons was adapted to the increased pulse intensity in the same noise condition. This study further examined the echolocation pulse frequency and frequency analysis of auditory midbrain neurons with noise conditions. The data revealed that H. pratti did not shift the resting frequency in the presence of background noise. The auditory midbrain neuronal frequency analysis highly linked to processing the resting frequency with the presence of noise by presenting the constant best frequency (BF), frequency sensitivity, and frequency selectivity. Thus, our results suggested that auditory midbrain neuronal responses in background white noise are adapted to process echolocation pulses in the noise conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Prion diseases are fatal and incurable neurodegenerative disorders affecting both humans and animals. The development of in vitro cellular models from naturally susceptible species such as ruminants can be very useful for the study of prion disease mechanisms and the discovery of potential therapies. Our study shows for the first time how the culture, in the form of three-dimensional spheroids of ovine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow in growth and neurogenic conditions, makes these cells more permissive to prion infection, mimicking the prion toxicity occurring in these diseases. This three-dimensional system appears as a potential in vitro model for studying prion diseases in a microenvironment approaching in vivo conditions. In neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases, cellular in vitro models appear as fundamental tools for the study of pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic compounds. Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell culture systems are the most used cell-based assays, but these platforms are not able to reproduce the microenvironment of in vivo cells. This limitation can be surpassed using three-dimensional (3D) culture systems such as spheroids that more effectively mimic in vivo cell interactions. Herein, we evaluated the effect of scrapie prion infection in monolayer-cultured ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (oBM-MSCs) and oBM-MSC-derived spheroids in growth and neurogenic conditions, analyzing their cell viability and their ability to maintain prion infection. An MTT assay was performed in oBM-MSCs and spheroids subjected to three conditions: inoculated with brain homogenate from scrapie-infected sheep, inoculated with brain homogenate from healthy sheep, and non-inoculated controls. The 3D conditions improved the cell viability in most cases, although in scrapie-infected spheroids in growth conditions, a decrease in cell viability was observed. The levels of pathological prion protein (PrPSc) in scrapie-infected oBM-MSCs and spheroids were measured by ELISA. In neurogenic conditions, monolayer cells and spheroids maintained the levels of PrPSc over time. In growth conditions, however, oBM-MSCs showed decreasing levels of PrPSc throughout time, whereas spheroids were able to maintain stable PrPSc levels. The presence of PrPSc in spheroids was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Altogether, these results show that a 3D culture microenvironment improves the permissiveness of oBM-MSCs to scrapie infection in growth conditions and maintains the infection ability in neurogenic conditions, making this model of potential use for prion studies.

AB  - Predation-risk effects (PEs), i.e. costly consequences of antipredator trait responses in prey, have been the focus of many theoretical and applied studies on predator-prey systems, but we still have limited knowledge on how prey functional traits - such as the ability to acquire and use inadvertent social information (ISI) - influence the susceptibility to strong PEs. In this study, I used an individual-based model to explore how ISI use alters the relative importance of consumptive and predation-risk effects on herbivore prey abundance and total consumption, a proxy for plant damage. I found that ISI use contributed to higher prey abundance by lowering predation-related mortality, but it also decreased prey total consumption through PE irrespective of the relation between prey and predator detection ranges and the type of prey social organisation. Moreover, due to its stronger effect on the non-consumptive component of the total predation effect, ISI use contributed to an overall reduction in prey feeding performance. The estimated strengths of different predator effect components were also comparable to previous experimental findings. These findings provide strong support for the idea that the access to and use of risk-related social information not only result in more prey individuals exhibiting the antipredator response but also leads to strong behavioural PEs with substantial consequences on prey consumption.

AB  - Early life stress (ELS) is associated with an increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, and both neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction seem to be central to mental health. Herein, using an animal model of ELS, a single episode of maternal deprivation (MD, 24 h on pnd 9) extensively documented to elicit behavioural anomalies in male and female Wistar rats, we investigated its consequences in terms of neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampal formation (HCF). MD differentially affected the brain content of cytokines: MD induced a transient increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) in the PFC, as well as in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the HCF. MD also induced a significant decrease mitochondria citrate synthase activity, but MD did not exert significant changes in mitochondria Complex IV activity, revealing a generalized decrease in mitochondrial density without any change in mitochondrial respiration. In the present study, we demonstrate that MD induces neuroinflammatory processes in specific brain regions. Additional research is needed to better understand the temporal pattern of such changes, their impact on the developing brain, and their participation in the already well-known behavioural consequences of MD.

AB  - We studied the humoral innate immune responsiveness (HII), i.e., the hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes by complement proteins, the adaptive humoral (antibody production) immune responsiveness (AHI) to intraperitoneal injection of sheep red blood cells, the morphological and hormonal reproductive characteristics and stress level (blood cortisol) in male Campbell's hamsters kept under long-day (LD; 16D: 8N) and short-day (SD; 8D: 16N) photoperiods. In SD males we found the body mass, anogenital distance, midventral gland size, and level of testosterone in the peripheral blood (but not the cortisol level) decreased after two months of exposure. The results indicate lower HII, but not AHI in SD. Comparison of the SD nonresponders, SD responders, and LD individuals demonstrated a statistically significant increase of HII in SD photosensitive hamsters compared to LD. There was no link between HII and AHI, which indicates an independent photoperiodic responsiveness of different branches of the immune system.

AB  - This study aimed to determine whether the acceleration of conceptus development induced by the administration of exogenous progesterone (P4) during the preimplantation period of pregnancy alters calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D signaling at the maternal-conceptus interface. Suffolk ewes (n = 48) were mated to fertile rams and received daily intramuscular injections of either corn oil (CO) vehicle or 25 mg of progesterone in CO (P4) for the first 8 days of pregnancy and hysterectomized on either Day 9 (CO, n = 5; P4, n = 6), 12 (CO, n = 9; P4, n = 4) or 125 (CO, n = 14; P4, n = 10) of gestation. The expression of S100A12 (P < 0.05) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR2) (P < 0.01) messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was lower in endometria from P4-treated ewes on Day 12. The expression of ADAM10 (P < 0.05) mRNA was greater in endometria from P4-treated ewes on Day 125. The expression of ADAM10 (P < 0.01), FGFR2 (P < 0.05), solute carrier (SLC)20A1 (P < 0.05), TRPV5 (P < 0.05), and TRPV6 (P < 0.01) mRNAs was greater, but KL mRNA expression was lower (P < 0.05) in placentomes from P4-treated ewes at Day 125. There was lower endometrial and greater placentomal expression of mRNAs involved in mineral metabolism and transport in twin compared to singleton pregnancies. Further, the expression of mRNAs involved in mineral metabolism and transport was greater in P4-treated twin placentomes. KL, FGF23, vitamin D receptor (VDR), S100A9, S100A12, S100G, and CYP27B1 proteins were immunolocalized in endometria and placentomes. Exogenous P4 in early pregnancy altered the expression of regulators of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D on Day 125 of pregnancy indicating a novel effect of P4 on mineral transport at the maternal-conceptus interface.
   Exogenous progesterone in early pregnancy affects the expression of regulators of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D in late pregnancy, suggesting previously unappreciated effects on mineral transport at the maternal-conceptus interface of sheep.

AB  - Bats provide an excellent casestudy for studying evolution due to their remarkable flight and echolocation capabilities. In this study, we sought to understand the phenotypic evolution of key traits in Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats) using phylogenetic comparative methods. We aimed to test the phylogenetic signals of traits, and evaluated the best-fit evolutionary models given the data for each trait considering different traits may evolve under different models (i.e., Brownian Motion [BM], Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU], and Early Burst [EB]) and reconstruct ancestral character states. We examined how phenotypic characters are associated with echolocation calls and minimum detectable prey size. We measured 34 traits of 10 Asian rhinolophids species (187 individuals). We found that the majority of traits showed a high phylogenetic signal based on Blomberg ' s K and Pagel ' s lambda, but each trait may evolve under different evolutionary models. Sella traits were shown to evolve under stabilizing selection based on OU models, indicating sella traits have the tendency to move forward along the branches toward some medial value in equilibrium. Our findings highlight the importance of sella characters in association with echolocation call emissions in Rhinolophidae, as calls are important for spatial cognition and also influence dietary preferences. Minimum detectable prey size in Rhinolophidae was associated with call frequency, bandwidth, call duration, wingspan, and wing surface area. Ultimately, understanding trait evolution requires sensitivity due to the differential selective pressures which may apply to different characteristics.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by diffuse pain, often associated with symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive disturbances, and mood disorders. Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, has recently gained attention for its potential benefits beyond glucose regulation. It has shown promise in alleviating neuropathic and inflammatory pain, suggesting that it could offer a novel approach to managing chronic pain conditions like FM. This study aimed to further explore metformin's analgesic potential by evaluating its effects in an experimental FM model induced by reserpine in both male and female mice. After the administration of 200 mg/kg metformin to male and female mice, the FM-related symptoms were assessed, including mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and depressive-like behaviors. A histological examination of the thalamus, hippocampus, and spinal cord was conducted using haematoxylin and eosin staining. The neurotransmitter and proinflammatory cytokines levels were measured in the brains and spinal cords. Our results have shown that metformin treatment for seven days significantly reversed these FM-like symptoms, reducing pain sensitivity and improving mood-related behaviors in both the male and female mice. Additionally, metformin exhibited neuroprotective effects, mitigating reserpine-induced damage in the hippocampus, thalamus, and spinal cord. It also significantly lowered the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-beta (IL-1 beta) in the brain and spinal cord. Notably, metformin modulated the neurotransmitter levels differently between the sexes, decreasing glutamate and increasing serotonin and norepinephrine in the male mice, but not in the females. These findings underscore metformin's potential as an alternative therapy for FM, with sex-specific differences suggesting distinct mechanisms of action.

AB  - Simple Summary Prediction equations allow small farmers who do not have a scale to estimate the live weight of animals from their body measurements. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology and estimate the live weight from body measurements of Socorro Island Merino lambs. A group of Socorro Island Merino lambs was recorded from birth to year for live weight, rump width, rump length, withers height, body length, cannon bone perimeter, and chest girth, width, and depth. Sex and crossbreeding with hair breeds affected weight and mainly thoracic morphology at birth and at the year of Socorro Island Merino lambs, with the greatest and smaller weights and body measurements being observed in crossbreed males and purebred females, respectively. The highly significant and positive correlation between LW and CG suggests that this variable can be used as the sole predictor in exponential and linear models and in combination with other measurements in multiple linear models to provide a good estimate of LW. Chest measurements could be used as an indirect selection criterion to improve growth traits in this breed. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology and estimate live weight from body measurements of Socorro Island Merino lambs. A group of Socorro Island Merino lambs was recorded from birth to year for live weight, rump width, rump length, withers height, body length, cannon bone perimeter, and chest girth, width, and depth. The effect of the lamb type on body measurements and live weight was analyzed using ANOVA, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to estimate the relationship between body measurements and live weight, multiple linear regressions were fitted to obtain prediction equations of live weight from the body measurements and finally, chest girth was used to generate prediction equations using linear and exponential models. At birth and at year, differences were observed in body measurements, especially those related to the thoracic region, with crossbred males showing the highest values. Live weight was correlated with almost all the body measurements, with the highest coefficients observed with chest girth, chest width, and chest depth. Live weight can be accurately predicted from multiple regression equations using several body measurements, but using only chest girth (CG) as a predictor, the exponential equation W0-365 = 0.9142 exp((0.0462 CG)) showed the best accuracy.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS), considered as separate branch of the autonomic nervous system, is located throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract as a series of interconnected ganglionic plexuses. Recently, the ENS is getting more in the focus of gastrointestinal research. For years, the main interest and research was aimed to the enteric neurons and their functional properties in normal conditions, less attention has been paid to the germ-free animals. Germ-free (GF) piglets have clear microbiological background and are reared in sterile environment. GF piglets are regarded as clinically relevant models for studying of human diseases, as these piglets' manifest similar clinical symptoms to humans. In this study we briefly summarised the main characteristics in immunohistochemical distribution of ENS elements in the wall of jejunum and colon of germ-free piglets.

AB  - Cryoinjury and protein changes are a consequence of cryopreservation and may have a negative impact on sperm quality regarding motility, viability and fertilizing ability. However, potential proteomic changes in rabbit semen throughout the cryopreservation process have never been previously investigated. The aim of the present study was to compare the whole proteome of fresh and cryopreserved rabbit semen (spermatozoa and extracellular fluid), to examine the effects of freeze-thawing on proteins changes in semen. Comparative analysis and identification of proteins was carried out using 2dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Proteomic raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD034832 for spermatozoa and PXD034853 for extracellular fluid. Respectively, 107 and 28 proteins differed in abundance in spermatozoa and extracellular fluid between fresh and frozen groups. Most of these proteins were involved in pathways related to energy metabolism and protein quality control under stress conditions, reproductive processes and mechanisms of cell death/survival regulation, resulting in a significant decrease of motility and viability of post-thawing rabbit sperm and its potential fertilizing ability. These results broaden the understanding of the effects of cryopreservation on rabbit semen and represent a new starting point for the development of improved freezing procedures.

AB  - Subpopulations of neurons display increased activity during memory encoding and manipulating the activity of these neurons can induce artificial formation or erasure of memories. Thus, these neurons are thought to be cellular engrams. Moreover, correlated activity between pre- and postsynaptic engram neurons is thought to lead to strengthening of their synaptic connections, thus increasing the probability of neural activity patterns occurring during encoding to reoccur at recall. Therefore, synapses between engram neurons can also be considered as a substrate of memory, or a synaptic engram. One can label synaptic engrams by targeting two complementary, non-fluorescent, synapse-targeted GFP fragments separately to the pre- and postsynaptic compartment of engram neurons; the two GFP fragments reconstitute a fluorescent GFP at the synaptic cleft between the engram neurons, thereby highlighting synaptic engrams. In this work we explored a transsynaptic GFP reconstitution system (mGRASP) to label synaptic engrams between hippocampal CA1 and CA3 engram neurons identified by different Immediate-Early Genes: cFos and Arc. We characterized the expression of the cellular and synaptic labels of the mGRASP system upon exposure to a novel environment or learning of a hippocampal-dependent memory task. We found that mGRASP under the control of transgenic ArcCre(ERT2) labeled synaptic engrams more efficiently than when controlled by viral cFostTA, possibly due to differences in the genetic systems rather than the specific IEG promoters.

AB  - Cisplatin (cis-diclorodiamminoplatin, CDDP) is a common chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors, but its use is limited by severe side effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Variability in CDDP dosing and administration, along with high mortality and sensitivity in animal models, complicates experimental approaches. This study aimed to evaluate ototoxic damage in rats by comparing a single bolus versus three divided CDDP injections, also considering nephrotoxic effects. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: eight received a single intraperitoneal injection of CDDP (14 mg/kg), eight received three injections (4.6 mg/kg/day), and eight were untreated controls. All CDDP-treated rats showed significant high-frequency hearing loss and morphological damage, including cochlear outer hair cell loss and renal glomerular atrophy with proximal tubule necrosis. Oxidative stress markers (nitrotyrosine and SOD1 expression) confirmed cochlear and renal alterations. Notably, the single bolus group had a 25% mortality rate and significant weight loss among survivors, unlike the other groups. This study introduces the novel finding that cumulative administration of three doses reduces mortality and weight loss while maintaining similar ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. Therefore, cumulative administration is recommended for future studies to mitigate ototoxic and nephrotoxic damage, offering a potentially improved protocol for the administration of cisplatin.

AB  - Stress is hypothesized to be one of the primary abiotic factors that influence the structuring of food webs. Drought and salinity stresses are the most serious induced problems of agriculture due to climatic changes. Considering the global warming and drying of Urmia salt lake in northwestern Iran which can result in salinization of agricultural lands nearby, the focus of this study is to examine the effects of the two above-mentioned stresses on a host plant (Medicago sativa L.) and its pest (Tetranychus urticae Koch) performance. Two levels of water deficit (kept dry for 5 and 10 days and received 50% and 25% of field capacity respectively) and three levels of salinity (100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl) were added to alfalfa plants as stress factors and the following characteristics were measured before and after herbivore infestation: relative water, chlorophyll, carotenoid, protein, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 contents of leaves and catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) enzyme activities. The life table parameters of two-spotted spider mite reared on stressed plants were measured and compared with control. We found that drought and salinity stresses led to a decrease of alfalfa plant growth. Morphological and physiological changes included a decrease of relative water, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and an increase of protein, proline, MDA and H2O2 contents and APX enzyme activity. The net reproductive rate (R0), mean generation time (T), intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) were significantly higher for mites grown on control host plants compared to mites grown on stressed ones and were 25.66 offspring/ individual/generation time, 16.38 d, 0.1971 day-1 and 1.2180 day-1 respectively. These parameters reduced significantly in mites grown on stressed host plants; the significant lowest values were recorded for mites grown on host plants subjected to high salinity (300 mM) and were 0.5 offspring/individual/generation time, 14.47 d, -0.0514 day-1 and 0.9502 day-1 respectively. In terms of this experiment, the water stress had a stronger influence on the morphological and physiological characteristics of alfalfa plant compared to spider mite infestation.

AB  - Simple Summary Our study represents an innovative attempt to describe fetal skeleton development during the first part of gestation in sheep using ultrasonography associated with a differential staining technique that allows the observation of the first ossification processes. The timing of ossification and the growth rate of skeletal components are very important to assess normal prenatal growth. This knowledge may be useful for gestational management and early diagnosis of skeletal diseases, especially in the early period of pregnancy when bone growth is very fast in the ovine species. Increased knowledge of the developmental processes during gestation could provide valuable information on potential alterations in embryonic/fetal development. We examined the development of ovine conceptus between the 20th and 70th day of gestation with three convergent analyses: (1) uterus ultrasound examination and measurement (eco) of crown-rump length (CRL) and biparietal diameter (BPD) of the conceptus; (2) direct measurement (vivo) of CRL and BPD of the conceptus outside the uterus (3) osteo-cartilage dynamics during development by differential staining. No significant differences were observed between eco and vivo measurements for CRL and BPD in all examined concepti. CRL and BPD, instead, showed a significant positive linear correlation with gestational age. The study of osteogenesis dynamics has demonstrated a completely cartilaginous ovine fetus at up to 35 days of gestation. The ossification begins in the skull (40th day) and is almost complete between the 65th and the 70th of pregnancy. Our study highlighted that CRL and BPD are accurate parameters for gestational age estimation in the first part of sheep pregnancy and provides an overview of osteochondral temporal dynamics. Furthermore, tibia ossification is a valid parameter to estimate fetal age by ultrasound.

AB  - As relatively new members of the non-coding RNA family, circRNAs play important roles in a variety of biological processes. However, the temporal expression pattern and the function of circRNAs during sheep skeletal muscle development remains unclear. This study aimed to identify circRNAs related to sheep skeletal muscle development and explore their roles in myoblast proliferation. The circRNA expression profiles of longissimus dorsi of sheep from F90, L30, and A3Y were obtained by the RNA-seq method. The function and mechanisms of the novel circCHRNG in muscle satellite cell proliferation were explored using CCK-8 assay, Western blot, qPCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. We identified 12,375 circRNAs, including 476, 133, and 233 DEcircRNAs found among three comparative groups. KEGG results showed that DEcircRNAs were enriched in muscle contraction, the regulation of cell proliferation, and the AMPK, insulin, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Notably, a novel circRNA, termed circRNA CHRNG, acts as a miR-133 sponge to promote skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation. Our study provides a systematic description of circRNAs of ovine skeletal muscle across fetal, lamb, and adult stages. GO and KEGG analyses showed that DEcircRNAs were enriched in multiple pathways associated with muscle development, such as the PI3K-Akt and AMPK signaling pathways. In addition, we propose that circCHRNG acts as a miR-133 sponge to upregulate the expression levels of SRF and MEF2A, thereby promoting myoblast proliferation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mulberry leaf (Folium Mori) is a dried leaf of the dicotyledonous mulberry tree and is a homologous food and medicine. Treating insomnia with it is a common practice in traditional Chinese medicine. But still, its potential sleep-improving mechanism remains to be elucidated. Aim of review: Potential bioactive components and mechanisms of the sleep-improving effect of purified flavone from mulberry leaves (MLF) were explored through in vivo experiments, network pharmacology analysis, and molecular experimental validation. Materials and methods: The mice model was established by pentobarbital sodium induction to evaluate the sleepimproving effect of MLF. The MLF's chemical composition was identified through a liquid chromatograph quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF LC/MS) to elucidate its sleep-improving active ingredient. At last, the underlying mechanism of MLF's sleep-improving effect was elucidated through neurotransmitter detection (ELISA), network pharmacology analysis, and molecular experimental validation (quantitative realtime PCR and western blotting). Results: MLF could dramatically reduce sleep latency by 35%, prolong sleep duration by 123%, and increase the sleep rate of mice through increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin (5-HT) release in serum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Q-TOF LC/MS identified 17 flavonoid components in MLF. Network pharmacological analysis suggested that the key sleep-improving active ingredients in MLF might be quercetin, kaempferol, morin, and delphinidin. The key path for MLF to improve sleep might be the tryptophan metabolism and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and the key targets might be gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit alpha2 Gene (GABRA2) and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors. Conclusions: MLF has shown significant sleep-improving effects in mice and may take effect through regulating the GABA and 5-HT receptors.

AB  - The most prevalent type of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a compelling illustration of the link between cognitive deficits and neurophysiological anomalies. We investigated the possible protective effect of intranasal insulin intake with exercise on amyloid-beta (A beta)-induced neuronal damage. The level of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were analyzed to understand the involvement of BDNF-TrkB pathway in this modulation. In this study, we induced AD-like pathology by amyloid-beta (A beta) administration. Then, we examined the impact of a 4-week pretreatment of moderate treadmill exercise and intranasal intake of insulin on working and spatial memory in male Wistar rats. We also analyzed the mechanisms of improved memory and anxiety through changes in the protein level of BDNF and TrkB. Results showed that animals received A beta had impaired working memory, increased anxiety which were accompanied by lower protein levels of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus. The exercise training and intranasal insulin improved working memory deficits, decreased anxiety, and increased BDNF, and TrkB levels in the hippocampus of animals received A beta. Our finding of improved memory performance after intranasal intake of insulin and exercise may be of significance for the treatment of memory impairments and anxiety-like behavior in AD.

AB  - D-galactose (D-gal) is broadly used in animal aging studies as its chronic administration mimics learning and memory impairments related to aging in humans. However, within the few studies that utilize chronic oral D-gal intake, none of them is focused on alteration in synaptic structure and function. We examined the effects of 6weeks oral D-gal intake (200 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, dissolved in tap water) on age-related changes, with emphasis on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP) of adult male Wistar rats. Memory assessment was followed by histological examination of the PFC and HIP (Nissl staining and Iba-1 immunostaining), while in crude synaptosomal fractions the state of oxidative stress and the expression of proteins involved in glutamatergic signaling was determined. Although applied dosages compromised memory, alterations such as impaired sensory-motor function and aberrant morphology were not detected. In the PFC, analysis of microglia revealed reduction of branching pattern following D-gal intake, in parallel with increased oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and disturbed pro-oxidant antioxidant balance. These changes in the PFC were further accompanied with decreased levels of vesicular glutamate transporter 1, syntaxin-1 and NMDA receptor 2B subunit in both treated groups. Simultaneously, the increased hippocampal oxidative damage of lipids was detected. Results indicate successful provocation of age-related changes following oral D-gal intake, and suggest greater sensitivity of the PFC to D-gal treatment than HIP.

AB  - Pair bonding in humans and other socially monogamous species can have positive effects on health and wellbeing. These attachments also come with the potential for challenges such as separation, jealousy, or grief. Much of the work on the neurobiology of pair bonding in non-human primates has been carried out in coppery titi monkeys (Plecturocebus cupreus), a monogamous South American monkey, although these studies have been primarily in males. In the current study, we utilized female titi monkeys to experimentally examine responses to their monogamous male partner vs. a male stranger or being alone. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed on eight adult female titi monkeys from well-established pairs. We used a within-subjects design in which each female underwent three different conditions after the fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) injection: a) the subject was reunited with her partner, b) encountered a stranger, or c) was alone in the experimental cage. Behavioural observations were recorded, and plasma assayed for cortisol. Females housed alone showed higher cortisol compared with either the partner or stranger conditions. FDG uptake was higher in the amygdala and hippocampus when interacting with the stranger than the partner. Proximity modulated the relationship between social condition and FDG uptake in several areas. Females entered into mutual proximity more frequently with the partner than with the stranger. Female titi monkeys have different physiological, neural, and behavioural reactions to being with their partner, a stranger male, or being alone.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of reducing the sodium chloride content in in vitro growth (IVG) medium to 61.6mM on in vitro maturation (IVM) and embryonic development of pig oocytes derived from small antral follicles (SAF) less than 3mm in diameter. SAF oocytes were cultured for 2 days to induce IVG in alpha-minimal essential medium with 108mM NaCl (alpha MEM-108) or porcine zygote medium (PZM) containing 61.6mM (PZM-61.6) or 108mM (PZM-108) NaCl. These media were further supplemented with 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After IVG culture, oocytes were matured for 44 h in our standard IVM medium. The IVG culture in PZM-61.6 significantly increased nuclear maturation (88.0 +/- 2.2%) of SAF oocytes compared to that in PZM-108 (77.3 +/- 3.9%) or alpha MEM-108 (75.9 +/- 3.8%). After parthenogenesis (PA), the proportions of blastocysts, based on the number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes, induced for PA were not different among IVG oocytes cultured in PZM-61.6 (50.2 +/- 3.0%), PZM-108 (46.8 +/- 2.9%), or alpha MEM-108 (45.6 +/- 2.9%). The IVM oocytes derived from IVG in PZM-61.6 showed increased perivitelline space (PVS) (12.1 +/- 0.6 mm) and intra-oocyte glutathione (GSH) content (1.19 +/- 0.04 pixels/oocyte) compared to PVS (8.0 +/- 0.5 and 7.4 +/- 0.4 mm) and GSH (1.03 +/- 0.04 and 1.00 +/- 0.04 pixels/oocyte) of oocytes derived from PZM-108 and alpha MEM-108, respectively. The IVG culture in PZM-61.6 stimulated meiotic resumption after IVG and faster nuclear progression after IVM than that in alpha MEM-108. After somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the blastocyst formation of SAF oocytes grown in PZM-61.6 (17.8 +/- 3.3%) was higher than that of oocytes grown in PZM-108 (7.5 +/- 2.7%) but not different from that of oocytes in alpha MEM-108 (11.4 +/- 3.4%). Regardless of the different osmotic pressures, nuclear maturation was significantly increased by IVG culture in PZM with reduced NaCl (86.8 +/- 2.3 and 84.9 +/- 4.2% in PZM-61.6 and PZM-61.6 with sorbitol, respectively) than in PZM-108 (70.5 +/- 3.4%). Blastocyst formation was not affected by the differences in NaCl content and osmotic pressure of the IVG medium, whereas the mean number of cells in blastocysts was significantly higher following IVG culture in PZM-61.6 than in the other groups. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that, following SCNT in pigs, IVG culture of SAF oocytes in a medium with a reduced NaCl concentration stimulates oocyte maturation and improves subsequent embryonic development.

AB  - General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness accompanied by transient amnesia. Yet, long-term memory impairment is an undesirable side effect. How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus, a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood. Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging, and behavioral analysis, we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF), and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity, decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered spine dynamics. CA1 network activity under all 3 anesthetics was different to natural sleep. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled unperturbed activity during wakefulness and sleep, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.

AB  - Simple Summary Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is widely used to predict the nutritional value of raw materials and complete feeds in feed mills. Recently, faecal NIRS was proposed as a fast and cheap method to predict nutrient digestibility to partially replace in vivo digestibility trials. Previous studies used freeze-dried ground (FDG) faeces via NIRS, but the use of not ground (FDNG) faeces could save time and workload. The objective of the present study was to compare the results obtained with NIRS using faecal samples in two forms, FDNG and FDG, to predict faecal chemical composition and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) coefficients. Faecal samples were collected from grower-finisher pigs at pen level, freeze-dried, and analysed via NIRS as FDNG and FDG faeces. NIRS calibrations were developed and successfully predicted faecal chemical components and ATTD coefficients of nutrients for both FDNG and FDG faeces. Thus, faecal NIRS is a potential tool to evaluate faeces' chemical components and ATTD coefficients of nutrients, and those are successfully predicted using FDNG faeces, saving analysis time and workload. The present study aimed to compare NIRS results using freeze-dried ground or not ground (FDG or FDNG) faeces to predict faecal chemical composition and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) coefficients. Two different batches of pigs were used (n = 20 mixed sex pens/batch; 11 pigs/pen; Duroc x (Large White x Landrace)). The first batch of pigs (B1; 50.1 & PLUSMN; 3.44 kg body weight (BW)) was used at 13 wks of age and the second batch (B2; 87.0 & PLUSMN; 4.10 kg BW) was used at 18 wks of age. For both B1 and B2, pens were assigned to five diets formulated to obtain a control [10.03 MJ of net energy (NE), 160.0 g of crude protein (CP), and 9.5 g of standardized ileal digestive (SID) lysine (Lys) per kg of feed], low protein (132.0 g CP and 7.5 g SID Lys), high protein (188.0 g CP and 11.5 g SID Lys), low energy (9.61 MJ NE/kg), and high energy (10.45 MJ NE/kg) diets. After a 10-day adaptation period, one faecal sample was collected daily from each pen floor during 6 days in both B1 and B2 (n = 120/batch). Faecal samples were freeze-dried and analysed via NIRS as FDNG and FDG faeces. Dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), CP, gross energy (GE), fat, and ATTD coefficients were analysed/calculated. The NIRS calibrations were evaluated by cross-validation, splitting the data in four random groups, or using the leave-one-out method. For both FDNG and FDG faeces, coefficients of determination for calibration (R-cv(2)) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) values were: close to 0.9 and 3 for DM and CP, 0.7-0.8 and & GE;2 for OM and GE, 0.6 and <2 for fat, and 0.54-0.75 and & LE;2 for ATTD coefficients, respectively. CP was better predicted using FDG faeces (p < 0.05), while DM and OM ATTD were better predicted using FDNG faeces (p < 0.05). In conclusion, NIRS successfully predicts faeces' chemical components and ATTD coefficients of nutrients using FDNG or FDG faeces.

AB  - The effect of antifreeze protein (AFP) as a cryoprotectant used in different concentrations of glycerol on post-thaw quality of epididymal sperm was investigated. Sperm were isolated from 50 testicles, obtained from 25 healthy mature goat bucks, with progressive motility >80%, and total morphological abnormalities <10% were pooled in each replication. The semen samples were diluted with Tris-citrate-fructose-soybean lecithin extender containing different concentration of AFP [0 mu g/mL (A0), 5 mu g/mL (A5), 10 mu g/mL (A10)]. Each concentration of AFP was added in an extender containing either 7% (G7) or 5% (G5) glycerol. Post-thaw total and progressive motility were found to be higher (p < 0.05) in groups A5G5 and A5G7. Plasma membrane integrity, sperm acrosome integrity, DNA integrity, acrosome intact sperm, and mitochondrial membrane potential were found to be higher (p < 0.05) in groups A5G5 and A10G5. Sperm viability was found to be higher (p < 0.05) in group A5G5, while lipid peroxidation was recorded lower (p < 0.05) in groups A5G5 and A5G7. Regarding the apoptosis occurrence, the results demonstrate higher (p < 0.05) live post-thawed spermatozoa for groups containing 5 mu g/mL AFP with 5% and 7% glycerol in addition to the lowest (p < 0.05) value for groups containing 0 mu g/mL AFP with 5% and 7% glycerol. Based on these results, the present study concludes that the addition of 5 mu g/mL AFP in combination with 5% glycerol in freezing extender improves the post-thaw quality, structure, and function parameters for buck spermatozoa.

AB  - The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) with fertilisers holds the potential to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and optimise nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). However, this potential of NIs needs to be quantified across diverse field conditions to comprehensively assess the influence of management practices, crop types, fertilisation strategies, climatic conditions, annual variations, and soil types. In 2020, a field experiment was conducted using spring barley, followed by a similar experiment with winter wheat in 2021, aimed at studying N2O mitigation, crop nitrogen uptake and crop yield effects of three additives containing commercially available NIs: 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), nitrapyrin (NP), and a mixture of 1,2,4-triazole and 3-metylpyrazole (TM) together with synthetic (ammonium sulphate nitrate (NS), urea ammonium nitrate (UAN)) and organic (pig slurry (PS)) fertilisers. DMPP was applied with NS and PS, while NP and TM were applied with UAN and PS. Fertilisers were applied during early spring in both years, following the recommended optimal rate of synthetic fertiliser and PS. Control treatments included fertilisers applied at the same rate without NIs and no fertiliser. N2O fluxes were assessed throughout the growing seasons of both years utilising manual static flux chambers. The study found that N2O emissions were significantly reduced from PS with DMPP (by 77 %) and TM (by 67 %), and that DMPP significantly reduced N2O emissions from NS (by 60 %) in 2021. Crop yield and N uptake were increased with NIs in both years. These findings suggest that DMPP and TM effectively reduce N2O emissions from both PS and synthetic N sources. Notably, the mitigation effects were more pronounced in PS compared to synthetic N. Nonetheless, the efficiency of N2O reduction through these nitrification inhibitors varied depending on crop type and specific management conditions.

AB  - Histone lysine lactylation (Kla) is a novel epigenetic modification that plays a crucial role in cellular processes driven by glycolysis and lactate production. However, the mechanisms of histone lactylation and its interaction with m6A RNA methylation during early embryonic development remain underexplored. This study systematically investigated the effects of oxygen levels-atmospheric oxygen (atmosO2; 20% O2) and physiological oxygen (physO2; 5% O2)-on hallmark events during early embryonic development, revealing that lactylation modification regulates early goat embryonic development through the m6A methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3). We observed that physO2 conditions significantly promote embryonic development, with higher expression levels of METTL3, global histone lactylation, and histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) compared to atmosO2 exposure. Furthermore, the addition of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors led to a decrease in global lactylation, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in METTL3 expression. Sequencing analysis of the METTL3 knockdown embryo revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were primarily enriched in the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, RNA degradation, and RNA polymerase pathways. These findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of histone lactylation during early embryonic development in livestock, highlighting potential molecular targets and strategies to enhance mammalian in vitro embryo production techniques.

AB  - Birds can bioaccumulate persistent contaminants, and maternal transfer to eggs may expose embryos to concentrations sufficient to cause adverse effects during sensitive early-life stages. However, using tissue residue concentrations alone to infer whether contaminant effects are occurring suffers from uncertainty, and efficient, sensitive biomarkers remain limited in wildlife. We studied relationships between whole embryo contaminant concentrations (total mercury, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances, polychlorinated biphenyls, and halogenated flame retardants) together with mRNA expression in embryonic liver tissue from a Pacific Ocean seabird, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). Fresh eggs were collected, incubated under controlled conditions, and from the pre-hatch embryo, hepatic RNA was extracted for qPCR array analysis to measure gene expression (2- Delta Cq), while the remaining embryo was analyzed for contaminant residues. Contaminant and gene expression data were assessed with a combination of multivariate approaches and linear models. Results indicated correlations between embryonic total mercury and several genes such as sepp1, which encodes selenoprotein P. Correlation between the biotransformation gene cyp1a4 and the C7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid PFHpA was also evident. This study demonstrates that egg collection from free-living populations for contaminant biomonitoring programs can relate chemical residues to in ovo mRNA gene expression effects in embryo hepatic tissue.

AB  - The problem of membrane fouling is a key factor restricting the application of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) in the partial nitrosation (PN) and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) processes. In this study, the pilot-scale continuous flow MBR was used to start up the partial nitrosation process in order to investigate the change trend of mid-transmembrane pressure (TMP) in the process of start-up, which was further explored to clarify the membrane fouling mechanism in the pilot-scale reactor. The results showed that the MBR system was in a stable operating condition during the partial nitrosation operation and that the online automatic backwash operation mode is beneficial in alleviating membrane fouling and reducing the cost of membrane washing. Particular attention was paid to the influence trend of free ammonia (FA)on membrane fouling, and it was found that the increase in FA concentration plays the most critical role in membrane fouling. The increase in FA concentration led to an increase in the extracellular polymer (EPS), dissolved microorganism product (SMP) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) concentration. FA was extremely significantly correlated with EPS and SCOD, and the FA concentration was approximately 20.7 mg/L. The SCODeff (effluent SCOD concentration) concentration was approximately 147 mg/L higher than the SCODinf (influent SCOD concentration) concentration. FA mainly affects membrane fouling by affecting the concentration of EPS and SCOD.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) has enthralled both consumers and researchers, due to its taste, aroma and its medicinal attributes. Tea consumers concern themselves with the quality of tea in particular, its taste and aroma based on which consumers are willing to pay premium prices for the best quality teas. The quality of tea is undeniably affected by variations in its metabolite composition. In this study, two groups of black tea cultivars were compared using a metabolomics approach. Data were generated via GC-MS and H-1-NMR. The GC-MS differentiated between the two groups, based on carbohydrates. The H-1-NMR differentiated between the two groups, based on caffeine, catechins and amino acids. These metabolites applicability in the discrimination of newly developed cultivars into potentially commercialisable and non-commercialisable groups at an early stage in the tea improvement programme is demonstrated. This may help tea breeders to select promising high quality tea cultivars either for release or further field evaluations.

AB  - Tick-borne haemoparasites, including piroplasms and trypanosomes, are almost ubiquitous in Australian wildlife, with some associated with health impacts to individual animals and declining wildlife populations. An array of ecologically distinct piroplasm and trypanosome species occur throughout Australia although many of these species and their sylvatic ecologies are poorly characterised. Between May 2022 and October 2023, an anecdotally reported localised eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) morbidity/mortality event occurred in coastal southern New South Wales, Australia, characterised by animals presenting with blindness, emaciation, lethargy, ataxia, and astasia. Here we used molecular techniques to identify tick-borne piroplasms (Babesia and Theileria) and trypanosomes in affected animals. Blood (n = 89) and liver (n = 19) samples were collected after the humane euthanasia of wild animals due to welfare concerns, and brief notes on the animal's health were recorded. In total, 20 (22.5%) animals were infected with tick-borne haemoparasites, including a novel Theileria sp. nov. (14, 15.7%), Babesia macropus (2, 2.2%), Trypanosoma gilletti (5, 5.6%), and Trypanosoma vegrandis (1, 1.1%). Liver samples were also screened for Wallal and Warego viruses due to animals' blindness, but were negative. This is the first report of T. gilletti and T. vegrandis in eastern grey kangaroos, although they have been previously reported in high numbers in ticks which commonly parasites this host. The novel Theileria sp. was previously reported in questing Ixodes holocyclus and in ticks from an opportunistically collected eastern grey kangaroo and red-necked wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus). However, we show for the first time this Theileria sp. can occur widely in eastern grey kangaroos. Ultimately, this small study did not intend, and is not able to draw inference regarding the pathogenicity of these haemoparasites to eastern grey kangaroos and it is likely that other factors, such as chronic Phalaris grass toxicity, had a role in this localised mortality/morbidity event.

AB  - Females show greater benefits of exercise on cognition in both humans and rodents, which may be related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the Val66Met poly-morphism, within the human BDNF gene, causes impaired activity-dependent secretion of neuronal BDNF and impairments to some forms of memory. We evaluated whether sex and BDNF genotype (Val66Met polymorphism (Met/Met) versus wild-type (Val/Val)) influenced the ability of voluntary running to enhance cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Middle-aged C57BL/6J (13 months) mice were randomly assigned to either a control or an aerobic training (AT) group (running disk access). Mice were trained on the visual discrimination and reversal paradigm in a touchscreen-based technology to evaluate cognitive flexibility. BDNF Met/Met mice had fewer correct responses compared to BDNF Val/Val mice on both cognitive tasks. Female BDNF Val/Val mice showed greater cognitive flexibility compared to male mice regardless of AT. Despite running less than BDNF Val/Val mice, AT improved performance in both cognitive tasks in BDNF Met/Met mice. AT increased neuro-genesis in the ventral hippocampus of BDNF Val/Val mice of both sexes and increased the proportion of mature type 3 doublecortin-expressing cells in the dorsal hippocampus of female mice only. Our results indicate AT improved cognitive performance in BDNF Met/Met mice and increased hippocampal neurogenesis in BDNF Val/ Val mice in middle age. Furthermore, middle-aged female mice may benefit more from AT than males in terms of neuroplasticity, an effect that was influenced by the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism.

AB  - The development of small-diameter vascular grafts requires testing in large animal models before advancing to clinical trials. Vascular graft interposition implantation in sheep carotid arteries (CAs) is the most widely used model, but ovine CAs are prone to severe spasm following surgical manipulation, potentially impairing graft performance assessment. There is paucity in the literature on reducing sheep CA spasm using effective vasodilator therapeutic protocols. In this study, four healthy Merino cross White Suffolk wethers (1-2 years, 52.1 +/- 0.8 kg) underwent CT angiography and CA graft surgery. CT angiography using iodinated contrast agent was performed with innominate artery access through the CA or ascending aortic arch access through the femoral artery. Sheep then underwent right CA sham surgery or left CA vascular graft implantation. A variety of vasodilators, including papaverine, sodium nitroprusside, verapamil, and their combination, were tested for preventing or treating CA spasms intraoperatively. Blood flow was reassessed immediately after CA surgery using CT angiography. The results showed that innominate artery access through the CA for CT angiography in sheep induced presurgical CA spasm with reduced arterial flow. Conversely, ascending aortic arch access through the femoral artery for CT angiography did not cause CA spasm and maintained arterial flow. During CA graft surgery, surgical trauma induced CA spasm, which was prevented by localized intra-arterial administration of vasodilators papaverine hydrochloride and verapamil before significant surgical manipulation.
   Impact Statement With the increasing use of novel biomaterials for vascular graft development, consistent and accurate testing in large animal models is extremely important for clinical translation. Our study provides a clear implantation method for such testing with the ability to detect and prevent vasospasm and its related false-negative graft performance. We believe that our findings will significantly contribute to the advancement of preclinical testing methods for vascular grafts, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in the treatment of occlusive artery diseases.

AB  - Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by abnormal or synchronous brain activity causing seizures, which may produce convulsions, minor physical signs, or a combination of symptoms. These disorders affect approximately 65 million people worldwide, from all ages and genders. Seizures apart, epileptic patients present a high risk to develop neuropsychological comorbidities such as cognitive deficits, emotional disturbance, and psychiatric disorders, which severely impair quality of life. Currently, the treatment for epilepsy includes the administration of drugs or surgery, but about 30% of the patients treated with antiepileptic drugs develop time-dependent pharmacoresistence. Therefore, further investigation about epilepsy and its causes is needed to find new pharmacological targets and innovative therapeutic strategies. Pharmacoresistance is associated to changes in neuronal plasticity and alterations of GABA(A) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. The downregulation of GABA inhibitory activity may arise from a positive shift in GABA(A) receptor reversal potential, due to an alteration in chloride homeostasis. In this paper, we review the contribution of K+-Cl--cotransporter (KCC2) to the alterations in the Cl- gradient observed in epileptic condition, and how these alterations are coupled to the increase in the excitability.

AB  - Colleterial glands of female insects are accessory glands responsible for producing secretions associated with egg-laying. Within Dictyoptera, they synthesize compounds of the ootheca. However, their morphology and role in termites are poorly understood. Here, we compared the morphology, development, and secretory activity of the colleterial glands between non- and egg-laying females of the pest termite Coptotermes gestroi under light and transmission electron microscopy. We also provide the first description of these glands for Rhinotermitidae. The glands are paired, divided into anterior and posterior units, which join in a common duct via basal trunks. They are highly developed within egg-laying females, especially the posterior gland, secreting glycoproteins to lubricate the genital chamber and/or stick the eggs together. Ultrastructure revealed glandular epithelia composed of bicellular units of Class 3, whose secretory activity varied between groups and units. Posterior gland of egg-laying females showed richness of mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory vesicles, including electron-dense secretory granules, indicating synthesis and transport of contents, especially proteins. The basal trunks were enfolded by muscles, supporting their role in conducting secretion. Morphophysiological modifications occur in the colleterial glands as females mature and lay eggs, and the mechanisms underlying the secretory cycle of the glands are discussed.

AB  - Environmental enrichment (EE) is a paradigm that offers the animal a plethora of stimuli, including physical, cognitive, sensory, and social enrichment. Exposure to EE can modulate both anxiety responses and plasma corticosterone. In this study, our objective was to explore how chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) impacts anxiety -related behaviors in male Swiss mice raised in EE conditions. Additionally, we investigated corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels to assess the involvement of the hypothalamic -pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in mediating these responses. Mice were housed under either EE or standard housing conditions for 21 days. Afterward, they were exposed to 11 days of CUS while still reared in their distinct housing conditions, with half of the mice receiving daily pretreatment with the vehicle and the other half receiving daily metyrapone (MET) injections, an inhibitor of steroid synthesis, 30 mins before CUS exposure. Blood samples were obtained to assess plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels. The 11 -day CUS protocol induced anxiety -like phenotype and elevated ACTH levels in EE mice. Chronic MET pretreatment prevented anxiety -like behavior in the EE-CUS groups, by mechanisms involving increased plasma corticosterone levels and decreased ACTH. These results suggest a role of the HPA axis in the mechanism underlying the anxiogenic phenotype induced by CUS in EE mice and shed light on the complex interplay between environmental factors, stress, and the HPA axis in anxiety regulation.

AB  - Simple Summary Lactose is a kind of carbohydrate that exists in mammal milk. It has some physiological functions, such as providing energy, regulating gut microbiota, and affecting immunity. Rotavirus (RV) is the main pathogen that induces severe diarrhea in piglets, which impairs their growth and development. In this study, we investigated whether different levels (4% and 6%) of dietary lactose supplementation alleviates RV-induced diarrhea in weaned piglets. The results showed that lactose administration relieved the negative effect of RV on growth, which was derived from the improvement of nutrient utilization, gut barrier function, and immunity. Moreover, supplementing 6% lactose in the diets had a tendency to alleviate diarrhea in RV-infected piglets. Thus, we suggest that the diet of weaned piglets should be supplemented with more than 4% lactose (especially in the early period of weaning) if the cost of feed can be afforded. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dietary lactose supplementation relieves rotavirus (RV)-induced diarrhea and gut dysfunction. Thirty-six crossbred weaned piglets were randomly allocated into three groups and fed diets containing 0, 4%, and 6% lactose for 20 days. On Day 15, half of the piglets in each group were orally infused with RV. RV infection impaired growth performance; induced severe diarrhea; decreased serum D-xylose concentration and morphology and sIgA level of jejunal mucosa; downregulated MUC1, MUC2, occludin, Bcl-2, IL-4, pBD3, pBD2, and pBD1 mRNA expression of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes; upregulated Bax, caspase-3, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IFN-beta mRNA expression of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes; and damaged microbiota and metabolites of cecal digesta in weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Dietary lactose supplementation improved nutrient digestibility and growth performance and relieved the negative influence of RV challenge on intestinal barrier function, mRNA expression of cytokines, and host defense peptides of jejunal mucosa and/or mesenteric lymph nodes in weaned piglets (p < 0.05). Dietary administration of 6% lactose tended to relieve diarrhea (p = 0.07). These results suggest that lactose in feed increases growth performance and has a tendency to alleviate RV-induced diarrhea, derived from the improvement of nutrient utilization, gut barrier function, and immunity.

AB  - The brain is constituted of heterogeneous types of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, which are organized into distinct anatomical regions, and show precise regulation of gene expression during development, aging and function. In the current database release, STAB2 provides a systematic cellular map of the human and mouse brain by integrating recently published large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from diverse regions and across lifespan. We applied a hierarchical strategy of unsupervised clustering on the integrated single-cell transcriptomic datasets to precisely annotate the cell types and subtypes in the human and mouse brain. Currently, STAB2 includes 71 and 61 different cell subtypes defined in the human and mouse brain, respectively. It covers 63 subregions and 15 developmental stages of human brain, and 38 subregions and 30 developmental stages of mouse brain, generating a comprehensive atlas for exploring spatiotemporal transcriptomic dynamics in the mammalian brain. We also augmented web interfaces for querying and visualizing the gene expression in specific cell types. STAB2 is freely available at https://mai.fudan.edu.cn/stab2.

AB  - Rifaximin and rifampicin are good broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The irrational use of antimicrobial drugs in veterinary clinics could threaten public health and food safety. It is necessary to develop a reliable detection method of the residue for enhancing the rational supervision of the use of such drugs, reducing and slowing down the generation of bacterial resistance, and promoting animal food safety and human health. So, this study developed an LC-MS/MS method for the detection of rifaximin and rifampicin residues in animal-origin foods. The residual rifaximin and rifampicin of homogenized test materials were extracted with acetonitrile-dichloromethane solution or acetonitrile in the presence of anhydrous sodium sulfate and vitamin C, purified by dispersible solid phase extraction, determined by LC-MS/MS, and quantified by the internal standard method. The specificity, sensitivity, matrix effect, accuracy, and precision of the method were investigated in the edible tissues of cattle, swine, or chicken. In addition, the stability of the standard stock solution and the standard working solution was also investigated. The method was suitable for the muscle, liver, kidney, fat, milk, and eggs of cattle, swine, or chicken, as well as fish and shrimp. The specificity of the method was good, and the detection of the analytes was not affected by different matrices. Both the LOD and LOQ of the two analytes were 5 mu g/kg and 10 mu g/kg, respectively. The results of matrix effects in each tissue were in the range of 80-120%; there were no significant matrix effects. The average accuracy of rifaximin and rifampicin in different foodstuffs of animal origin was between 80% and 120%, and the method precision was below 20% (RSD). The proposed method showed good performance for determination, which could be employed for the extraction, purification, and detection of residual rifaximin and rifampicin in edible animal tissues. The pretreatment procedure of tissue samples was simple and feasible. The method was highly specific, stable, reliable, and with high sensitivity, accuracy, and precision, which met the requirements of quantitative detection of veterinary drug residues.

AB  - The small brown planthopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus) is one of the most destructive insect pests in rice (Oryza sativa), which is the world's major grain crop. The dynamic changes in the rice transcriptome and metabolome in response to planthopper female adult feeding and oviposition have been reported. However, the effects of nymph feeding remain unclear. In this study, we found that pre-infestation with SBPH nymphs increased the susceptibility of rice plants to SBPH infestation. We used a combination of broadly targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic studies to investigate the rice metabolites altered by SBPH feeding. We observed that SBPH feeding induced significant changes in 92 metabolites, including 56 defense-related secondary metabolites (34 flavonoids, 17 alkaloids, and 5 phenolic acids). Notably, there were more downregulated metabolites than upregulated metabolites. Additionally, nymph feeding significantly increased the accumulation of seven phenolamines and three phenolic acids but decreased the levels of most flavonoids. In SBPH-infested groups, 29 differentially accumulated flavonoids were downregulated, and this effect was more pronounced with infestation time. The findings of this study indicate that SBPH nymph feeding suppresses flavonoid biosynthesis in rice, resulting in increased susceptibility to SBPH infestation.

AB  - Neurotoxic damage resulting from lead pollution exposure constitutes a significant public health concern. The regulatory impact of lead (Pb) exposure on neuronal dendritic spine plasticity, a crucial mechanism for neuronal adaptation, warrants further investigation. To elucidate the role and mechanism of the Mitofilin-mtDNA axis in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning and memory impairment induced by lead exposure, in this study, both in vivo and in vitro models were subjected to chronic lead exposure. The results showed that the spatial learning and memory abilities of lead-exposed mice were significantly reduced. Furthermore, Western blotting and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated a significant down-regulation in the expression of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Mitofilin. Extended exposure to lead has the potential to compromise the plasticity of dendritic spines within the CA1 region of hippocampal neurons and disrupt the structural integrity of neuronal mitochondria. Furthermore, lead exposure was associated with elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons. The study additionally demonstrated that the overexpression of Mitofilin ameliorated deficits in spatial learning and memory in mice subjected to chronic lead exposure. This overexpression also facilitated the normal formation of neuronal dendritic spines, preserved the structural integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and mitigated mitochondrial damage. The study further revealed that the overexpression of Mitofilin markedly suppressed the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in neurons subjected to chronic lead exposure, while concurrently reducing the expression levels of the inflammasome Nlrp3 and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lead-exposed neurons with Mitofilin overexpression. These findings suggest that the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Mitofilin may play a role in mediating synaptic plasticity impairment following chronic lead exposure through the regulation of mitochondrial function.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of human epilepsy, often accompanied by neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Like other neurological diseases, TLE is expected to disrupt lipid homeostasis. However, the lipid architecture of the human TLE brain is relatively understudied, and the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis is poorly understood. We performed desorption electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry imaging of 39 fresh frozen surgical specimens of the human hippocampus to investigate lipid profiles in TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 14) and control (non-TLE; n = 25) groups. In contrast to several previous studies on animal models of epilepsy, we report reduced expression of various important lipids, notably phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in the human TLE hippocampus. In addition, metabolic pathway analysis suggested the possible dysregulation of the Kennedy pathway in TLE, resulting in striking reductions of PC and PE levels. This revelation opens up opportunities to further investigate the associated molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets for TLE.

AB  - Simple Summary Zinc oxide (ZnO) can be used to prevent intestinal diseases in the swine industry but its secretion in feces can result in environmental pollution. As an alternative for ZnO, we evaluated the action of berberine in rats with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid known for regulatory action for inflammation. We compared ZnO with berberine and observed a protective effect of berberine to a similar level of ZnO. Our study suggests that berberine is a valid substitute for ZnO that could reduce intestinal inflammation and environmental pollution.Abstract Zinc oxide (ZnO) is frequently used in high concentrations to prevent diarrhea in weaning pigs. However, it can produce environmental pollution, because it is not absorbed by the intestines and is excreted in the feces. In studies to identify an alternative substance to ZnO, we used a model of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of berberine with ZnO. DSS-treated rats displayed weight loss, shortening of the colon, increased fecal water content, and an increase in the disease activity index (DAI). In contrast, DSS + ZnO- and DSS + berberine-treated rats exhibited reduced colon shortening, decreased fecal water content, and a decrease in the DAI. Histological analysis revealed that both ZnO and berberine treatment reduced epithelial cell damage, crypt destruction, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, the liver damage index was not significantly different between ZnO and berberine-treated rats. This study indicated that both ZnO and berberine can improve DSS-induced colitis in rats and suggests berberine as an alternative treatment to ZnO that would not cause environmental pollution.

AB  - Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We have shown that ketamine can induce cognitive impairments and schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. However, the detailed metabolic profile changes in the progression of ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms are still not fully elucidated. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based untargeted hippocampus high -throughput metabolomics method was first performed to screen for potential biomarkers in a schizophrenia-like state in a chronically administered ketamine-induced mouse model. Our results identified that the amino acid and energy metabolism pathways were significantly affected in mouse models of ketamine-induced schizophrenia. The detailed amino acid profiles were subsequently quan-tified in the hippocampus. The results showed that ketamine dramatically decreased the Lys, Gly, and Ser levels while significantly increasing the Gln level and relative Glu-to-GABA ratio. Our study suggested that Gln, Gly and Ser metabolism disturbances might be involved in ketamine-induced schizophrenia -like phenotypes. This research offers a fresh viewpoint for creating new neuroleptic medications and contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying ketamine-induced schizophrenia.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Early life adversity (ELA) heightens the risk for anxiety disorders (which are characterized by heightened fear and avoidance behaviors), with females being twice as likely as males to develop pathology. Pavlovian fear conditioning tasks have been used to study possible mechanisms supporting endophenotypes of pathology. Identification of sex and ELA selective effects on the nature of behavioral responding in these paradigms may provide a unique window into coping strategies in response to learned fear to guide more mechanistic studies. The goals of this study were two-fold; First, to test if male and female mice employed different coping strategies in response to threat learning using different conditioning parameters (low, medium, and high intensity foot shocks). Second, to test if ELA in the form of limited bedding and nesting (LBN) altered the behavioral response of mice to conditioning. Mice received 6 tone/foot-shock pairings at one of three different foot-shock intensities (0.35 mA; 0.57 mA; 0.7 mA). Freezing, darting, and foot-shock reactivity were measured across trials. During conditioning, control-reared female mice exhibited significantly higher rates of darting behavior compared to control males at nearly all shock intensities tested. LBN rearing decreased the proportion of darting females to levels observed in males. Thus, ELA in the form of LBN significantly diminished the recruitment of active versus passive coping strategies in female mice but did not generally change male responding. Additional work will be required to understand the neural basis of these behavioral effects. Findings extending from this work have the potential to shed light on how ELA impacts trajectories of regional brain development with implications for sex-selective risk for behavioral endophenotypes associated with pathology and possibly symptom presentation.

AB  - Simple Summary Human remains are often burned in an effort to conceal the identity of the victim and/or obscure traumatic injuries related to the death event. Thermal exposure can produce artifacts resembling trauma and disguise preexisting trauma. However, there is a paucity of experimental studies with varied results addressing the differentiation of thermally induced artifacts from traumatic signatures. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a small-scale study using domestic pigs as correlates to test the impact of thermal alteration on blunt force trauma to the cranium. Two tools (e.g., hammer and crowbar) were utilized to manually inflict injuries on the human analogs before controlled burning in an outdoor environment. The results of this experiment demonstrated that the most diagnostic variable to differentiate thermally induced alternations from blunt force fractures was fracture pattern. In forensic scenarios involving homicide, human remains are often exposed to fire as a means of disposal and/or obscuring identity. Burning human remains can result in the concealment of traumatic injury, the creation of artifacts resembling injury, or the destruction of preexisting trauma. Since fire exposure can greatly influence trauma preservation, methods to differentiate trauma signatures from burning artifacts are necessary to conduct forensic analyses. Specifically, in the field of forensic anthropology, criteria to distinguish trauma from fire signatures on bone is inconsistent and sparse. This study aims to supplement current forensic anthropological literature by identifying criteria found to be the most diagnostic of fire damage or blunt force trauma. Using the skulls of 11 adult pigs (Sus scrofa), blunt force trauma was manually produced using a crowbar and flat-faced hammer. Three specimens received no impacts and were utilized as controls. All skulls were relocated to an outdoor, open-air fire where they were burned until a calcined state was achieved across all samples. Results from this experiment found that blunt force trauma signatures remained after burning and were identifiable in all samples where reassociation of fragments was possible. This study concludes that distinct patterns attributed to thermal fractures and blunt force fractures are identifiable, allowing for diagnostic criteria to be narrowed down for future analyses.

AB  - Background: Patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) mainly exhibit enduring adverse emotions, heightening susceptibility to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Notably, metabolites of ketamine, particularly (2R,6R)-hydroxyketamine (HNK), have demonstrated favorable antidepressant properties. However, the precise mechanism through which HNK exerts its therapeutic effects on negative emotional symptoms in PTSD patients should be fully elucidated. Methods: In this investigation, a model involving a single prolonged stress and plantar shock (SPS&S) was utilized, followed by the administration of (2R, 6R)-HNK into the lateral ventricle subsequent to the recovery phase. The evaluation of PTSD-related behaviors was conducted through the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EMPT), and forced swim test (FST). The expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphokinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in rat brain regions was analyzed using molecular biology experiments. Results: SPS&S rats displayed adverse emotional behaviors characterized by depression and anxiety. Treatment with (2R, 6R)-HNK enhanced exploratory behavior and reversed negative emotional behaviors. This intervention mitigated disruptions in the expression levels of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-associated proteins in the HIP and PFC, without influencing PI3K/AKT signaling in the AMY of SPS&S rats. Conclusion: Traumatic stress can trigger negative emotional reactions in rats, potentially involving the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the HIP, PFC, and AMY. The (2R, 6R)-HNK compounds have demonstrated the potential to mitigate adverse emotions in rats subjected to the SPS&S paradigm. This effect may be attributed to the modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the HIP, and PFC, with a particularly notable impact observed in the HIP region.

AB  - Nitrogen isotopes are widely used to study the trophic position of animals in modern food webs; however, their application in the fossil record is severely limited by degradation of organic material during fossilization. In this study, we show that the nitrogen isotope composition of organic matter preserved in mammalian tooth enamel (delta N-15(enamel)) records diet and trophic position. The delta N-15(enamel) of modern African mammals shows a 3.7 parts per thousand increase between herbivores and carnivores as expected from trophic enrichment, and there is a strong positive correlation between delta N-15(enamel) and delta N-15(bone-collagen) values from the same individuals. Additionally, delta N-15(enamel) values of Late Pleistocene fossil teeth preserve diet and trophic level information, despite complete diagenetic loss of collagen in the same specimens. We demonstrate that delta N-15(enamel) represents a powerful geochemical proxy for diet that is applicable to fossils and can help delineate major dietary transitions in ancient vertebrate lineages.
   Enamel-bound nitrogen isotopes in modern and fossil mammal teeth preserve dietary and trophic level information. This novel geochemical archive can be used to reconstruct trophic niche in ancient ecosystems.

AB  - The second form of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH-II) and its receptor (GnRHR-II) are abundantly produced within the porcine testis and immunolocalize within the seminiferous tubules, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis and/or sperm function. The objective of this study was to quantify GnRH-II and GnRHR-II abundance within boar reproductive tract tissues and examine their role in porcine sperm function. Immunoblotting revealed GnRHR-II abundance was 12-fold greater (P < 0.0001) within the testis compared with other reproductive organs. Within seminiferous tubules, GnRHR-II prominently immunolocalized to elongating spermatids. In ejaculated spermatozoa, GnRHR-II immunolocalized to the connecting piece. GnRH-II was also detected in seminal plasma, likely originating from the testis as GnRH-II concentrations were greatest in testicular homogenates (P < 0.0001) compared with other reproductive tissues. To assess the effects of GnRH-II/GnRHR-II on sperm function, extended semen samples were treated with GnRHR-II analogues and evaluated via computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). In Experiment 1, semen treatment with increasing concentrations of GnRHR-II agonist (D-ala(6) GnRH-II) revealed that two concentrations (0.1 and 100 mu M) tended to decrease the percentage of bent sperm tails versus vehicle-treated semen (P < 0.10). In Experiment 2, semen treatment with increasing concentrations of GnRHR antagonist (SB-75/Cetrorelix) indicated that only 10 <mu>M SB-75 impaired CASA metrics compared with vehicle-treated samples (P < 0.05). In Experiment 3, semen treatment with both 100 <mu>M D-ala(6) GnRH-II and 10 mu M SB-75 partially rescued sperm motility and morphology measures. These data suggest that GnRH-II and its receptor regulate porcine sperm function in an autocrine/paracrine manner.

AB  - Studies indicate that gestational exercise practice positively impacts the offspring's cognition. Nevertheless, the influence of maternal resistance exercise, different periods of exercise practice, and the inter- and trans-generational effects involved in these responses are not known. This study sought to report the influence of the maternal practice of resistance exercise on offspring's cognitive function, exploring behavior, and neuroplastic and epigenetic marks in the hippocampus. Female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sedentary (SS), exercised during pregnancy (SE), exercised before pregnancy (ES), and exercised before and during pregnancy (EE). Exercised rats were submitted to a resistance exercise protocol (vertical ladder climbing). Between postnatal days (P)81 and P85, male offspring were submitted to the Morris water maze test. At P85, the following analyses were performed in offspring's hippocampus: expression of IGF-1 and BrdU+ cells, global DNA methylation, H3/H4 acetylation, and HDAC2 amount. Only the offspring of SE mothers presented subtly better performance on learning and memory tasks, associated with lower HDAC2 amount. Offspring from ES mothers presented an overexpression of hippocampal neuroplastic marks (BrdU+ and IGF-1), as well as a decrease of DNA methylation and an increase in H4 acetylation. Offspring from EE mothers (continuously exercised) did not present modifications in plasticity or epigenetic parameters. This is the first study to observe the influence of maternal resistance exercise on offspring's brains. The findings provide evidence that offspring's hippocampus plasticity is influenced by exercise performed in isolated periods (pre- or gestationally) more than that performed continually.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a woody, edible-oil plant native to China. Anthracnose is the major disease of Ca. oleifera, and Colletotrichum fructicola is the main epidemic pathogen. Our previous research indicated that CfHac1 (homologous to ATF/CREB1) and CfGcn5 (general control nonderepressible 5, Gcn5) are integral to key cellular processes that govern fungal development and pathogenesis. Further transcriptomic analyses of the CfHac1 and CfGcn5 mutants, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hold the potential to unveil additional genes implicated in this critical cellular response. We identified all OST/PMT (oligosaccharyltransferase/Protein O-Mannosyltransferases) genes in C. fructicola and analyzed their expression levels. To elucidate novel glycosylation-related genes that may be important for the virulence of C. fructicola, we took an unbiased transcriptomic approach comparing wild-type and the triangle Cfhac1 mutant. Notably, all OST/PMT genes were induced by dithiothreitol and down-regulated in the Delta Cfhac1 mutant, yet only the CfPMT4 (Protein O-Mannosyltransferases 4) gene (A04626) was unaffected in the Delta Cfgcn5. The results of targeted gene deletion experiments indicate that CfPMT4 plays a crucial role in both vegetative growth and conidiation. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the Delta Cfpmt4 exhibits deficiencies in appressorium formation, as well as in its response to cell wall integrity and endoplasmic reticulum stresses. Furthermore, the mutant displayed impaired glycogen metabolism, which may contribute to reduced penetration ability. Overall, CfPmt4, an O-mannosyltransferase, controls the growth, development, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola. Understanding the function of the CfPMT4 homolog could provide a potential molecular target for controlling Ca. oleifera anthracnose.

AB  - Tails play essential roles in functions related to locomotor stability and maneuverability among terrestrial and arboreal animals. In kangaroo rats, bipedal hopping rodents, tails are used as effective inertial appendages for stability in hopping, but also facilitate stability and maneuverability during predator escape leaps. The complexity of tail functionality shows great potential for bio-inspiration and robotic device design, as maneuvering is accomplished by a long and light-weight inertial appendage. To (1) further understand the mechanics of how kangaroo rats use their tails during aerial maneuvers and (2) explore if we can achieve this behavior with a simplified tail-like appendage (i.e., template), we combined quantified animal observations, computational simulations, and experiments with a two degrees of freedom (2-DoF) tailed robot. We used video data from free-ranging kangaroo rats escaping from a simulated predator and analyzed body and tail motion for the airborne phase. To explain tail contributions to body orientation (i.e., spatial reorientation), we built a mid-air kangaroo rat computational model and demonstrated that the three-dimensional body orientation of the model can be controlled by a simplified 2-DoF tail with a nonlinear control strategy. Resulting simulated trajectories show movement patterns similar to those observed in kangaroo rats. Our robot experiments show that a lightweight tail can generate a large yaw displacement and stabilize pitch and roll angles to zero simultaneously. Our work contributes to better understanding of the form-function relationship of the kangaroo rat tail and lays out an important foundation for bio-inspiration in robotic devices that have lightweight tail-like appendages for mid-air maneuvering.

AB  - Simple Summary Grazing in arid and semi-arid regions causes ewes to suffer from feed shortages to some degree. This is particularly problematic in late pregnancy, when maximum fetal growth has been reached and the nutritional requirements of the growing fetus exceed maternal nutrient intake. The result is weaker offspring with lower birth weights and survival rates, which in turn affects livestock profitability. Finding an alternative to improve the supply of necessary nutrients to dams during pregnancy will help farm managers achieve healthy lambs with higher survival rates. Using additives involved in the energy status of animals, this study has shown that administration of these additives during late gestation reverses the debilitating effects of feed restriction and improves placental efficiency, thereby enhancing nutrient delivery to the growing fetus, such that lambs from ewes offered diets containing these additives had higher birth weights and subsequently higher survival rates. These results will help livestock producers in arid and semi-arid regions to benefit from the combined administration of the three substances, namely propylene glycol, rumen-protected choline chloride, and monensin sodium, when feeding pregnant ewes. To evaluate the effects of supplementation of feed additives in the last trimester of pregnancy on placental characteristics and offspring performance, this study was conducted with 48 estrous-synchronized Ghezel ewes that had randomly been assigned to one of the following six groups (n = 8): ad libitum feeding (AL); feed restriction (RF; 60% of ad libitum intake); feed restriction + propylene glycol (PG); feed restriction + propylene glycol + monensin sodium (MS); feed restriction + propylene glycol + rumen-protected choline chloride (RPC); feed restriction + propylene glycol + monensin sodium + rumen-protected choline chloride (PMC). Birth weight, body size, and rectal temperature of lambs were determined within 24 h of birth. The presence of lambs at 87 days of age was used as an index of survival to weaning. The outcome of this study was that the average placental weight of ewes in the AL and MS groups was the highest and lowest, respectively, among the treatment groups (p < 0.01). RPC ewes presented higher placental efficiency compared to AL, RF, and MS ewes (p < 0.05). The largest and smallest crown-to-rump lengths (CRLs) were observed in PMC and RF lambs, respectively (p < 0.01). In addition, lambs born from PMC, RPC, and PG ewes had a longer curved crown-to-rump length (CCRL) than those born from AL and RF ewes (p < 0.01). The concurrent administration of propylene glycol and rumen-protected choline chloride resulted in the highest birth weight among treatment groups (p < 0.01). Lambs born to PMC and RPC ewes had a higher survival rate and rectal temperature than those born to RF ewes (p < 0.05). It can be concluded that although dietary restriction does not have adverse effects on lambs' performance compared with ad libitum intake, the combined administration of propylene glycol and rumen-protected choline chloride in the ewes' restricted diet can improve placental characteristics and subsequently amend lambs' birth weight and body size. Therefore, the combined administration of these additives can be practiced during feed restriction.

AB  - This study investigated whether the origin of sperm (epididymal vs. ejaculate) affects the cryopreservation efficiency in agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). Five sexually mature agoutis underwent electroejaculation, resulting in obtaining four semen samples. After 15 days, the same animals were euthanized, and through retrograde flushing, sperm samples were obtained from the epididymis tails. In both collection methods, samples were evaluated for sperm parameters (sperm concentration, motility, vigor, membrane integrity, osmotic response, and morphology). Then, samples were diluted in ACP 109c, added with 20% egg yolk, and a final concentration of 6% glycerol. Finally, the samples were packaged in 0.25 mL straws and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After one week, samples were thawed and evaluated in the same way as fresh samples, with the addition of membrane integrity analysis using fluorescent probes (C-FDA/PI) and computerized analysis (CASA). Immediately after obtaining the sperm, samples obtained directly from the epididymis presented higher values (P <= 0.05) than those obtained by electroejaculation concerning the parameters of volume, sperm concentration, and total number of sperm (1,398.25 +/- 206.0 x10(6) and 184.5 +/- 78.0 x10(6) sperm). On the other hand, in the classical evaluation of the other sperm parameters and the computerized analysis (CASA) after thawing, such as total motility, no statistical differences were observed between sperm from both origins (ejaculate: 16.7 +/- 8.2% and epididymal: 24.8 +/- 12.0%, P > 0.05). This demonstrates the possibility of direct application of the cryopreservation protocol for agouti (D. leporina) sperm obtained via the epididymis or ejaculate.

AB  - Hyalomma dromedarii is the predominant tick species parasitizing camels in Egypt. This study aimed to evaluate the acaricidal activity of selected oils against H. dromedarii and determine their effects on enzyme activities. A screening test was performed against unfed adults using 30 oils at a concentration of 20%. Rosemary, garlic, neem, and Cyperus oils were evaluated against semi-engorged females in a bioassay experiment. Semi-engorged females were exposed to LC50 that was calculated after two days to estimate enzyme activities of Glutathione S-transferase (GST), Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and Catalase (CAT). Results of the screening test showed that the most effective oils against unfed adults were rosemary, neem, Cyperus, and garlic. In the bioassay experiment, rosemary oil exhibited the highest toxicity on the 2nd day (LC50: 12.3%) followed by garlic oil (LC50: 17.4%). Neem and Cyperus oils revealed approximately the same toxicity recording an LC50 of around 29% on the 2nd day. The four selected oils exhibited a significant increase or decrease in the activity of GST, AChE, and CAT enzymes (P < 0.001) during 48 h post-treatment. In conclusion, rosemary and garlic oils have strong acaricidal effects against H. dromedarii. Therefore, these two oils could be recommended in the control program of ticks as safe alternatives to chemical acaricides.

AB  - Tanimbar is one of the main island groups in Wallacea included in Birdsell's early human migration routes from Sunda to Sahul, situated at the easternmost end of south Wallacea on Birdsell's Route 2A. Despite its geographic significance, the island group has not undergone thorough archaeological investigation. Here, we present the first evidence of Pleistocene human occupation in the Tanimbar Islands, dating back approximately 42,000 years, representing one of the oldest ages for human occupation in Wallacea. This finding aligns with records from islands in the west of Wallacea, suggesting rapid human movement through the region. The successful colonization of Tanimbar, like other islands in southern Wallacea, required advanced maritime technology. However, unlike other islands on Route 2A, the early occupants on Tanimbar had access to medium-sized terrestrial mammals, specifically macropods, which are now locally extinct. The faunal remains from the initial colonization period suggest exploitation of both terrestrial and marine resources. This early settlement of the Tanimbar's potentially enabled exploration of surrounding islands, supported by possible evidence of the movement of lithic raw materials and potentially the introduction of macropods from Sahul.

AB  - Background: Perinatal exposure to deltamethrin (DM) causes attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder-like behaviors. However, the vulnerable time window to DM exposure and the possible mechanism are obscure. We aimed to identify the critical window(s) at perinatal stages for DM exposure and the possible mechanism. Method: Pregnant mice were exposed to DM (0.5 mg/kg) at three different prenatal stages [gestational day (GD) 0-5, 6-15 and 16-birth (16-B)] and early postnatal stage (PD 0-10). Locomotor activity, learning and memory were evaluated using open field and Y-maze test, respectively. Nissl staining and western blots were used to examine the neuronal loss and the protein expression, respectively. Results: Perinatal exposures to DM had no effect on reproductive and growth index of offspring. However, mice receiving DM exposure during GD 16-B displayed significantly higher mortality suggesting GD 16-B is the most vulnerable time window to DM exposure. Prenatal but not early postnatal DM exposure impaired locomotor activity, learning and memory, and caused neuron loss in the dentate gyrus of male offspring. However, neither prenatal nor postnatal DM exposure affected mouse behavior of female offspring. Prenatal DM exposures decreased the protein levels of NR2A and NR2B in both hippocampi and cerebral cortices of male offspring. However, female mice receiving DM exposure at GD 16-B but not other stages displayed increased expression levels of NR2A and NR2B in hippocampi. Conclusion: Prenatal but not early postnatal DM exposure impairs the neuron development in male but not female mice. Altered NMDA receptor expression may correlate to DM-induced behavioral deficits.

AB  - Reproductive success requires considerable energy investment. Research has shown that some adipokines, i.e. the hormones produced in adipose tissue, affect reproductive functions by influencing all structures of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Apelin is a recently identified member of the adipokine family. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the gene and protein expression of the apelin system (the apelin hormone and the apelin receptor, APJ) in the anterior (AP) and posterior (PP) pituitary lobes of the domestic pig during different phases of the oestrous cycle (days 2 to 3, 10 to 12, 14 to 16, and 17 to 19) and in early pregnancy (days 10 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, and 27 to 28). It was also assumed that apelin participates in the regulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion and influences Akt, MAPK/Erk1/2, and AMPK signalling pathways in the AP during the oestrous cycle. Apelin, APJ mRNAs and proteins were detected in both pituitary lobes. Apelin was identified in gonadotropes, somatotropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes. The study also revealed that apelin and APJ mRNA/protein levels fluctuate during the oestrous cycle and early gestation. Apelin affects basal, GnRH- and/or insulin-stimulated gonadotropin secretion in some phases of the cycle, as well as the phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK/Erk1/2, and AMPK proteins in AP cells. These findings suggest that apelin may be produced locally in the pituitary and that this gland is receptive to apelin's action. The study also suggest that apelin may influence female reproductive functions by controlling the release of LH and FSH from AP cells, and that it affects Akt, MAPK/Erk1/2, and AMPK signalling pathways.

AB  - While accumulated publications support the existence of neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus, the homeostasis and developmental potentials of neural stem cells (NSCs) under different contexts remain unclear. Based on our generated single-nucleus atlas of the human hippocampus across neonatal, adult, aging, and injury, we dissected the molecular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of human hippocampal NSCs under different contexts. We further identified new specific neurogenic lineage markers that overcome the lack of specificity found in some well-known markers. Based on developmental trajectory and molecular signatures, we found that a subset of NSCs exhibit quiescent properties after birth, and most NSCs become deep quiescence during aging. Furthermore, certain deep quiescent NSCs are reactivated following stroke injury. Together, our findings provide valuable insights into the development, aging, and reactivation of the human hippocampal NSCs, and help to explain why adult hippocampal neurogenesis is infrequently observed in humans.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) help the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) adapt to environmental stress, and they are also quality-related components of tea. However, the upstream mechanism regulating the herbivore-induced expression of volatile biosynthesis genes is unclear, especially at the level of epigenetic regulation. In this study, similar to the effects of a tea green leafhopper infestation, treatments with exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and histone deacetylase inhibitors significantly increased the (E)-nerolidol content in tea and induced the expression of the associated biosynthesis gene CsNES. Furthermore, a key transcription factor related to JA signaling, myelocytomatosis 2 (CsMYC2), interacted with histone deacetylase 2 (CsHDA2) in vitro and in vivo. A tea green leafhopper infestation inhibited CsHDA2 expression and decreased CsHDA2 abundance. Moreover, the tea green leafhopper infestation increased H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the promoter region of CsNES, which in turn upregulated the expression of CsNES and increased the (E)-nerolidol content. In this study, we revealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, while also confirming that CsHDA2-CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers. The results of this study may be useful for characterizing plant aromatic compounds and the main upstream stress-responsive signaling molecules. Furthermore, the study findings will assist researchers clarify the epigenetic regulation influencing plant secondary metabolism in response to external stress.

AB  - Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent-assisted coiling, and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis, and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, a nanoclay-based shear-thinning hydrogel (STH) is developed for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing is performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability, and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm models in rats and in pigs are created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization, and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or nontarget embolization; STH is also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH is able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long-term survival experiments. STH is a promising semisolid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

AB  - We recently showed that chronic exposure of adult male mice to environmental doses of DEHP alone or in a phthalate mixture altered blood brain barrier integrity and induced an inflammatory profile in the hippocampus. Here, we investigate whether such exposure alters hippocampus-dependent behavior and underlying cellular mechanisms. Adult C57BL/6 J male mice were continuously exposed orally to the vehicle or DEHP alone (5 or 50 mu g/kg/d) or to DEHP (5 mu g/kg/d) in a phthalate mixture. In the Morris water maze, males showed reduced latencies across days to find the platform in the cue and spatial reference memory tasks, regardless of their treatment group. In the probe test, DEHP-50 exposed males displayed a higher latency to find the platform quadrant. In the temporal order memory test, males exposed to DEHP alone or in a phthalate mixture were unable to discriminate between the most recently and previously seen objects. They also displayed reduced ability to show a preference for the new object in the novel object recognition test. These behavioral alterations were associated with a lowered dendritic spine density and protein levels of glutamate receptors and postsynaptic markers, and increased protein levels of the presynaptic synaptophysin in the hippocampus. Metabolomic analysis of the hippocampus indicated changes in amino acid levels including reduced tryptophan and Lkynurenine and elevated NAD + levels, respectively, a precursor, intermediate and endproduct of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Interestingly, the protein amounts of the xenobiotic aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a target of this metabolic pathway, were elevated in the CA1 area. These data indicate that chronic exposure of adult male mice to environmental doses of DEHP alone or in a phthalate mixture impacted hippocampal function and structure, associated with modifications in amino acid metabolites with a potential involvement of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.

AB  - Dura mater plays a critical role in neurofluid homeostasis, yet comparative data on capillary network density and organization between cranial and spinal regions remain limited. This study addresses this gap by systematically analyzing capillary architecture and aquaporin (AQP) expression in porcine cranial (parietal, falx) and spinal dura mater. Immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy were used to assess capillary density, spatial distribution, and AQP1/AQP4 expression patterns across over 1000 capillaries in these regions. Cranial dura exhibited a 3-4 times higher capillary density compared to spinal dura, with capillaries predominantly localized to meningeal-dural border cell interfaces in cranial regions and a more dispersed distribution in spinal dura. Both AQP1 and AQP4 were detected as discrete clusters within capillary walls, with higher expression in cranial compared to spinal dura. Lymphatic vessels (PDPN-positive) were also observed adjacent to capillaries, supporting a dual-system model for fluid and waste exchange. These findings highlight the dura's region-specific vascular specialization, with cranial regions favoring dense, structured capillary networks suited for active fluid exchange. This work establishes a foundation for investigating capillary-driven fluid dynamics in pathological states like subdural hematomas or hydrocephalus.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary neurodegenerative disease. It can be caused by aging and brain trauma and severely affects the abilities of cognition and memory of patients. Therefore, it seriously threatens the mental and physical health of humans worldwide. As a traditional Chinese medicine, ginsenosides have been proven to have a variety of pharmacological activities. Ginsenoside Rh4 (Rh4) is one of the rare ginsenosides with higher pharmacological activity than ordinary ginsenosides, but its effect on alleviating AD and its molecular mechanism have not been studied. Here, we investigated the anti-AD effects of Rh4 and its potential mechanisms using an AD mouse model induced by a combination of AlCl3 center dot 6H(2)O and D-galactose. The results showed that Rh4 could significantly improve the ability of cognizance and reduce neuronal damage in mice. Concurrently, Rh4 attenuates amyloid ss accumulation, increases the density of dendritic spines, and logically inhibits synaptic structural damage as a result of neuronal excessive apoptosis and autophagy. Rh4 can not only inhibit the inflammatory response caused by the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, increase the level of antioxidant enzymes in serum, and significantly improve the activity of antioxidant enzyme SOD1 in the hippocampus but also inhibit the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the hippocampus of mice by regulating the Wnt2b/GSK-3 ss/SMAD4 signaling pathway. Together, this study provides a theoretical basis for Rh4 in the treatment of AD and reveals that Rh4 is a potential drug for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Simple Summary The housing patterns of gestating sows affect their health and welfare. In this study, the differences between behavior and stress hormone levels were assessed when sows were housed in a group housing system compared to individual stalls; in addition, the disease resistance and resilience of their piglets were compared. In our investigation, the group-housed sows showed more exploratory behavior, less vacuum chewing, less sitting behavior, and lower stress hormone levels throughout pregnancy. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection test revealed that the offspring of group-housed sows showed better resistance and resilience to disease. Therefore, the gestating sows raised in a group housing system and their piglets are healthier and have improved welfare. Our results show that a group housing system provides higher welfare standards, with conditions that are more suitable for gestating sows in modern pig production. Being in a confined environment causes chronic stress in gestating sows, which is detrimental for sow health, welfare and, consequently, offspring physiology. This study assessed the health and welfare of gestating sows housed in a group housing system compared to individual gestation stalls. After pregnancy was confirmed, experimental sows were divided randomly into two groups: the group housing system (GS), with the electronic sow feeding (ESF) system; or individual stall (IS). The behavior of sows housed in the GS or IS was then compared; throughout pregnancy, GS sows displayed more exploratory behavior, less vacuum chewing, and less sitting behavior (p < 0.05). IS sows showed higher stress hormone levels than GS sows. In particular, at 41 days of gestation, the concentration of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and adrenaline (A) in IS sows was significantly higher than that of GS sows, and the A level of IS sows remained significantly higher at 71 days of gestation (p < 0.01). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) test was carried out in the weaned piglets of the studied sows. Compared with the offspring of gestating sows housed in GS (PG) or IS (PS), PG experienced a shorter period of high temperature and showed a quicker return to the normal state (p < 0.05). Additionally, their lower levels of stress hormone (p < 0.01) suggest that PG did not suffer from as much stress as PS. These findings suggested that gestating sows housed in GS were more able to carry out their natural behaviors and, therefore, had lower levels of stress and improved welfare. In addition, PG also showed better disease resistance and resilience. These results will provide a research basis for the welfare and breeding of gestating sows.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers. The role of autophagy in the pathobiology of CRC is intricate, with opposing functions manifested in different cellular contexts. The Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator inactivated by the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway, functions as an oncoprotein in a variety of cancers. In this study, we found that YAP could negatively regulate autophagy in CRC cells, and consequently, promote tumor progression of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP interacts with TEAD forming a complex to upregulate the transcription of the apoptosis-inhibitory protein Bcl-2, which may subsequently facilitate cell survival by suppressing autophagy-related cell death; silencing Bcl-2 expression could alleviate YAP-induced autophagy inhibition without affecting YAP expression. Collectively, our data provide evidence for YAP/Bcl-2 as a potential therapeutic target for drug exploration against CRC.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness that can cause significant emotional disturbances and severe socioeconomic burdens. Rodent and nonhuman primate-based depression models have been studied, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and monoamine acid disorder hypotheses, as well as peripheral microbiota disturbances causing MDD; however, the pathogenesis is still largely unknown. This study aims to explore the relationship between ferritin and MDD. First, alterations in ferritin, including ferritin light chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH), in MDD patient plasma compared with healthy control (HC) plasma were detected using ELISA. Then, serum ferritin expression in cLPS-depressed mice was measured by ELISA. The existence of FTH in the hippo campus was validated by immunofluorescence, and the change in FTH levels in the hippocampus of mice injected with cLPS was detected by western blotting. FTL levels in MDD patients were decreased compared with those in HCs. In cLPS-depressed mice, serum ferritin was not different from that in the control group, while the expression of FTH in the hippocampus was significantly reduced in depressed mice. Our findings demonstrate the alteration of ferritin expression in MDD and provide new insight into the pathogenesis of MDD.

AB  - The hippocampus is well recognized for its significant contributions to learning, memory formation, and emotional regulation. In addition, it was approved by several studies that hippocampus plays a pivotal role in pain modulation; however, the exact mechanism has not yet been identified. In the current research, effects of microinjection of muscarinic M1 cholinergic agents into the CA1 region of the hippocampus in orofacial nociception evoked by formalin and corresponding memory impairment were investigated. Left and right sides of the hippocampus were implanted by guide cannulas. Orofacial nociception was elicited through subcutaneously injection of formalin (1.5 %) solution into the pad of vibrissa region. Evaluating memory was conducted with Morris water maze (MWM). Microinjections of McN-A-343 (a selective agonist of muscarinic M1 receptors) attenuated the both phases of orofacial nociceptive behavior, face rubbing. This effect of McN-A-343 was blocked by prior microinjection of pirenzepine (an antagonist of muscarinic receptors). On the other hand, McN-A-343 and pirenzepine increased and decreased traveled time as well as traveled distance in target zone of MWM, respectively. Additionally, McN-A-343 improved the memory deficits caused by orofacial nociception. Our results indicate that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors contribute significantly in the hippocampal modulation of orofacial nociception and related memory impairment.

AB  - Silent infarcts (SI) are subcortical cerebral infarcts that occur in the absence of clinical symptoms commonly associated with ischemia and are linked to dementia development. Little is known about the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive dysfunction associated with SI, and few studies have examined the early cellular responses and neurobiological underpinnings. We induced SI in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using an infusion of endothelin-1 in the CA1 dorsal hippocampus. Twenty-four hours later, we assessed cognition using the hippocampal-dependent object place recognition task. We also examined whether the resulting cognitive effects were associated with common markers of ischemia, specifically cell and synapse loss, gliosis, and inflammation, using histology and immunohistochemistry. Hippocampal SI led to subtle cognitive impairment on the object place recognition task 24 -hs post-injury. This was characterized by a significant difference in exploration proportion relative to a pre-injury baseline and a positive association between time spent with both the moved and unmoved objects. SI did not result in any detectable cell or synaptophysin loss, but did increase apoptosis, gliosis and inflammation in the CA1. Principal component analysis indicated the main variables associated with hippocampal SI included increased time spent with the unmoved object, gliosis, apoptosis and inflammation as well as decreased exploration proportion and CA1 cells. Our data demonstrate that hippocampal SI can lead to cognitive dysfunction 24 -hs after injury. Further, this appears to be driven by early degenerative processes including apoptosis, gliosis and inflammation, suggesting that these may be targets for early interventions treating hippocampal SI and its cognitive consequences.

AB  - Six types of nut-based bars with the addition of edible insect flour were obtained. Flours made from three different insects (Tenebrio molitor L., Acheta domesticus L., Alphitobius diaperinus P.) were used at two different additive levels (15% and 30%) in relation to the weight of the nuts. The addition of insect flour significantly increased protein content and the insoluble fraction of dietary fiber. The largest amount of these compounds was found in bars with 30% cricket flour, 15.51 g/100 g and 6.04 g/100 g, respectively, in comparison to standard bars, 10.78 g/100 g and 3.14 g/100 g, respectively. The greatest consumer acceptance was found in relation to bars with buffalo worm flour. The overall acceptance of these bars was 6.26-6.28 points compared to 6.48 for standard bars. Bars and raw materials were characterized by the high biological value of the protein. Cis linoleic acid dominated among unsaturated fatty acids. The percentage of this compound was in the range of 69.56%, for bars with a 30% addition of buffalo worm flour, to 73.88%, for bars with 15% cricket flour. Instrumental analysis of taste and smell compounds showed the presence of compounds such as 3-methylbutanoic acid, hexanal, and 2,3-pentanedione.

AB  - BackgroundDespite the evidence of an association between problematic mobile phone use (PMPU) and psychological symptoms, a few studies explore whether physical activity (PA) could moderate the effect of PMPU on psychological symptoms and its neural substrates. The aim of this study was to examine the association between PMPU and psychological symptoms in late adolescents, along with the potential moderating effect of PA and neural basis by brain gray matter volume (GMV). MethodsA total of 251 college students reported on their PMPU, PA, and psychological symptoms and subsequently underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural basis of their PA characteristics. A multiple regression model was performed to detect brain GMV associated with PA by the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method. Moderating analysis was conducted using PROCESS macro in the SPSS software. ResultsBehavioral results showed that PMPU was correlated to depression, anxiety, and stress, and PA has significantly moderated the association between PMPU with depression, anxiety, and stress. The VBM analysis showed that PA was correlated to GMV of the right fusiform gyrus (FFG), left precuneus (PCUN), left insula (INS), and left triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (IFGtriang). Moreover, GMV of the left INS moderated the relationship between PMPU and depression. ConclusionThis study has shed light on the neural perspective of PA that moderates the relationship between PMPU and depressive symptom.

AB  - The majority of today's fertilizers are based on mineral resources and fossil fuels. Among other factors, geopolitical sensitivities and rising fertilizer demand contribute to high and volatile prices. To reduce our dependency on non-renewable resources, valuable bio-based fertilizer components can be recovered through valorization of organic waste streams. However, from a farmer's perspective, an optimization problem arises: the farmer wants to minimize costs while safeguarding crop nutrient uptake. Optimization research in the fertilizer domain focuses on scheduling fertilizer application or minimizing manure management costs. The model developed in this paper intends to minimize fertilizer costs for an individual vegetable farmer by considering the possibility of bio-based fertilizer prosumption through composting and anaerobic digestion as well as leaving crop residues on the field. In a Linear Programming model, these options are compared to purchasing mineral fertilizer, commercial compost or pig slurry. In addition, a distinction is made between different business models. Sensitivity analysis is carried out with respect to changing cost parameters. The results confirm that it is not optimal for a Flemish vegetable farmer to fulfil nutrient needs solely with bio-based fertilizer. Nevertheless, the study shows that it can be interesting to consider value chains involving regional cooperation.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the neuro-regenerative properties of co-ultramicronized PEALut (Glialia(R)), composed of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and the flavonoid luteolin (Lut), in an in vivo model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and patients affected by moderate TBI. An increase in neurogenesis was seen in the mice at 72 h and 7 d after TBI. The co-ultra PEALut treatment helped the neuronal reconstitution process to restore the basal level of both novel and mature neurons; moreover, it induced a significant upregulation of the neurotrophic factors, which ultimately led to progress in terms of memory recall during behavioral testing. Moreover, our preliminary findings in a clinical trial suggested that Glialia(R) treatment facilitated neural recovery on working memory. Thus, co-ultra PEALut (Glialia(R)) could represent a valuable therapeutic agent for intensifying the endogenous repair response in order to better treat TBI.

AB  - Cryopreservation of stallion semen is less efficient than other species such as bovine. This is mainly because of the greater susceptibility of stallion sperm to the freezing damage that generates oxidative stress and plasma membrane injury, resulting in DNA fragmentation and cell death.These data suggest the need to develop new strategies of sperm cryopreservation that can improve the efficiency of this technique in stallions by reducing or preventing membrane damage and cell death. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding membrane stabilizers to the freezing medium and assess the quality and in vitro capacitation of stallion sperm after thawing. Semen samples from three stallions frozen with membrane stabilizers (cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin and cholestanol-loaded cyclodextrin) were evaluated in two experiments: i) sperm quality and functional analysis after thawing, and ii) sperm quality and functional analysis after 4 h of post-thaw incubation in capacitating conditions. Plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, membrane lipid disorder, intracellular Ca2 thorn , tyrosine phosphorylation, acrosome reaction, DNA damage, sperm motility, and binding to the zona pellucida were assessed. The results showed that cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin was the stabilizer that most efficiently reduced the membrane disruption and post-thaw cell damage. In addition, this stabilizer made it possible to obtain in vitro capacitated sperm showing higher plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm motility, binding to the zona pellucida and better response to in vitro capacitating conditions.

AB  - Within their familiar areas homing pigeons rely on familiar visual landscape features and landmarks for homing. However, the neural basis of visual landmark -based navigation has been so far investigated mainly in relation to the role of the hippocampal formation. The avian visual Wulst is the telencephalic projection field of the thalamofugal pathway that has been suggested to be involved in processing lateral visual inputs that originate from the far visual field. The Wulst is therefore a good candidate for a neural structure participating in the visual control of familiar visual landmark -based navigation. We repeatedly released and tracked Wulst-lesioned and control homing pigeons from three sites about 10 -15 km from the loft. Wulst lesions did not impair the ability of the pigeons to orient homeward during the first release from each of the three sites nor to localise the loft within the home area. In addition, Wulst-lesioned pigeons displayed unimpaired route fidelity acquisition to a repeated homing path compared to the intact birds. However, compared to control birds, Wulst-lesioned pigeons displayed persistent oscillatory flight patterns across releases, diminished attention to linear (leading lines) landscape features, such as roads and wood edges, and less direct flight paths within the home area. Differences and similarities between the effects of Wulst and hippocampal lesions suggest that although the visual Wulst does not seem to play a direct role in the memory representation of a landscape -landmark map, it does seem to participate in influencing the perceptual construction of such a map.

AB  - While intergroup conflict features prominently in the behavioural ecology literature, its antonym, intergroup peace, has been a rather neglected phenomenon until recently. Neighbourly relations and affiliative interactions are far from uncommon. We provide a comprehensive synthesis of the empirical evidence of peaceful between-group interactions in primates which take various forms that vary along two continua: intensity and duration. These include intergroup tolerance, intergroup affiliation, visits, mingling, intergroup coalitions and mergers between groups. We propose that an analysis of intergroup peace would benefit from distinguishing between facilitating factors (facilitators), active drivers and stabilizing forces (stabilizers). A prime example of a facilitator is resource heterogeneity in the landscape which can make resource defence logistically impractical and make initially independent groups more interdependent. While this often suffices for tolerant associations to emerge, for full-blown intergroup peace with sporadic or frequent intergroup affiliation and/or cooperation to arise, motivations or adaptive benefits (drivers) need to be present. Some of the adaptive benefits that can trigger a switch from tolerance to peace between groups include dispersal facilitation, information gathering, predation protection, extra-group mating, communal defence, and reciprocal resource access. Lastly, a further mediator of xenophobia and intergroup agonism is the degree of relatedness and familiarity between interacting groups (stabilizers). Finally, we propose several ways to move this research forward. We hope that this review will stimulate empirical and theoretical studies and encourage field researchers to pay more attention to hitherto rather neglected forms of between-group contact. An understanding of the functional correlates of peaceful between-group relationships in primates also holds promise for making inferences about the human social system where intergroup peace has enabled cooperation and cultural diffusion on an unprecedented scale.

AB  - ObjectiveEvidence suggests that exercise timing is crucial in reducing the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study explores the effects of delayed and early exercise on brain damage, cognitive dysfunction, and anxiety behavior using an experimental TBI model. MethodsWe randomly assigned 36 male rats to six groups: control (sham, TBI), treadmill exercise (24hA, 1-month exercise 24 h after TBI), 1WA (1-month exercise 1 week after TBI), 1MB (1-month exercise before TBI), and 1MBA (1-month exercise before and after TBI). ResultsTBI caused significant impairments in cognitive and anxiety behaviors, as well as increased brain edema (p < 0.05). The exercise groups showed significant improvement in the following order for cognitive impairments: 1MBA > 24hA > 1WA > 1MB. Compared to the 1WA group, exercise starting 24 h after TBI (24hA) significantly improved all variables except anxiety behavior. Exercise 1MBA was significantly more effective than other groups (p < 0.05) in reducing cognitive problems, anxious behavior, and brain damage. ConclusionRegular exercise or a consistent exercise routine before TBI, such as in athletes, may provide the most benefits from exercise intervention after the TBI. Starting exercise soon after the TBI (within 24 h) may help protect against brain edema and improve learning and memory by reducing cell death in specific brain regions (CA1 and CA3) and also decreasing TNF-alpha and MDA compared to starting exercise later (1 week after).

AB  - Diseases caused by fungi can affect the quality and yield of the leaves of tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze]. At present, the availability of highly effective and safe fungicides for controlling tea plants remains limited. The objectives of this study were to identify novel compounds with antifungal activities and to determine their molecular mechanisms. A series of sulfone compounds containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole were evaluated in China for their antifungal activities against several pathogens causing foliar diseases and high production losses. Transcriptomics and bioinformatics were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes of Lasiodiplodia theobromae treated with a representative compound, jiahuangxianjunzuo (JHXJZ). Moreover, the effects of JHXJZ on ergosterol content, membrane permeability, cell structure, and seven key genes involved in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway were investigated. JHXJZ had a strong antifungal activity against L. theobromae in vitro, with an effective concentration giving 50% inhibition of 3.54 +/- 0.55 lg/ml, and its curative efficacies on detached tea leaves reached 41.78% at 100 lg/ml. JHXJZ upregulated 899 genes (P < 0.05) and downregulated 1,185 genes (P < 0.05) in L. theobromae. These genes were found to be associated with carbohydrate metabolic processes, which are closely related to steroid biosynthesis in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Because JHXJZ regulates the key genes of sterol biosynthesis, it decreased the ergosterol content, increased cell-membrane permeability, changed the cellular structure, enhanced the roughness of the surface of the hyphae, and resulted in degradation of the hyphal nuclei and necrosis of the hyphal cytoplasm. Our study demonstrates that JHXJZ is a fungicide with a novel mechanism of action that differs from that of triazole fungicides. JHXJZ has potential for applications in controlling tea plant diseases.

AB  - Hiking is a popular recreational activity in North Carolina that may expose people to ticks and tick-borne pathogens. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how ticks are distributed on and near trails. Our study tested the hypothesis that ticks are more likely to be encountered when moving further away from trails by measuring differences in relative abundance at various distances. We tested 4 distances (middle of trail, edge of trail, 5 m, 20 m), as well as an on-trail and off-trail grouping. We collected significantly more ticks and ticks were more likely to be collected at our 20 m and 5 m sampling distances rather than directly on or adjacent to trails, and significantly more were collected during off-trail collections than on-trails. When looking only at Amblyomma americanum, post hoc comparisons revealed that significantly more juvenile stages were collected at 5 m and 20 m distances, but not for adults. Our monthly sampling also allowed us to describe the phenology of A. americanum in North Carolina, which is consistent with the phenology of this species in the southeastern United States with adults peaking May-Jun, nymphs Jun-Jul, and larvae in Jul-Aug. These results generally demonstrate the importance of utilizing established trails when hiking to decrease tick-borne disease risk and should be communicated to the public as a recommendation for reducing tick-encounter risk.

AB  - (1) Background: Improper disinfection of slurry and municipal wastewater poses a serious threat to public health. These fluids are reservoirs of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. (2) Methods: This study aimed to evaluate, on a laboratory scale, the disinfection effectiveness of fine bubble aeration with air activated by radiant catalytic ionization (RCI) against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Senftenberg W775, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridioides difficile, Aspergillus niger and Ascaris suum eggs in comparison to conventional atmospheric air aeration. The inactivation kinetics was calculated on the basis of Weibull and first-order models. (3) Results: The final number of microorganisms on the last day in the slurry disinfected with RCI ranged from 1.14 x 102 for L. monocytogenes to 1.91 x 107 CFU (colony-forming unit) x mL-1 for C. difficile. After using atmospheric air aeration, the bacteria number ranged from 2.82 x 103 for L. monocytogenes to 2.24 x 107 CFU x mL-1 for C. difficile. In the case of aeration using RCI technology, the maximum time required to eliminate 99.9% of the microorganisms population was 20.84 days in slurry and 16.40 days in wastewater and was determined for A. niger. In the case of atmospheric air, this time was 47.76 days in slurry and 28.74 days in wastewater and was determined for C. difficile. In turn, the time to inactivate the number of invasive A. suum eggs by 90% was 20.70 and 24.61 weeks for RCI and 21.33 and 27.82 weeks for atmospheric air, respectively. Both in the case of slurry and municipal wastewater, disinfection with RCI was more effective than aeration with atmospheric air. (4) Conclusions: Our study, for the first time, exploits the possibility of using RCI in aeration to improve the efficiency of pathogen elimination from wastewater and slurry.

AB  - Bromophenols (BPs) are prominent environmental pollutants extensively utilized in aquaculture, pharmaceuticals, and chemical manufacturing. This study aims to identify UDPglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) isoforms involved in the metabolic elimination of BPs. Mono-glucuronides of BPs were detected in human liver microsomes (HLMs) incubated with the co -factor uridine-diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA). The glucuronidation metabolism reactions catalyzed by HLMs followed Michaelis-Menten or substrate inhibition kinetics. Recombinant enzymes and inhibition experiments with chemical reagents were employed to phenotype the principal UGT isoforms participating in BP glucuronidation. UGT1A6 emerged as the major enzyme in the glucuronidation of 4Bromophenol (4 -BP), while UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and UGT1A8 were identified as the most essential isoforms for metabolizing 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP). UGT1A1, UGT1A8, and UGT2B4 were deemed the most critical isoforms in the catalysis of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) glucuronidation. Species differences were investigated using the liver microsomes of pig (PLM), rat (RLM), monkey (MyLM), and dog (DLM). Additionally, 2,4,6TBP effects on the expression of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 in HepG2 cells were evaluated. The results demonstrated potential induction of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 upon exposure to 2,4,6-TBP at a concentration of 50 mu M. Collectively, these findings contribute to elucidating the metabolic elimination and toxicity of BPs.

AB  - Navigation is often constrained to pathways, and a recurring problem concerns whether to turn left or right when approaching an intersection. We examined this problem during T-maze performance in which the maze location in the recording environment varied over five-trial blocks and analyzed the associated positional firing patterns of hippocampal CA1 and posterior parietal cortex neurons. An arbitrary partitioning of the environmental space determined the left versus right turning rule for T-maze behavior. Under these conditions, rats learned the logical fragmentation of allocentric space into left turn and right turn sub-regions. Paradoxically, under these conditions, the spatial tuning of both posterior parietal cortex and hippocampal CA1 neurons followed the frame of reference given by the T-maze, as opposed to the location in the environment. Moreover, first trials within each block were associated with distinct firing rate changes for both posterior parietal cortex and hippocampal CA1 neurons. These data support a model where spatial tuning by hippocampus and cortex can interact to guide choice behavior in complex, path-based environments where a correct turn choice varies across environmental locations, and as a function of recent experience.

AB  - The bioengineerined and whole matured human brain organoids stand as highly valuable three-dimensional in vitro brain-mimetic models to recapitulate in vivo brain development, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Various instructive signals affecting multiple biological processes including morphogenesis, developmental stages, cell fate transitions, cell migration, stem cell function and immune responses have been employed for generation of physiologically functional cerebral organoids. However, the current approaches for maturation require improvement for highly harvestable and functional cerebral organoids with reduced batch-to-batch variabilities. Here, we demonstrate two different engineering approaches, the rotating cell culture system (RCCS) microgravity bioreactor and a newly designed microfluidic platform (mu-platform) to improve harvestability, reproducibility and the survival of high-quality cerebral organoids and compare with those of traditional spinner and shaker systems. RCCS and mu-platform organoids have reached ideal sizes, approximately 95% harvestability, prolonged culture time with Ki-67 + /CD31 + /beta-catenin+ proliferative, adhesive and endothelial-like cells and exhibited enriched cellular diversity (abundant neural/glial/ endothelial cell population), structural brain morphogenesis, further functional neuronal identities (glutamate secreting glutamatergic, GABAergic and hippocampal neurons) and synaptogenesis (presynaptic-postsynaptic interaction) during whole human brain development. Both organoids expressed CD11b + /IBA1 + microglia and MBP + /OLIG2 + oligodendrocytes at high levels as of day 60. RCCS and mu-platform organoids showing high levels of physiological fidelity a high level of physiological fidelity can serve as functional preclinical models to test new therapeutic regimens for neurological diseases and benefit from multiplexing.
   Two engineering approaches, a rotating cell culture system (RCCS) and microfluidic platform (mu-platform), are presented with the goal of improving harvestability, scalability, reproducibility and survival of human brain organoids in long term culture.

AB  - In this research, the common microorganisms in chilled meat were used as the targeted antibacterial objects. Chitosan, pullulan, and carvacrol were chosen to prepare the edible antibacterial film. The effects of different concentrations of carvacrol on the microstructure, physical properties and antibacterial properties of the films were investigated. The results showed that the antibacterial activity of chitosan/pullulan film (CS/PU) was unsatisfactory, when carvacrol was added, the antibacterial activity of the chitosan/pullulan/carvacrol film (CS/ PU/CAR) improved significantly (p < 0.05), and the water vapor permeability (WVP) of the CS/PU/CAR decreased significantly (p < 0.05). When the carvacrol concentration was higher than 1.25% (w/v), the tensile strength and percentage elongation at break of the CS/PU/CAR increased significantly (p < 0.05), and the CS/ PU/CAR exhibited satisfying antibacterial activity against the common bacteria in chilled meat such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, the CS/PU/CAR film was applied to the preservation of chilled goat meat and extended the shelf life of goat meat to more than 15 days. These results suggested that the targeted CS/PU/CAR film can be used as biodegradable films for the active packaging of chilled meat.

AB  - The weighted gene co-expression network analysis and antisense oligonucleotide-mediated transient gene silencing revealed that CsAAP6 plays an important role in amino acid transport during tea shoot development.Nitrogen transport from source to sink is crucial for tea shoot growth and quality formation. Amino acid represents the major transport form of reduced nitrogen in the phloem between source and sink, but the molecular mechanism of amino acid transport from source leaves to new shoots is not yet clear. Therefore, the composition of metabolites in phloem exudates collected by the EDTA-facilitated method was analyzed through widely targeted metabolomics. A total of 326 metabolites were identified in the phloem exudates with the richest variety of amino acids and their derivatives (93), accounting for approximately 39.13% of the total metabolites. Moreover, through targeted metabolomics, it was found that the content of glutamine, glutamic acid, and theanine was the most abundant, and gradually increased with the development of new shoots. Meanwhile, transcriptome analysis suggested that the expression of amino acid transport genes changed significantly. The WGCNA analysis identified that the expression levels of CsAVT1, CsLHTL8, and CsAAP6 genes located in the MEterquoise module were positively correlated with the content of amino acids such as glutamine, glutamic acid, and theanine in phloem exudates. Reducing the CsAAP6 in mature leaves resulted in a significant decrease in the content of glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, leucine, asparagine, glutamine, and arginine in the phloem exudates, indicating that CsAAP6 played an important role in the source to sink transport of amino acids in the phloem. The research results will provide the theoretical basis and genetic resources for the improvement of nitrogen use efficiency and tea quality.[ABSTRACT]

AB  - Alveolar cleft repair is a key step in multiple disciplinary treatment for patients with cleft lip/and palate. Although autologous bone grafting has been used worldwide over the past half century, alternative advanced techniques, such as the use of bone substitutes and guided tissue regeneration, have shown their great potentials and have been recommended by a growing number of physicians and surgeons. The employment of new therapeutic approaches and devices in clinical routine requires tremendous experimental efforts and appropriate animal models with similar sizes and sites of deformity to that of human both anatomically and physiologically. The aim of this study is to develop a juvenile porcine model with surgically created alveolar clefts imitating congenital alveolar cleft in the cleft lip and palate. Alveolar defects between second incisor and canine were surgically created in two miniature pigs (unilateral cleft in P1 and P2); bilateral alveolar defects were surgically created between first and third incisor in one miniature pig (P3) using piezo surgery. Pigs were sacrificed (P1 at 1 month after the surgery and P2 at 3 months postoperatively) and the evaluation of defects were performed by assessing result from the computed tomography (CT) scan and histopathological examination. Postoperative CT scan results showed that the size of the defect remained the same, whereas the edge of the defect became irregular 3 months after the surgery. In all pig subjects, histopathological examination found no sign of osteogenesis in the area of defect, indicating that our surgical procedure was successful in establishing porcine models for alveolar cleft in congenital cleft lip and palate. In conclusion, we developed alveolar cleft in porcine models to mimic the size, site, and environment of congenital alveolar cleft in cleft lip and palate. The novel animal model can be employed in pilot studies for the purpose of optimizing the current surgical treatment techniques as well as developing new treatment procedures and test the bone substitute materials. The bilateral model can be applied in further control studies. Impact statementCancellous iliac bone graft was the most popular surgical technique as well as the gold standard to reconstruct alveolar cleft. Nevertheless, several disadvantages exist regarding the additional surgical field of donor side and delayed age of alveolar bone grafting. Bone tissue-engineered strategy offers a promising alternative to address the gap in the current limitation of autologous bone to treat the growing craniofacial skeleton. Among different species of laboratory animals, porcine is suitable for oral and maxillofacial bone and implant-related research, where alveolar defect can be surgically developed simulating the size and site of alveolar cleft occurring together with cleft lip and palate. In this proposal, a reproducible porcine model of alveolar bone defect imitating congenital alveolar cleft during craniofacial growing stage is successfully constructed that will show great potential application in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model for bilateral alveolar cleft can be potentially applied in a controlled study in future.

AB  - Many studies of animal distributions use habitat and climactic variables to explain patterns of observed space use. However, without behavioral information, we can only speculate as to why and how these characteristics are important to species persistence.
   Animal-borne accelerometer and magnetometer data loggers can be used to detect behaviors and when coupled with telemetry improve our understanding of animal space use and habitat requirements. However, these loggers collect tremendous quantities of data requiring automated machine learning techniques to identify patterns in the data. Supervised machine learning requires a set of training signals with known behaviors to train the model to identify the unique signal characteristics associated with each behavior. In contrast, unsupervised approaches aggregate unlabeled signals into groups based purely on signal similarity but, without additional information, do not identify specific behaviors.
   In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for interpreting uncertainty in machine learning techniques-the probability profile-and demonstrate how to post hoc identify behaviors within signal groups. We assess model performance using a matrix-based measure of dissimilarity. We used a Random Forest (RF) and a clustered self-organizing map (CSOM) for comparison and demonstrate the use of a behavioral profile for each using a data set of high-frequency accelerometer and magnetometer data collected from 7 captive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) moving in a 1 ha outdoor enclosure.
   We found that the RF had more discrimination than the CSOM which had fewer clusters associated with high probabilities of a single behavior (>50%). The leave-p-out cross validation statistic of the probability matrix (<(L-1)over bar>) indicated that there was an average maximum dissimilarity of 20% and 65% between the training and test data sets for the RF and CSOM methods, respectively.
   Using a probability profile to describe groups predicted from machine learning allows the variation and error inherent in behavioral prediction to be incorporated directly into the model to better reflect the nuances of behavior derived from accelerometer and/or magnetometer signals. We discuss the data requirements of this framework, demonstrate its application to field data, highlight critical assumptions and caveats, and examine how it may be used to generate new ecological inference.

AB  - Proteolytic enzymes, which play a crucial role in peptide bond cleavage, are widely applied in various industries. In this study, protease-producing bacteria were isolated and characterized from marine sediments collected from the Yellow Sea, China. Comprehensive screening and 16S rDNA sequencing identified a promising G4 strain as Bacillus atrophaeus. Following meticulous optimization of fermentation conditions and medium composition via response surface methodology, protease production using strain G4 was significantly enhanced by 64%, achieving a yield of 3258 U/mL. The G4 protease exhibited optimal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 7.5, demonstrating moderate thermal stability with 52% residual activity after 30-min incubation at 50 degrees C-characteristics typical of an alkaline protease. Notably, the enzyme retained over 79% activity across a broad pH range (6-11) and exhibited excellent salt tolerance, maintaining over 50% activity in a saturated NaCl solution. Inhibition by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, confirmed its classification as a serine protease. The enzyme's potential in generating bioactive peptides was further demonstrated through hydrolysis of sheep (Ovis aries) placenta, resulting in a hydrolysate with notable antioxidant properties. The hydrolysate exhibited a 64% superoxide anion scavenging activity, surpassing that of reduced glutathione. These findings expand the current understanding of Bacillus atrophaeus G4 proteases and provide a foundation for innovative sheep placenta utilization with potential industrial applications.

AB  - The combination of optimal nitrate and l-cysteine to safely mitigate rumen methane (CH4) emissions in ruminants was studied in an open-circuit respiration head-hood system using four rumen-fistulated Suffolk wethers in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Four treatments were set up Control: fed on lucerne hay cubes without nitrate and l-cysteine, Nitrate: fed on lucerne hay cubes with 0.18 % NO3--N in dry matter (DM)), N + Cys-H: fed on lucerne hay cubes supplemented with 0.18 % NO3--N and 0.74 % l-cysteine (equivalent to half the upper limit of effective S requirement in DM), and N + Cys-Q: fed on lucerne hay cubes supplemented with 0.18 % NO3--N and 0.37 % l-cysteine (equivalent to 1/4 of the upper limit of effective S requirement in DM). In this experiment, the ingested nitrate at a subclinical concentration/s (0.18 % in DM) increased by 11.2 % mean methemoglobin value and alleviated rumen methanogenesis by 47 %. Administration of l-cysteine set at 0.74 % and 0.37 % in DM reduced by 68 % and 58 % methemoglobin formed by nitrate alone, respectively (P < 0.05). However, daily mitigation of CH4 emissions decreased by 35 % with the addition of l-cysteine at both addition concentration/s compared with Control. The results of this study suggest that mitigation of enteric methane emissions by the combination of nitrate and l-cysteine can be achieved by feeding diets in which the nitrate content is maintained at around 0.18 % NO3--N in DM and l-cysteine addition is adjusted to 0.37-0.74 % in DM. This method would be recommended as a safe, efficient, and practical way to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions leading to increased productivity while reducing the increased N excretion that causes N2O emissions.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. mixed with porcine cardiac blood (PCB-DS) is mainly employed for the treatment of brain ischemia-induced mental disturbances, palpitations and phlegm confusion based on the traditional principle of Menghe medical sect. PCB is the guide to DS and enhances the effect of DS. However, the potential mechanism of PCB-DS preventing cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) from the perspective of oxidative stress induced cell apoptosis remains unknown.Aim of the study: To investigate the pharmacological activity and molecular mechanism of PCB-DS against CIRI.Materials and methods: DS samples processed with different methods were prepared and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was employed for qualitative analysis of the respective processing product. The middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion model was then established to investigate the pharmacological activities of PCB-DS. Pathological changes in the rat brain were observed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), hematoxylin-eosin, and TUNEL staining. The levels of IL-6, IL-1 & beta;, and TNF-& alpha; were detected by ELISA to evaluate the inflammatory damage. Metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid was further used to explore the potential mechanism of PCB-DS in pre-venting CIRI. Based on this, the levels of oxidative stress-related lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. The protein levels of PI3K, AKT, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-9 proteins of the cerebral infarct zone were finally measured by western blotting.Results: Forty-seven components were identified in four processing products. Compared to DS, the content of total aqueous components in PCB-DS was significantly increased including salvianolic acid B isomer, salvianolic acid D, salvianolic acid F, and salvianolic acid H/I/J. Among the DS, DS processed with wine, DS processed with pig blood, and DS processed with porcine cardiac blood, PCB-DS best alleviated the CIRI through the neurological score, brain infarct volume, brain histopathology and the levels of inflammatory factors in the brain. Twenty-five significant metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid were screened out between the sham and I/R groups. They were mainly involved in the beta-alanine metabolism, histidine metabolism, and lysine degradation, which indicated that PCB-DS may inhibit oxidative stress-induced apoptosis to achieve treating ischemic stroke. The results of biomedical examination showed that PCB-DS could alleviate oxidative damage, significantly downregulate the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9, and upregulate the expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and Bcl-2.

AB  - Impaired gas exchange close to labor causes perinatal asphyxia (PA), a neurodevelopmental impairment factor. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) proved neuroprotective in experimental brain injury and neurodegeneration models. This study aimed to evaluate PEA effects on the immature-brain, i.e., early neuroprotection by PEA in an experimental PA paradigm. Newborn rats were placed in a 37 degrees C water bath for 19 min to induce PA. PEA 10 mg/kg, s.c., was administered within the first hour of life. Neurobehavioral responses were assessed from postnatal day 1 (P1) to postnatal day 21 (P21), recording the day of appearance of several reflexes and neurological signs. Hippocampal CA1 area ultrastructure was examined using electron microscopy. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), phosphorylated high and medium molecular weight neurofilaments (pNF H/M), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot at P21. Over the first 3 weeks of life, PA rats showed late gait, negative geotaxis and eye-opening onset, and delayed appearance of air-righting, auditory startle, sensory eyelid, forelimb placing, and grasp reflexes. On P21, the hippocampal CA1 area showed signs of neuronal degeneration and MAP-2 deficit. PEA treatment reduced PA-induced hippocampal damage and normalized the time of appearance of gait, air-righting, placing, and grasp reflexes. The outcome of this study might prove useful in designing intervention strategies to reduce early neurodevelopmental delay following PA.

AB  - Stressful life event is closely associated with depression, thus strategies that blunt or prevent the negative effect stress on the brain might benefits for the treatment of depression. Although previous study showed the role of protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) in inflammation related depression, its involvement in the neuropathology of chronic stress induced depression is still unknown. We tried to explore whether block the PERK pathway would alleviate the animals' depression-like behavior induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) and investigate the underlying mechanism. The CRS-exposed mice exhibited depression-like behavior, including anhedonia in the sucrose preference test (SPT), and increased immobility time in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swim test (FST). ISRIB administration for 2 weeks significantly improved the depression-like behavior in male mice exposed to CRS, which was manifested by markedly increasing the sucrose preference and reducing the immobility time in the FST and TST. However, we observed that exposure to the same dose of ISRIB in CRS female mice only showed improved anhedonia-like deficits,leaving unaltered improvement in the FST and TST. Mechanically, we found that ISRIB reversed the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, indicating decreased levels of serum corticosterone, reduced hippocampal glucocorticoidreceptor (GR) expression and expression of FosB in hypothalamic paraventricularnucleus (PVN), which was accompanied by preserved hippocampal neurogenesis. The present findings further expand the potential role of ER stress in depression and provide important details for a therapeutic path forward for PERK inhibitors in mood disorders.

AB  - The perirhinal cortex (PRC), subdivided into areas 35 and 36, belongs to the parahippocampal regions that provide polysensory input to the hippocampus. Efferent and afferent connections along its rostro-caudal axis, and of areas 35 and 36, are extremely diverse. Correspondingly functional tasks in which the PRC participates are manifold. The PRC engages, for example, in sensory information processing, object recognition, and attentional processes. It was previously reported that layer II of the caudal area 35 may be critically involved in the encoding of large-scale objects. In the present study we aimed to disambiguate the roles of the different PRC layers, along with areas 35 and 36, and the rostro-caudal compartments of the PRC, in processing information about objects of different dimensions. Here, we compared effects on information encoding triggered by learning about subtle and discretely visible (microscale) object information and overt, highly visible landmark (macroscale) information. To this end, nuclear expression of the immediate early gene Arc was evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Increased nuclear Arc expression occurred in layers III and V-VI of the middle and caudal parts of area 35 in response to both novel microscale and macroscale object exposure. By contrast, a significant increase in Arc expression occurred in area 36 only in response to microscale objects. These results indicate that area 36 is specifically involved in the encoding of small and less prominently visible items. In contrast, area 35 engages globally (layer III to VI) in the encoding of object information independent of item dimensions.

AB  - Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) is the most common functional dyspepsia (FD) subtype. Early satiety is one of the cardinal symptoms of the PDS subtype in FD patients. The heterogeneity of symptoms in FD patients hampered therapy for patients based on specific symptoms, necessitating a symptom-based understanding of the pathophysiology of FD. To investigate the correlation between reward circuit and symptom severity of PDS patients, seed (Nucleus accumbens, NAc, a key node in the reward circuit) based resting-state functional connectivity (FC) was applied in the neuroimaging data analysis. The results demonstrated that the patients with PDS manifested strengthened FC between NAc and the caudate, putamen, pallidum, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula. Moreover, the FC between NAc and ACC, insula, thalamus, and hippocampus exhibited significant positive associations with symptom severity. More importantly, the strengthened FC between NAc and the ACC, insula, amygdala, and hippocampus were found associated with the early satiety symptom of patients with PDS. This study indicated that the altered FC of reward circuit regions may play a role in the pathophysiology of patients with PDS, and some of the aberrant NAc-based FC within the reward circuit were more related to the early satiety of patients with PDS. These findings improve our symptombased understanding of the central pathophysiology of FD, lay the groundwork for an objective diagnosis of FD, and shed light on the precise prescription for treating FD based on symptoms.

AB  - Temperature is a key factor influencing plant growth and productivity; however, temperature fluctuations can cause detrimental effects on crop growth. This study aimed to assess the effect of seed priming on Camelina sativa L. under heat stress. Experimental treatments were comprised of; seed priming including, no-priming, hydropriming (distilled water priming), and osmopriming (thiourea applications at 500 ppm), heat stress (control = 20 degrees C and heat stress = 32 degrees C), and camelina varieties (7126 and 8046). Heat stress hammered crop growth as relative water content and photosynthetic rate were reduced by 35.9% and 49.05% in 7126, respectively, and 25.6% and 41.2% in 8046 as compared with control-no thiourea applied. However, osmopriming with thiourea improved the root and shoot length, and biomass production compared to control-no application under heat stress, with more improvement in variety 8046 as compared with 7126. Moreover, the maximum values of gas exchange and water relations were recorded at thiourea priming and no stress as compared with no-priming under heat stress that helped to improve seed yield by 12% in 7126 and 15% in 8046, respectively. Among the varieties, camelina variety 8046 showed better performance than 7126 by producing higher seed yield especially when subjected to thiourea priming. In conclusion, thiourea seed priming helped the plants to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress by upregulating plant physiological attributes that lead to maintain camelina seed yield.

AB  - Simple Summary Bombus breviceps is an important native species of bumblebee in southern China. As a pollinator, it has the potential for domestication and commercial rearing. In this study, in order to identify the nutritional requirements for the egg-laying, hatching, and colony foundation stages, we selected three common local types of pollen, including camellia pollen, oilseed rape pollen, and apricot pollen, as well as mixtures of them, to feed B. breviceps queens to evaluate the reproductive performance, and feasibility of these pollens as a diet and the nutritional requirements. The results showed that the pollen with a higher essential amino acid content had advantages in laying time, the number of eggs laid, larval ejection, and the time of first worker emergence, while the pollen with a higher crude protein content had advantages in the time the colony took to reach ten workers. These results may guide the selection of feed in B. breviceps artificial feeding and help to explore the nutritional requirements in oviposition and the colony stage from the perspective of conventional pollen. Pollen is an important source of nutrition for bumblebees to survive, reproduce, and raise their offspring. To explore the nutritional requirements for the egg laying and hatching of queenright Bombus breviceps colonies, camellia pollen, oilseed rape pollen, apricot pollen, and mixtures of two or three types of pollen in equal proportions were used to feed the queens in this study. The results showed that the camellia pollen with a higher essential amino acid content was superior to the pollen with a lower essential amino acid content in the initial egg-laying time (p < 0.05), egg number (p < 0.05), larval ejection (p < 0.01), time of first worker emergence (p < 0.05), and the average weight of workers in the first batch (p < 0.01). It took less time for colonies under the camellia pollen and camellia-oilseed rape-apricot pollen mix treatments, both with a higher crude protein content, to reach ten workers in the colony (p < 0.01). On the contrary, the queens fed apricot pollen never laid an egg, and larvae fed oilseed rape pollen were all ejected-both pollens with a lower essential amino acid content. The results emphasize that the diet should be rationally allocated to meet the nutritional needs of local bumblebees at various stages when guiding them to lay eggs, hatch, and develop a colony.

AB  - Amygdala activation by emotional arousal during memory formation can prioritize events for long-term memory. Building upon our prior demonstration that brief electrical stimulation to the human amygdala reliably improved long-term recognition memory for images of neutral objects without eliciting an emotional response, our study aims to explore and describe individual differences and stimulation-related factors in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Thirty-one patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for intractable epilepsy were shown neutral object images paired with direct amygdala stimulation during encoding with recognition memory tested immediately and one day later. Adding to our prior sample, we found an overall memory enhancement effect without subjective emotional arousal at the one-day delay, but not at the immediate delay, for previously stimulated objects compared to not stimulated objects. Importantly, we observed a larger variation in performance across this larger sample than our initial sample, including some participants who showed a memory impairment for stimulated objects. Of the explored individual differences, the factor that most accounted for variability in memory modulation was each participant's pre-operative memory performance. Worse memory performance on standardized neuropsychological tests was associated with a stronger susceptibility to memory modulation in a positive or negative direction. Sex differences and the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during testing also accounted for some variance in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Given the potential and challenges of this memory modulation approach, we discuss additional individual and stimulation factors that we hope will differentiate between memory enhancement and impairment to further optimize the potential of amygdala-mediated memory enhancement for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Intracranial electrical self-stimulation (ICSS) is a useful procedure in animal research. This form of administration ensures that areas of the brain reward system (BRS) are being functionally activated, since the animals must perform an operant response to self-administer an electrical stimulus. Rewarding post-training ICSS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), an important system of the BRS, has been shown to consistently improve rats' acquisition and retention in several learning tasks. In the clinical setting, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of different targets is currently being used to palliate the memory impairment that occurs in some neurodegenerative diseases. However, the stimulation of the MFB has only been used to treat emotional alterations, not memory disorders. Since DBS stimulation treatments in humans are exclusively administered by external sources, studies comparing the efficacy of that form of application to a self-administered stimulation are key to the translationality of ICSS. This protocol compares self-administered (ICSS) and experimenter-administered (EAS) stimulation of the MFB on the spatial Morris Water Maze task (MWM). c-Fos immunohistochemistry procedure was carried out to evaluate neural activation after retention. Results show that the stimulation of the MFB improves the MWM task regardless of the form of administration, although some differences in c-Fos expression were found. Present results suggest that MFB-ICSS is a valid animal model to study the effects of MFB electrical stimulation on memory, which could guide clinical applications of DBS. The present protocol is a useful guide for establishing ICSS behavior in rats, which could be used as a learning and memory-modulating treatment.

AB  - IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in the US. Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-1-7), an endogenous peptide, acts at the G protein coupled MAS1 receptors (MASR) to inhibit inflammatory mediators and decrease reactive oxygen species within the CNS. Few studies have identified whether Ang-(1-7) decreases cognitive impairment following closed TBI. This study examined the therapeutic effect of Ang-(1-7) on secondary injury observed in a murine model of mild TBI (mTBI) in a closed skull, single injury model. Materials and methodsMale mice (n = 108) underwent a closed skull, controlled cortical impact injury. Two hours after injury, mice were administered either Ang-(1-7) (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 12), continuing through day 5 post-TBI, and tested for cognitive impairment on days 1-5 and 18. pTau, Tau, GFAP, and serum cytokines were measured at multiple time points. Animals were observed daily for cognition and motor coordination via novel object recognition. Brain sections were stained and evaluated for neuronal injury. ResultsAdministration of Ang-(1-7) daily for 5 days post-mTBI significantly increased cognitive function as compared to saline control-treated animals. Cortical and hippocampal structures showed less damage in the presence of Ang-(1-7), while Ang-(1-7) administration significantly changed the expression of pTau and GFAP in cortical and hippocampal regions as compared to control. DiscussionThese are among the first studies to demonstrate that sustained administration of Ang-(1-7) following a closed-skull, single impact mTBI significantly improves neurologic outcomes, potentially offering a novel therapeutic modality for the prevention of long-term CNS impairment following such injuries.

AB  - In the present study, a pilot-scale plug flow reactor was used for anaerobic co-digestion of swine wastewater (SWW) and deep bedding (DB). The reactor was operated with organic loads between 315.6 and 782.8 kgCOD d(-1) in winter and summer. The experiment was conducted in 4 phases with the addition of DB in SWW in proportions of 0, 5, 10 and 15 tons. Biogas productions 3 times higher were recorded when 15 ton of DB were applied, generating 634.5 kWh d(-1) of bioenergy in summer and 267 kWh d(-1) in winter. Application of DB in winter promoted stability in biogas production. CH4 concentrations from 60 to 68% were recorded in winter and from 61 to 72% in summer. Methane yield was maximum in summer with application of 15 ton of DB (0.343 m(3) KgCOD(Rem)-(1)). Removals of volatile solids and COD were within the ranges of 60-70 and 61-84%, respectively. There was no accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), nor pronounced decrease of pH in the reactor. The biofertilizer produced in all experimental stages can be used for agricultural cultivation with application rate defined based on the concentrations of Na and K to avoid soil salinization.

AB  - Endometritis is a prevalent disease in sows that strongly reduces reproductive performance. Its causes are complex and multifaceted, making disease management challenging without targeted measures. To provide a scientific basis for developing targeted disease management strategies, we examined vaginal microbiota diversity and its correlation with serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in sows with endometritis and the main pathogenic bacterial species contributing to endometritis. Fourteen post-weaning sows selected at a pig farm in Beijing, China, were randomly divided into healthy (C) and endometritis (E) groups. Levels of cytokines including interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Vaginal microbiota species were identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Concentrations of IL-1 alpha and IL-6 in serum and vaginal microbial diversity were significantly increased in group E versus group C. The relative abundance of Firmicutes exhibited a marked increase in group E, whereas that of Fusobacteriota was significantly decreased. The composition and relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera differed between the two groups, and the dominant genera in group E were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, UCG-005, UCG-002, Terrisporobacter, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. IL-6 was significantly positively correlated with Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Terrisporobacter in group E. These results suggest that vaginal microbiota abundance and diversity and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels are increased in sows with endometritis, and the latter are closely associated with vaginal microbiota abundance and composition. This study provides a foundation for investigating the pathogenesis of endometritis in sows and a theoretical basis for disease prevention and treatment.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that exhibits great host diversity. The primary means of transmission of the virus in low- and middle-income countries is contaminated water, often due to a lack of access to proper sanitation, which leads to faecal contamination of water sources. Environmental surveillance is an important tool that can be used to monitor virus circulation and as an early warning system for outbreaks. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of HEV in wastewater, surface water (rivers and standpipe/ablution water), and effluent from a piggery in South Africa. A total of 536 water samples were screened for HEV using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 21.8% (117/536) of the wastewater, river, and ablution water samples tested positive for HEV, whereas 74.4% (29/39) of the samples from the piggery tested positive. Genotyping revealed sequences belonging to HEV genotypes 3 (98%, 53/54) and 4 (2%, 1/54), with subtypes 3c, 3f, and 4b being identified.

AB  - Major depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. This is mainly related to the disorder chronic and recurrent nature, and to high rates of refractoriness to treatment. Limited efficacy with currently available antidepressants highlights the need for more effective options for treating drug-resistant patients and emphasizes the importance of developing specific preclinical models for treatment-resistant populations. Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is commonly defined as failure to respond to two or more trials of antidepressants. In this study, we investigated the effect of fluoxetine treatment for fourteen days on the depressive-like behavior and the oxidative and inflammatory parameters of mice submitted to chronic corticostemne administration. After 21 days of subcutaneous corticosterone administration (20 mg/kg/day) and 14 days of oral fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg/day, started on day 7 of induction protocol), we separated animals into two groups according to the tail suspension test (TST) results: antidepressant responders (good response to antidepressant, GRA) and non-responders (resistance to antidepressant, AR). Forced swimming test (FST), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and open field test (OFT) were performed. We found that animals classified as AR (i.e., those with higher immobility values in the TST) demonstrated anxiety-like behavior in the EPMT, increased H2O2 levels, and decreased catalase activity in the hippocampus, as well as increased serum levels of IL-17 and IFN-gamma. Our findings suggest that a redox imbalance in the hippocampus, combined with increased levels of peripheral IL-17 and INF-gamma, may be involved with an impaired response to fluoxetine.

AB  - Background Large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1), one of the predominant components of the Hippo pathway, has been characterized as a key player controlling the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, including gastric cancer (GC) cells. However, the mechanism by which the functional stability of LATS1 is modulated has yet to be elucidated. Methods Online prediction tools, immunohistochemistry and western blotting assays were used to explore the expression of WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase 2 (WWP2) in GC cells and tissues. Gain- and loss-of-function assays, as well as rescue experiments were performed to determine the role of the WWP2-LATS1 axis in cell proliferation and invasion. Additionally, the mechanisms involving WWP2 and LATS1 were assessed by coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP), immunofluorescence, cycloheximide and in vivo ubiquitination assays. Results Our results demonstrate a specific interaction between LATS1 and WWP2. WWP2 was markedly upregulated and correlated with disease progression and a poor prognosis in GC patients. Moreover, ectopic WWP2 expression facilitated the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. Mechanistically, WWP2 interacts with LATS1, resulting in its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, leading to increased transcriptional activity of YAP1. Importantly, LATS1 depletion abolished the suppressive effects of WWP2 knockdown on GC cells. Furthermore, WWP2 silencing attenuated tumor growth by regulating the Hippo-YAP1 pathway in vivo. Conclusions Our results define the WWP2-LATS1 axis as a critical regulatory mechanism of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway that promotes GC development and progression.

AB  - The fauna from the Early Acheulean site of Gombore IB is relatively abundant but quite fragmented. As in the other sites of Melka Kunture, it is dominated by hippos and alcelaphin bovids, followed by equids. Suids are rare, and all other taxa (i.e., rhinos, giraffids, tragelaphins, primates) are virtually absent. In spite of the presence of forested areas nearby, the taphocenosis sampled an open-country faunal assemblage. The fauna resembles that of the nearby site of Garba IVD, but exact contemporaneity is unlikely.

AB  - The musculotendon work contributions across all joints during jumping by kangaroo rats are not well understood. Namely, measures of external joint work do not provide information on the contributions from individual muscles or in-series elastic structures. In this study, we examined the functional roles of a major ankle extensor muscle, the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), and a major knee extensor muscle, the vastus lateralis (VL), through in vivo sonomicrometry and electromyography techniques, during vertical jumping by kangaroo rats. Our data showed that both muscles increased shortening and activity with higher jumps. We found that knee angular velocity and VL muscle shortening velocity were coupled in time. In contrast, the ankle angular velocity and LG muscle shortening velocity were decoupled, and rapid joint extension near the end of the jump produced high power outputs at the ankle joint. Further, the decoupling of muscle and joint kinematics allowed the LG muscle to prolong the period of shortening velocity near optimal velocity, which likely enabled the muscle to sustain maximal power generation. These observations were consistent with an LG tendon that is much more compliant than that of the VL.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to poor growth of a fetus during pregnancy due to deficient maternal nutrition or oxygen supply. Supplementation of a mother's diet with antioxidants, such as hydroxytyrosol (HTX), has been proposed to ameliorate the adverse phenotypes of IUGR. In the present study, sows were treated daily with or without 1.5 mg of HTX per kilogram of feed from day 35 of pregnancy (at 30% of the total gestational period), and fetuses were sampled at day 100 of gestation. Fetuses were classified as normal body weight (NBW) or low body weight (LBW) as a consequence of IUGR, constituting four groups: NBW-Control, NBW-HTX, LBW-Control, and LBW-HTX. The brain was removed, and the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex were rapidly dissected. Neuronal markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, and a decrease in the number of mature neurons in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) and the Dentate Gyrus (DG) regions was observed in LBW fetuses together with a higher number of immature neurons and other alterations in neuronal morphology. Furthermore, IUGR conditions altered the neurotransmitter (NT) profile, since an increase in the serotonin (5-HT) pathway was observed in LBW fetuses. Supplementation with HTX was able to reverse the morphological and neurochemical changes, leading both characteristics to values similar to those of NBW fetuses.

AB  - In learning and memory tasks, immune overactivation is associated with impaired performance, while normal immune activation is associated with optimal performance. In one specific domain of memory, context discrimination memory, peripheral immune stimulation has been shown to impair performance on the context -object discrimination memory task in male rats. In order to evaluate potential sex differences in this task, as well as potential mechanisms for the memory impairment, we evaluated the ability of peripheral immune stimulation to impair task performance in both males and females. Next, we examined whether treatment with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), a receptor antagonist for the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) -18, was able to rescue the memory deficit. We examined microglial morphology in the hippocampus and cytokine mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus and the periphery. Male rats displayed memory impairment in response to LPS, and this impairment was not rescued by IL-1ra. Female rats did not have significant memory impairments and IL-1ra administration improved memory following inflammation. A subset of cytokines and chemokines were increased only in LPS-treated males. Inflammation alone did not alter microglia morphology, but IL-1ra did in certain sub-regions of the hippocampus. Together, these results indicate that sex differences exist in the ability of a peripheral immune stimulus to influence context discrimination memory and specific cytokine signals may be altered in impaired males. This study highlights the importance of sex differences in response to inflammatory challenges, especially related to memory impairments in context discrimination memory.

AB  - Disorders such as Trichotillomania (TTM) and skin-picking disorder (SPD) are associated with reduced flexibility and increased internally focused attention. While the basal ganglia have been hypothesized to play a key role, the mechanisms underlying learning and flexible accommodation of new information is unclear. Using a Bayesian Learning Model, we evaluated the neural basis of learning and accommodation in individuals with TTM and/or SPD. Participants were 127 individuals with TTM and/or SPD (TTM/SPD) recruited from three sites (age 18-57, 84% female) and 26 healthy controls (HC). During fMRI, participants completed a shape-button associative learning and reversal fMRI task. Above-threshold clusters were identified where the Initial Learning-Reversals BOLD activation contrast differed significantly (p < .05 FDR-corrected) between the two groups. A priori, effects were anticipated in predefined ROIs in bilateral basal ganglia, with exploratory analyses in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Relative to HC, individuals with TTM/SPD demonstrated reduced activation during initial learning compared to reversal learning in the right basal ganglia. Similarly, individuals with TTM/SPD demonstrated reduced activation during initial learning compared to reversal learning in several clusters in the dlPFC and dACC compared to HC. Individuals with TTM/SPD may form or reform visual stimulus-motor response associations through different brain mechanisms than healthy controls. The former exhibit altered activation within the basal ganglia, dlPFC, and dACC during an associative learning task compared to controls, reflecting reduced frontal-subcortical activation during initial learning. Future work should determine whether these neural deficits may be restored with targeted treatment.

AB  - Plant feeding by omnivorous predators may affect their development and survival rate, as well as their dispersal behavior after release in the target patch. In this study, we determined whether soybean or corn seedlings could be used as insectary plants to enhance the establishment of Arma chinensis and improve its suitability as a natural enemy of pest insects. We tested the development, nymphal survival rate, predation rate, number of eggs laid, and dispersal of A. chinensis on soybean, corn, and tobacco in laboratory and field experiments. Results showed that A. chinensis reared on soybean developed faster and had greater survival rates during the nymphal stage as compared to those reared on corn and tobacco. Adult A. chinensis fed least on Spodoptera litura larvae and laid the greatest number of eggs on soybean seedlings. Arma chinensis dispersed faster and spent less time in the greenhouse when provided with corn as a host, while the retention time of A. chinensis in the target field was extended when provided with soybean as a host. In addition, a more uniform distribution of A. chinesis on a higher proportion of plants was observed when soybean was provided as a host. These results indicate that soybean is a potential insectary plant that could be used during the early stages of A. chinensis release when prey is scarce or absent.

AB  - Breast cancer represents the most common cancer diagnosis among World Trade Center (WTC)-exposed community members, residents, and cleanup workers enrolled in the WTC Environmental Health Center (WTC EHC). The primary aims of this study were (1) to compare blood DNA methylation profiles of WTC-exposed community members with breast cancer and WTC-unexposed pre-diagnostic breast cancer blood samples, and (2) to compare the DNA methylation differences among the WTC EHC breast cancer cases and WTC-exposed cancer-free controls. Gene pathway enrichment analyses were further conducted. There were significant differences in DNA methylation between WTC-exposed breast cancer cases and unexposed prediagnostic breast cancer cases. The top differentially methylated genes were Intraflagellar Transport 74 (IFT74), WD repeat-containing protein 90 (WDR90), and Oncomodulin (OCM), which are commonly upregulated in tumors. Probes associated with established tumor suppressor genes (ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, and TP53) were hypermethylated among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to the unexposed group. When comparing WTC EHC breast cancer cases vs. cancer-free controls, there appeared to be global hypomethylation among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to exposed controls. Functional pathway analysis revealed enrichment of several gene pathways in WTC-exposed breast cancer cases including endocytosis, proteoglycans in cancer, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, focal adhesion, calcium signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, mTOR, Hippo, and oxytocin signaling. The results suggest potential epigenetic links between WTC exposure and breast cancer in local community members enrolled in the WTC EHC program.

AB  - Two trials evaluated the effects of dietary protease inclusion in weaned piglets fed diets with or without crude protein (CP) reduction, focusing on performance, intestinal health, and amino acid digestibility. In Trial I, 270 piglets (21-63 days) received six treatments: control (PC), PC with 100 g/ton protease A (PC+A), CP reduced by 1.0% (NC1) or 1.5% (NC1.5), NC1.5 with 50 g/ton protease A (NC1.5+A), and NC1.5 with 50 g/ton protease B (NC1.5+B). PC+A improved weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion compared with NC1.5+A. The incidence of diarrhea was reduced in animals fed protease-supplemented diets (PC+A, NC1.5+A and NC1.5+B). PC had greater ileal villus height than NC1.5+B, and PC+A showed a higher jejunal villus-to-crypt ratio than reduced CP groups. NC1.5+B increased jejunal expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and haptoglobin. In Trial II, 12 ileal-cannulated piglets received diets with or without protease A. Protease improved the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of methionine+cysteine and tryptophan but reduced the SID of glycine and proline. While protease supplementation can improve some amino acids (Met+Cys and Thr) protein digestibility, our findings suggest it cannot fully replace careful amino acid balancing in CP-reduced diets. However, protease-supplemented diets were associated with improved intestinal morphometry and a reduced incidence of diarrhea.

AB  - Against the backdrop of the almost total failure of conventional physical fences to prevent deaths due to human-elephant conflict and elephant-train collision, management of the problem requires novel approaches. The elephant is a giant and intelligent animal, who, as has been observed through experience, cannot be effectively confined to an area by physical barriers, most of which are built without even considering long-established elephant passes. Instead, human habitats and facilities, including highways, should be pre-planned following an overall strategy to suitably assign natural resources to each party such that natural habitats are disturbed as little as possible. Hence, we envisage the need for a virtual elephant fence as part of the aforesaid strategy to warn elephants that a certain area is not appropriate for them to be present in or best for the safety of the herd. The present study involved in-depth experimentation to investigate the effects of multiple stimuli on real elephants based on the known elephant responses to such stimuli. The proposed system is an autonomous system that detects the presence of elephants, generates alarms for concerned parties, and coordinatively and tactically repels the animals back to safer areas. Experiment results indicated that the sound of a drone and the sound of tiger growls can both exert a strong deterrent effect on elephants. The sound of bees and the low-frequency burst yielded similar results in terms of encounter and withdrawal reactions. The resulting insights may lay a foundation for a novel approach toward the management of human-elephant conflict and elephant-train collisions.

AB  - Sex differences are apparent in numerous behavioural characteristics. In order to compare and characterise male and female variability of exploratory behaviour, 365 male and 401 female rats were assessed in a task where a bimodal response distribution had previously been established in males. Female rats had significantly higher exploratory activity, and presented normal distribution of the behaviour, very differently from the bimodal distribution of males. No major effect of litter or oestrous cycle was detected. Several differences between male and female rats were found in monoamine metabolism measured ex vivo. Male rats had lower levels of dopamine (DA) in frontal cortex, and higher levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in raphe area; higher levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in dorsal striatum but lower levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in locus coeruleus area, 5-HIAA levels were also lower in hippocampus as compared to females. Males had higher noradrenaline (NA) levels in hippocampus and lower normetanephrine (NMN) levels in striatum, in both brain regions male animals had lower NMN/NA ratio. No sex difference was found in accumbens. The only brain region with an interaction between sex and the expression of exploratory activity was raphe: Here 5-HT levels were lower, and DOPAC levels and DOPAC/DA and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios higher in low exploring male but not female rats. Conclusively, female rats not only display higher levels of exploration but the population distribution of this behaviour is distinct; this may be related to differences in the monoaminergic systems between female and male animals.

AB  - Animals may limit the cost of stress responses during key life history stages such as breeding and molting by reducing tissue sensitivity to energy-mobilizing stress hormones (e.g. cortisol). We measured expression of genes encoding glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1), GR inhibitor (FKBP5) and cortisol-inactivating enzyme (HSD11B2) in blubber and muscle of northern elephant seals before and after stress axis stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) early and late in a fasting period associated with molting. ACTH elevated cortisol levels for >24 h and increased FKBP5 and HSD11B2 expression while downregulating NR3C1 expression in blubber and muscle, suggesting robust intracellular negative feedback in peripheral tissues. This feedback was maintained over prolonged fasting, despite differences in baseline cortisol and gene expression levels between early and late molt, suggesting that fasting adapted animals use multiple tissue-specific, intracellular negative feedback mechanisms to modulate downstream impacts of acute stress responses during key life history stages.

AB  - Objectives The action of stress hormones, mainly glucocorticoids, starts and coordinates the systemic response to stressful events. The HPA axis activity is predicated on information processing and modulation by upstream centres, such as the hippocampus where adult-born neurons (hABN) have been reported to be an important component in the processing and integration of new information. Still, it remains unclear whether and how hABN regulates HPA axis activity and CORT production, particularly when considering sex differences. Materials and Methods Using both sexes of a transgenic rat model of cytogenesis ablation (GFAP-Tk rat model), we examined the endocrinological and behavioural effects of disrupting the generation of new astrocytes and neurons within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Results Our results show that GFAP-Tk male rats present a heightened acute stress response. In contrast, GFAP-Tk female rats have increased corticosterone secretion at nadir, a heightened, yet delayed, response to an acute stress stimulus, accompanied by neuronal hypertrophy in the basal lateral amygdala and increased expression of the glucocorticoid receptors in the ventral DG. Conclusions Our results reveal that hABN regulation of the HPA axis response is sex-differentiated.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers are normally white, even though the leaves could be purple. We previously discovered a specific variety with purple leaves and flowers. In the face of such a phenomenon, researchers usually focus on the mechanism of color formation but ignore the change of aroma. The purple tea flowers contain more anthocyanins, which belong to flavonoids. Meanwhile, phenylalanine (Phe), derived from the shikimate pathway, is a precursor for both flavonoids and volatile benzenoid-phenylpropanoids (BPs). Thus, it is not clear whether the BP aroma was attenuated for the appearance of purple color. In this study, we integrated metabolome and transcriptome of petals of two tea varieties, namely, Zijuan (ZJ) with white flowers and Baitang (BT) with purple flowers, to reveal the relationship between color (anthocyanins) and aroma (volatile BPs). The results indicated that in purple petals, the upstream shikimate pathway promoted for 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) was elevated. Among the increased anthocyanins, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (DpG) was extremely higher; volatile BPs, including benzyl aldehyde, benzyl alcohol, acetophenone (AP), 1-phenylethanol, and 2-phenylethanol, were also enhanced, and AP was largely elevated. The structural genes related to the biosynthesis of volatile BPs were induced, while the whole flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was downregulated, except for the genes flavonoid 3 '-hydroxylase (F3 ' H) and flavonoid 3 ',5 '-hydroxylase (F3 ' 5 ' H), which were highly expressed to shift the carbon flux to delphinidin, which was then conjugated to glucoside by increased bronze-1 (BZ1) (UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase) to form DpG. Transcription factors (TFs) highly related to AP and DpG were selected to investigate their correlation with the differentially expressed structural genes. TFs, such as MYB, AP2/ERF, bZIP, TCP, and GATA, were dramatically expressed and focused on the regulation of genes in the upstream synthesis of Phe (DAHPS; arogenate dehydratase/prephenatedehydratase) and the synthesis of AP (phenylacetaldehyde reductase; short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase), Dp (F3 ' H; F3 ' 5 ' H), and DpG (BZ1), but inhibited the formation of flavones (flavonol synthase) and catechins (leucoanthocyanidin reductase). These results discovered an unexpected promotion of volatile BPs in purple tea flowers and extended our understanding of the relationship between the BP-type color and aroma in the tea plant.

AB  - The effects of age on encoding-related neural activity predictive of accurate item and source memory judgments were examined with fMRI, with an a priori focus of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampus. During a scanned study phase, young and older adults viewed a series of pictures of objects and made one of two judg-ments on each object. At test, which occurred outside of the scanner, an 'old/new' judgment on each test item was followed, for those items endorsed old, by a source judgment querying the study task. Neural activity predictive of accurate subsequent item and source memory judgments was identified in bilateral IFG, several other cortical regions and bilateral hippocampus. Cortical effects were graded in the young group (source > item > miss) but predicted item memory only in the older group. Hippocampal effects exclusively predicted source memory, and the magnitude of these effects did not reliably differ between the age groups. In the older group only, IFG and hippocampal encoding effects were positively correlated across participants with memory per-formance. Similar findings were evident in the extra-IFG regions demonstrating encoding effects. With the exception of the age-dependent relationship identified for hippocampal encoding effects, the present findings are broadly consistent with those from prior aging studies that employed verbal memoranda and tests of associative recognition. Thus, they extend these prior findings to include non-verbal materials and a different operation-alization of episodic recollection. Additionally, the present findings suggest that the sensitivity in older adults of IFG encoding effects to subsequent memory performance reflects a more general tendency for cortical encoding effects to predict memory performance in this age group.

AB  - Amblyomma americanum (Linnaeus) (Acari: Ixodidae) (lone star tick) is an aggressive, generalist parasite that vectors numerous important human and animal pathogens. In recent decades its geographic range has expanded northwards from endemic regions in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In 2019 five questing A. americanum ticks, comprising two life stages were detected at one site in southwestern Michigan, satisfying one CDC criterium for an established population for the first time in recent history in the state. To better characterize the extent of emerging A. americanum, we conducted active surveillance (i.e., drag sampling) in summer 2020 throughout Michigan's southern counties and detected one adult A. americanum from each of six widespread sites, including where they had been detected in 2019. A larger established population was identified at another site in Berrien County, which yielded 691 A. americanum comprising three life stages, and questing phenologies here were similar to that reported for other endemic regions. Statewide surveillance in 2021 revealed no A. americanum outside of Berrien County, but establishment criteria were met again at the two sites where established populations were first detected respectively in 2019 and 2020. These observations may represent the successful invasion of A. americanum into Michigan. Data from passive (1999-2020) and active surveillance (2004-2021) efforts, including a domestic animal sentinel program (2015-2018), are reported to provide context for this nascent invasion. Continued active surveillance is needed to help inform the public, medical professionals, and public health officials of the health risks associated with this vector.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of ascorbic acid (VC) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on broiler health and performance. A total of 200 Ross 308 male broilers were divided into five groups, each receiving different dietary combinations of ASA and VC (ASA: 50 or 100 mg/kg; VC: 200 or 400 mg/kg). The 42-day trial assessed parameters such as feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass characteristics, serum parameters, immune response and cecal microbial flora. The results indicate significant treatment effects on feed intake and growth performance, with a higher feed intake of ADG and FCR in treatment groups (p < 0.05). Serum lipid parameters were unaffected, but creatine kinase increased with ASA and VC intake (p < 0.05). Changes in sheep red blood cell titers and influenza antibodies were noted (p < 0.05). The combination of ASA and VC positively influenced carcass traits, reducing abdominal fat and altering the ratio of immune response organs to body weight (p < 0.05). Additionally, the cecal E. coli count decreased with treatment (p < 0.05). This study underscores the intricate interactions between ASA and VC supplementation, growth performance and carcass composition and immune response in broilers. Further research is warranted to explore dosage nuances and variations under specific stress conditions.

AB  - The frying process is one of the excellent ways for food to have ideal sensory. However, some harmful substances may also be produced, such as aldehydes and monoepoxy oleic acid. In this experiment, Camellia oleifera seed cake extract (CSCE) was used as the test material, and the antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by the determination of antioxidant indexes. The synergistic effect of the extract and TBHQ in inhibiting oil oxidation was studied. The colorimetric method was used to determine total phenol content of the extract was determined by high performance liquid chromatography to determine the composition and content of polyphenols in the polyphenol extract of Camellia oleifera seed cake. The results show that CSCE can significantly reduce monocpoxy oleic acid. In addition, CSCE has a better inhibitory effect on monoepoxy fatty acids than TBHQ. Our results may help provide reference and guidance for finding new natural antioxidants.

AB  - Efficient and accurate large-scale networks are a fundamental tool in modeling brain areas, to advance our understanding of neuronal dynamics. However, their implementation faces two key issues: computational efficiency and heterogeneity. Computational efficiency is achieved using simplified neurons, whereas there are no practical solutions available to solve the problem of reproducing in a large-scale network the experimentally observed heterogeneity of the intrinsic properties of neurons. This is important, because the use of identical nodes in a network can generate artifacts which can hinder an adequate representation of the properties of a real network. To this aim, we introduce a mathematical procedure to generate an arbitrary large number of copies of simplified hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons models, which exhibit the full range of firing dynamics observed in these cells - including adapting, non -adapting and bursting. For this purpose, we rely on a recently published adaptive generalized leaky integrate -and -fire (A-GLIF) modeling approach, leveraging on its ability to reproduce the rich set of electrophysiological behaviors of these types of neurons under a variety of different stimulation currents. The generation procedure is based on a perturbation of model's parameters related to the initial data, firing block, and internal dynamics, and suitably validated against experimental data to ensure that the firing dynamics of any given cell copy remains within the experimental range. A classification procedure confirmed that the firing behavior of most of the pyramidal/interneuron copies was consistent with the experimental data. This approach allows to obtain heterogeneous copies with mathematically controlled firing properties. A full set of heterogeneous neurons composing the CA1 region of a rat hippocampus (approximately 1.2 million neurons), are provided in a database freely available in the live paper section of the EBRAINS platform. By adapting the underlying A-GLIF framework, it will be possible to extend the numerical approach presented here to create, in a mathematically controlled manner, an arbitrarily large number of non -identical copies of cell populations with firing properties related to other brain areas.

AB  - Simple Summary The protective effect of niacin on growth performance and gut health of weaned piglets and the underlying mechanism remains unclear despite it being a common additive in pig diets. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of niacin on growth performance, intestinal morphology, intestinal mucosal immunity, and colonic microbiota in weaned piglets. Our results show that niacin supplementation significantly improved the growth performance in piglets as compared with those given a niacin receptor antagonist. Niacin also significantly improved the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the colon and alleviate the inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa as compared with control piglets and those given a niacin receptor antagonist. These results provide new insight into the beneficial effects of niacin on growth performance and gut health in weaned piglets. This study aimed to investigate the effects of niacin on growth performance, intestinal morphology, intestinal mucosal immunity, and colonic microbiota in weaned piglets. A total of 96 weaned piglets (Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire), 21-d old, 6.65 +/- 0.02 kg body weight (BW)) were randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups (8 replicate pens per treatment, each pen containing 4 males; n = 32/treatment) for 14 d. Piglets were fed a control diet (CON) or the CON diet supplemented with 20.4 mg/kg niacin (NA) or an antagonist for the niacin receptor GPR109A (MPN). The results showed that NA or MPN had no effect on ADG, ADFI, G/F or diarrhea incidence compared with the CON diet. However, compared with piglets in the NA group, piglets in the MPN group had lower ADG (p = 0.042) and G/F (p = 0.055). In comparison with the control and MPN group, niacin supplementation increased the villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (p < 0.05), while decreasing the crypt depth in the duodenum (p < 0.05). Proteomics analysis of cytokines showed that niacin supplementation increased the expression of duodenal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), jejunal interleukin-10 (IL-10) and ileal interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p < 0.05), and reduced the expression of ileal interleukin-8 (IL-8) (p < 0.05) compared with the control diet. Piglets in the MPN group had significantly increased expression of ileal IL-6, and jejunal IL-8 and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) (p < 0.05) compared with those in the control group. Piglets in the MPN group had lower jejunal IL-10 level and higher jejunal IL-8 level than those in the NA group (p < 0.05). The mRNA abundance of duodenal IL-8 and ileal granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes were increased (p < 0.05), and that of ileal IL-10 transcript was decreased (p < 0.05) in the MPN group compared with both the control and NA groups. Additionally, niacin increased the relative abundance of Dorea in the colon as compared with the control and MPN group (p < 0.05), while decreasing that of Peptococcus compared with the control group (p < 0.05) and increasing that of Lactobacillus compared with MPN supplementation (p < 0.05). Collectively, the results indicated that niacin supplementation efficiently ensured intestinal morphology and attenuated intestinal inflammation of weaned piglets. The protective effects of niacin on gut health may be associated with increased Lactobacillus and Dorea abundance and butyrate content and decreased abundances of Peptococcus.

AB  - miR156 play important roles in regulation of plant growth and development, secondary metabolite synthesis and other biological processes by targeting the SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL) family. Our previous sequencing data analysis suggested that Csn-miR156d may regulate flowering and anthocyanin accumulation by cleavage and degradation of the expression of the SPL in tea plant, but it remains to be elucidated. In this study, 5 ' RLM-RACE experiment, tobacco transient transformation, qRT-PCR and antisense oligonucleotide (asODN) were used to verify that CsSPL1 is the target gene of Csn-miR156d. Stable transformation of Arabidopsis revealed that Csn-miR156d could delay flowering by negatively regulating the transcript levels of FT, AP1, FUL and SOC1, while overexpression of CsSPL1 showed an opposite effect. Additionally, overexpression of Csn-miR156d in Arabidopsis could enhance the transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthesis-related structural genes DFR, ANS, F3H, UGT78D2 and LDOX, as well as regulatory genes PAP1, MYB113, GL3, MYB11 and MYB12, leading to anthocyanin accumulation. Moreover, asODN experiment revealed that Csn-miR156d could increase the anthocyanin content in tea plant. These results suggest that Csn-miR156d regulates flowering and anthocyanin accumulation in tea plant by suppressing the expression of CsSPL1. Our study provides new insights into the development and anthocyanin accumulation in tea plant and lays a theoretical foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in regulating tea plant growth and secondary metabolism.

AB  - Sporadic or late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) accounts for more than 95% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases without any family history. Although genome-wide association studies have identified associated risk genes and loci for LOAD, numerous studies suggest that many adverse environmental factors, such as social isolation, are associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, the underlying mechanisms of social isolation in AD progression remain elusive. In the current study, we found that 7 days of social isolation could trigger pattern separation impairments and presynaptic abnormalities of the mossy fibre-CA3 circuit in AD mice. We also revealed that social isolation disrupted histone acetylation and resulted in the downregulation of 2 dentate gyrus (DG)-enriched miRNAs, which simultaneously target reticulon 3 (RTN3), an endoplasmic reticulum protein that aggregates in presynaptic regions to disturb the formation of functional mossy fibre boutons (MFBs) by recruiting multiple mitochondrial and vesicle-related proteins. Interestingly, the aggregation of RTN3 also recruits the PP2A B subunits to suppress PP2A activity and induce tau hyperphosphorylation, which, in turn, further elevates RTN3 and forms a vicious cycle. Finally, using an artificial intelligence-assisted molecular docking approach, we determined that senktide, a selective agonist of neurokinin3 receptors (NK3R), could reduce the binding of RTN3 with its partners. Moreover, application of senktide in vivo effectively restored DG circuit disorders in socially isolated AD mice. Taken together, our findings not only demonstrate the epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying mossy fibre synaptic disorders orchestrated by social isolation and tau pathology but also reveal a novel potential therapeutic strategy for AD.

AB  - Introduction: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psycho-socio-biological disease characterized by severe weight loss as result of dieting and hyperactivity. Effective treatments are scarce, despite its significant prevalence and mortality. AN patients show lower basal insulin levels and increased metabolic clearance, leading to weight loss, cognitive deficits, and hormonal imbalances. Low-dose polymer insulin could potentially reverse these effects by restoring brain function, reducing fear of weight gain, encouraging food intake, and restoring fat depots. This study evaluates an insulin delivery system designed for sustained release and AN treatment. Methods: AN-like model was established through dietary restriction (DR). On days 1-25, mice were on DR, and on days 26-31 they were on ad libitum regimen. An insulin-loaded delivery system was administered subcutaneously (1% w/w insulin). The impact of insulin treatment on gene expression in the hippocampus (cognition, regulation of stress, neurogenesis) and hypothalamus (eating behavior, mood) was assessed. Behavioral assays were conducted to evaluate motor activity and cognitive function. Results: The delivery system demonstrated sustained insulin release, maintaining therapeutic plasma levels. Diet restriction mice treated with the insulin delivery system showed body weight restoration. Gene expression analysis revealed enhanced expression of CB1 and CB2 genes associated with improved eating behavior and cognition, while POMC expression was reduced. Insulin-polymer treatment restored cognitive function and decreased hyperactivity in the AN-like model. Conclusion: The PSA-RA-based insulin delivery system effectively restores metabolic balance, body weight, and cognitive function in the AN model. Its ability to steadily release insulin makes it a promising candidate for AN treatment."

AB  - The interaction of pectin and gut microbiota plays animportantrole in maintaining animal and human health, but this interactionis not fully understood. Here, the impact of pectin supplementationon substrate dynamics and gut microbiota (in the terminal ileum andfeces) was integrally investigated in a fistula pig model. Our resultsshowed that a pectin-supplemented diet (PEC) decreased the concentrationsof starch, cellulose, and butyrate in feces but not in the terminalileum. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that PEC had a low impact onthe ileal microbiota but significantly increased plant polysaccharide-degradinggenera (e.g., Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Treponema) in feces. Additionally, CAZymeprofiling indicated that PEC reduced GH68 and GH8 for oligosaccharidedegradation in the ileal microbiome, while it enriched GH5, GH57,and GH106 for degradation of carbohydrate substrates in feces. Metabolomicanalysis confirmed that PEC increased metabolites involved in carbohydratemetabolism including glucuronate and aconitate. Collectively, pectincould promote complex carbohydrate substrate degradation in the hindgutvia modulating the gut microbiota.

AB  - Atherosclerosis (AS) is the pathological basis of many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, in which macrophage-derived foam cells are the critical step and a typical pathological feature of early atherosclerosis. We previously confirmed that low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMWF) had a good anti-AS effect, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here with aim to investigate the inhibitory effect of LMWF on foam cells and its molecular mechanism. Oil red O staining showed that LMWF effectively alleviated lipid accumulation and the formation of foam cells. Flow cytometry detection showed that LMWF promoted foam cells apoptosis. In addition, immu-nofluorescence showed that LMWF inhibited macrophage scavenger receptor A1 (SR-A1)-mediated lipid uptake and promoted ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated cholesterol outflow. Western blot showed that LMWF downregulated SR-A1 protein expression and upregulated ABCA1 protein expression by inhibiting p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) phosphorylation. Moreover, the mRNA transcriptions of Stat1, Elk-1, and Myc were downregulated when treated with LMWF. It concluded that, LMWF achieved bidirectional regulation of SR-A1 and ABCA1, then prevented the formation of foam cells, finally ameliorated the development of AS.

AB  - Iron is a key element in cell function; however, its excess in iron overload conditions can be harmful through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell oxidative stress. Activity of Na, K-ATPase has been shown to be implicated in cellular iron uptake and iron modulates the Na, K-ATPase function from different tissues. In this study, we determined the effect of iron overload on Na, K-ATPase activity and established the role that isoforms and conformational states of this enzyme has on this effect. Total blood and membrane preparations from erythrocytes (ghost cells), as well as pig kidney and rat brain cortex, and enterocytes cells (Caco-2) were used. In E1-related subconformations, an enzyme activation effect by iron was observed, and in the E2-related subconformations enzyme inhibition was observed. The enzyme's kinetic parameters were significantly changed only in the Na+ curve in ghost cells. In contrast to Na, K-ATPase alpha 2 and alpha 3 isoforms, activation was not observed for the alpha 1 isoform. In Caco-2 cells, which only contain Na, K-ATPase alpha 1 isoform, the FeCl(3 )increased the intracellular storage of iron, catalase activity, the production of H2O2 and the expression levels of the alpha 1 isoform. In contrast, iron did not affect lipid peroxidation, GSH content, superoxide dismutase and Na, K-ATPase activities. These results suggest that iron itself modulates Na, K-ATPase and that one or more E1-related subconformations seems to be determinant for the sensitivity of iron modulation through a mechanism in which the involvement of the Na, K-ATPase alpha 3 isoform needs to be further investigated.

AB  - Bearded Vultures deliberately stain their feathers with iron oxides from ferruginous springs (FS) to acquire orange colouration. This uncommon behaviour is believed to play an important role in the relationship between individuals, so FS may constitute a strategic resource for the species. In the French Central-Western Pyrenees, we surveyed and mapped FS, checked those used by Bearded Vultures and characterised their habitat variables and geological features. We also evaluated FS availability in Bearded Vultures' home ranges and their conservation status. FS occurred in relatively large number (more than three hundred) in the study area, spatially distributed in a very heterogeneous way. Sedimentary or metamorphic rocks dating from the Palaeozoic Era (-541 to -252 million years ago) hold majority of them, with schists being the predominant rock type (62.1%). FS were near absent from limestone massifs of the North-Pyrenean zone and from granite formations of the axial zone. We found evidences of use by Bearded Vultures in a limited number of sites (n = 27 out of 339 localised FS). These colouring sites were characterised by steep slopes, intense coloured iron oxide deposits and a location usually close to the forest edge. Availability of colouring sites for breeding Bearded Vultures (n = 32 pairs or trios in the study area) was high enough: we localised a mean of 36.9 available FS and 2.6 used FS in a 15 km-radius around the usual breeding site of each pair/trio. The mean distance between a breeding site and the nearest known colouring site was 8.8 +/- 0.86 km, a minor flight distance for this species. The conservation status of the used FS seems generally satisfactory, although one site disappeared due to drought and three others were damaged by domestic livestock trampling or wild ungulates. The vicinity of cables or fences, i.e. potential mortality factors, also concerns three of the used FS. We recommend to consider these colouring sites as key resources for the species and to protect them from any damage.

AB  - Animals rely on sensory information from the environment to make optimal decisions. However, animals are often faced with incomplete or ambiguous information. Some species use sensory information and previous experiences to generate expectations about ambiguity. To test this, we used a cognitive bias test experimentally modified for Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) to investigate how they respond to ambiguous cues after positive (rewarded) and negative (unrewarded) experiences. We manipulated the degree of ambiguity by associating the spatial position and colour of the cues to either previously experienced positive or negative experiences. We demonstrate that elephants use previous experiences, and the valence (affective value) attached to those experiences to make decisions regarding ambiguity. Elephants show a positive bias by opening the ambiguous positive box three times as often and twice as quickly compared to the negative cue. Conversely, they are less likely to open and slower to respond to the ambiguous negative cue. These results are consistent with responses of farm animals and captive wild mammals when faced with unconditioned ambiguous cues with perceptual overlaps. Our findings indicate that when making decisions under ambiguity, animals rely on cognitive and sensory mechanisms. A greater understanding of decision-making mechanisms could aid in understanding animals' responses to their immediate environment with potential implications for conservation and welfare.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera) is a major rice pest that exhibits condition dependent wing dimorphisms - a macropterous (long wing) form and a brachypterous (short wing) form. Although, the gene cascade that regulates wing development and dimorphic differentiation has been largely defined, the utility of these genes as targets for pest control has yet to be fully explored. RESULTSFive genes typically associated with the developmental signaling network, armadillo (arm), apterous A (apA), scalloped (sd), dachs (d), and yorkie (yki) were identified from the WBPH genome and their roles in wing development assessed following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown. At 5 days-post injection, transcript levels for all five targets were substantially decreased compared with the dsGFP control group. Among the treatment groups, those injected with dsSfarm had the most pronounced effects on transcript reduction, mortality (95 +/- 3%), and incidence (45 +/- 3%) of wing deformities, whereas those injected with dsSfyki had the lowest incidence (6.7 +/- 4%). To assess the utility of topical RNAi for Sfarm, we used a spray-based approach that complexed a large-scale, bacteria-based double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) expression pipeline with star polycation (SPc) nanoparticles. Rice seedlings infested with third and fourth instar nymphs were sprayed with SPc-dsRNA formulations and RNAi phenotypic effects were assessed over time. At 2 days post-spray, Sfarm transcript levels decreased by 86 +/- 9.5% compared with dsGFP groups, and the subsequent incidences of mortality and wing defects were elevated in the treatment group. CONCLUSIONSThis study characterized five genes in the WBPH developmental signaling cascade, assessed their impact on survival and wing development via RNAi, and developed a nanoparticle-dsRNA spray approach for potential field control of WBPH.

AB  - Aim: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia with multiple etiology and no effective remedy. Statins are a group of medicines that are basically used to lower cholesterol. However, several studies have recently done to assess the potential relationship between statins use and dementia but presented controversial results.
   Methods: In this study, using ovariectomy and D-galactose injection, a model of AD was induced in female rats, and then the protective effects of oral administration of simvastatin were investigated. shuttle box and Y-maze tests were done to assess the animals' learning and memory performance. Using GC-MC, ELISA, Immunohistochemistry and tissue staining techniques, changes in the amount of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), plasma and hippocampus neuroinflammatory markers and histological changes in the intestine and hippocampus were assessed in sham, disease and treatment groups.
   Key findings: Oral administration of simvastatin improved the gut microbiome activity (increased the amount of SCFAs in fecal samples) and strengthened the tight junctions of intestinal cells. Moreover, simvastatin reduced the amount of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in plasma and hippocampus. Also, cell death and Amyloid plaques notably decreased in the simvastatin-treated hippocampal tissue. All these physiological changes led to better performance in behavioral tasks in the treatment group in comparison to the disease group.
   Significance: These findings provide evidence that simvastatin may improve gut-brain axis followed by improvement in learning and memory via an anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - Recent advances in single-cell technologies have uncovered significant cellular diversity in tumors, influencing cancer progression and treatment outcomes. The Hippo pathway controls cell proliferation through its downstream effectors: yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Our analysis of human lung adenocarcinoma and murine models revealed that cancer cells display heterogeneous YAP/TAZ activation levels within tumors. Murine lung cancer cells with high YAP/TAZ activity grow rapidly but are sensitive to ferroptosis, a cell death induced by lipid peroxidation. In contrast, cells with low YAP/TAZ activity grow slowly but resist ferroptosis. Moreover, they protect neighbouring cells from ferroptosis, creating a protective microenvironment that enhances the tumor's resistance to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, inhibiting YAP/TAZ upregulates GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), an enzyme critical for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which functions as a secretory antioxidant to prevent lipid peroxidation. Pharmacological inhibition of GCH1 sensitizes lung cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach. Our data highlights the non-cell-autonomous roles of the Hippo pathway in creating a ferroptosis-resistant tumor microenvironment.

AB  - During composting of organic waste, nitrogen is lost through gaseous forms and ion leaching. Biochar has been shown to capture mineral nitrogen (Nmin: NH4+ and NO3-) from compost, which we hypothesize reduces N2O formation. However, associating Nmin captured by biochar with the dynamics of N2O and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during composting remains unstudied and was the aim of this work. We composted (outdoor for 148 days) together kitchen scraps (43.3% dw, where dw is dry weight), horse manure (40.9% dw), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L) straw (15.8% dw) without (Control) or with biochar (Bc, 15% compost dw). The biochar consisted of hardwood and softwood pieces pyrolyzed at 680 degrees C and exhibited 60% of particles with 4-8 mm. We monitored compost GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) emissions, Nmin content in compost and biochar particles (sequential extractions), and biochar surface transformations (SEM-EDX and 13C-NMR spectroscopy) along composting. Biochar did not significantly reduce or increase GHG emissions and Nmin content (mg kg-1) in compost. However, the final NO3- amount (g compost pile-1) in the Bc treatment was significantly higher (54%) compared to the Control, indicating lower NO3- losses. Despite the high aromaticity and minimal contribution of carboxyl C to the biochar structure, biochar retained NH4+, mainly in easily extractable form (55%), in the first 2 weeks of composting and mainly in strongly retained form (75%) in the final compost. The NO3- content in biochar increased continuously during composting. In the final compost, the NO3- content extracted from biochar was 164 (37%, easily extractable), 80 (19%, moderately extractable), and 194 mg NO3--N kg-1 (44%, strongly retained). Although Nmin retention in biochar was not accompanied by lower N2O emissions, contradicting our hypothesis, we demonstrated the efficacy of biochar to recover Nmin from organic waste without stimulating GHG emissions.
   Biochar particles retained NH4+ in an early and NO3- in a later phase of composting. Highly aromatic biochar captured NH4+ and NO3- in easily extractable and strongly retained forms. Compost amended with biochar had a higher final NO3- content without stimulating greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Simple Summary The cd26 gene is known to be significantly involved in immune responses. However, there are very few studies that have used cd26 siRNA in porcine embryos and no available information regarding its role during this pre-implantation development in in vitro. In the present study, the cd26 siRNA-injected oocytes showed significantly lower blastocyst development than control groups and we confirmed aberrant gene expression patterns of the porcine parthenogenetic embryo development. This study showed the possibility that the cd26 plays an important role in in vitro development of the porcine pre-implantation embryo. cd26 is ubiquitously distributed in the body, particularly in the endothelial and epithelial cells, with the highest expression in the kidney, liver, and small intestine. In humans, cd26 serves as a marker for the embryo implantation phase. However, little is known about the role of cd26 in porcine pre-implantation embryo development. Here, we aimed to examine siRNA-induced cd26 downregulation in the cytoplasm of MII oocytes, to determine whether cd26 is involved in the regulation of porcine pre-implantation embryonic development. The cd26 siRNA was micro-injected into the cytoplasm of MII oocytes, which were then parthenogenetically activated electrically in a medium containing 0.3M Mannitol. Inhibition of the cd26 expression did not affect cleavage but stopped development in the blastocyst stage. Additionally, the cd26 siRNA-treated blastocysts had significantly more apoptotic cells than the untreated blastocysts. Among the 579 transcripts evaluated with transcriptome resequencing, 38 genes were differentially expressed between the treatment and control blastocysts (p < 0.05). Twenty-four genes were upregulated in cd26 siRNA-injected blastocysts, whereas 14 were downregulated. These genes are involved in apoptosis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and aberrant expression of ribosomal protein genes. Our results indicate that cd26 is required for proper porcine parthenogenetic activation during embryonic development.

AB  - IntroductionThe extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) is a pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces microglial activation in the pathology of AD. The expression of serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) is increased in the brain tissues of patients with AD. In this study, we examined the effect of SRPK2 in the activation of microglia. MethodsMicroglia (BV2) cells were cultured and the expression of SRPK2 was enhanced by transfection of SRPK2 recombinant vectors or knockdown by SRPK2 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or A beta in vitro, generating inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-6], which were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ELISA. The proliferation ability of the BV2 cells with/without SRPK2 expression was evaluated by WST-1 under pressure in the presence of A beta. The effects of SRPK2 on microglia polarization were evaluated by investigating the expression of CD16/32 and CD206 by western blot and the expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) and arginase-1 (Arg-1) by immunofluorescence. Hippocampal cells HT-22 were cultured with a BV2 cell (with/without SRPK2 expression)-derived medium stimulated by A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma, prior to the evaluation of HT-22 cytotoxicity by assessment of cell viability. Possible relationships between Akt and SRPK2 in the BV2 cells were investigated by western blot. ResultsThe expression of SRPK2 was related to the phenotype polarization changes of microglia with increased expression of CD16/32 and IBA-1. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha was increased, whereas the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was decreased in the BV2 cells with SRPK2 overexpression. Moreover, with the expression enhancement of SRPK2, the BV2 cells had a higher proliferation rate. A beta treatment can promote SRPK2 expression in BV2 cells. A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma promoted the production of cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha but decreased cytokine IL-10 in the BV2 cells. SRPK2 deficiency alleviated the cytotoxic effects of A beta or LPS + IFN-gamma exposed microglia on HT22 cells. In addition, the activated Akt pathway promoted the expression of SRPK2 in the BV2 cells. ConclusionOur data have found that enhanced SRPK2 expression contributed to the proinflammatory activation of microglia. Thus, SRPK2 may be a key modulating pathway of inflammatory mediators in AD pathology.

AB  - Introduction: Children with wheeze and asthma present with airway epithelial vulnerabilities, such as impaired responses to viral infection. It is postulated that the in utero environment may contribute to the development of airway epithelial vulnerabilities. The aims of the study were to establish whether the receptors for rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are expressed in the amniotic membrane and whether the pattern of expression is similar to newborn nasal epithelium. Methods: Placenta were collected (n = 33) from newborns in AERIAL, a sub-study nested under the ORIGINS birth cohort. Using purified RNA from amniotic samples (n = 33), along with previously extracted RNA from nasal epithelial cells from newborns (n = 20), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to determine gene expression of viral receptors for RV, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in both amniotic and newborn nasal epithelial samples. In addition, receptor protein expression was quantified through Western blot and localised using immunohistochemical staining in amniotic samples. Results: Amniotic and newborn nasal samples expressed various receptors for RV (ICAM-1, LDLR, CDHR3), RSV (NCL, CX3CR1) and SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2, TMPRSS2) at the gene level, although the magnitude of expression varied. In addition, protein expression of these receptors was confirmed in the amniotic samples. These proteins were localised to the epithelial layer of the amniotic membrane. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study indicates the potential of amniotic samples to facilitate investigation into the interactions between the in utero environment and prenatal programming of epithelial innate immune responses to viruses.

AB  - Water infusion of pan-fried minimally oxidized leaves of plant Camellia sinensis is recognized as green tea. This infusion is rich in catechins, the bioactive components responsible for its health-promoting potential. Herbal teas or tisanes are the infusion or decoction of plant parts other than Camellia sinensis. Tisanes are generally known for their refreshing taste, fragrance, tranquilizing, and antioxidant effects. These infusions are also loaded with different types of phenolic compounds and exhibit multiple health benefits. The popu-larity and consumption of green tea is on the rise world over, but herbal teas are underutilized. There is a need to explore more about herbal teas and their biological activities especially in comparison to green tea. This review provides an update on the comparative studies carried out between green tea and herbal teas for antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial and anticancer properties. (c) 2021 SAAB.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) possess the characteristics of self-renewal and differentiation, as well as the ability to generate functional sperm. Their unique stemness has broad applications in male infertility treatment and species preservation. In rodents, research on SSCs has been widely reported, but progress is slow in large livestock such as cattle and pigs due to long growth cycles, difficult proliferation in vitro, and significant species differences. Previously, we showed that histone 3 (H3) lysine 9 (K9) trimethylation (H3K9me3) is associated with the proliferation of bovine SSCs. Here, we isolated and purified SSCs from calf testicular tissues and investigated the impact of different H3K9me3 levels on the in vitro proliferation of bovine SSCs. The enriched SSCs eventually formed classical stem cell clones in vitro in our feeder-free culture system. These clones expressed glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-1 (GFR alpha 1, specific marker for SSCs), NANOG (pluripotency protein), C-KIT (germ cell marker), and strong alkaline phosphatase (AKP) positivity. qRT-PCR analysis further showed that these clones expressed the pluripotency genes NANOG and SOX2, and the SSC-specific marker gene GFR alpha 1. To investigate the dynamic relationship between H3K9me3 levels and SSC proliferation, H3K9me3 levels in bovine SSCs were first downregulated using the methyltransferase inhibitor, chaetocin, or transfection with the siRNA of H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1 (SUV39H1). The EDU (5-Ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine) assay revealed that SSC proliferation was inhibited. Conversely, when H3K9me3 levels in bovine SSCs were upregulated by transfecting lysine demethylase 4D (KDM4D) siRNA, the EDU assay showed a promotion of cell proliferation. In summary, this study established a feeder-free culture system to obtain bovine SSCs and explored its effects on the proliferation of bovine SSCs by regulating H3K9me3 levels, laying the foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanism underlying histone methylation modification in the proliferation of bovine SSCs.

AB  - Vitamin E is an essential nutrient usually recommended in post-weaning piglets, when a decline in the serum vitamin E concentration is observed. Selected polyphenols have the potential to partially replace vitamin E in animal feed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the dietary inclusion of some commercial polyphenol products (PPs) on the growth performance, antioxidant status and immunity of post-weaning piglets. A total of 300 piglets (BW 7.18 kg +/- 1.18) were randomly assigned to six dietary groups: CON- (40 mg/kg vitamin E); CON+(175.8 mg/kg vitamin E); and PP1, PP2, PP3 and PP4, in which 50% vitamin E of CON+ was replaced with PP with equivalent vitamin E activity. The PP1 group exhibited lower performance (p < 0.05) than the other dietary groups, but a similar performance to that commonly registered in pig farms. Dietary polyphenols did not influence the IgG concentration or the IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokine concentrations. A lower IL-8 level was found in the PP4 group than in the other groups. The diets that affected the vitamin A content showed the highest value (p < 0.05) in the PP1 group, and a trend was noted for vitamin E with a higher content in PP4 and CON+. The polyphenols-enriched diets, especially the PP3 diet, maintained an antioxidant capacity (whole blood KRL) similar to the CON+ diet. In conclusion, the replacement of vitamin E with all PPs enables partial vitamin E substitution in post-weaning piglets.

TI  - Nanobody-mediated targeting of Plasmodium falciparum PfPIMMS43 can block malaria transmission in mosquitoes
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The transition from ookinete to oocyst is a critical step in the Plasmodium falciparum lifecycle and an important target for malaria transmission-blocking strategies. PfPIMMS43, a surface protein of P. falciparum ookinetes and sporozoites, is critical for this transition and aids the parasite in evading mosquito immune responses. Previous studies demonstrated that polyclonal PfPIMMS43 antibodies reduced P. falciparum infection in Anopheles mosquitoes. Here, building on these findings, we have developed high-affinity single-domain VHH antibodies (nanobodies) derived from llama heavy-chain-only antibodies. We have shown that these nanobodies bind both recombinant and endogenous PfPIMMS43 produced by P. falciparum ookinetes in the mosquito midgut. Importantly, they significantly reduce infection intensity and prevalence of laboratory and field strains of P. falciparum in An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, respectively. Epitope mapping has revealed that the nanobodies target conserved regions in the second half of PfPIMMS43, with homology modelling confirming epitope accessibility. These findings establish PfPIMMS43 as a promising transmission-blocking target. To enhance malaria control and elimination efforts, we propose an innovative strategy in which genetically modified mosquitoes express PfPIMMS43-specific nanobodies in their midguts and spread this trait in wild mosquito populations via gene drive technology.

AB  - Artemisinins, a group of plant-derived sesquiterpene lactones, are efficient antimalarial agents. They also share anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities and were considered for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, artemisinins bind to gephyrin, the multifunctional scaffold of GABAergic synapses, and modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in vitro. We previously reported an increased expression of gephyrin and GABA(A) receptors in early pre-symptomatic stages of an AD mouse model (APP-PS1) and in parallel enhanced CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of gephyrin at S270. Here, we studied the effects of artemisinin on gephyrin in the brain of young APP-PS1 mice. We detected an additional increase of gephyrin protein level, elevated gephyrin phosphorylation at Ser270, and an increased amount of GABA(A)R-gamma 2 subunits after artemisinintreatment. Interestingly, the CDK5 activator p35 was also upregulated. Moreover, we demonstrate decreased density of postsynaptic gephyrin and GABA(A)R-gamma 2 immunoreactivities in cultured hippocampal neurons expressing gephyrin with alanine mutations at two CDK5 phosphorylation sites. In addition, the activity-dependent modulation of synaptic protein density was abolished in neurons expressing gephyrin lacking one or both of these phosphorylation sites. Thus, our results reveal that artemisinin modulates expression as well as phosphorylation of gephyrin at sites that might have important impact on GABAergic synapses in AD.

AB  - BackgroundHigh-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has been found to ameliorate cognitive impairment. However, the effects of HF-rTMS remain unknown in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH).AimTo investigate the effects of HF-rTMS on cognitive improvement and its potential mechanisms in CCH mice.Materials and methodsDaily HF-rTMS therapy was delivered after bilateral carotid stenosis (BCAS) and continued for 14 days. The mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the sham group, the model group, and the HF-rTMS group. The Y maze and the new object recognition test were used to assess cognitive function. The expressions of MAP-2, synapsis, Myelin basic protein(MBP), and brain-derived growth factors (BDNF) were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot to evaluate neuronal plasticity and white matter myelin regeneration. Nissl staining and the expression of caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were used to observe neuronal apoptosis. In addition, the activation of microglia and astrocytes were evaluated by fluorescence staining. The inflammation levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor(TNF)-alpha were detected by qPCR in the hippocampus of mice in each group.ResultsVia behavioral tests, the BCAS mice showed reduced a rate of new object preference and decreased a rate of spontaneous alternations, while HF-rTMS significantly improved hippocampal learning and memory deficits. In addition, the mice in the model group showed decreased levels of MAP-2, synapsis, MBP, and BDNF, while HF-rTMS treatment reversed these effects. As expected, activated microglia and astrocytes increased in the model group, but HF-rTMS treatment suppressed these changes. HF-rTMS decreased BCAS-induced neuronal apoptosis and the expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Caspase-3 and Bax) and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2). In addition, HF-rTMS inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha).ConclusionsHF-rTMS alleviates cognitive impairment in CCH mice by enhancing neuronal plasticity and inhibiting inflammation, thus serving as a potential method for vascular cognitive impairment.
   This study highlights the role and mechanisms of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. HF-rTMS stimulation has been shown to attenuate cognitive impairment in mice, which is attributed to its enhancement of behavioral functions in mice by inhibiting glial cell activation, alleviating neuronal, damage, regulating synaptic proteins, and alleviating white matter damage. image

AB  - Inspired by the optical imaging algorithm, the Fourier Ptychography (FP) algorithm is adopted to improve the resolution of ultrasonic array imaging. In the FP algorithm, the steady-state spectrum is utilized to recover the high-resolution ultrasonic images. Meanwhile, the parameters of FP algorithm are empirical, which can affect the imaging quality of ultrasonic array. Then the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of FP algorithm to further improve the imaging quality of ultrasonic array. The tungsten imaging experiments and pig eye imaging experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm and the coherent wave superposition (CWS) al-gorithm are both based on single plane wave (SPW) algorithms and they are then compared. The results show that the CWS algorithm and FP algorithm have good longitudinal and lateral resolutions, respectively. The particle swarm optimization-based FP (PSOFP) imaging algorithm has both excellent lateral and longitudinal resolutions. The average lateral resolution of PSOFP imaging algorithm is improved by 34.47% compared with CWS imaging algorithm in the tungsten wires experiments, and the lateral boundary structure width of the lens is improved by 49.48% in the pig eye experiments. The proposed algorithm can effectively improve the ultrasonic imaging quality for medical application.

AB  - Simple Summary Local communities living on the edge of protected areas often experience negative impacts on their livelihoods due to wildlife. These situations threaten support for long-term conservation of wildlife and wild habitats so a key for conservation sustainability should be based on implementing socially accepted and economically sustainable mitigation practices. For successful design and implementation of mitigation strategies, it is vital to engage local communities and understand their preferences and previous experiences. In this study, we present a choice experiment as a tool to analyze local farmer preferences for the most common farm-based solutions to reduce African elephant crop damage. Results show that there are significant differences among responses triggered by farmers' previous experience with elephants and socioeconomic situation, with a marked spatial distribution among respondents. This methodology, based on a choice modeling approach considering the differential availability of resources and previous experience with elephants or other wildlife, is highly applicable, with small changes in other areas where wildlife competes with local communities for resources. This approach also represents a suitable instrument for identifying stakeholders' preferences in each specific context. Local communities surrounding wildlife corridors and natural reserves often face challenges related to human-wildlife coexistence. To mitigate the challenges and ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife, it is important to engage local communities in the design of conservation strategies. By conducting 480 face-to-face interviews in 30 villages along and adjacent to the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor (Tanzania), we quantified farmers' preferences for farm-based measures to mitigate African elephant damage using choice experiments. Results show that farmers considered no action the least preferred option, revealing that they are open to trying different measures. The most preferred management strategy matched with the preferences of wildlife rangers in the area, suggesting low concern about the potential conflicts between stakeholders. However, a latent class model suggests that there are significant differences among responses triggered by farmers' previous experience with elephants, the intensity of the elephant damage, and the socioeconomic situation of the farmer. Results show a marked spatial distribution among respondents, highlighting the benefits of zone management as conflicts were found to be highly context dependent. Understanding the human dimension of conservation is essential for the successful planification and implementation of conservation strategies. Therefore, the development and broad utilization of methodologies to gather specific context information should be encouraged.

AB  - A numerical simulation procedure is proposed for analyzing the partial replacement of pulverized coal injection by hydrogen, oxygen, and blast furnace gas (BFG) injections mixed with pulverized coal (PCI) within the tuyeres of large blast furnaces. The massive use of hydrogen-rich gas is extremely interesting for ironmaking blast furnaces in the context of net-zero carbon hot metal production. Likewise, this new approach allows for increasing productivity and for reducing the specific emissions of carbon dioxide toward a net-zero carbon ironmaking technology. Nevertheless, the mixture of pulverized coal injection and gas injection is a complex technology. In addition to the impact on chemical reactions and energy exchange, the internal temperature and gas flow patterns can also change drastically. With a view to assessing the state of the furnace in this complex operation, a comprehensive mathematical model utilizing multiphase theory was developed. The model simultaneously handles bulk solids (sinter, pellets, small coke, granular coke, and also iron ore), gas, liquid metal and slag, and coal powder phases. The associated conservation equations take into account momentum, mass, chemical species, and energy while being discretized and solved using finite volume techniques. The numerical model was validated against the reference operating conditions using 220 kg per ton of pig iron (kg/t(HM)) of pulverized coal. Therefore, the combined injection of different concentrations of fuel hydrogen, blast furnace gas, and oxygen was simulated for replacing 40, 60, and 80 kg/t(HM) of coal injection. Theoretical analysis showed that the best scenario with stable operation conditions could be achieved with a productivity increase of 20% corresponding to a CO2 reduction of 15% and 60 kg/t(HM) of PCI replacement.

AB  - Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is crucial for reproduction. Human and porcine oocytes transiently cluster their chromosomes before the onset of spindle assembly and subsequent chromosome segregation. The mechanism and function of chromosome clustering are unknown. Here we show that chromosome clustering is required to prevent chromosome losses in the long gap phase between nuclear envelope breakdown and the onset of spindle assembly, and to promote the rapid capture of all chromosomes by the acentrosomal spindle. The initial phase of chromosome clustering is driven by a dynamic network of Formin-2- and Spire-nucleated actin cables. The actin cables form in the disassembling nucleus and migrate towards the nuclear centre, moving the chromosomes centripetally by interacting with their arms and kinetochores as they migrate. A cage of stable microtubule loops drives the late stages of chromosome clustering. Together, our data establish a crucial role for chromosome clustering in accurate progression through meiosis.
   Harasimov et al. show that, in human and porcine oocytes, actin cables and microtubule loops move chromosomes into a cluster before spindle assembly to ensure fast and complete chromosome capture in meiosis.

AB  - Animal specimens in natural history collections are invaluable resources in examining the historical context of pathogen dynamics in wildlife and spillovers to humans. For example, natural history specimens may reveal new associations between bat species and coronaviruses. However, RNA viruses are difficult to study in historical specimens because protocols for extracting RNA from these specimens have not been optimized. Advances have been made in our ability to recover nucleic acids from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) commonly used in human clinical studies, yet other types of formalin preserved samples have received less attention. Here, we optimize the recovery of RNA from formalin-fixed ethanol-preserved museum specimens in order to improve the usability of these specimens in surveys for zoonotic diseases. We provide RNA quality and quantity measures for replicate tissues subsamples of 22 bat specimens from five bat genera (Rhinolophus, Hipposideros, Megareops, Cynopterus, and Nyctalus) collected in China and Myanmar from 1886 to 2003. As tissues from a single bat specimen were preserved in a variety of ways, including formalin-fixed (8 bats), ethanol-preserved and frozen (13 bats), and flash frozen (2 bats), we were able to compare RNA quality and yield across different preservation methods. RNA extracted from historical museum specimens is highly fragmented, but usable for short-read sequencing and targeted amplification. Incubation of formalin-fixed samples with Proteinase-K following thorough homogenization improves RNA yield. This optimized protocol extends the types of data that can be derived from existing museum specimens and facilitates future examinations of host and pathogen RNA from specimens.

AB  - Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloenzymes that convert superoxide radicals to H2O2 and O2. Although SODs have been extensively studied in mammals and other species, comparative studies in invertebrates, such as abalones, are lacking. Here, we aimed to characterize manganese superoxide dismutase in disk abalone (Haliotis discus discus) (AbMnSOD) by assessing its transcriptional levels at different embryonic developmental stages. Additionally, the temporal expression of AbMnSOD in different abalone tissues in response to bacterial, viral, and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) stimuli was investigated. SOD activity was measured at various recombinant protein concentrations via the xanthine oxidase/WST-1 system. Cell viability upon exposure to H2O2, wound healing ability, and subcellular localization were determined in AbMnSOD-transfected cells. AbMnSOD was 681 bp long and contained the SOD-A domain. AbMnSOD expression was higher at the trochophore stage than at the other stages. When challenged with immune stimulants, AbMnSOD showed the highest expression at 6 h post-injection (p.i.) for all stimulants except lipopolysaccharides. In the gills, the highest AbMnSOD expression was observed at 6 h p.i., except for the Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge. Recombinant AbMnSOD showed concentration-dependent xanthine oxidase activity. Furthermore, AbMnSOD-transfected cells survived H2O2-induced apoptosis and exhibited significant wound gap closure. As expected, AbMnSOD was localized in the mitochondria of the cells. Our findings suggest that AbMnSOD is an essential antioxidant enzyme that participates in regulating developmental processes and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in hosts.

AB  - Gram-negative bacterial infections pose a significant threat to public health. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and induces innate immune responses, autophagy, and cell death, which have major impacts on the body's physiological homeostasis. However, the role of TLR4 in bacterial LPS-induced autophagy and apoptosis in large mammals, which are closer to humans than rodents in many physiological characteristics, remains unknown. So far, few reports focus on the relationship between TLR, autophagy, and apoptosis in large mammal levels, and we urgently need more tools to further explore their crosstalk. Here, we generated a TLR4-enriched mammal model (sheep) and found that a high-dose LPS treatment blocked autophagic degradation and caused strong innate immune responses and severe apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages of transgenic offspring. Excessive accumulation of autophagosomes/autolysosomes might contribute to LPS-induced apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages of transgenic animals. Further study demonstrated that inhibiting TLR4 downstream NF-& kappa;B or p38 MAPK signaling pathways reversed the LPS-induced autophagy activity and apoptosis. These results indicate that the elevated TLR4 aggravates LPS-induced monocytes/macrophages apoptosis by leading to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux, which is associated with TLR4 downstream NF-& kappa;B and MAPK signaling pathways. This study provides a novel TLR4-enriched mammal model to study its potential effects on autophagy activity, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death. These findings also enrich the biological functions of TLR4 and provide powerful evidence for bacterial infection.

AB  - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and neurodevelopmental impairment are among the most common morbidities affecting preterm infants. Although BPD is a predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, it is currently uncertain how BPD contributes to brain injury in preterm infants. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in interorgan communication in diverse pathological processes. ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) is pivotal in inflammasome assembly and activation of inflammatory response. We assessed expression profiles of the alveolar macrophage (AM) markers CD11b, CD11c, and CD206 as well as ASC in EVs isolated from the plasma of preterm infants at risk for BPD at 1 week of age. We found that infants on higher fraction of inspired oxygen therapy (HO2>30%) 2 > 30%) had increased concentrations of AM-derived EV-ASC compared with infants on lower fraction of inspired oxygen (LO2<30%). 2 <30%). To assess the function of these EVs, we performed adoptive transfer experiments by injecting them into the circulation of newborn mice. We discovered that mice that received EVs from infants on HO2 2 had increased lung inflammation, decreased alveolarization, and disrupted vascular development, the hallmarks of BPD. Importantly, these EVs crossed the blood-brain - brain barrier, and the EVs from infants on HO2 2 caused inflammation, reduced cell survival, and increased cell death, with features of pyroptosis and necroptosis in the hippocampus. These results highlight a novel role for AM-derived EV-ASC in mediating the lung-to-brain crosstalk that is critical in the pathogenesis of BPD and brain injury and identify potential novel targets for preventing and treating BPD and brain injury in preterm infants.

AB  - The mitochondrial bc1 complex is a major source of mitochondrial superoxide. While bc1-generated superoxide plays a beneficial signaling role, excess production of superoxide lead to aging and degenerative diseases. The catalytic core of bc1 comprises three peptides -cytochrome b, Fe-S protein, and cytochrome c1. All three core peptides exhibit accelerated evolution in anthropoid primates. It has been suggested that the evolution of cytochrome b in anthropoids was driven by a pressure to reduce the production of superoxide. In humans, the bc1 core peptides exhibit anthropoid-specific substitutions that are clustered near functionally critical sites that may affect the production of superoxide. Here we compare the high-resolution structures of bovine, mouse, sheep and human bc1 to identify structural changes that are associated with human-specific substitutions. Several cytochrome b substitutions in humans alter its interactions with other subunits. Most significantly, there is a cluster of seven substitutions, in cytochrome b, the Fe-S protein, and cytochrome c1 that affect the interactions between these proteins at the tether arm of the Fe-S protein and may alter the rate of ubiquinone oxidation and the rate of superoxide production. Another cluster of substitutions near heme bH and the ubiquinone reduction site, Qi, may affect the rate of ubiquinone reduction and thus alter the rate of superoxide production. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that cytochrome b in humans (and other anthropoid primates) evolve to reduce the rate of production of superoxide thus enabling the exceptional longevity and exceptional cognitive ability of humans.

AB  - Structural and functional differences in the hippocampus have been related to the episodic memory and social impairments observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In neurotypical individuals, hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity systematically varies between anterior and posterior hippocampus, with changes observed during typical development. It remains unknown whether this specialization of anterior-posterior hippocampal connectivity is disrupted in ASD, and whether age-related differences in this specialization exist in ASD. We examined connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampus in an ASD (N = 139) and non-autistic comparison group (N = 133) aged 5-21 using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN). Consistent with previous results, we observed lower connectivity between the whole hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in ASD. Moreover, preferential connectivity of the posterior relative to the anterior hippocampus for memory-sensitive regions in posterior parietal cortex was reduced in ASD, demonstrating a weaker anterior-posterior specialization of hippocampal-cortical connectivity. Finally, connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and precuneus negatively correlated with age in the ASD group but remained stable in the comparison group, suggesting an altered developmental specialization. Together, these differences in hippocampal-cortical connectivity may help us understand the neurobiological basis of the memory and social impairments found in ASD.
   The brain's hippocampus is an important structure for memory, learning, and social interaction. Research has shown differences in the structure and function of the hippocampus in autism. We investigated the anterior-posterior specialization of the hippocampus; whereby the front and back portions of the hippocampus display unique patterns of coordinated activity with the rest of the brain. This specialization matures during child development and is related to memory performance. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that hippocampal specialization would differ in those diagnosed with autism. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the coordinated activity of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain in autistic and non-autistic children and young adults. We identified several brain regions displaying different hippocampal specialization between autistic and non-autistic participants. Many of these regions are known to be involved in memory processes. Interestingly, only the autistic group showed age-related differences in specialization. This suggests that distinct developmental patterns of hippocampal specialization exist in autistic and non-autistic children. These findings help us understand how the hippocampus functions differently in autism and may give insight into differences in memory and social behavior.

AB  - Mature neurons have stable dendritic architecture, which is essential for the nervous system to operate correctly. The ability to undergo structural plasticity, required to support adaptive processes like memory formation, is still present in mature neurons. It is unclear what molecular and cellular processes control this delicate balance between dendritic structural plasticity and stabilization. Failures in the preservation of optimal dendrite structure due to atrophy or maladaptive plasticity result in abnormal connectivity and are associated with various neurological diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGFD) is critical for the maintenance of mature dendritic trees. Here, we describe how VEGFD affects the neuronal cytoskeleton and demonstrate that VEGFD exerts its effects on dendrite stabilization by influencing the actin cortex and reducing microtubule dynamics. Further, we found that during synaptic activity-induced structural plasticity VEGFD is downregulated. Our findings revealed that VEGFD, acting on its cognate receptor VEGFR3, opposes structural changes by negatively regulating dendrite growth in cultured hippocampal neurons and in vivo in the adult mouse hippocampus with consequences on memory formation. A phosphoproteomic screening identified several regulatory proteins of the cytoskeleton modulated by VEGFD. Among the actin cortex-associated proteins, we found that VEGFD induces dephosphorylation of ezrin at tyrosine 478 via activation of the striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). Activity-triggered structural plasticity of dendrites was impaired by expression of a phospho-deficient mutant ezrin in vitro and in vivo. Thus, VEGFD governs the equilibrium between stabilization and plasticity of dendrites by acting as a molecular brake of structural remodeling.

AB  - In neurons, changes in Akt activity have been detected in response to the stimulation of transmembrane receptors. However, the mechanisms that lead to changes in neuronal function upon Akt inhibition are still poorly understood. In the present study, we interrogate how Akt inhibition could affect the activity of the neuronal Na-v channels with while impacting intrinsic excitability. To that end, we employed voltage-clamp electrophysiological recordings in heterologous cells expressing the Na(v)1.6 channel isoform and in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the presence of triciribine, an inhibitor of Akt. We showed that in both systems, Akt inhibition resulted in a potentiation of peak transient Na+ current (I-Na) density. Akt inhibition correspondingly led to an increase in the action potential firing of the CA1 pyramidal neurons that was accompanied by a decrease in the action potential current threshold. Complementary confocal analysis in the CA1 pyramidal neurons showed that the inhibition of Akt is associated with the lengthening of Na(v)1.6 fluorescent intensity along the axonal initial segment (AIS), providing a mechanism for augmented neuronal excitability. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that Akt-mediated signal transduction might affect neuronal excitability in a Na(v)1.6-dependent manner.

AB  - Advances in biologic technology enable researchers to obtain a huge amount of genetic and genomic data, whose dimensions are often quite high on both phenotypes and variants. Testing their association with multiple phenotypes has been a hot topic in recent years. Traditional single phenotype multiple variant analysis has to be adjusted for multiple testing and thus suffers from substantial power loss due to ignorance of correlation across phenotypes. Similarity-based method, which uses the trace of product of two similarity matrices as a test statistic, has emerged as a useful tool to handle this problem. However, it loses power when the correlation strength within multiple phenotypes is middle or strong, for some signals represented by the eigenvalues of phenotypic similarity matrix are masked by others. We propose a divided-and-combined omnibus test to handle this drawback of the similarity-based method. Based on the divided-and-combined strategy, we first divide signals into two groups in a series of cut points according to eigenvalues of the phenotypic similarity matrix and combine analysis results via the Cauchy-combined method to reach a final statistic. Extensive simulations and application to a pig data demonstrate that the proposed statistic is much more powerful and robust than the original test under most of the considered scenarios, and sometimes the power increase can be more than 0.6. Divided-and-combined omnibus test facilitates genetic association analysis with high-dimensional data and achieves much higher power than the existing similarity based method. In fact, divided-and-combined omnibus test can be used whenever the association analysis between two multivariate variables needs to be conducted.

AB  - Despite mounting evidence for dietary protease benefits, the mechanisms beyond enhanced protein degradation are poorly understood. This study aims to thoroughly investigate the impact of protease addition on the growth performance, intestinal function, and microbial composition of weaned piglets. Ninety 28-day-old weaned pigs were randomly assigned to the following three experimental diets based on their initial body weight for a 28-day experiment: (1) control (CC), a basic diet with composite enzymes without protease; (2) negative control (NC), a diet with no enzymes; and (3) dietary protease (PR), a control diet with protease. The results show that dietary proteases significantly enhanced growth performance and boosted antioxidant capacity, increasing the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels (p < 0.05) while reducing malonaldehyde levels (p < 0.05). Additionally, protease addition reduced serum levels of inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 (p < 0.05), suppressed mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the jejunum (p < 0.01), and inhibited MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Moreover, protease-supplemented diets improved intestinal morphology and barrier integrity, including zonula occludens protein 1(ZO-1), Occludin, and Claudin-1 (p < 0.05). Microbiota compositions were also significantly altered by protease addition with increased abundance of beneficial bacteria (Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001) (p < 0.05) and reduced harmful Terrisporobacter (p < 0.05). Further correlation analysis revealed a positive link between beneficial bacteria and growth performance and a negative association with inflammatory factors and intestinal permeability. In summary, dietary protease addition enhanced growth performance in weaned piglets, beneficial effects which were associated with improved intestinal barrier integrity, immunological response, and microbiota composition.

AB  - RNase9 plays a reproductive function and has been recognized as an important member of the ribonuclease (RNase) A superfamily, a gene family that is widely used as a model for molecular evolutionary studies. Here, we identified 178 RNase9 genes from 95 Cetartiodactyla species that represent all four lineages and 21 families of this clade. Unexpectedly, RNase9 experienced an evolutionary scenario of "birth and death" in Ruminantia, and expression analyses showed that duplicated RNase9A and RNase9B genes are expressed in reproductive tissues (epididymis, vas deferens or prostate). This expression pattern combined with the estimate that these genes duplicated during the middle Eocene, a time when Ruminantia become a successful lineage, suggests that the RNase9 gene duplication might have been advantageous for promoting sperm motility and male fertility as an adaptation to climate seasonality changes of this period. In contrast, all RNase9 genes were lost in the Cetacean lineage, which might be associated with their high levels of prostatic lesions and lower reproductive rates as adaptations to a fully aquatic environment and a balance to the demands of ocean resources. This study reveals a complex and intriguing evolutionary history and functional divergence for RNase9 in Cetartiodactyla, providing new insights into the evolution of the RNaseA superfamily and molecular mechanisms for organismal adaptations to the environment.

AB  - To meet the current demand of assisted reproduction and animal breeding via superovulation and reduce the impact of hormone drugs, it is necessary to develop new superovulation drugs. This study examined the role of inflammation and steroids in ovulation. Sodium salicylate can regulate inflammation and steroids. However, the effect of sodium salicylate on ovulation has not been studied. In this study, mice were intraperitoneally injected with different concentrations of sodium salicylate for four consecutive days. The effects of sodium salicylate on oocyte quality and on the number of ovulations were examined, and these effects were compared with those of pregnant horse serum gonadotropin (PMSG)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) treatment. We found that low-dose sodium salicylate increased the levels of ovulation hormones and inflammation by promoting the expression of CYP17A1. Sodium salicylate had the same effect as the commonly used superovulation drug PMSG/FSH and reduced the histone methylation level. Sodium salicylate can promote ovulation in mice and Awang sheep. It can greatly decrease the use of hormone drugs, reduce breeding costs and physical impacts, and can thus be used for livestock breeding.

AB  - In the decades since the first cannabinoids were identified by scientists, research has focused almost exclusively on the function and capacity of cannabinoids as medicines and intoxicants for humans and other vertebrates. Very little is known about the adaptive value of cannabinoid production, though several hypotheses have been proposed including protection from ultraviolet radiation, pathogens, and herbivores. To test the prediction that genotypes with greater concentrations of cannabinoids will have reduced herbivory, a segregating F-2 population of Cannabis sativa was leveraged to conduct lab- and field-based bioassays investigating the function of cannabinoids in mediating interactions with chewing herbivores. In the field, foliar cannabinoid concentration was inversely correlated with chewing herbivore damage. On detached leaves, Trichoplusia ni larvae consumed less leaf area and grew less when feeding on leaves with greater concentrations of cannabinoids. Scanning electron and light microscopy were used to characterize variation in glandular trichome morphology. Cannabinoid-free genotypes had trichomes that appeared collapsed. To isolate cannabinoids from confounding factors, artificial insect diet was amended with cannabinoids in a range of physiologically relevant concentrations. Larvae grew less and had lower rates of survival as cannabinoid concentration increased. These results support the hypothesis that cannabinoids function in defense against chewing herbivores.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and has a higher incidence in women. The main component of the senile plaques characteristic of AD is amyloid-beta (A?), with surrounding astrocytes contributing to the degenerative process. We hypothesized that the sex difference in the incidence of AD could be partially due to differential astrocytic responses to A?. Thus, the effect of A?1-40 on cell viability, the inflammatory response, and oxidative status was studied in cultures of hippocampal astrocytes from male and female rats. A?1-40 increased astrocyte viability in both female and male cultures by activating proliferation and survival pathways. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses were induced in astrocytes from both sexes. A?1-40 did not affect endoplasmic reticulum stress although it induced oxidative stress in male and female astrocytes. Interestingly, male astrocytes had an increase in cell number and significantly lower cell death in response to A?140. Conversely, astrocytes from females displayed a greater inflammatory response after the A?1-40 challenge. These results suggest that the inflammatory and oxidative environment induced by A?1-40 in female astrocytes may contribute to enhance the vulnerability to AD and warrants further studies to unveil the mechanisms underlying sex differences in astrocytic responses.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess whether vulvar morphometric changes occurring in female pigs during proestrus and oestrus could be objective, accurate and predictive indicators of the onset to oestrus and thus performed artificial inseminations at the most appropriate time. For that purpose, pictures of vulvas from 60 hyperprolific females (30 gilts and 30 sows) during proestrus and oestrus were taken once a day. Vulva measurements (area, perimeter, length and width) on these pictures were performed using the image processing ImageJ software. Gilts and sows showed statistical differences (p < .01) in all vulvar morphometric measurements between proestrus and oestrus. Statistical differences in vulvar metrics were detected 24 h before the onset to oestrus, affecting all vulvar measurements in gilts, whereas only vulvar width was affected in sows. The image analysis used in this study may contribute to the development of smart technology in swine farming.

AB  - Long-term memories are believed to be encoded by unique transcriptional signatures in the brain. The expression of immediate early genes (IEG) promotes structural and molecular changes required for memory consolidation. Recent evidence has shown that the brain is equipped with mechanisms that not only promote, but actively constrict memory formation. However, it remains unknown whether IEG expression may play a role in memory suppression. Here we uncovered a novel function of the IEG neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4), as an inducible memory suppressor gene of highly salient aversive experiences. Using a contextual fear conditioning paradigm, we found that low stimulus salience leads to monophasic Npas4 expression, while highly salient learning induces a biphasic expression of Npas4 in the hippocampus. The later phase requires N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity and is independent of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Our in vivo pharmacological and genetic manipulation experiments suggested that the later phase of Npas4 expression restricts the consolidation of a fear memory and promote behavioral flexibility, by facilitating fear extinction and the contextual specificity of fear responses. Moreover, immunofluorescence and electrophysiological analysis revealed a concomitant increase in synaptic input from cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons. Our results demonstrate how salient experiences evoke unique temporal patterns of IEG expression that fine-tune memory consolidation. Moreover, our study provides evidence for inducible gene expression associated with memory suppression as a possible mechanism to balance the consolidation of highly salient memories, and thereby to evade the formation of maladaptive behavior.

AB  - Porcine interleukin-2 (poIL-2) has not yet been demonstrated to be immune-enhancing against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) inactivated vaccine (IV), despite IL-2 having been proven to have immunological adjuvant effects for a variety of vaccinations. In this work, the impact of poIL-2 on TGEV IV in terms of immunological enhancement was investigated. Twenty four (24) SPF piglets were utilized and divided into six groups: PBS group, poIL-2 group, IV group, 10 mu g poIL-2+IV group, 50 mu g poIL-2 +IV group, and 250 mu g poIL-2+IV group. They received a second vaccine at 28 days point following the initial immunization. Serum and blood samples were obtained at various periods throughout the experiment. By using ELISA assay, neutralization assay, MTT assay, and flow cytometry assay, the TGEV-specific antibody expressions, neutralizing antibodies generations, interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) productions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) proliferation response and lymphocyte phenotype subpopulations (CD3+, 3 + , CD4+, 4 + , and CD8+ 8 + immune cells) reflections were determined. The results showed that piglets inoculated with IV supplemented with poIL-2 significantly not only increased more piglet cellular immunity against TGEV by raising the degrees of IL-4, IFN-gamma, Stimulation Index (SI), and the ratio of CD4+ 4 + /CD8+ 8 + cell subgroups, but also promoted more humoral immunity against TGEV by increasing levels of anti-TGEV specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (NAs) than those piglets inoculated with the TGEV IV alone. Additionally, the results suggested that porcine interleukin-2 (poIL-2) may improve pigs' immune responses in a dosage-dependent way.Our study revealed that poIL-2 had an immune-enhancing effect on the immunization of TGEV IV, and it possessed the potential to be applied as an immune-stimulating agent.

AB  - RF-amide related peptides (RFRP) have been proposed as critical regulators of gonadotropin secretion in mammals. This study was designed to construct a DNA vaccine and investigate the effect of vaccine encoding RFRP-3 on reproduction physiology in ewe. A recombinant vaccine was constructed using two copies of the RFRP-3 gene and HBsAg-S that generate a fusion protein to induce an immunology response. Results showed this recombinant vaccine could produce a significant antibody titer in the treated ani-mals (P < 0.05). The specific RFRP-3 antibody response induced by the vaccine was detected at week 2 with a peak at week 6 after the initial immunization. Furthermore, we found that ewes inoculated with pVAX-tPA-HBsAg-S-2RFRP-asd vaccine significantly raised the concentration of GnRH, LH and E2 in serum compared to the control group. LH and E2 concentration in the treated ewes (Group T) was significantly higher than that in control ewes (Group C) at weeks 10,12 and 14 after the initial immu-nization, respectively (P < 0.05). Therefore, RFRP-3 can be used as a target for DNA immunization to promote reproductive hormone secretion in ewes and RFRP-3 gene immunization might be a candidate tool to regulate mammal reproduction.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belongs to the coronavirus family and the coronavirus genus, causing contact enteric infection in pigs. It is one of the most serious diseases that threatens the pig industry. However, there is currently no specific drug to prevent and treat the disease, indicating that we need to be vigilant about the spread of the disease and the development of anti-PEDV drugs. The dried aerial parts of the plant Portulaca oleracea in the family Portulacaceous, whose decoction can be used to treat acute enteritis, dysentery, diarrhea, and other diseases. This study explored the potential mechanism of water extract of Portulaca oleracea (WEPO) in PEDV-induced pyroptosis in Vero cells. PEDV decreased the viability of Vero cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, causing cell damage, upregulating the level of intracellular Nlrp3, and inhibiting the level of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and the activation of Caspase-1. WEPO can inhibit PEDV-induced pyroptosis, reduce the elevation of inflammatory factors caused by infection, and exhibit a dose-dependent effect. Knockdown of Caspase-1 and GSDMD separately can induce the production of the inflammatory factor IL-1 beta to significantly decrease and increase, respectively. These results suggest that WEPO can inhibit cell pyroptosis caused by PEDV and that the Caspase-1 and GSDMD pathways play an important role in this process.

AB  - Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis increases circulating corticosterone levels, causing a host of downstream behavioral, molecular, and metabolic changes. Here, we assess the effects of chronic exogenous CORT administration on changes in behavior and mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal synaptosomes of male and female mice. Adult male (n = 15) and female (n = 17) C57Bl/6NTac mice were given 35ug/mL CORT or vehicle dissolved in their drinking water for 21 consecutive days. Chronic CORT increased piloerection in males only. Although volume of CORT-containing water consumed was similar between males and females, circulating plasma and fecal corticosterone levels were only elevated in CORT-exposed males. Behavioral effects of CORT were evident in the Y-maze such that CORT caused a decrease in direct revisits in both sexes. There was no observed presentation of anxiety-like behavior following chronic CORT administration. Functional hippocampal synaptosomes were analyzed for mitochondrial respiration using Agilent's Cell Mito Stress test. Chronic CORT caused a decrease in synaptic mitochondria basal respiration, maximal respiration, proton leak, and ATP production in both sexes. Despite only observing an effect of chronic CORT on corticosterone concentrations in fecal and blood samples of males, chronic CORT induced marked changes in hippocampal synaptic mitochondrial function of both sexes. These data highlight the importance of considering effects of stress hormone exposure on neural function even in the absence of measurable peripheral elevations in females.

AB  - Premise Camelina (gold-of-pleasure or false flax) is an ancient oilseed crop with emerging applications in the production of sustainable, low-input biofuels. Previous domestication hypotheses suggested a European or western Asian origin, yet little genetic evidence has existed to assess the geographical origin for this crop, and archaeological data have not been systematically surveyed. Methods We utilized genotyping-by-sequencing of 185 accessions of C. sativa and its wild relatives to examine population structure within the crop species and its relationship to populations of its wild progenitor, C. microcarpa; cytotype variation was also assessed in both species. In a complementary analysis, we surveyed the archaeological literature to identify sites with archaeobotanical camelina remains and assess the timing and prevalence of usage across Europe and western Asia. Results The majority of C. microcarpa sampled in Europe and the United States belongs to a variant cytotype (2n = 38) with a distinct evolutionary origin from that of the crop lineage (2n = 40). Populations of C. microcarpa from Transcaucasia (South Caucasus) are most closely related to C. sativa based on cytotype and population structure; in combination with archaeological insights, these data refute prior hypotheses of a European domestication origin. Conclusions Our findings support a Caucasus, potentially Armenian, origin of C. sativa domestication. We cannot definitively determine whether C. sativa was intentionally targeted for domestication in its own right or instead arose secondarily through selection for agricultural traits in weedy C. sativa, as originally proposed by Vavilov for this species.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of donor age on lipid metabolism during in vitro maturation (IVM) of pigs cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). We evaluated transcript levels of genes, the percentage of ooplasm occupied by lipid droplets (LD) and evaluated DNA methylation in COCs from sows and prepubertal gilts. Transcript levels of six genes (ACACA, ACSS2, FASN, FABP3, SLC27A4, PLIN2), which were analyzed in cumulus cells (CCs), increased after 44 h of IVM in the sow group. In the gilt group, only FASN expression increased, while NR3C1 expression decreased after IVM. The measurement of LD in oocytes showed an accumulation of lipids in sow oocytes during IVM, while gilt oocytes showed a decrease in LD. FABP3 and NR3C1 methylation patterns exhibited a demethylation pattern in CCs and oocytes from gilts and sows and showed statistical differences between groups. CCs from sows had a better capacity to change transcription levels of the major genes involved in lipid metabolism during IVM than CCs from gilts. This difference may be involved in accumulation of lipids, acquisition of competence, and maturation of enclosed oocytes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism and acquisition of competence in porcine COCs.

AB  - The by-products of the extraction of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) concentrated juice may represent a functional food ingredient for white chocolate production, as a rich source of bioactive compounds. The effects of six treatments derived from the factorial combination of two types of by-products (with oil or without oil) and three different concentrations (5%, 10%, and 15%), were assessed on rheological, quality, colour, antioxidant, and mineral properties of chocolate. The 15% addition of full powder led to the highest values of max firmness, total shear energy, shear energy, cohesiveness, gummosity, dry matter, and ABTS, compared to the untreated control, but the two highest concentrations of the oil-deprived powder resulted in the protein content increasing. The full powder addition always raised fat levels. Both the 'L' and 'a' colour component as well as total carotenoids, beta-carotene, lycopene, and vitamin C increased with the rise of H. rhamnoides powder addition, compared to the untreated control. The opposite trend was shown by the 'b' colour component and pH, whereas polyphenols and antioxidant activity attained higher values with the oil-deprived powder. The content of potassium decreased upon the 15% addition of the Hippophae rhamnoides by-product powder, compared to the untreated control, whereas calcium and magnesium increased. The 15% H. rhamnoides full powder elicited the augmentation of phosphorus content in chocolate, compared to the untreated control, contrary to the effect of the oil-deprived powder on P and Zn. The employment of SBB by-products highlights the great potential for manufacturing innovative functional foods with high nutritional value, such as chocolate.

AB  - Lower urinary tract dysfunction, such as incontinence or urinary retention, is one of the leading consequences of neurological diseases. This significantly impacts the quality of life for those affected, with implications extending not only to humans but also to clinical veterinary care. Having motor and sensory fibers, the pudendal nerve is an optimal candidate for neuromodulation therapies using bidirectional intraneural prostheses, paving the way towards the restoration of a more physiological urination cycle: bladder state can be detected from recorded neural signals, then an electrical current can be injected to the nerve based on the real-time need of the bladder. To develop such prostheses and investigate this novel approach, animal studies are still required since the morphology of the target nerve is fundamental to optimizing the prosthesis design. This study aims to describe the porcine pudendal nerve as a model for neuromodulation studies aiming at restoring lower urinary tract dysfunction. Five male farm pigs were involved in the study. First, a surgical procedure to access the porcine pudendal nerve without muscle resection was developed. Then, an intraneural interface was implanted to confirm the presence of fibers innervating the external urethral sphincter by measuring its electromyographic activity. Finally, the morphophysiology of the porcine pudendal nerve at the level of surgical exposure was described by using histological and immunohistochemical characterization. This analysis confirmed the fasciculate nature of the nerve and the presence of mixed fibers with a spatial and functional organization. These achievements pave the way for further pudendal neuromodulation studies by using a clinically relevant animal model with the potential for translating the findings into clinical applications.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the incidence of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) in India. The purpose of our report is to describe the prevalence of ROCM in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the second Indian COVID-19 wave, as well as its diagnostics proceeding, and to discuss the challenges met in the time frame from the suspected diagnosis to the therapeutic decision in such patients. We conducted a retrospective multicentre case series study at six centres of Sudhalkar and Raghudeep group of hospitals in India. ROCM was confirmed in 38 (2.5%) of the 1546 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The average time to establish a diagnosis was 16 days. In total, 19 (50%) patients suffered from type 2 diabetes and were mostly treated with hypoglycaemic agents (in 90% of cases). The standard of care for SARS-CoV-2 management included systemic steroids therapy, intravenous remdesivir for 5 days, and concomitant prophylactic antibiotic therapy following admission. The median (IQR) blood glucose levels in all patients during the course of hospitalisation was 320 (250.5-375) mg/dl. A total of 16% of patients had an irreparable functional loss, and the mortality was 5%. We may hypothesise that excessive administration of antibiotics that profoundly affects human microbiota, coupled with poorly controlled glycaemia and unprotocolised haphazard steroid administration, contribute to a favourable setting for mucormycosis infections.

AB  - Adipose tissue is composed mostly of adipocytes that are in contact with capillaries. By using a ceiling culture method based on buoyancy, lipid-free fibroblast-like cells, also known as dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells, can be separated from mature adipocytes with a large single lipid droplet. DFAT cells can re-establish their active proliferation ability and transdifferentiate into various cell types under appropriate culture conditions. Herein, we sought to compare the regenerative potential of collagen matrix alone (control) with autologous DFAT cell-loaded collagen matrix transplantation in adult miniature pigs (microminipigs; MMPs). We established and transplanted DFAT cells into inflammation-inducing periodontal class II furcation defects. At 12 weeks after cell transplantation, a marked attachment gain was observed based on the clinical parameters of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). Additionally, micro computed tomography (CT) revealed hard tissue formation in furcation defects of the second premolar. The cemento-enamel junction and alveolar bone crest distance was significantly shorter following transplantation. Moreover, newly formed cellular cementum, well-oriented periodontal ligament-like fibers, and alveolar bone formation were observed via histological analysis. No teratomas were found in the internal organs of recipient MMPs. Taken together, these findings suggest that DFAT cells can safely enhance periodontal tissue regeneration.

AB  - (1) Background: Litter size traits are critical for pig breeding efficiency but pose challenges due to low heritability and sex-limited influences. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic architecture and identify candidate genes for these traits in Large White pigs using genomic selection (GS) and genome-wide association analyses (GWAS). (2) Methods: This study utilized phenotypic data from nine litter size traits in Large White sows. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was performed to obtain genotype data, retaining 153,782 high-quality SNPs after quality control. Genetic evaluation was conducted using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP), with genetic parameters (heritability and genetic correlations) estimated via an animal model (repeatability model). To assess prediction accuracy, 10-fold cross-validation was employed to compare traditional BLUP with ssGBLUP. Furthermore, a single-step genome-wide association study (ssGWAS) integrated genomic information and pedigree-based relationship matrices to screen for significant SNPs associated with litter size traits across the genome. Functional analysis of key candidate genes was subsequently conducted based on ssGWAS results. (3) Results: Heritabilities for litter traits ranged from 0.01 to 0.06. ssGBLUP improved genomic prediction accuracy by 6.38-13.33% over BLUP. Six genomic windows explaining 1.07-1.77% of genetic variance were identified via ssGWAS, highlighting GPR12 on SSC11 as a key candidate gene linked to oocyte development. (4) Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of ssGBLUP for low-heritability traits and identifies GPR12 as a pivotal gene for litter size. Prioritizing NHB and LBWT in breeding programs could enhance genetic gains while mitigating adverse effects on piglet health. These findings advance genomic strategies for improving reproductive efficiency in swine.

AB  - Oscillation of intracellular calcium concentration is a stable phenomenon that affects cellular function throughout the lifetime of both electrically excitable and non-excitable cells. Nitric oxide, a gaseous secondary messenger and the product of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), affects intracellular calcium dynamics. Using mouse hippocampal primary cultures, we recorded the effect of NOS blockade on neuronal spontaneous calcium activity. There was a correlation between the amplitude of spontaneous calcium events and the number of action potentials (APs) (Spearman R = 0.94). There was a linear rise of DAF-FM fluorescent emission showing an increase in NO concentration with time in neurons (11.9 +/- 1.0%). There is correlation between the integral of the signal from DAF-FM and the integral of the spontaneous calcium event signal from Oregon Green 488 (Spearman R = 0.58). Blockade of NOS affected the parameters of the spontaneous calcium events studied (amplitude, frequency, integral, rise slope and decay slope). NOS blockade by Nw-Nitro-L-arginine suppressed the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous calcium events. The NOS blocker 3-Bromo-7-Nitroindazole reduced the frequency but not the amplitude of spontaneous calcium activity. Blockade of the well-known regulator of NOS, calcineurin with cyclosporine A reduced the integral of calcium activity in neurons. The differences and similarities in the effects on the parameters of spontaneous calcium effects caused by different blockades of NO production help to improve understanding of how NO synthesis affects calcium dynamics in neurons.

AB  - The humoral response is complex and involves multiple cellular populations and signaling pathways. Bacterial and viral infections, as well as immunization regimens, can trigger this type of response, promoting the formation of microanatomical cellular structures called germinal centers (GCs). GCs formed in secondary lymphoid organs support the differentiation of high-affinity plasma cells and memory B cells. There is growing evidence that the quality of the humoral response is influenced by genetic variants. Using 12 genetically divergent mouse strains, we assessed the impact of genetics on GC cellular traits. At steady state, in the spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, we quantified GC B cells, plasma cells and follicular helper T cells. These traits were also quantified in the spleen of mice following immunization with a foreign antigen, namely, sheep red blood cells, in addition to the number and size of GCs. We observed both strain- and organ-specific variations in cell type abundance, as well as for GC number and size. Moreover, we find that some of these traits are highly heritable. Importantly, the results of this study inform on the impact of genetic diversity in shaping the GC response and identify the traits that are the most impacted by genetic background.
   In this study, we investigated the impact of genetic variation on the germinal center response. Using a panel of genetically divergent strains, we uncover an important impact of genetics on the number, size and cellular composition of germinal centers, both at steady state and after immune challenge. image

AB  - Lipid deposition is related to agricultural animal production and human health, and elucidating its molecular regulatory mechanisms is a topic of interest and a challenge in current scientific research. (MUSTN1) regulates growth and development, including muscle tissue; however, its role in fat deposition remains unknown. Thus, our objective was to determine this role. Our new findings were as follows: MUSTN1 was highly expressed in the fat tissue of pigs with strong adipose deposition capacity; functionally, MUSTN1 promoted the proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of porcine and mouse preadipocytes. MUSTN1 knockout mice were protected against HFD-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance; and fatty acid binding protein 3 was identified as an interacting protein of MUSTN1, which facilitated preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT signaling pathways. This study reveals a positive regulator for fat development, which suggests a novel approach for studying obesity and animal genetic improvement through the modulation of MUSTN1 expression.

AB  - The aim was to evaluate the effect of butterfly pea inclusion on the fermentation dynamics, nutritional quality and aerobic stability of mixed elephant grass silages. Butterfly pea levels (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% on a natural matter basis) were added to elephant grass silages. A completely randomized design was adopted, with 5 treatments and 3 replications, totaling 15 experimental silos, which were opened after 30 days of fermentation. The inclusion of butterfly pea in elephant grass silages resulted in a quadratic effect for permeability, density, maximum pH, final pH, time to reach maximum temperature and aerobic stability (P<0.05). Butterfly pea inclusion levels increased dry matter recovery, pH, dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, crude protein and total digestible nutrients (P<0.001) and reduced gas and effluent losses, mineral matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and total carbohydrates (P<0.001). Inclusions of 40, 60 and 80% of butterfly pea provided temperature increases at 10, 20, 30 and 40 hours. The inclusion of butterfly pea with levels of up to 80% reduces fermentation losses, allows for a nutritional increase and increase in aerobic stability of silages.

AB  - We examined the effects of a dihydropyridine analog, PAK-200, on guinea pig myocardium during experimental ischemia and reperfusion. In isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes, PAK-200 (1 mu M) had no effect on the basal peak inward and steady-state currents but inhibited the isoprenaline-induced time-independent Cl- current. In the right atria, PAK-200 had no effect on the beating rate and the chronotropic response to isoprenaline. In an ischemia-reperfusion model with coronary-perfused right ventricular tissue, a decrease in contractile force and a rise in tension were observed during a period of 30-min no-flow ischemia. Upon reperfusion, contractile force returned to less than 50% of preischemic values. PAK-200 had no effect on the decline in contractile force during the no-flow ischemia but reduced the rise in resting tension. PAK-200 significantly improved the recovery of contractile force after reperfusion to about 70% of the preischemic value. PAK-200 was also shown to attenuate the decrease in tissue ATP during ischemia. Treatment of ventricular myocytes with an ischemia-mimetic solution resulted in depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations. PAK-200 significantly delayed these changes. Thus, PAK-200 inhibits the cAMP-activated chloride current in cardiac muscle and may have protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury through novel mechanisms.

AB  - We have previously reported that two inhibitors of an E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), SMIP004 and C1, have an antidepressant-like effect in non-stressed and chronically stressed mice. This prompted us to ask whether other Skp2 inhibitors could also have an antidepressant effect. Here, we used NSC689857, another Skp2 inhibitor, to investigate this hypothesis. The results showed that administration of NSC689857 (5 mg/kg) produced an antidepressant-like effect in a time-dependent manner in non-stressed male mice, which started 8 days after drug administration. Dose-dependent analysis showed that administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, of NSC689857 produced antidepressant-like effects in both non-stressed male and female mice. Administration of NSC689857 (5 mg/kg) also induced antidepressant-like effects in non-stressed male mice when administered three times within 24 h (24, 5, and 1 h before testing) but not when administered acutely (1 h before testing). In addition, NSC689857 and fluoxetine coadministration produced additive antidepressant-like effects in non-stressed male mice. These effects of NSC689857 were not associated with the changes in locomotor activity. Administration of NSC689857 (5 mg/kg) also attenuated depression-like behaviors in male mice induced by chronic social defeat stress, suggesting therapeutic potential of NSC689857 in depression. Overall, these results suggest that NSC689857 is capable of exerting antidepressant-like effects in both non-stressed and chronically stressed mice.

AB  - Introduction: Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) is a protein involved in many neuronal processes in the nervous system including the modulation of synaptic transmission. The loss of FMRP produces the fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting synaptic and neuronal function and producing cognitive impairments. However, the effects of FXS on short-term processing of synaptic inputs and neuronal outputs in the hippocampus have not yet been sufficiently clarified. Furthermore, it is not known whether dorsal and ventral hippocampi are affected similarly or not in FXS. Method: We used an Fmr1 knockout (KO) rat model of FXS and recordings of evoked field potentials from the CA1 field of transverse slices from both the dorsal and the ventral hippocampi of adult rats. Results: Following application of a frequency stimulation protocol consisting of a ten-pulse train and recordings of fEPSP, we found that the dorsal but not ventral KO hippocampus shows altered short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, applying the frequency stimulation protocol and recordings of population spikes, both segments of the KO hippocampus display altered short-term neuronal dynamics. Conclusions: These data suggest that short-term processing of synaptic inputs is affected in the dorsal, not ventral, FXS hippocampus, while short-term processing of neuronal output is affected in both segments of the FXS hippocampus in a similar way. These FXS-associated changes may have significant impact on the functions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampi in individuals with FXS.

AB  - Four types of permeable pavements were monitored at the Edison Environmental Center in Edison, New Jersey, for three water quality indicator organisms consisting of fecal coliform, enterococci, and Escherichia coli. This study expands a previously published result based on less than a year of available data. The current study reflects nearly 5 years of data collection with efforts focusing on collection of data in all four seasons to analyze seasonal effects and to understand the effects of pH on infiltrate concentrations. All three indicators were detected in infiltrates from all four permeable surfaces and as well as asphalt and roof runoff. Seasonally, the infiltrate during winter had fewer detections and lower enumerations and was most often significantly different than surface infiltrate and runoff for the other seasons. More significant concentration reductions were observed in summer and fall, and the lowest reduction was observed in winter. Pervious Asphalt treatment removed the most microorganisms for all three indicator organisms. A permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP) that was a replacement for pervious concrete during the study performed better than the original PICP most likely due to smaller gap spacing (8 mm compared to 12.7 mm) and correspondingly smaller specified surface aggregate compared to the original PICP. Percent concentration removal reductions based on geometric means were 89% or greater for PC, PA, and PICP for fecal coliform; 75% or better for PC, PA and PICP for E. coli; and 95% or greater for PC and PA for enterococci, while there were no annual removals for enterococci for original or new PICP nor removals for E. coli for original PICP and minimal removal for fecal coliform for original PICP. The major sources of fecal indicators in the stormwater runoff were most likely from the feces of deer, geese, and other wild animals. Practitioner Points The infiltrate during winter had fewer detections and lower enumerations and was most often significantly different than surface infiltrate and runoff for the other seasons. More significant concentration reductions were observed in summer and fall, and the lowest reduction was observed in winter. Pervious Asphalt treatment removed the most microorganisms for all three indicator organisms.

AB  - Inflammation plays a central role in stroke-induced brain injury. The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR) can modulate immune responses in both the periphery and the brain. The aims of the present study were to investigate alpha 7nAChR expression in different brain regions and evaluate the potential effect of the selective alpha 7nAChR agonist AR-R17779 on ischemia-reperfusion brain injury in mice. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to evaluate the absolute expression of the gene encoding alpha 7nAChR (Chrna7) in hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and cortex in adult, naive mice. Mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) or sham surgery were treated with alpha 7nAChR agonist AR-R17779 (12 mg/kg) or saline once daily for 5 days. Infarct size and microglial activation 7 days after tMCAO were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Chrna7 expression was found in all analyzed brain regions in naive mice with the highest expression in cortex and hippocampus. At sacrifice, white blood cell count was significantly decreased in AR-R17779 treated mice compared with saline controls in the sham groups, although, no effect was seen in the tMCAO groups. Brain injury and microglial activation were evident 7 days after tMCAO. However, no difference was found between mice treated with saline or AR-R17779. In conclusion, alpha 7nAChR expression varies in different brain regions and, despite a decrease in white blood cells in sham mice receiving AR-R17779, this compound does not affect stroke-induced brain injury.

AB  - PM2.5, recognized as a potential pathogenic factor for nervous system diseases, remains an area with many unknowns, particularly regarding its effects on human health. After five-month real-ambient PM2.5 exposure, we observed no significant pathological damage to the lung, liver, spleen, or kidney tissues. However, PM2.5 exposure led to neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal CA1 region of Brown Norway (BN) rats. The level of IL-6, IL-13, IL-1 beta, IL-12, IL-4, GRO/KC, MIP-1 alpha, CM-CSF significantly increased in lung lavage fluid (P < 0.05 for all). Notably, we detected a slight impairment in spatial learning ability, as evidenced by the Barnes maze training outcomes. There were no significant changes in the bacterial community in lung lavage fluid (P = 0.621), but the bacterial community in the gut significantly changed (P < 0.001), with more species identified (P < 0.05). The metabolomic analysis revealed 147 and 149 significantly changed metabolites in the pulmonary system and serum, respectively (P < 0.05). PM2.5 exposure caused a decrease in Nervonic acid (NA) in both the lung and serum, which likely contributed to spatial learning impairment (P < 0.01). The correlation between lung metabolites, gut bacterial species, and serum metabolites indicated that PM2.5 exposure likely impaired spatial learning through the lung-gut-brain axis pathway. Lung and serum metabolic disorders and intestinal microbial imbalance occurred in BN rats post-five-month real-ambient PM2.5 exposure. There were two potential ways that PM2.5 exposure caused the decline of spatial learning ability in wild-type BN rats: (1) PM2.5 exposure led to a significant decrease of neuroprotective Nervonic acid in lung and serum metabolites.

AB  - In this study, the Co29Cr9W3Cu porous scaffolds with different unit cell types including octahedron (OCT), face-centered cubic (FCC), and hexahedron (HCP) were fabricated by selective laser melting, aim-ing to reduce the stress shielding effect and promote the early bone ingrowth. The effect of pore size and unit cell types on the compressive stress and elastic modulus were investigated, and regulating pore size led to the compressive stress and elastic modulus ranging from 3.7 to 467 MPa and from 2.6 to 36.3 GPa, respectively. The in vitro results demonstrated that the ability to support the osteogenesis and angiogen-esis was for the most part similar between the FCC-65, OCT-65, and HCP-65 scaffolds (porosity of 65%). After implantation in goats for 12 weeks, the FCC-65, OCT-65, and HCP-65 scaffolds showed sufficient results for guiding bone ingrowth, indicating good biocompatibility and osteointegration; interestingly, the scaffold with OCT unit cell structure offered the strongest ability to accelerate bone mineralization compared with the FCC-65, HCP-65 scaffold, possibly due to mechanical-adapted properties. The study was expected to offer the possibility of the SLM-produced Co29Cr9W3Cu scaffold to achieve osseointe-gration by guiding early bone ingrowth into the bone contact porous surface of the ankle joint.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Simple Summary In the Mediterranean environment, climatic variability determines a discontinuity in the forage availability of pastures. Caciocavallo Palermitano is a cheese obtained from the milk of the Cinisara cattle breed, mainly raised on pasture. The present study investigated the fatty acid profile of cheeses produced in two typical farms in the four seasons of the year, with the aim of identifying specific fatty acids that can be used as biomarkers to discriminate the productions obtained in the different seasons, in order to economically enhance those seasonal productions that have better health characteristics. The results revealed the possibility of distinguishing spring productions from those of other seasons on the basis of the higher content of some fatty acids deriving from grazing fresh forage, the availability of which is greater in spring. Further studies should be conducted to also evaluate the possibility of using fatty acids as biomarkers of different diets. This experiment aims to evaluate the potential of fatty acids (FA) of Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese as biomarkers of production season and pasture-based diet. A total of 48 cheeses were made in the four seasons with milk from two farms that raised cows of Cinisara breed. The animals were fed on pasture with supplementation of wheat bran and wheat straw in the barn, and in summer also with Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes. The chemical composition and FA profile of cheese were influenced by the season and not by the farm. In particular, cheeses produced in spring were characterized by higher protein and lower fat, and showed higher contents in trans-vaccenic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, rumenic acid, n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), and total PUFA. In winter, the lower availability of grazing forage, requiring a higher level of feeding integration, was responsible for an increase of saturated FA (SFA). The multivariate analysis distinguished clearly the cheeses made in winter and spring, while those produced in autumn and summer showed some overlapping points. Further investigations should be carried out to evaluate the effects of type and level of feeding integration on the presence of FA more suitable to be used as biomarkers of period and diet.

AB  - A new species of small Hipposideros in the bicolor group is described based on specimens from Thailand and Malaysia. It can be distinguished from other small Hipposideros in Southeast Asia by a combination of external, craniodental, and bacular morphology, as well as echolocation call frequency. The new species has a distinct rounded swelling on the internarial septum of the noseleaf, with a forearm length of 35.3-42.6 mm, greatest skull length of 15.94-17.90 mm, and a call frequency of maximum energy of 132.3-144.0 kHz. Although clearly different in morphology, the new species forms a sister clade with H. kunzi and H. bicolor in the phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial DNA. In addition, this study reports echolocation and genetic data, with a confirmed record of H. einnaythu from Thailand for the first time. The new species most closely resembles H. einnaythu. However, it differs in the details of the noseleaf and craniodental morphology, and it has a genetic distance of 9.6% and 10.4% based on mitochondrial COI and ND2, respectively. It is currently documented from five localities: two in peninsular Thailand, at Hala Forest in Yala Province, and Phru To Daeng Swamp Forest in Narathiwat Province, one from peninsular Malaysia at Krau Wildlife Reserve in Pahang, and another two in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo at Gunung Kinabalu, and near Madai Caves. However, it is likely that many previous records of "H. cineraceus" from Borneo refer to this species. Most records of the species are from lowland evergreen rainforest, though one record from Sabah was at 1800m. The roosting sites for this new species are currently unknown. Future research with a combination of data such as genetics, echolocation and morphology would be necessary to further determine the species geographic distribution in Southeast Asia.

AB  - In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in the use of artificial illumination as a bycatch reduction device. In the U.S. West Coast groundfish bottom trawl fishery, research has found that the addition of green light-emitting diode (LED) lights to the upper bridles of low-rise cutback trawls significantly reduced Pacific halibut ( Hippoglossus stenolepis ) bycatch. Recent regulation changes in this fishery now permit high-rise trawls, a gear configuration with a higher vertical opening, in areas where only low-rise trawls were previously permitted. This study conducted catch comparison and catch ratio analyses to determine if catches of Pacific halibut and three commercially important groundfishes (e.g., petrale sole [ Eopsetta jordani ], Dover sole [ Microstomus pacificus ], and sablefish [ Anoplopoma fimbria ]) differ between illuminated and non-illuminated tows for a high-rise bottom trawl. Illuminated tows caught fewer individuals than the non-illuminated tows across all species, including Pacific halibut; however, the difference in catch efficiency was not significant. Total catch volume did have a significant positive effect on levels of glucose and lactate for Pacific halibut. However, no statistically significant differences between illuminated and non-illuminated tows were exhibited across all of the physiological parameters assessed. The results from our study provide valuable information to fishers and managers that can be used for future decision-making and identifying research priorities.

AB  - After the last interglacial [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e] Europe was affected by several harsh climatic oscillations. In this context southern Italy acted, like the rest of peninsular Mediterranean Europe, as a 'glacial refugium', allowing the survival of various species, and was involved in the spread of 'cold taxa' (e.g. woolly mammoth and woolly rhino) only during the coldest phases (MIS 4 and MIS 2). Both late Mousterian and early Upper Palaeolithic sites testify to a human occupation continuity in southern Italy and especially in Apulia in this time span. Here we present a focus on three key Apulian Palaeolithic sequences (Grotta di Santa Croce, Riparo L'Oscurusciuto and Grotta del Cavallo - layers F-E) jointly spanning from the late MIS 4 to the demise of Neanderthals around 43 ka. Novel chronological, sedimentological and zooarchaeological data are discussed for the first time in the light of the palaeoenvironmental information provided by recent analyses carried out on a speleothem from Pozzo Cucu cave (Bari) and the results of the magnetic susceptibility analysis from Riparo L'Oscurusciuto. This integrated reading allows a better understanding of the role played by the Apulian region as both a refugium for late Neaderthals and a suitable habitat for the early settling of modern humans.

AB  - Residual pesticides in agricultural environments, including soil and irrigation water, can be taken up by plants, and thus pose a potential risk to food safety. Although tolfenpyrad has been widely used in tea plantations, limited information is available on its root uptake and fate in tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.). Exploring the mechanisms involved is crucial for understanding the migration and accumulation of tolfenpyrad in tea plants, particularly in the edible parts. In this study, root uptake of tolfenpyrad and its subsequent translocation, distribution, and metabolism in tea seedlings were investigated. The results indicated that the passive transport and apoplastic pathway dominated the root uptake of tolfenpyrad. After uptake, tolfenpyrad distributed predominantly in the cell walls (90.8-92.0 %) of roots, resulting in limited upward translocation in water-soluble fractions through transpirational pull, with translocation factor values far <1 (TFstem/root = 0.115-0.453 and TFleaf/stem = 0.039-0.184). Similar accumulation patterns were observed for the carboxylated metabolite PT-CA as well as hydroxylated metabolite PT-OH. Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of PT-CA in stems was much different from that of the parent tolfenpyrad: PT-CA mainly distributed in the stem cell walls (41.72 %) and cell organelles (56.18 %) at 3 h, then gradually transferred into the cell-soluble fractions (33.07 %) after 120 h. Results from the present study indicated limited upward translocation of tolfenpyrad with its main metabolites to leaves. This finding helps to alleviate concerns about environmental residual tolfenpyrad in tea consumption and provides valuable information for the safety evaluation of tolfenpyrad.

AB  - Widespread pollution of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) poses significant threats to organisms and human health. However, the extent of MPs and NPs contamination and their ecological risks to wildlife remain underexplored. In this study, we used Laser Direct Infrared (LDIR) spectroscopy to identify and characterize MPs in the intestinal contents of 49 bird species, and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to identify NPs in the intestinal contents of five species. LDIR analysis indicated that chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were the most prevalent plastics among 32 identified types. MP particle sizes below 100 mu m were most abundant, and MPs were predominantly in the form of fragments or pellets. We also found that birds with narrower dietary niche breadth had more MPs. Herbivorous and carnivorous birds had higher MP abundance than omnivorous species, which suggests the capacity of MP accumulation across diet categories. The Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) for MPs revealed that most species sampled were classified at hazard levels III or IV. Py-GC/MS identified four types of NPs in bird intestines, including nylon 66 (PA66), PVC, polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). This study advances our knowledge of plastic pollution ingested by terrestrial organisms and the risks associated with increased plastic pollution in the environment.

AB  - AimsGastric adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (GAED) is a rare subset of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing carcinomas with poor prognosis. However, the molecular features associated with the malignant potential of GEAD remain partially elucidated. Methods and resultsIn this study, the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and aggressive biological behaviour was analysed in 37 patients with GAED. The results showed that GAED tended to infiltrate the deep layer of the gastric wall and possessed more frequent vascular invasion than conventional gastric adenocarcinoma (CGA) (P < 0.001). All distant metastases were observed in the GAED group, not the CGA group (P < 0.001). High HER2 expression was found in nearly 24.32% of the informative cases, and none showed EBV-encoded RNA positivity or deficient mismatch repair. The most frequently mutated gene in GAED was p53. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunostaining revealed 13 patients with a combined positive score (CPS) & GE; 5 (65%, 13 of 20). Thus, based on these molecular markers (immunostaining, in situ hybridisation and mutation analysis), GAED may be classified as a unique subgroup of the chromosomal instability subtype with HER2(+)/EBV-/MSS/TP53(+)/PD-L1(+). Next-generation sequencing analyses showed that mutations in the TOPI, ELOA and NOTCH3 genes were found only in GAED, and abnormally expressed genes in GAED were significantly enriched in hepatocellular carcinoma-, gland development-, and gastric cancer-related pathways. ConclusionThe HER2(+)/EBV-/MSS/TP53(+)/PD-L1(+) profile and hepatocellular carcinoma-related pathways may be significant in the malignant potential of GAED. In addition to anti-HER2 therapy, immune check-point inhibitors may be an effective treatment option for patients with GAED.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the spatial and temporal regulation of muscle development and regeneration. Nevertheless, the determination of their biological functions and mechanisms underlying muscle regeneration remains challenging. Here, we identified a lncRNA named lncMREF (lncRNA muscle regeneration enhancement factor) as a conserved positive regulator of muscle regeneration among mice, pigs and humans. Functional studies demonstrated that lncMREF, which is mainly expressed in differentiated muscle satellite cells, promotes myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, lncMREF interacts with Smarca5 to promote chromatin accessibility when muscle satellite cells are activated and start to differentiate, thereby facilitating genomic binding of p300/CBP/H3K27ac to upregulate the expression of myogenic regulators, such as MyoD and cell differentiation. Our results unravel a novel temporal-specific epigenetic regulation during muscle regeneration and reveal that lncMREF/Smarca5-mediated epigenetic programming is responsible for muscle cell differentiation, which provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of muscle regeneration.

AB  - Soy isoflavones (SIF) are bioactive compounds with low bioavailability due to their poor water solubility. In this study, we utilized polymerized goat milk whey protein (PGWP) as a carrier to encapsulate SIF with encapsulation efficiency of 89%, particle size of 135.53 nm, and zeta potential of -35.16 mV. The PGWP-SIF nanoparticles were evaluated for their stability and in vitro digestion properties, and their ability to transport SIF was assessed using a Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The nanoparticles were resistant to aggregation when subjected to pH changes (pH 2.0 to 8.0), sodium chloride addition (0-200 mM), temperature fluctuations (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C), and long-term storage (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 30 days), which was mainly attributed to the repulsion generated by steric hindrance effects. During gastric digestion, only 5.93% of encapsulated SIF was released, highlighting the nanoparticles' resistance to enzymatic digestion in the stomach. However, a significant increase in SIF release to 56.61% was observed during intestinal digestion, indicating the efficient transport of SIF into the small intestine for absorption. Cytotoxicity assessments via the MTT assay showed no adverse effects on Caco-2 cell lines after encapsulation. The PGWP-stabilized SIF nanoparticles improved the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of Caco-2 cells for SIF by 11.8-fold. The results indicated that using PGWP to encapsulate SIF was an effective approach for delivering SIF, while enhancing its bioavailability and transcellular transport.

AB  - Carbendazim (CBZ) is one of the most common fungicides used to fight plant fungal diseases, otherwise, it leaves residue on fruits, vegetables, and soil that contaminate the environment, water, animal, and human causing serious health problems. Several studies have reported the reproductive and endocrine pathological disorders induced by CBZ in several animal models, but little is known about its neurotoxicity. So that, the present study aimed to explain the possible mechanisms of CBZ induced neurotoxicity in rats. Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 15). Group (1) received normal saline and was kept as the negative control group, whereas groups (2, 3, 4) received CBZ at 100, 300, 600 mg/kg b.wt respectively. All rats received the aforementioned materials daily via oral gavage. Brain tissue samples were collected at 7, 14, 28 days from the beginning of the experiment. CBZ induced oxidative stress damage manifested by increasing MDA levels and reducing the levels of TAC, GSH, CAT in some brain areas at 14 and 28 days. There were extensive neuropathological alterations in the cerebrum, hippocampus, and cerebellum with strong caspase-3, iNOS, Cox-2 protein expressions mainly in rats receiving 600 mg/kg CBZ at each time point. Moreover, upregulation of mRNA levels of NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, IL-1B genes and downregulation of the transcript levels of both AchE and MAO genes were recorded in all CBZ receiving groups at 14 and 28 days especially those receiving 600 mg/kg CBZ. Our results concluded that CBZ induced dose- and time-dependent neurotoxicity via disturbance of oxidant/antioxidant balance and activation of NF-kappa B signaling pathway. We recommend reducing the uses of CBZ in agricultural and veterinary fields or finding other novel formulations to reduce its toxicity on non-target organisms and enhance its efficacy on the target organisms.

AB  - The benefits of estrogen treatment on cognition in middle-aged and older women are dependent on many factors, including the timing of treatment. Moreover, the potential interactive effects with other lifestyle factors, such as exercise, are poorly understood. In this study, we tested for lasting benefits of independent and combined treatment with estrogen and voluntary exercise initiated in midlife, using a rat model of menopause. Twelvemonth-old, retired female breeders were bilaterally ovariectomized and received six weeks of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) treatment via subcutaneous implant, with or without access to running wheels. After E2 treatment, animals in the exercise groups had running wheel access for seven additional weeks, including a two-week period of cognitive and affective testing. Thereafter, hippocampal neuronal and cellular plasticity were assessed. E2 and exercise independently exerted effects on behavioral and cellular outcome measures. Transient E2 treatment enduringly increased motor output, lowered body weight, and increased behavioral plasticity. Exercise decreased total hippocampal microglia number and increased brain weight. No additive effects of exercise and E2 treatment were observed. E2 treatment may provide a means by which to enduringly increase physical activity in middle age, but combined E2 and exercise do not produce additive benefits on hippocampal behavioral or cellular plasticity.

AB  - In the ruminant placenta, glucose uptake and transfer are mediated by facilitative glucose transporters SLC2A1 (GLUT1) and SLC2A3 (GLUT3). SLC2A1 is located on the basolateral trophoblast membrane, whereas SLC2A3 is located solely on the maternal-facing, apical trophoblast membrane. While SLC2A3 is less abundant than SLC2A1, SLC2A3 has a five-fold greater affinity and transport capacity. Based on its location, SLC2A3 likely plays a significant role in the uptake of glucose into the trophoblast. Fetal hypoglycemia is a hallmark of fetal growth restriction (FGR), and as such, any deficiency in SLC2A3 could impact trophoblast glucose uptake and transfer to the fetus, thus potentially setting the stage for FGR. By utilizing in vivo placenta-specific lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in sheep, we were able to significantly diminish (p <= 0.05) placental SLC2A3 concentration, and determine the impact at mid-gestation (75 dGA). In response to SLC2A3 RNAi (n = 6), the fetuses were hypoglycemic (p <= 0.05), exhibited reduced fetal growth, including reduced fetal pancreas weight (p <= 0.05), which was associated with reduced umbilical artery insulin and glucagon concentrations, when compared to the non-targeting sequence (NTS) RNAi controls (n = 6). By contrast, fetal liver weights were not impacted, nor were umbilical artery concentrations of IGF1, possibly resulting from a 70% increase (p <= 0.05) in umbilical vein chorionic somatomammotropin (CSH) concentrations. Thus, during the first half of gestation, a deficiency in SLC2A3 results in fetal hypoglycemia, reduced fetal development, and altered metabolic hormone concentrations. These results suggest that SLC2A3 may be the rate-limiting placental glucose transporter during the first-half of gestation in sheep.

AB  - Localization of mRNA facilitates spatiotemporally controlled protein expression in neurons. In axons, mRNA transport followed by local protein synthesis plays a critical role in axonal growth and guidance. However, it is not yet clearly understood how mRNA is transported to axonal subcellular sites and what regulates axonal mRNA localization. Using a transgenic mouse model in which endogenous beta-actin mRNA is fluorescently labeled, we investigated beta-actin mRNA movement in axons of hippocampal neurons. We cultured neurons in microfluidic devices to separate axons from dendrites and performed single-particle tracking of axonal beta-actin mRNA. Compared with dendritic beta-actin mRNA, axonal beta-actin mRNA showed less directed motion and exhibited mostly subdiffusive motion, especially near filopodia and boutons in mature dissociated hippocampal neurons. We found that axonal beta-actin mRNA was likely to colocalize with actin patches (APs), regions that have a high density of filamentous actin (F-actin) and are known to have a role in branch initiation. Moreover, simultaneous imaging of F-actin and axonal beta-actin mRNA in live neurons revealed that moving beta-actin mRNA tended to be docked in the APs. Our findings reveal that axonal beta-actin mRNA localization is facilitated by actin networks and suggest that localized beta-actin mRNA plays a potential role in axon branch formation.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effects of paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) on behavioral and oxidative stress parameters in the brain and serum of mice submitted to the animal model of hyperglycemia induced by alloxan, mimicking the main symptom of diabetes mellitus (DM). Adults C57BL/6 male and female mice received an injection of alloxan, and ten days later, the animals were submitted to the PSD for 36 h. The animals' behavioral parameters were evaluated in the open-field test. Oxidative stress parameters [Diacetyldichlorofluorescein (DCF), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Glutathione] were assessed in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and serum. The PSD increased the male and female mice locomotion, but the alloxan's pre-administration prevented the PSD-induced hyperactivity. In addition, the male mice receiving alloxan and submitted to the PSD had elevated latency time in the first quadrant and the number of fecal boli, demonstrating increased anxiety-like behavior. The HPA-axis was hyperactivating in male and female mice pre-administered alloxan and/or PSD-submitted animals. The oxidative stress parameters were also increased in the serum of the animals administered alloxan and/or sleep-deprived mice. Despite alloxan or PSD leading to behavioral or biochemical alterations, the one did not potentiate the other in mice. However, more studies are necessary to identify the link between sleep and hyperglycemia.

AB  - The health status of livestock will directly or indirectly affect meat quality and farmers' income. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the physiological indicators of livestock to timely reflect their health status. The respiratory rhythm of animals can provide early warning for the occurrence of diseases, but there is currently limited research on the characteristics of the rhythm. Therefore, this paper conducted the following research. PVDF flexible piezoelectric sensors were prepared by spin-coating, laser-induced graphene, and transfer printing processes, in which three common flexible substrate materials were compared, three key parameters of laser scanning were explored, while practical application tests were carried out on model animals, and the collected respiratory rhythm signals were analyzed in the time and frequency domains. The results showed that (1) posilicone of 25 durometer was identified as the flexible substrate material, and the LIG process with a scanning speed of 120 mm/min, a scanning power of 12 %, and a scanning interval of 0.02 mm as the optimal parameters was determined; (2) the sensor exhibited a response speed of 50 ms, an output voltage of 3.7 v, and still had a stable output; (3) in the monitoring of the respiratory rhythm of rabbits, the monitoring accuracy reached 96.7 %, while the respiratory signal collected by the sensor was randomly intercepted for 10 s, and its respiratory rhythm prediction accuracy reached 95.85 %. At the same time, the abnormal respiratory rhythm change of the animal was found 10 min in advance, giving the farmer more time to deal with the problem. (4) The monitoring of the respiration of farm animals such as Hu sheep is being realised. At the same time, the time domain as well as frequency domain waveforms of the Hu sheep were analysed and compared with the time domain frequency domain plots of the rabbit, which showed that the sensor could achieve good results for both higher frequency breathing and low-frequency breathing. It provides potential technical support for future health monitoring and early prediction of diseases in large farm animals.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, or chondrocytes, show evidence that the donor cell's metabolic type influences the osteogenic process. Limited knowledge exists on DNA methylation changes during osteogenic differentiation and the impact of diverse donor genetic backgrounds on MSC differentiation. In this study, synovial membrane mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) from two pig breeds (Angeln Saddleback, AS; German Landrace, DL) with distinct metabolic phenotypes were isolated, and the methylation pattern of SMSCs during osteogenic induction was investigated. Results showed that most differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were hypomethylated in osteogenic-induced SMSC group. These DMRs were enriched with genes of different osteogenic signalling pathways at different time points including Wnt, ECM, TGFB and BMP signalling pathways. AS pigs consistently exhibited a higher number of hypermethylated DMRs than DL pigs, particularly during the peak of osteogenesis (day 21). Predicting transcription factor motifs in regions of DMRs linked to osteogenic processes and donor breeds revealed influential motifs, including KLF1, NFATC3, ZNF148, ASCL1, FOXI1, and KLF5. These findings contribute to understanding the pattern of methylation changes promoting osteogenic differentiation, emphasizing the substantial role of donor the metabolic type and epigenetic memory of different donors on SMSC differentiation.

AB  - The number of ribs (NRs) and the carcass length (CL) are important economic traits. The traits are usually measured after slaughter. To improve the prediction performance of genomic selection (GS) for NRs and CL, one strategy is to integrate the significant loci identified from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data by genome-wide association study (GWAS) into the genomic prediction (GP) model. This study investigated the GP of different genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian models using chip genotype data, imputed WGS (iWGS) data and modeling significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different ways for the GP of NRs and CL in the Suhuai pig population. The prediction accuracy, bias and running time of 15 different GP models were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. The prediction accuracy of GBLUP using chip data for NRs and CL was 0.314 +/- 0.022 and 0.194 +/- 0.040, respectively. For NRs, based on the iWGS data, treating the most significant SNP as fixed effects in the GBLUP model had the highest predictive performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.528 +/- 0.023. For CL, based on the chip data, the model that added all the significant SNPs identified by imputed data by GWAS into the multi-trait GBLUP as the second random additive effect was the highest predictive performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.305 +/- 0.027. This study provides insights into optimizing GP models for small populations with phenotypes that are difficult to measure.

AB  - Growing evidences indicate that neuropathic pain is frequently accompanied with cognitive impairments, which aggravate the decrease in the quality of life of chronic pain patients. Furthermore, it has been shown that the activation of Glucagon-like-peptide-1receptor (GLP-1R) improved memory deficit in multiple diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke. However, whether GLP-1R activation could improve memory impairment induced by neuropathic pain and the mechanisms underlying the effect of the activation of GLP-1R on memory protection have not yet been established. The spared nerve injury (SNI) model was established as a kind of neuropathic pain. And novel-object recognition memory (hippocampus-dependent memory) was tested by the novel object recognition test (NORT). The expression levels of GLP-1, GLP-1R, adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK), p-AMPKThr172, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kappa B p65), interleukin-1beta (IL1 beta), IL-1 beta p17 (mature IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the synaptic proteins were tested in the murine hippocampus with memory deficits caused by neuropathic pain. Then, exenatide acetate (Ex-4, a GLP-1R agonist), exendin (9-39) (Ex(9-39), a GLP-1R antagonist) and Compound C dihydrochloride (CC, an AMPK inhibitor) were used to test the effects of the activation of GLP-1R in the mice with neuropathic pain. First, we uncovered that neuropathic pain could inhibit GLP-1/GLP-R axis, disturb inflammatory signaling pathway, increase the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-1 beta p17 and TNF-alpha, downregulate the synaptic proteins (postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and Arc). Subsequently, we reported that Ex-4 treatment could improve recognition memory impairment, increase the ratio of p-AMPKThr172/AMPK, inhibit the phosphorylation NF-kappa B p65 and decrease the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-1 beta p17 and TNF-alpha, upregulate the levels of PSD95 and Arc. Moreover, we found that Ex (9-39) and CC treatment could abrogate the memory protection of activation of GLP-1R in mice with neuropathic pain. The results indicated that the activation of GLP-1R could improve recognition memory impairment via regulating AMPK/NF-kappa B pathway, improving neuroinflammation, reversing the decreased level of synaptic proteins in neuropathic pain mice.

AB  - As a significant infectious disease in livestock, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) imposes substantial economic losses on the swine industry. Identification of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets has been a focal challenge in PPRS prevention and control. By integrating metabolomic and lipidomic serum analyses of clinical pig cohorts through a machine learning approach with in vivo and in vitro infection models, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is discovered as a serum metabolic biomarker for PRRS virus (PRRSV) clinical diagnosis. PRRSV promoted LPA synthesis by upregulating the autotaxin expression, which causes innate immunosuppression by dampening the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and type I interferon responses, leading to enhanced virus replication. Targeting LPA demonstrated protection against virus infection and associated disease outcomes in infected pigs, indicating that LPA is a novel antiviral target against PRRSV. This study lays a foundation for clinical prevention and control of PRRSV infections.
   This study analyzes metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of PRRSV-infected pigs using a machine learning approach, identifying LPA as a serum diagnostic biomarker. PRRSV augments LPA synthesis by upregulating ATX expression, leading to RIG-I and IFN-beta suppression, and increases virus replication.

AB  - In the context of a large animal model of early osteoarthritis (OA) treated by orthobiologics, the purpose of this study was to reveal relations between articular tissues structure/composition and cartilage viscoelasticity. Twenty-four sheep, with induced knee OA, were treated by mesenchymal stem cells in various preparations-adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and amniotic endothelial cells (AECs)-and euthanized at 3 or 6 months to evaluate the (i) biochemistry of synovial fluid; (ii) histology, immunohistochemistry, and histomorphometry of articular cartilage; and (iii) viscoelasticity of articular cartilage. After performing an initial analysis to evaluate the correlation and multicollinearity between the investigated variables, this study used machine learning (ML) models-Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to classify variables according to their importance and employ them for interpretation and prediction. The experimental setup revealed a potential relation between cartilage elastic modulus and cartilage thickness (CT), synovial fluid interleukin 6 (IL6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and between cartilage relaxation time and CT and PGE2. SVF treatment was the only limit on the deleterious OA effect on cartilage viscoelastic properties. This work provides indications to future studies aiming to highlight these and other relationships and focusing on advanced regeneration targets.

AB  - Aberrant alternative splicing events (AASEs) are key biological processes for tumorigenesis and the rationale for designing splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs). However, the landscape of AASEs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear, which undermines the development of SSOs for ESCC. Here, we profiled AASEs based on 125 pairs of RNA-seq libraries. We identified 14,710 AASEs in ESCC, most of which (92.67%) affected coding genes. The first exon of transcripts was frequently changed in ESCC. We constructed a regulatory network where 74 RNA-binding proteins regulated 2142 AASEs. This network was enriched in apoptotic pathways and various adhesion/junction-related processes. Somatic mutations in ESCC regulating ASEs were mainly through trans-regulatory mode and were enriched in intron regions. Isoform switches of apoptotic genes and binding genes both tended to induce "noncoding transcripts" and "domain loss," disrupting the apoptotic and Hippo signaling pathways. All ESCC samples were grouped into three clusters with different AASEs patterns and the second cluster was identified as "cold tumor," with a low abundance of immune cells, activated immune pathways, and immunomodulators. Our work comprehensively profiled the landscape of AASEs in ESCC, revealed novel AASEs related to tumorigenesis and immune microenvironment, and suggested promising directions for designing SSOs for ESCC.

AB  - Simple Summary: Production of small ruminants, specifically hair sheep, has increased in recent years and has resulted in an increased presence of hair sheep in feedlots for finishing. In 2017, the United States banned the use of antibiotic growth promoters. This ban has resulted in an interest in non-medicated feed additives, such as yeast, to aid in growth promotion. While hair lambs tend to take longer to reach an adequate finishing weight, the utilization of a yeast fermentation product may aid as a natural growth promoter in the feedlot. Additionally, interest in grass-based finishing systems has grown, but there are limited data on using stored cool-season forages as the base of the diet. Based on the results of this experiment, the inclusion of a yeast fermentation product can improve the feedlot performance and carcass texture of hair lambs in a feedlot with an annual ryegrass-hay-based diet.
   Hair sheep production has increased in recent years, which has resulted in an increased presence in feedlots. Additionally, grass-based finishing systems for ruminant animal production have increased. Data are limited for finishing hair lambs on diets based on cool-season hay. The objective was to evaluate a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP) on the feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of Katahdin lambs offered an annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum)-hay-based diet. Twenty-four Katahdin lambs (21.5 +/- 2.5 kg BW) were assigned to either the control (CON) or the yeast-supplemented group (SCFP) in a completely randomized design. Lambs were offered a 14% crude protein total mixed ration diet based on annual ryegrass hay. The SCFP group also received the yeast supplement in their diet. Lambs in the SCFP group had a higher final body weight (p < 0.01) and ADG (p = 0.01). Less maximum and total energy were required to cut SCFP lamb meat compared to CON lamb meat (p < 0.03). Results from this study indicated that SCFP supplementation may prove to be beneficial in hair lamb finishing diets. Future research will need to specifically evaluate the use of these products in hair lambs with a larger sample size.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is the most popular nonalcoholic beverage worldwide. During cultivation, tea plants are susceptible to herbivores and pathogens, which can seriously affect tea yield and quality. A previous report showed that (Z)-3-hexenol is a potentially efficient defensive substance. However, the molecular mechanism mediating (Z)-3-hexenol signaling in tea plants and the resulting effects on plant defenses remain uncharacterized. To clarify the signaling mechanisms in which (Z)-3-hexenol and light are involved, the gene transcription and metabolite levels were assessed, respectively. This study demonstrated that tea plants rapidly and continuously release (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol in response to an insect infestation. (Z)-3-Hexen-1-ol absorbed by adjacent healthy plants would be converted into three insect defensive compounds: (Z)-3-hexenyl-glucoside, (Z)-3-hexenyl-primeveroside, and (Z)-3-hexenyl-vicianoside identified with laboratory-synthesized standards. Moreover, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol also activates the synthesis of jasmonic acid to enhance the insect resistance of tea plants. Additionally, a continuous light treatment induces the accumulation of (Z)-3-hexenyl-glycosides. Hence, (Z)-3-hexenol serves as a light-regulated signaling molecule that activates the systemic defenses of adjacent plants. Our study reveals the molecular mechanisms by which biotic and abiotic factors synergistically regulate the signaling functions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in plants, providing valuable information for future comprehensive analyses of the systemic defense mechanisms in plants.

AB  - Background: Noise is an important environmental stressor in the industrialized world and has received increasing attention in recent years. Although epidemiological research has extensively demonstrated the relationship between noise and cognitive impairment, the specific molecular mechanisms and targets remain to be fully explored and understood.Methods: To address this issue, 5-month-old C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups, with one group exposed to white noise at 98 dB. The effects of noise on cognition in mice were investigated through molecular biology and behavioral experiments. Subsequently, transcriptomic sequencing of the hippocampus in both groups of mice was performed and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted using KEGG and GO databases. Furthermore, LASSO analysis was used to further narrow down the relevant DEGs, followed by enrichment analysis of these genes using KEGG and GO databases. The DEGs were further validated by rt-qPCR.Results: Following noise exposure, the hippocampus levels of inflammation-related factors increased, the phosphorylation of Tau protein increased, the postsynaptic density protein decreased, the number of Nissl bodies decreased, and cell shrinkage in the hippocampus increased. Moreover, the behavioral experiments manifest characteristics indicative of a decline in cognitive.A total of 472 DEGs were identified through transcriptomic analysis, and seven relevant genes were screened by the LASSO algorithm, which were further validated by PCR to confirm their consistency with the omics results.Conclusion: In conclusion, noise exposure affects cognitive function in mice through multiple pathways, and the omics results provide new evidence for the cognitive impairment induced by noise exposure.

AB  - Swine biomedical models have been gaining in popularity over the last decade, particularly for applications in oncology research. Swine models for cancer research include pigs that have severe combined immunodeficiency for xenotransplantation studies, genetically modified swine models which are capable of developing tumors in vivo, as well as normal immunocompetent pigs. In recent years, there has been a low success rate for the approval of new oncological therapeutics in clinical trials. The two leading reasons for these failures are either due to toxicity and safety issues or lack of efficacy. As all therapeutics must be tested within animal models prior to clinical testing, there are opportunities to expand the ability to assess efficacy and toxicity profiles within the preclinical testing phases of new therapeutics. Most preclinical in vivo testing is performed in mice, canines, and non-human primates. However, swine models are an alternative large animal model for cancer research with similarity to human size, genetics, and physiology. Additionally, tumorigenesis pathways are similar between human and pigs in that similar driver mutations are required for transformation. Due to their larger size, the development of orthotopic tumors is easier than in smaller rodent models; additionally, porcine models can be harnessed for testing of new interventional devices and radiological/surgical approaches as well. Taken together, swine are a feasible option for preclinical therapeutic and device testing. The goals of this resource are to provide a broad overview on regulatory processes required for new therapeutics and devices for use in the clinic, cross-species differences in oncological therapeutic responses, as well as to provide an overview of swine oncology models that have been developed that could be used for preclinical testing to fulfill regulatory requirements.

AB  - High and Low Activity strains of mice were bidirectionally selected for differences in open-field activity (DeFries et al., 1978, Behavior Genetics, 8: 3-13) and subsequently inbred to use as a genetic model for studying anxiety-like behaviors (Booher et al., 2021, Genes, Brain and Behavior, 20: e12730). Hippocampal RNA-sequencing of the High and Low Activity mice identified 3901 differentially expressed protein-coding genes, with both sex-dependent and sex-independent effects. Functional enrichment analysis (PANTHER) highlighted 15 gene ontology terms, which allowed us to create a narrow list of 264 top candidate genes. Of the top candidate genes, 46 encoded four Complexes (I, II, IV and V) and two electron carriers (cytochrome c and ubiquinone) of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process. The most striking results were in the female high anxiety, Low Activity mice, where 39/46 genes relating to oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated. In addition, comparison of our top candidate genes with two previously curated High and Low Activity gene lists highlight 24 overlapping genes, where Ndufa13, which encodes the supernumerary subunit A13 of complex I, was the only gene to be included in all three lists. Mitochondrial dysfunction has recently been implicated as both a cause and effect of anxiety-related disorders and thus should be further explored as a possible novel pharmaceutical treatment for anxiety disorders.

AB  - Hypoxia is a critical environmental stressor affecting fish survival and physiological function. Landlocked rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and anadromous steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), two ecotypes of the same species, exhibit distinct physiological adaptations to fluctuating oxygen levels. To investigate their responses to acute hypoxia in these fish, brain histology and transcriptome analyses were conducted before stress, after hypoxia (12 and 24 h), and after reoxygenation (24 h). The results showed that the number of vacuolated nerve cells in the brain increased with the duration of hypoxia and decreased after 24 h of reoxygenation in both fish. RNA-Seq analysis identified 8409 differentially expressed genes (3952 in rainbow trout and 4457 in steelhead), one hypoxia-related module (MEred), and two significantly expressed gene clusters (cluster 3 in rainbow trout and cluster 8 in steelhead) through differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and Mfuzz clustering. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that signal transduction, immune response, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were significantly influenced by hypoxia in both fish. Distinct hypoxic responses were observed: in rainbow trout, ferroptosis, necroptosis, phosphatidylinositol signaling, calcium, and apelin signaling pathways were enriched, whereas in steelhead, the enriched pathways included platelet activation, Rap1, PI3K-Akt, Hippo, relaxin, and oxytocin signaling. Steelhead display marginally greater hypoxia tolerance than rainbow trout, although the difference is minimal, likely owing to their classification as the same species. These findings provide insight into the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia and reoxygenation stress in salmonids, contributing to a broader understanding of oxygen homeostasis in fish.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop low-cost techniques for culturing seahorses in extensive shrimp ponds to foster a legal and more sustainable production chain to meet market demand for traditional Chinese medicine. In the present article, the results of two-year experiments of seahorse culture in cages and extensive shrimp ponds are reported. We found that juveniles of the lined seahorse survived in cages and ponds very well, and the juvenile survival generally was >70% during the experimental periods. The survival and growth of the juveniles were similar to or even better than that reported in indoor tank culture. Additionally, the lined seahorse survived well (>60%) at temperatures up to 34.6 degrees C which is the highest recorded temperature for the species in the field. For large ponds of >5 ha, cage culture may be a better way. For small ponds of <0.3 ha, culturing the seahorse in a pond is recommended. A 1000 m(2) pond could support around 7000 of the juveniles of the lined seahorse. In conclusion, culturing the lined seahorse in an extensive shrimp pond is technically feasible.

AB  - Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse can lead to dysregulation of chemical synapses by altering the release and uptake of neurotransmitters. Such alterations in neurotransmission modify synaptic plasticity which causes addictive-like behaviors. Our previous study shed light on the involvement of glial cells in morphine-induced behavioral responses. It has been shown that glial cells play an indispensable role in synaptic transmission through the release of gliotransmitter into and uptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. Connexin-43 (Cx43), the dominant Cx protein in astrocytes, is the main component of astrocytic gap junctions and hemichannels. It has a critical role in synaptic efficacy through setting the amount of presynaptic gliotransmitter release in physiological conditions. It is probable that addictive substances affecting gliotransmitters release through the alteration of Cx43 function. In this study, we examined the role of the hippocampal-specific astrocytic connexin (Cx43) in morphine-induced behavioral responses. Male rats received subcutaneous (s.c.) morphine sulfate (10 mg/kg) at an interval of 12 h for 9 days. The animals received microinjection of TAT-Gap19 (inhibitor of Cx43) into the CA1 region before each morning morphine administration. The animals were assessed for morphine dependence by monitoring naloxone hydrochloride precipitated withdrawal somatic signs. Results showed that animals receiving TAT-Gap19 before morphine injection demonstrated a significant reduction in several signs of morphine withdrawal such as Activity, Freezing, Chewing, Ptosis, Defecation, Teeth chattering, Writhing, Penis-licking, Head tremor, Scratching, Sniffing, Rearing, and Diarrhea (One way ANOVA, P < 0.001; P < 0.01; P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that hippocampal Cx43 may be involved in morphine induced behavioral responses. Therefore, gliotransmitter release by astrocytes seems to be a mechanism which is engaged in addictive-like behaviors.

AB  - David Sherry has been a pioneer in investigating the avian hippocampal formation (HF) and spatial memory. Following on his work and observations that HF is sensitive to the occurrence of reward (food), we were interested in carrying out an exploratory study to investigate possible HF involvement in the representation goal value and risk. Control sham-lesioned and hippocampal-lesioned pigeons were trained in an open field to locate one food bowl containing a constant two food pellets on all trials, and two variable bowls with one containing five pellets on 75% (High Variable) and another on 25% (Low Variable) of their respective trials (High-Variable and Low-Variable bowls were never presented together). One pairing of pigeons learned bowl locations (space); another bowl colors (feature). Trained to color, hippocampal-lesioned pigeons performed as rational agents in their bowl choices and were indistinguishable from the control pigeons, a result consistent with HF regarded as unimportant for non-spatial memory. By contrast, when trained to location, hippocampal-lesioned pigeons differed from the control pigeons. They made more first-choice errors to bowls that never contained food, consistent with a role of HF in spatial memory. Intriguingly, the hippocampal-lesioned pigeons also made fewer first choices to both variable bowls, suggesting that hippocampal lesions resulted in the pigeons becoming more risk averse. Acknowledging that the results are preliminary and further research is needed, the data nonetheless support the general hypothesis that HF-dependent memory representations of space capture properties of reward value and risk, properties that contribute to decision making when confronted with a choice.

AB  - Food insecurity is defined as having limited or uncertain access to nutritious foods, and adolescent food insecurity is associated with obesity and disordered eating behaviors in humans. We developed a rodent model of adolescent food insecurity to determine whether adolescent food insecurity per se promotes increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and altered eating behaviors during adulthood. Female juvenile Wistar rats were singly housed and assigned to three experimental diets: food-secure with standard chow (CHOW), food-secure with a high-fat/sugar Western diet (WD), and food-insecure with WD (WD-FI). Food-secure rats (CHOW and WD) received meals at fixed feeding times (9:00, 13:00, and 16:00). WD-FI rats received meals at unpredictable intervals of the above-mentioned feeding times but had isocaloric amounts of food to WD. We investigated the impact of adolescent food insecurity on motivation for sucrose (Progressive Ratio), approach-avoidance behavior for palatable high-fat food (Approach-Avoidance task), and susceptibility to weight gain and hyperphagia when given an obesogenic choice diet. Secondary outcomes were the effects of food insecurity during development on anxiety-like behaviors (Open Field and Elevated Plus Maze) and learning and memory function (Novel Location Recognition task). Rodents with adolescent food insecurity showed a greater trend of weight gain and significantly increased fat mass and liver fat accumulation on an obesogenic diet in adulthood, despite no increases in motivation for sucrose or high-fat food. These data suggest that adolescent unpredictable food access increases susceptibility to diet-induced fat gain without impacting food motivation or food intake in female rodents. These findings are among a small group of recent studies modeling food insecurity in rodents and suggest that adolescent food insecurity in females may have long-term implications for metabolic physiology later in life.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective vulnerability of distinct cell populations; however, the cause for this specificity remains elusive. Here, we show that entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) neurons are unusually vulnerable to prolonged neuronal inactivity compared with neighboring regions of the temporal lobe, and that reelin + stellate cells connecting EC with the hippocampus are preferentially susceptible within the EC2 population. We demonstrate that neuronal death after silencing can be elicited through multiple independent means of activity inhibition, and that preventing synaptic release, either alone or in combination with electrical shunting, is sufficient to elicit silencing-induced degeneration. Finally, we discovered that degeneration following synaptic silencing is governed by competition between active and inactive cells, which is a circuit refinement process traditionally thought to end early in postnatal life. Our data suggests that the developmental window for wholesale circuit plasticity may extend into adulthood for specific brain regions. We speculate that this sustained potential for remodeling by entorhinal neurons may support lifelong memory but renders them vulnerable to prolonged activity changes in disease.

AB  - Dynamic crosstalk between the embryo and mother is crucial during implantation. Here, we comprehensively profile the single-cell transcriptome of pig peri-implantation embryos and corresponding maternal endometrium, identifying 4 different lineages in embryos and 13 cell types in the endometrium. Cell-specific gene expression characterizes 4 distinct trophectoderm subpopulations, showing development from undifferentiated trophectoderm to polar and mural trophectoderm. Dynamic expression of genes in different types of endometrial cells illustrates their molecular response to embryos during implantation. Then, we developed a novel tool, ExtraCellTalk, generating an overall dynamic map of maternal-foetal crosstalk using uterine luminal proteins as bridges. Through cross-species comparisons, we identified a conserved RBP4/STRA6 pathway in which embryonic-derived RBP4 could target the STRA6 receptor on stromal cells to regulate the interaction with other endometrial cells. These results provide insight into the maternal-foetal crosstalk during embryo implantation and represent a valuable resource for further studies to improve embryo implantation.

AB  - Plant volatile compounds have important physiological and ecological functions. Phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), a volatile phenylpropanoid/benzenoid, accumulates in the leaves of tea (Camellia sinensis) plants grown under continuous shading. This study was conducted to determine whether PAld production is correlated with light and to elucidate the physiological functions of PAld in tea plants. Specifically, the upstream mechanism modulating PAld biosynthesis in tea plants under different light conditions as well as the effects of PAld on chloroplast/chlorophyll were investigated. The biosynthesis of PAld was inhibited under light, whereas it was induced in darkness. The structural gene encoding aromatic amino acid aminotransferase 1 (CsAAAT1) was expressed at a high level in darkness, consistent with its importance for PAld accumulation. Additionally, the results of a transcriptional activation assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated CsAAAT1 expression was slightly activated by phytochrome-interacting factor 3-2 (CsPIF3-2), which is a light-responsive transcription factor. Furthermore, PAld might promote the excitation of chlorophyll in dark-treated chloroplasts and mediate electron energy transfer in cells. However, the accumulated PAld can degrade chloroplasts and chlorophyll, with potentially detrimental effects on photosynthesis. Moreover, PAld biosynthesis is inhibited in tea leaves by red and blue light, thereby decreasing the adverse effects of PAld on chloroplasts during daytime. In conclusion, the regulated biosynthesis of PAld in tea plants under light and in darkness leads to chloroplast modifications. The results of this study have expanded our understanding of the biosynthesis and functions of volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids in tea leaves.

AB  - The deteriorating effects of Lead (Pb) on central nervous system (CNS) such as cerebellum has been demonstrated in previous studies. Glycoconjugates with the important role in CNS development may be affected by Pbexposure. Utilization of antioxidant agents and herbal plants has attracted a great deal of attention on attenuating neurotoxicants-induced damage. Thus, in this study the neuroprotective effects of vitamin C and garlic on content of glycoconjugates of cerebellar cortex in Pb-exposed animals were investigated. Wistar pregnant rats were divided into: control (C), Pb-exposed (Pb) (1500 ppm lead acetate in drinking water), Pb plus vitamin C (Pb + Vit C) (500 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, Pb plus garlic (Pb + G) (1 mL /100 g body weight fresh garlic juice via gavage), Pb plus vitamin C and garlic (Pb + Vit C + G), and sham groups (Sh). Finally, levels of Pb in blood were measured in both rats and offspring on postnatal day 50 (PND50). Also, the cerebellums were removed for measuring Pb-levels and performing lectin histochemistry. Blood and cerebellar Pb-levels were increased in Pbexposed group compared to control group (P < 0.001), whereas they were decreased significantly in Pb + Vit C, Pb + G, and Pb + Vit C + G groups (P < 0.01). By using MPA, UEA-1, and WGA lectin histochemistry, Pb-exposed group showed weak staining intensity compared to other groups. Besides, significant decrease was observed in the density of lectin-positive neurons of Pb-exposed group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, strong staining intensity and high lectin-positive neurons were found in Pb + Vit C, Pb + G and Pb + Vit C + G groups than Pb-exposed group (P < 0.001). The present study revealed that Pb-exposure can result in alteration in the cerebellar glycoconjugates contents and co-administration of vitamin C and garlic could attenuate the adverse effects of Pb. The findings of this study revealed the ameliorating effects of vitamin C and garlic against Pb, suggesting the potential use of vitamin C and garlic as preventive agents in Pb poisoning.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant mRNA modification, regulates various mRNA metabolism to affect numerous physiological processes, including immune response. Interestingly, many RNA viruses contain internal m(6)A modifications that contribute to viral replication and innate immune escape process, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is a common cause of diarrhea and gastroenteritis in piglets. Here, we first revealed the m(6)A methylation profile on the PoRV genome. PoRV infection significantly reduced methyltransferase METTL3 expression and induced nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of METTL3. The structural protein VP6 of PoRV can co-localize with METTL3 in the cytoplasm and bind to METTL3 protein, suggesting that PoRV hijacked the host METTL3 to achieve m(6)A methylation. On the contrary, knockdown of Mettl3 or Ythdf2 in IPEC cells inhibited the replication of PoRV. Mechanistically, silencing of Mettl3 or Ythdf2 enhanced the expression of IRF2 and IFI44L via an increase of mRNA stability of Irf2 and Ifi44l. Furthermore, knockdown of Irf2 and Ifi44l promoted viral replication in IPEC cells. In conclusion, PoRV took full advantage of METTL3 to promote replication, in turn, host reduced own m(6)A methylation to enhance IRF2 and IFI44L to restrain virus infection, suggesting a love-hate relationship between virus and host, and providing novel targets for developing antiviral drugs in the pig industry.

AB  - Background: Shenfu decoction (SFD) is a classic Chinese medicine prescription that has a strong cardiotonic effect. The combination of ginseng (the dried root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) and Fuzi (processed product of sub-root of Aconitum carmichaeli Debx), the main constituents of SFD, has been reported to improve the pharmacological effect of each other. Moreover, research has shown that the main active components of SFD, ginseng total saponins (GTS) and Fuzi total alkaloids (FTA), have antidepressant activity. However, the effects of these ingredients on depressive-like behavior induced by ovariectomy, a model of menopausal depression, have not been studied.
   Purpose: Our research aims to elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of GTS and FTA compatibility (GF) in ovariectomized mice and the potential mechanisms.
   Methods: To elucidate the antidepressant-like effects of GF in mice in ovariectomy condition, behavioral tests were performed after 7 days of intragastric administration of different doses of GF. Underlying molecular mechanisms of CREB-BDNF, BDNF-mTORC1 and autophagy signaling were detected by western blotting, serum metabolites were examined by UPLC-QE plus-MS and dendritic spine density was determined by Golgi-Cox staining.
   Results: GF remarkably decreased the immobility time in the forced swim test. GF also increased levels of pCREB/CREB, BDNF, Akt, mTORC1 and p62 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as decreased LC3-II/LC3-I in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of ovariectomized mice. Furthermore, 15 serum differential metabolites (9 of which are lipids and lipid molecules) were identified by metabonomics. Next, the antidepressant-like effects of GF was blocked by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1. The antidepressant actions of GF on levels of pCREB, mTORC1, LC3-II/LC3-I and p62 in the prefrontal cortex and the levels of BDNF, Akt, mTORC1 and p62 in the hippocampus were inhibited by rapamycin, and the dendritic spines density was also regulated.
   Conclusion: GF has antidepressant effects in ovariectomized mice, and like other antidepressants, these effects involve activation of BDNF-mTORC1, autophagy regulation and consequent effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Moreover, metabolomic results suggest that GF also has effects on peripheral lipid profiles that may provide potential biomarkers for these antidepressant-like effects. These results indicate that GF is worthy of further exploration as a promising pharmaceutical treatment for depression. This study provides a new direction for the development of new indications for traditional Chinese medicine compounds.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess welfare outcomes of electrical stunning as a means of restraint in farmed grower saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus). Physical handling of a stunned, unconscious crocodile is far safer for the operator than handling a fully conscious animal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before and after the application of electrical stunning at 50 Hz or 400 Hz using an electrical stunner applied to the cranial plate (Position 1: P1-50 Hz; n = 31, P1-400 Hz; n = 29) or immediately behind the skull (Position 2: P2-50 Hz; n = 29; P2-400 Hz; n = 30). For all electrical stuns, percentage total EEG power in a 10-s epoch decreased in the alpha and beta frequency bands; and increased in the delta and lower frequencies bands. All electrical stuns resulted in increased strength of signal, based on the quadratic mean EEG power in all frequency bands of the EEG. Greatest change in power occurred in the delta frequency band, with P1-50 Hz. This was greater than with P2-50 Hz; while decibel change using 400 Hz at either position was intermediate and not significantly different from either. Application of either electrical stunner at position 1 resulted in seizure-like activity and activation in low frequencies, but at position 2 this was not consistent across all animals. The ability of the electrical stunning equipment to consistently induce recoverable unconsciousness could be ranked in decreasing order as: P1-50 Hz > P1-400 Hz = P2-50 Hz > P2-400 Hz. Based on behavioural observations, all animals in the study appeared to stunned however evaluation of duration of EEG changes indicates that use of the electrical stunning equipment at 50 Hz would allow some margin for inaccuracies in tong placement, while achieving a consistently reliable stun.

AB  - David Sherry's pioneering work on the neuroecology of spatial memory has three characteristics that could inspire studies on other cognitive processes: it was grounded in a robust prior literature in psychology and neuroscience; it identified several natural history contexts in which repeated independent evolution of spatial memory differences had occurred in different clades; it involved a precise cognitive ability with a precise neural substrate. We discuss the application of these three principles to a more domain-general trait-innovation. We argue that targeting the caudolateral nidopallium and its connected areas, favoring problem-solving over reversal learning as an experimental assay, and focusing on situations that involve environmental change, such as urbanization and invasion, can help the study of innovation progress, like the field of spatial memory has since 1989.

AB  - Knowledge of gene expression profiles reflecting functional features and specific responsiveness of parathyroid glands (PTGs) contributes to understanding mineral homeostasis and parathyroid function in healthy and diseased conditions. The study aims to reveal effector molecules driving the maintenance of phosphorus (P) homeostasis and parathyroid hormone (PTH) responsiveness to variable P supply throughout fetal and postnatal life. In this study, a long-term dietary intervention was performed by keeping pig offspring on distinct mineral P levels throughout fetal and postnatal life. Respective adaptation processes of P homeostasis were assessed in mRNA profiles of PTGs and serum minerals. RNA sequencing data and resulting molecular pathways of PTGs showed that the PTH abundance is very strictly controlled via e.g., PIN1, CaSR, MAfB, PLC and PKA signaling to regulate PTH expression, stability, and secretion. Additionally, the observed dietary effects on collagen expression indicate shifts in the ratio between connective tissue and parenchyma, thereby affecting cell-cell contacts as another line of PTH regulation. Taken together, the mRNA profiles of porcine PTGs reflect physiological responses in-vivo following variable dietary P supplies during fetal and postnatal life. The results serve to evaluate a long-term nutrition strategy with implications for improving the mineral balance in individuals with pathological disorders.

AB  - The bean farms in Iran are increasingly suffering from two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) herbivory, which is intensified with the gradual increase in temperature and decrease in relative humidity coinciding with the flowering time in the common bean. Limited genetic variability for resistance to TSSM is a major bottleneck in the development of resistant common beans. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the response of a diverse panel of 104 common bean genotypes to TSSM infestation during reproductive stages. The experiment was conducted in the form of an augmented randomized complete block design under TSSM-infested and non-infested conditions. The less susceptible genotypes had more grain yield, number of pods, plant height and leaf chlorophyll content, but also, they showed less reduction in these traits under TSSM herbivory condition relative to the more susceptible genotypes. The spider mite laid more eggs on the leaves of more susceptible beans creating a negative density dependence condition, while there was a greater nutritional contribution per adult mite on the leaves of less susceptible common beans. Variance components estimation highlighted grain yield, number of pods, plant height and 1,000-grain weight of the common bean with the higher genotypic variances compared to environmental variances. The findings provide a phenotypic screening procedure of common bean to determine the main plant traits contributing to genetic TSSM resistance under field conditions. This study concludes that pole-type genotypes of common bean would tolerate the mite feeding more than bush-type genotypes during reproductive stages.

AB  - Seven previously undescribed triterpenoid saponins, oleiferasaponins G1-G7 (1-7), along with two known congeners (8 and 9) were isolated from seeds of Camellia oleifera Abel. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic data. All isolated compounds are decorated with an aglycone and tetrasaccharide moiety. Compounds 1-5 were characterized by an uncommon acylation at C-16 instead of hydroxylation among the identified triterpenoid saponins in Camellia plants. Importantly, compounds 6-9 exhibited excellent antiproliferation effects against HCT-116, HL-60 and HepG2. According to preliminary structure-activity relationship investigations, a free hydroxyl group at the C-16 position of saponins was beneficial for their antiproliferation activity. Interestingly, compounds 1-5 displayed neither antiproliferation nor hemolytic activity, which suggests that the hemolytic and antiproliferation activity of the test saponins exhibit a relatively consistent pattern in their structure-activity relationships.

AB  - This study investigates two levels of dietary selenium (Se) and vitamin E in combination on their status in sows and their progeny, and influence on antioxidant status and immunological responses of the piglets at weaning. Female pigs (n = 6) were provided LOW or HIGH antioxidant nutrition (Se and vitamin E) from mating until weaning of their off-spring. The HIGH treatment elevated the concentration of Se (p = 0.015) and alpha-tocopherol (p = 0.023) in plasma of piglets compared with piglets of the LOW treatment. Treatments also affected the concentrations of milk and sow plasma immunoglobulins. Piglets from sows on the HIGH treatment had increased (p < 0.001) activity of glutathione peroxidase, lower serum levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.005), haptoglobin (p = 0.05) and albumin (p = 0.05), and the number of white blood cells (p = 0.023) and the ratio of NEU to LYM was lower (p = 0.025) than in piglets from sows on the LOW group. Furthermore, the dietary antioxidant level influenced responses of cytokines (interleukine (IL) 6 (p = 0.007), 12 (p = 0.01) and 18 (p = 0.01)) in piglets' plasma. In conclusion, improved antioxidant status via dietary maternal provision improves the robustness of the offspring via immunomodulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Simple Summary This report characterizes, for the first time, utero-cutaneous fistula (UCF) in animals, affecting ewes and cows, thus contributing to the knowledge about this rare condition in pregnant ruminants. Two ruminants presented non-specific clinical signs on the right ventral abdomen before UCF formation, such as moderate depression, low feed intake, and weight loss. The lack of reports on UCF in animals suggests underreporting or absence of diagnosis. Therefore, further studies are required to ensure improvements in the diagnosis and knowledge of pathogenesis, aiming at prevention.Abstract Reports on UCF in animals are still lacking in veterinary literature. Detailed clinical signs, laboratory findings, and follow-up information from the first cases of UCF in two ewes and two cows are provided. The cases occurred over a 12-year period. All ruminants presented a fistulous tract or perforated wound on the right ventral abdomen, emitting a foul-smelling secretion possibly associated with macerated fetal parts or placental remains. Laboratory findings included anemia, leukocytosis by neutrophilia, and hyperfibrinogenemia in one ewe, and hyperfibrinogenemia in one cow. Ovariohysterectomy and fistulectomy were performed in one ewe, while the other three ruminants were submitted for the removal of fetal parts and placental remains through the UCF. Two ewes died within 12-48 h, and the two Nelore cows had an uneventful recovery, achieving secondary intention healing within 30 to 35 days. As a never-reported or unnoticed disease of the reproductive tract, UCF is an unusual consequence of dead fetus retention in an end-stage pregnancy and a potentially life-threatening condition in ruminants, especially ewes. Further broad studies in large herds of cattle and small ruminant flocks must be conducted to estimate the incidence of UCF and ensure improvements in the diagnosis and knowledge of pathogenesis, aiming at prevention.

AB  - Simple Summary In the pig industry, new market trends and consumer demands have emerged over the past decades, which includes increased concerns about how animals are raised on farms. As a consequence of consumers' concerns, technologies capable of predicting animal welfare on farms have been explored. One of the technologies that are permeating the frontier of knowledge in this area are epigenetic biomarkers. Epigenetic biomarkers are biochemical markers surrounding the genome, which may be able to predict the exposures that individuals had during their lifetime. These markers represent an advance in the molecular level accuracy to support the current welfare indicators. In this literature review focused on pigs, we show some studies already carried out, we performed an integrative analysis of the already reported genes surrounding epi-biomarkers, and we highlight the benefits of investing efforts in this research field to enhance animal welfare and consumers' trust. Epigenetics works as an interface between the individual and its environment to provide phenotypic plasticity to increase individual adaptation capabilities. Recently, a wide variety of epi-genetic findings have indicated evidence for its application in the development of putative epi-biomarkers of stress in farm animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate previously reported stress epi-biomarkers in swine and encourage researchers to investigate potential paths for the development of a robust molecular tool for animal welfare certification. In this literature review, we report on the scientific concerns in the swine production chain, the management carried out on the farms, and the potential implications of these practices for the animals' welfare and their epigenome. To assess reported epi-biomarkers, we identified, from previous studies, potentially stress-related genes surrounding epi-biomarkers. With those genes, we carried out a functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the DNA of swine subjected to different stress-related conditions (e.g., heat stress, intrauterine insult, and sanitary challenges). We identified potential epi-biomarkers for target analysis, which could be added to the current guidelines and certification schemes to guarantee and certify animal welfare on farms. We believe that this technology may have the power to increase consumers' trust in animal welfare.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) has deleterious effects on cognitive functions including learning and memory. However, some studies have shown that SD can improve cognitive functions. Interestingly, treadmill exercise has both impairment and improvement effects on memory function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of SD for 4 (short-term) and 24 (long-term) hours, and two protocols of treadmill exercise (mild short-term and moderate long-term) on spatial memory performance, and oxidative and antioxidant markers in the serum of rats. Morris Water Maze apparatus was used to assess spatial memory performance. Also, SD was done using gentle handling method. In addition, the serum level of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was measured. The results showed that 24 h SD (but not 4 h) had negative effect on spatial memory performance, decreased SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px level, and increased MDA level. Long-term moderate (but not short-term mild) treadmill exercise had also negative effect on spatial memory performance, decreased SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px level, and increased MDA level. Interestingly, both protocols of treadmill exercise reversed spatial memory impairment and oxidative stress induced by 24 h SD. In conclusion, it seems that SD and treadmill exercise interact with each other, and moderate long-term exercise can reverse the negative effects of long-term SD on memory and oxidative status; although, it disrupted memory function and increased oxidative stress by itself.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of organic acids on piglet growth performance and health status. A total of 360 weanling pigs (5.3 & PLUSMN; 0.6 kg) were randomly allotted to 3 treatment groups with 12 replicates of 10 pigs/pen. Piglets were fed the same basal diet and given either water (control) or water plus 2.0 L/Ton organic acid (OA) blends, such as OA1 or OA2, respectively, for 7 weeks. Compared to the control, OA1 and OA2 improved growth performance and/or reduced the piglets' diarrhea rate during the various periods and improved small intestinal morphology at days 14 and/or 49. OA1 and OA2 also increased serum CAT and SOD activities and/or T-AOC and, as expected, decreased MDA concentration. Moreover, at day 14 and/or day 49, OA1 and OA2 increased the jejunal mRNA levels of host defense peptides (PBD1, PBD2, NPG1, and NPG3) and tight junction genes (claudin-1) and decreased that of cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-2). Additionally, the two acidifiers regulated the abundance of several cecum bacterial genera, including Blautia, Bulleidia, Coprococcus, Dorea, Eubacterium, Subdoligranulum, and YRC2. In conclusion, both of the organic acid blends improved piglet growth performance and health status, potentially by regulating intestinal redox homeostasis, immunity, and microflora.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Epimedii Folium is a famous traditional Chinese medicine that has been utilized to treat depression, impotency and rheumatism for centuries in China. Icariin (ICA) is the primary flavonoid and quality control ingredient of Epimedii Folium. Aims of the study: The objective of this investigation was to clarify the mechanisms through which ICA improved depressive-like behavior in prenatal stress (PS) offspring rats. Materials and methods: Male offspring rats subjected to PS were utilized to investigate the antidepressant effect and possible mechanism of ICA. H&E staining, Nissl staining, ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescence staining and molecular docking were carried out in this work. Results: ICA treatment markedly mitigated depressive-like behavior and hippocampal neuronal damage in PS offspring rats. The hippocampal synaptic plasticity of PS offspring rats was impaired, while the abnormal expressions of synaptic plasticity proteins and the synaptic ultrastructure were restored after the administration of ICA. Importantly, ICA treatment improved disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and morphology, thereby reversing the decline in ATP level and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the hippocampus of PS offspring rats. The reduction of MMP in PS rats further induced the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, while this trend was markedly reversed after the treatment with ICA. Concurrently, ICA reversed the decrease of mitochondrial biogenesis proteins (SIRT1, PGC-1 alpha, NRF1, and TFAM) and the interaction between SIRT1 and PGC-1 alpha. Further studies found that treatment with ICA notably counteracted the reduction in SIRT1 deacetylase activity and the increase in PGC-1 alpha acetylation level in the hippocampus of PS rats. Additionally, ICA enhanced mitophagy by activating the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. Conclusion: ICA exerted anti-depressive effects in PS offspring rats, partly by improving mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, and mitophagy.

AB  - Background: Fixation of biopsy specimens is a critical step before processing and staining them for histological tissue examination. Formalin is considered the gold standard fixative solution for its attributes. However, it has concerning side effects, such as carcinogenic and potential irritational properties. Owing to its various harmful effects, a safer natural substitute should be explored. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of propolis to 10% formalin and determined its ability as a natural fixative solution. Materials and Methods: Sixty tissue specimens were collected from goats' tongues and immediately placed in (1) 6.6% propolis, (2) 10% natural buffered formalin (positive control), (3) 6.6% propolis followed by 10% formalin, and (4) 0.9% saline (negative control). Tissue samples were fixed at different time points (12, 24, 48, and 72 h) at room temperature, followed by processing and staining. The quality of the microscopic parameters was blindly assessed by two oral and maxillofacial pathologists using a numerical scoring scale. Scores were statistically analyzed. Results: The fixation of tissue samples placed in 6.6% propolis was statistically significantly better than that of samples placed in 10% formalin and 0.9% saline at different time points. Conclusion: Propolis showed promising fixation properties and can be considered a natural alternative to 10% formalin.

AB  - Extrapolation of serial stimulus patterns seems to depend upon identification and application of patterns relating sequences of stimuli stored in memory, thus allowing prediction of pending events never experienced before. There have been proposals that such a "generator of predictions system" would include the subiculum, mammillary bodies, anteroventral thalamus and cingulate cortex (e.g., Gray, 1982). The anteroventral thalamus (AVT) seems to be in a strategic position, both hodologically and experimentally, to allow testing of this hypothesis. This study investigated the effect of NMDA-induced damage to the anteroventral thalamus [part of the anterodorsal (AD) thalamus was also damaged in some animals], following stereotaxic minute topic microinjections, on the ability of male Wistar rats to extrapolate relying on serial stimulus patterns. Corresponding shamoperated controls received phosphate-saline buffer microinjections at the same stereotaxic coordinates. The subjects were trained to run through a straight alleyway along 31 sessions, one session per day, to get rewarded. Each session included four successive trials. Subjects exposed to the monotonic serial pattern received 14, 7, 3, 1 sunflower seeds along trials. Subjects exposed to the non-monotonic serial pattern received 14, 3, 7, 1 sunflower seeds. On the 32nd testing session, a fifth trial, never experienced before, was included immediately after the fourth trial. Sham-operated control subjects exposed to the monotonic serial pattern were expected to exhibit longer running times, since the content of their prediction in the fifth trial should be "less than 1 sunflower seeds". In contrast, control subjects exposed to the non-monotonic serial pattern were expected to exhibit shorter running times, since the content of their prediction would be "more than 1 sunflower seeds". Confirming these predictions, control subjects exposed to the monotonic serial pattern exhibited longer running times as compared to both, their own running times in previous trials within the same session and control subjects exposed to the non-monotonic schedule, thus indicating the occurrence of extrapolation. In contrast, AVT/AD lesioned subjects exposed to the monotonic schedule did not exhibit this increase in running times on the fifth trial, indicating lack of extrapolation. These results indicate that extrapolation relying on serial stimulus patterns is disrupted following extensive NMDA-induced damage to AVT and part of the AD. This represents the first consistent demonstration that the anterior thalamic nuclei are required for extrapolation of serial stimulus patterns and generation of predictions.

AB  - Camellia oleifera fruits are randomly distributed in an orchard, and the fruits are easily blocked or covered by leaves. In addition, the colors of leaves and fruits are alike, and flowers and fruits grow at the same time, presenting many ambiguities. The large shock force will cause flowers to fall and affect the yield. As a result, accurate positioning becomes a difficult problem for robot picking. Therefore, studying target recognition and localization of Camellia oleifera fruits in complex environments has many difficulties. In this paper, a fusion method of deep learning based on visual perception and image processing is proposed to adaptively and actively locate fruit recognition and picking points for Camellia oleifera fruits. First, to adapt to the target classification and recognition of complex scenes in the field, the parameters of the You Only Live Once v7 (YOLOv7) model were optimized and selected to achieve Camellia oleifera fruits' detection and determine the center point of the fruit recognition frame. Then, image processing and a geometric algorithm are used to process the image, segment, and determine the morphology of the fruit, extract the centroid of the outline of Camellia oleifera fruit, and then analyze the position deviation of its centroid point and the center point in the YOLO recognition frame. The frontlighting, backlight, partial occlusion, and other test conditions for the perceptual recognition processing were validated with several experiments. The results demonstrate that the precision of YOLOv7 is close to that of YOLOv5s, and the mean average precision of YOLOv7 is higher than that of YOLOv5s. For some occluded Camellia oleifera fruits, the YOLOv7 algorithm is better than the YOLOv5s algorithm, which improves the detection accuracy of Camellia oleifera fruits. The contour of Camellia oleifera fruits can be extracted entirely via image processing. The average position deviation between the centroid point of the image extraction and the center point of the YOLO recognition frame is 2.86 pixels; thus, the center point of the YOLO recognition frame is approximately considered to be consistent with the centroid point of the image extraction.

AB  - Inducing carotid body anoxia through the administration of cyanide can result in oxygen deprivation. The lack of oxygen activates cellular responses in specific regions of the central nervous system, including the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are regulated by afferent pathways from chemosensitive receptors. These receptors are modulated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB. Oxygen deprivation can cause neuroinflammation in the brain regions that are activated by the afferent pathways from the chemosensitive carotid body. To investigate how microglia, a type of immune cell in the brain, respond to an anoxic environment resulting from the administration of NaCN, we studied the effects of blocking the TrkB receptor on this cell-type response. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized, and a dose of NaCN was injected into their carotid sinus to induce anoxia. Prior to the anoxic stimulus, the rats were given an intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of either K252a, a TrkB receptor inhibitor, BDNF, or an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). After the anoxic stimulus, the rats were perfused with paraformaldehyde, and their brains were processed for microglia immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that the anoxic stimulation caused an increase in the number of reactive microglial cells in the hypothalamic arcuate, basolateral amygdala, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, the infusion of the K252a TrkB receptor inhibitor prevented microglial activation in these regions.

AB  - Several atypical antipsychotics exert mood-stabilising effects via the modulation of various monoamine receptors and intracellular signallings. Recent pharmacodynamic studies suggested that tripartite synaptic transmission can contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and mood disorders, their associated cognitive impairment, and several adverse reactions to atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, to explore the mechanisms underlying the antidepressive mood-stabilising and antipsychotic effects of brexpiprazole (Brex), we determined the effects of subchronic administration of therapeutically relevant concentrations/doses of Brex on the protein expression of 5-HT receptors, connexin43, cAMP levels, and intracellular signalling in cultured astrocytes and rat hypothalamus using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry and capillary immunoblotting systems. Subchronic administration of a therapeutically relevant concentration of Brex (300 nM) downregulated both 5-HT1A (5-HT1AR) and 5-HT7 (5-HT7R) receptors, in addition to phosphorylated Erk (pErk), without affecting phosphorylated Akt in the astroglial plasma membrane. Subchronic administration of 300 nM Brex decreased and increased phosphorylated AMPK and connexin43, respectively, in the astroglial cytosol fraction. A therapeutically relevant concentration of Brex acutely decreased the astroglial cAMP level, whereas, under the inhibition of 5-HT1AR, Brex did not affect astroglial cAMP levels. However, the 5-HT7R-agonist-induced increased astroglial cAMP level was inhibited by Brex. In contrast to the in vitro study, systemic subchronic administration of effective doses of Brex (3 and 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) increased the cAMP level but did not affect phosphorylated AMPK in the rat hypothalamus. These results suggest several complicated pharmacological features of Brex. Partial 5-HT1AR agonistic action predominates in the low range of therapeutically relevant concentrations of Brex, whereas in the high range, 5-HT7R inverse agonist-like action is overlapped on the 5-HT1A agonistic action. These unique suppressive effects of Brex on 5-HT7R play important roles in the clinical features of Brex regarding its antidepressive mood-stabilising actions.

AB  - With the persistent challenge that epilepsy presents to therapeutic avenues, the study seeks to decipher the effects of the ketogenic diet (KD) on gut microbiota and subsequent epileptic outcomes. Mouse fecal samples from distinct KD and control diet (CD) cohorts underwent 16S rRNA sequencing. Differential genes of epileptic mice under these diets were sourced from the GEO database. The study melded in vivo and in vitro techniques to explore the nuanced interactions between KD, gut microbiota, and hippocampal TRHR dynamics. The KD regimen was found to result in a notable reduction in gut microbiota diversity when compared to the CD groups. Distinctive microbial strains, which are hypothesised to interact with epilepsy through G protein-coupled receptors, were spotlighted. In vivo, explorations affirmed that gut microbiota as central to KD's anti-epileptic efficacy. Of 211 distinguished genes, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway was underscored, particularly emphasizing TRHR and TRH. Clinical observations revealed a surge in hippocampal TRHR and TRH expressions influenced by KD, mirroring shifts in neuronal discharges. The KD, leveraging gut microbiota alterations, amplifies hippocampal TRHR expression. This finding provides a novel intervention strategy to reduce seizures.

AB  - Trichomes, which are differentiated from epidermal cells, are special accessory structures that cover the above-ground organs of plants and possibly contribute to biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Here, a bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of an F-2 population with significant variations in trichome length was undertaken. A 1.84-Mb candidate region on chromosome 10 was associated with trichome length. Resequencing and fine-mapping analyses indicated that a 12-kb structural variation in the promoter of Cla97C10G203450 (ClLOG) led to a significant expression difference in this gene in watermelon lines with different trichome lengths. In addition, a virus-induced gene silencing analysis confirmed that ClLOG positively regulated trichome elongation. These findings provide new information and identify a potential target gene for controlling multicellular trichome elongation in watermelon.

AB  - IntroductionHydatidosis is a zoonotic neglected disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. Evidence suggests a communication between hydatid cyst (HC) and hosts via extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, a little is known about the communication between EVs derived from HC fluid (HCF) and host cells. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of HCF derived EVs on expression of fibrotic and anti-fibrotic miRNAs in THP-1 cell line.MethodsIn the current study, EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation from wild-infected sheep HCF and characterized by western blot, electron microscope, and size distribution analysis. The effects of EVs on the expression levels of microRNAs (mir-16, mir-29a, and mir-155) involved in liver fibrosis were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), 3 and 24 h after incubation.ResultsWestern blot analyses confirmed the expression of CD63 marker, while Calnexin and CD81 were absent in EVs samples. The SEM and morphology revealed round shape vesicles. The DLS analysis showed average size distribution 130.6 nm diameter. The expression levels of mir-16 and mir-29a were significantly upregulated after 3 h for 8.66 and 3.420, respectively, while they were significantly downregulated after 24 h for 3.853 and 1.859, respectively.ConclusionThe main mechanism of the communication between EVs derived from HCF and their host remains unclear. Our results suggest that HC may modulate the expression of miRNAs, involved in liver fibrosis via EVs.

AB  - This study focused on polysaccharides from Camellia sinensis L., a tea plant, examining their bioactivities in various clones. These tea polysaccharides (TPS) are valuable for their diverse biological functions in humans, including immunomodulatory, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antitumor, and gastrointestinal benefits. Polysaccharides were extracted from different plant parts, including young meristematic leaves, stems, mature leaves, and roots, from cultivars like TRF-1, UPASI-9, and UPASI-28 in southern India. The study analyzed the morphological variations and fundamental composition of TPS across these cultivars. The purification process involved size and shape analysis using SEM, quantification of total polysaccharides through GC-MS, and quality assessment via assay methods. Additionally, bioactive compounds were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, total phenolic content analysis, and antioxidative property assessment. This study aims to identify TPS variations among tea clones and plant organs, contributing valuable insights into their potential commercial and health benefits.

AB  - Alterations of glutamatergic neurotransmission have been implicated in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Mice lacking the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit, encoded by the Gria1 gene, display multiple phenotypical features associated with glutamatergic dysfunction. While the phenotype of adult GluA1 deficient (Gria1(-/-)) mice has been studied comprehensively, there are relevant gaps in knowledge about the course and the onset of behavioral alterations in the Gria1 knockout mouse model during post-weaning development. Based on former investigations in young wild-type mice, we exposed female and male adolescent Gria1(-/-) mice to a behavioral home-cage based testing battery designed for the purpose of severity assessment. Data obtained from mice with a constitutive loss of GluA1 were compared with those from wild-type littermates. We identified several genotype-dependent behavioral alterations in young Gria1(-/-) mice. While the preference for sweetness was not affected by genotype during adolescence, Gria1(-/-) mice displayed limited burrowing performance, and reached lower nest complexity scores. Analysis of home-cage based voluntary wheel running performance failed to confirm genotype-dependent differences. In contrast, when exposed to the open field test, Gria1(-/-) mice showed pronounced hyperlocomotion in early and late adolescence, and female Gria1(-/-) mice exhibited thigmotaxis when prepubescent. We found increased corticosterone metabolite levels in fecal samples of adolescent Gria1(-/-) mice with females exhibiting increased adrenocortical activity already in prepubescence. Considering the course of behavioral modifications in early and late adolescence, the results do not support a persistent level of distress associated with GluA1 deficiency in the line. In contrast, the laboratory-specific readouts indicate transient, mild impairments of behavioral patterns relevant to animal welfare, and suggest a mild overall burden of the line.

AB  - Objective and design Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the leading causes of human respiratory tract infections. The function of Staphylococcal protein A (SpA), expressed on the S. aureus bacterial membrane and released in the environment, on human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we tested the SpA expression in S. aureus from chronic rhinosinusitis patients and investigated the effects of SpA on HNECs inflammation through Interferon Gamma Receptor 1(IFNGR1)/phosphorylated Janus Kinase 2 (p-JAK2) pathway.Methods RNA profiling was performed to investigate inflammatory activation in a S. aureus chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) mouse model. SpA release by S. aureus clinical isolates was determined using ELISA. The effect of purified SpA and SpA enriched conditioned media from S. aureus clinical isolates on HNECs cytotoxicity, apoptosis and release of inflammatory cytokines was evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase assays, and flow cytometry. SpA dependent IFNGR1 and p-JAK2 expression were assessed by qPCR, immunofluorescence and western blot in HNECs.Results 49 genes were significantly induced in S. aureus CRS mice indicative of activation of interferon signaling. SpA release was significantly higher in S. aureus clinical isolates from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) patients. Purified SpA significantly increased IFNGR1 mRNA and protein expression in HNECs. SpA induced cytotoxic effects and induced the release of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in an IFNGR1 dependent way.Conclusion SpA induces interferon signaling through activation of the IFNGR1-JAK-2 pathway, which provides an understanding of how S. aureus SpA affects the inflammatory process in the upper airways.

AB  - Background: Evidence of the role of interactions between air pollution and pollen exposure in subjects with allergic asthma is limited and need further exploration to promote adequate preventive measures. The objective of this study was to assess effects of exposure to ambient air pollution and birch pollen on exacerbation of respiratory symptoms in subjects with asthma and allergy to birch.
   Methods: Thirty-seven subjects from two Swedish cities (Gothenburg and Umea) with large variation in exposure to both birch-pollen and air pollutants, participated in the study. All subjects had confirmed allergy to birch and self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma. The subjects recorded respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis or eye irritation, dry cough, dyspnoea, the use of any asthma or allergy medication and peak respiratory flow (PEF), daily for five consecutive weeks during two separate pollen seasons and a control season without pollen. Nitrogen oxides -(NOx), ozone -(O-3), particulate matter -(PM2.5), birch pollen counts, and meteorological data were obtained from an urban background monitoring stations in the study city centres. The data were analysed using linear mixed effects models.
   Results: During pollen seasons all symptoms and medication use were higher, and PEF was reduced in the subjects. In regression analysis, exposure to pollen at lags 0 to 2 days, and lags 0 to 6 days was associated with increased ORs of symptoms and decreased RRs for PEF. Pollen and air pollution interacted in some cases; during low pollen exposure, there were no associations between air pollution and symptoms, but during high pollen exposure, -O-3 concentrations were associated with increased OR of rhinitis or eye irritation, and -PM2.5 concentrations were associated with increased ORs of rhinitis or eye irritation, dyspnea and increased use of allergy medication.
   Conclusions: Pollen and air pollutants interacted to increase the effect of air pollution on respiratory symptoms in allergic asthma. Implementing the results from this study, advisories for individuals with allergic asthma could be improved, minimizing the morbidities associated with the condition.

AB  - Protein abnormalities can accelerate aging causing protein misfolding diseases, and various adaptive responses have evolved to relieve proteotoxicity. To trigger these responses, cells must detect the buildup of aberrant proteins. Previously we demonstrated that the Hsp70-Bag3 (HB) complex senses the accumulation of defective ribosomal products, stimulating signaling pathway proteins, such as stress kinases or the Hippo pathway kinase LATS1. Here, we studied how Bag3 regulates the ability for LATS1 to regulate its key downstream target YAP (also known as YAP1). In naive cells, Bag3 recruited a complex of LATS1, YAP and the scaffold AmotL2, which links LATS1 and YAP. Upon inhibition of the proteasome, AmotL2 dissociated from Bag3, which prevented phosphorylation of YAP by LATS1, and led to consequent nuclear YAP localization together with Bag3. Mutations in Bag3 that enhanced its translocation into nucleus also facilitated nuclear translocation of YAP. Interestingly, Bag3 also controlled YAP nuclear localization in response to cell density, indicating broader roles beyond proteotoxic signaling responses for Bag3 in the regulation of YAP. These data implicate Bag3 as a regulator of Hippo pathway signaling, and suggest mechanisms by which proteotoxic stress signals are propagated.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the brain regions involved in the role of galanin (GAL) and specifically GAL3-receptors (GAL3) in alcohol intake. GAL3-KO mice displayed an alcohol-preferring phenotype in a twobottle, free choice paradigm. In contrast, no genotype differences in ethanol intake were observed in a Drinking In the Dark (DID) model, highlighting the differential involvement of brain GAL activity depending on the experimental model of alcohol consumption. Blood ethanol concentrations were approximately 10 % lower in GAL3-KO mice compared to wildtype (WT) following DID. WT mice drinking ethanol had significantly increased numbers of c-Fos immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the rostral prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and decreased numbers of ir neurons in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) compared to water drinking WT littermates, but these effects of ethanol were absent in GAL3-KO mice. Water drinking GAL3-KO mice furthermore had significantly increased numbers of c-Fos ir neurons compared to water drinking WT mice in the rostral PrL as well as the CA3 region of the dHIP. In the core and shell subregions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), or in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) or basolateral amygdala, there were no changes in the number of c-Fos ir cells or any involvement of GAL3 genotype. These findings support a role of GAL3-receptors in the effects of alcohol and implicate discrete brain regions involved in this interaction.

AB  - We previously reported that physical inactivity (PI) induces cognitive decline and depressive states, which were ameliorated by regular exercise. However, the mechanism underlying the preventive effect of exercise remains unelucidated. Irisin has recently been identified as an exercise-inducible myokine that improves cognitive impairment. Plasma irisin levels increase during physical exercise; therefore, PI could lead to a decline in cognitive function by reducing plasma irisin. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether irisin is associated with cognitive decline and mental deterioration altered by PI and exercise. The mice were housed for eight weeks in the PI cage, whose living space was one-sixth that of a standard cage. Simultaneously, the mice were subjected to regular exercise in the presence or absence of an irisin-neutralizing antibody. PI increased the epididymal fat mass without increasing body weight, muscle mass, or plasma corticosterone levels. Additionally, PI induced anxiety, depressive states, and a decline in working memory. In contrast, regular exercise after PI elevated irisin levels in plasma and increased fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammacoactivator 1 alpha expression in skeletal muscle. Regular exercise also increased hippo-campal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and BrdU-positive cells, alleviating cognitive decline and mental deterioration induced by PI. The beneficial effects of exercise were compromised by the administration of an irisin-neutralizing antibody. Moreover, plasma irisin level was positively correlated with working memory, hippocampal BDNF levels, and hippocampal cell proliferation. These findings suggest that exercise-inducible irisin is critical for maintaining cognitive function in the PI state.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder that leads to severe cognitive and functional impairments. Many AD patients also exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, prior to the clinical diagnosis of dementia. Chronic stress is associated with numerous adverse health consequences and disease states, and AD patients exhibit altered stress systems. Thus, stress may represent a causal link between neuropsychiatric symptoms and AD. To address this possibility, we examined the effects of chronic stress in the TgF344-AD rat model that co-expresses the mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1 Delta E9) genes. Adult male transgenic (Tg+) and wild-type (WT) rats (6-7.5 months of age), with and without a history of chronic restraint stress, were tested for footshock-induced conditioned fear and for anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze. We found that non-stressed Tg+ rats showed increased anxiety-like behavior compared to non-stressed WT rats. In contrast, Tg+ and WT rats did not differ in levels of freezing immediately following footshock or during contextual re-exposure. Additionally, stressed Tg+ rats were not significantly different from stressed WT rats on any measures of anxiety or fear. Thus, while stress has been linked as a risk factor for AD-related pathology, it appears from the present findings that two weeks of daily restraint stress did not further enhance anxiety- or fear-like behaviors in TgF344-AD rats.

AB  - Step selection analysis (SSA) is a fundamental technique for uncovering the drivers of animal movement decisions. Its typical use has been to view an animal as 'selecting' each measured location, given its current (and possibly previous) locations. Although an animal is unlikely to make decisions precisely at the times its locations are measured, if data are gathered at a relatively low frequency (every few minutes or hours) this is often the best that can be done. Nowadays, though, tracking data are increasingly gathered at very high frequencies, often >= 1 Hz, so it may be possible to exploit these data to perform more behaviourally-meaningful step selection analysis.
   Here, we present a technique to do this. We first use an existing algorithm to determine the turning-points in an animal's movement path. We define a 'step' to be a straight-line movement between successive turning-points. We then construct a generalised version of integrated SSA (iSSA), called time-varying iSSA (tiSSA), which deals with the fact that turning-points are usually irregularly spaced in time. We demonstrate the efficacy of tiSSA by application to data on both simulated animals and free-ranging goats Capra aegagrus hircus, comparing our results to those of regular iSSA with locations that are separated by a constant time-interval.
   Using (regular) iSSA with constant time-steps can give results that are misleading compared to using tiSSA with the actual turns made by the animals. Furthermore, tiSSA can be used to infer covariates that are dependent on the time between turns, which is not possible with regular iSSA. As an example, we show that our study animals tend to spend less time between successive turns when the ground is rockier and/or the temperature is hotter.
   By constructing a step selection technique that works between observed turning-points of animals, we enable step selection to be used on high-frequency movement data, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern biologging studies. Furthermore, since turning-points can be viewed as decisions, our method places step selection analysis on a more behaviourally-meaningful footing compared to previous techniques.

AB  - Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, chronic, affective disorder characterized by recurrent switching between mood states, psychomotor and cognitive symptoms, which can linger in euthymic states as residual symptoms. Hippocampal alterations may play a key role in the neural processing of BD symptoms. However, its dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) remains unclear. Therefore, the present study explores hippocampal dFC in relation to BD symptoms.
   Methods: We assessed hippocampus-based dFC coactivation patterns (CAPs) on resting-state fMRI data of 25 euthymic BD patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC).
   Results: : Bilateral hippocampal dFC with somatomotor networks (SMN) was reduced in BD, compared to HC, while at the same time dFC between the left hippocampus and midcingulo-insular salience system (SN) was higher in BD. Correlational analysis between CAPs and clinical scores revealed that dFC between the bilateral hippocampus and the default-like network (DMN) correlated with depression scores in BD. Furthermore, pathological hyperconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and SMN and the frontoparietal network (FPN) was modulated by the same depression scores in BD.
   Conclusions: Overall, we observed alterations of large-scale functional brain networks associated with decreased flexibility in cognitive control, salience detection, and emotion processing in BD. Additionally, the present study provides new insights on the neural architecture underlying a self-centered perspective on the environment in BD patients. dFC markers may improve detection, treatment, and follow-up of BD patients and of disabling residual depressive symptoms in particular.

AB  - Modulation of presynaptic short-term plasticity induced by actin polymerization was studied in rat hippocampal slices using the paired-pulse paradigm. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with paired pulses with a 70-ms interstimulus interval every 30 s before and during perfusion with jasplakinolide, an activator of actin polymerization. Jasplakinolide application resulted in the increase in the amplitudes of CA3-CA1 responses (potentiation) accompanied by a decrease in the paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting induction of presynaptic modifications. Jasplakinolide-induced potentiation depended on the initial paired-pulse rate. These data indicate that the jasplakinolide-mediated changes in actin polymerization increased the probability of neurotransmitter release. Less typical for CA3-CA1 synapses responses, such as a very low paired-pulse ratio (close to 1 or even lower) or even paired-pulse depression, were affected differently. Thus, jasplakinolide caused potentiation of the second, but not the first response to the paired stimulus, which increased the paired-pulse ratio from 0.8 to 1.0 on average, suggesting a negative impact of jasplakinolide on the mechanisms promoting paired-pulse depression. In general, actin polymerization facilitated potentiation, although the patterns of potentiation differed depending on the initial synapse characteristics. We conclude that in addition to the increase in the neurotransmitter release probability, jasplakinolide induced other actin polymerization-dependent mechanisms, including those involved in the paired-pulse depression.

AB  - Mechanical environment plays a crucial role in regulating bone regeneration in bone defects. Assessing the mechanobiological behavior of patient-specific orthopedic scaffolds in-silico could help guide optimal scaffold designs, as well as intra- and post-operative strategies to enhance bone regeneration and improve implant longevity. Additively manufactured porous scaffolds, and specifically triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), have shown promising structural properties to act as bone substitutes, yet their ability to induce mechanobiologially-driven bone regeneration has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to i) explore the bone regeneration potential of TPMS scaffolds made of different stiffness biocompatible materials, to ii) analyze the influence of pre-seeding the scaffolds and increasing the post-operative resting period, and to iii) assess the influence of patient-specific parameters, such as age and mechanosensitivity, on outcomes. To perform this study, an in silico model of a goat tibia is used. The bone ingrowth within the scaffold pores was simulated with a mechano-driven model of bone regeneration. Results showed that the scaffold's architectural properties affect cellular diffusion and strain distribution, resulting in variations in the regenerated bone volume and distribution. The softer material improved the bone ingrowth. An initial resting period improved the bone ingrowth but not enough to reach the scaffold's core. However, this was achieved with the implantation of a pre-seeded scaffold. Physiological parameters like age and health of the patient also influence the bone regeneration outcome, though to a lesser extent than the scaffold design. This analysis demonstrates the importance of the scaffold's geometry and its material, and highlights the potential of using mechanobiological patient-specific models in the design process for bone substitutes.

AB  - Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have key physiological roles in the regulation of protein synthesis, metabolism, food intake and aging. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of balanced BCAAs on healthy aging by increasing skeletal muscle mass and muscle fiber composition in a finishing pig model. A balanced BCAA ratio (Leu : Ile : Val = 2 : 2 : 1) significantly activated the mTOR pathway and upregulated the expression of amino acid transporters, such as ASCT2, SNAT2, LAT1, PAT1, and SLC38A9, simultaneously modulating mitochondrial function and muscle fiber composition, thereby inhibiting inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha, regulating amino acid metabolism, and ultimately increasing skeletal muscle mass. Overall, our results suggest that a BCAA ratio around 2 : 2 : 1 may be a promising candidate for healthy aging in humans and animals.

AB  - The rape stem weevil, Ceutorhynchus asper Roel. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a severe pest of oilseed rape. Currently, little is known about the chemosensory functions of odorant receptors (ORs) in coleopterans such as C. asper. Here, the antennal and body transcriptomes of adult C. asper were sequenced and annotated. In total, 49 ORs were identified in C. asper, and transcriptome and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed that CaspOR5 was antenna-biased. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that homologs of CaspOR5 were conserved among coleopterans. In single sensillum recordings of transgenic flies, CaspOR5 was found to be narrowly tuned to six green leaf volatiles (GLVs) of oilseed rape. Molecular docking indicated that active sites of CaspOR5 bound to GLVs were highly conserved. (E)-2-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenol were attractive for both sexes of C. asper, and (E)-2-hexenal was only attractive to male weevils. In conclusion, CaspOR5 can facilitate perception of GLVs, thereby playing crucial roles in host plant search and location of C. asper. Our investigation provides insights into the olfactory functions of the conserved CaspOR5 in Coleoptera and can facilitate future research on developing novel green strategies in management of related pest weevils.

AB  - A comprehensive approach is needed to develop multifunctional wound dressing that is simple yet efficient. In this work, Liquidambar orientalis Mill. storax loaded hydroxyethyl chitosan (HECS)-carrageenan (kC) based hydrogel (HECS-kC) and polydopamine coated asymmetric polycaprolactone membrane (PCL-DOP) were used to develop a multifunctional and modular bilayer wound dressing. Asymmetric PCL-DOP membrane was prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) followed by polydopamine coating and demonstrated an excellent barrier against bacteria while allowing permeability for 5.45 ppm dissolved-oxygen and 2130 g/m2 water vapor transmission in 24 h in addition to 805 kPa tensile strength. Storax loaded HECS-kC hydrogel, on the other hand, demonstrated a pH-responsive degradation and swelling to provide necessary conditions to facilitate wound healing. The hydrogels showed stretchability above 140 %, mild adhesive strength on sheep skin and PCLDOP membrane, while the storax incorporation enhanced antibacterial and antioxidant activity. Furthermore, rat full-thickness skin defect model showed that the developed bilayer wound dressing could significantly facilitate wound healing compared to TegadermTM and control groups. This study shows that the bilayered wound dressing has the potential to be used as a simple and effective wound care system.

AB  - Acidification of slurry is a common practice to reduce ammonia and methane emissions. Sulfuric acid is usually used for this process. However, this has been criticized due to the high sulfur input into soils. Therefore, the objective of this study is to show the effectiveness of a one-time acidification with alternative acids also in combination with other treatment strategies. The amount of acid as well as the change of pH value during storage were investigated. For most variants, a strong pH increase occurred within the first ten days after acidification. Mineral acids (sulfuric or hydrochloric acid) resulted in a lower pH increase compared to organic acids (lactic, acetic, and citric acid). Under anaerobic storage conditions, the pH remained significantly lower. The addition of glucose before acidification resulted in lower pH values during the first week, but in the long term, the conversion of glucose to carbonate led to higher pH values. A previous separation process was able to reduce the amount of acid. Although the pH increase was not that strong in the first days after acidification, it was much faster and stronger afterwards due to the lower buffer capacity in the separated slurry. A long-term pH reduction was achieved by acidification to pH 3.0, but this was associated with an increased amount of acid. On the basis of the results, a combination of organic acids with anaerobic storage can be recommended as an alternative to sulfuric acid.

AB  - Evidence from genetic, behavioural, anatomical, and physiological study suggests that the hippocampus functionally differs across its longitudinal (dorsoventral or septotemporal) axis. Although, how to best characterize functional and representational differences in the hippocampus across its long axis remains unclear. While some suggest that the hippocampus can be divided into dorsal and ventral subregions that support distinct cognitive functions, others posit that these regions vary in their granularity of representation, wherein spatial-temporal resolution decreases in the ventral (temporal) direction. Importantly, the cognitive and granular hypotheses also make distinct predictions on cellular recruitment dynamics under conditions when animals perform tasks with qualitatively different cognitive-behavioural demands. One interpretation of the cognitive function account implies that dorsal and ventral cellular recruitment differs depending on relevant behavioural demands, while the granularity account suggests similar recruitment dynamics regardless of the nature of the task performed. Here, we quantified cellular recruitment with the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc across the entire longitudinal CA1 axis in female and male rats performing spatial-and fear-guided memory tasks. Our results show that recruitment is greater in dorsal than ventral CA1 regardless of task or sex, and thus support a granular view of hippocampal function across the long axis. We further discuss how future experiments might determine the relative contributions of cognitive function and granularity of representation to neuronal activity dynamics in hippocampal circuits.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Conventional antidepressants therapy remains unsatisfactory due to the disadvantages of delayed clinical onset of action and side effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with good efficacy and higher safety have received much attention. Angelicae Sinensis Radix (AS), a well-known TCM, has been proved to exhibit the efficacy of antidepression recently. Aim of the study: The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential anti-depressant mechanisms of AS based on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model.Materials and methods: In this study, behavioral experiments, molecular biology techniques, and ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple-time of flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS) were combined to explore the potential antidepressant mechanisms of AS based on CUMS rat model. Results: The results demonstrated that AS could reduce the contents of serum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in CUMS rats, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT). In addition, AS regulated the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+, and the levels of serum cytokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in CUMS rats. Lipidomics showed that 31 lipids were related to depression and AS could regulate the lipid metabolism alteration induced by CUMS, particularly sphingolipid metabolism. Finally, the key proteins in sphingolipid metabolic pathways in hippocampus of CUMS rats could be back-regulated by AS, including serine palmitoyl transferase (SPTLC2), ceramide synthase (CerS2), sphingomyelinase (SPHK1), and neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase).Conclusion: AS could alleviate NEI network disorder and restore the levels of sphingolipid metabolites and key proteins in CUMS rats. The underlying mechanism by which AS relieved depression-like behavior in CUMS rats may be through modulation of NEI and disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of age and FSH treatment on the ovarian response, follicular fluid (FF) biochemical composition, nuclear maturation, and molecular profile of cumulus-oocytes complexes (COCs) recovered from prepubertal gilts. Thirty-five prepubertal gilts were separated according to age [140 (n = 20) or 160 (n = 15) days], and within each age, the gilts were allotted to receive either 100 mg of FSH [treated; G140+FSH (n = 10) and G160+FSH (n = 7)] or saline solution [control; G140+control (n = 10) and G160+control (n = 8)]. Thus, four experimental groups were included in this study. In the FSH-treated gilts, the percentage of medium follicles increased (P < 0.0001) in the same proportion with which the percentage of small follicles decreased (P < 0.0001). In addition, the glucose concentration in the FF obtained from medium follicles increased (P < 0.05), while that of triglycerides decreased (P < 0.05) in the FSH-treated gilts. The FSH stimulation also improved (P < 0.05) the number of grade I COCs obtained from medium follicles and the meiotic maturation and BCB + rates. FSH treatment only upregulated (P < 0.05) HMGCR expression in immature COCs from prepubertal gilts. The metaphase II and BCB + rates, FF glucose and plasma IGF-1 levels were greater (P < 0.05) in prepubertal gilts at 160 than at 140 days of age. Age had no effect (P > 0.05) on the transcript abundance of the target genes in immature COCs. Hence, oocytes obtained from 140-day-old prepubertal gilts appeared less meiotically competent than those of 160-day-old prepubertal gilts. Our study suggests a possible strategy of using FSH treatment to improve oocyte quantity, quality, and nuclear maturation in 140 and 160-day-old prepubertal gilts.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent studies had reported that compounds that stimulate microglia could be developed as potential drugs for the treatment of depression due to their reversal effect on depression-like behaviors in chronically stressed mice. Zymosan A is a cell wall preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae composed of & beta;-glucans. Based on its immuno-stimulatory activities, we hypothesized that zymosan A might have a therapeutic effect on depression. Our results showed that a single injection of zymosan A 5 h before behavioral tests at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, reversed chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors in mice in the tail suspension test, forced swimming test, and sucrose preference test. Time-dependent analysis showed that the antidepressant effect of zymosan A (2 mg/kg) in CUS mice became statistically significant at 5 and 8 h, but not at 3 h, and persisted for at least 7 days. Fourteen days after a single injection of zymosan A, no antidepressant effect was observed anymore. However, the disappeared antidepressant effect of zymosan A was restored by a second zymosan A injection (2 mg/kg, 5 h) 14 days after the first zymosan A injection. Stimulation of microglia was essential for the antidepressant effect of zymosan A because pre-inhibition of microglia by minocycline or pre-depletion of microglia by PLX3397 prevented the antidepressant effect of zymosan A. Based on these effects of zymosan A, zymosan A administration could be developed as a new strategy for the treatment of depression.

AB  - Background: Blackleg or Black Quarter (BQ) is a serious bacterial disease caused by Clostridium chauvoei. It causes edematous and gaseous changes in skeletal muscles of animals. The study was designed to find prevalence of BQ in 6 districts of Punjab, Pakistan from June 2018 to June 2019.Methods: Animals were randomly monitored, and selected in each union council regardless of age, sex and species, but lameness and hyperthermia were the selection parameters. A proforma was used to record the experimental readings of each animal. A total of 1500 swab samples from bovines (cattle and buffaloes) were processed through conventional PCR and culture sensitivity tests to examine the comparative diagnostic efficacy and suitability of the test.Results: Sensitivity and specificity of culture tests were 87.6% and 34.19% respectively, whereas PCR demonstrated 81% and 47.3% results for the said aspects, respectively. Alpha toxin gene (Ccta) was amplified at 52.2oC yielding an amplicon size of 1400 base pairs. Area wise and season wise prevalence of each animal was also determined. The prevalence of BQ in cattle was significantly higher (P<0.05) in Muzaffargarh (25.6%), Layyah (24.8%), Rahim Yar Khan (23.2%), and Bhakkar (29.6%) that belonged to the arid and dessert zones of Punjab-Pakistan whereas, it was non-significant (P > 0.05) in Lahore (0%) and Nankana Sahib (8%) which belonged to the canal irrigated zones.Conclusion: There was higher prevalence of BQ in different areas of Punjab, Pakistan that show the higher risk of disease transmission. A systematic surveillance system is essential to regularly monitor the disease incidence and prevalence in these areas of Pakistan.

AB  - From a cost and sustainability perspective, the use of by-products such as rye bran in sow diets is of particular interest. Rye bran has valuable ingredients that have potential benefits for the gut health of sows. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of including 15% rye bran in the sows' feed on the performance of sows and piglets. The feeding started one week before the farrowing date and ended at weaning. Performance was evaluated by measuring sow (n = 175) and piglet body weight (n = 1372) and sows' backfat thickness (n = 80). These data were additionally used to calculate the colostrum intake of the suckling piglets and the sows' milk production. It was found that there were no differences in the performance parameters between the experimental and control groups. However, this study showed that the piglets with light birth weight (LBW (<1000 g)) and medium birth weight (MBW (1000-1500 g) consumed more colostrum when the sows were fed rye bran (LBW: C/R 203.0 +/- 39.2 g/214.3 +/- 35.9 g; MBW: 291.3 +/- 39.0 g/298.5 +/- 36.4 g). It can be concluded that including 15% rye bran in the feed of lactating sows has no obvious negative effects on the performance of sows and piglets. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible positive effects of rye bran.

AB  - Chronic cold exposure is a stressor that may adversely affect the hippocampal structure and cognitive function. Critical for memory formation and learning processes, the hippocampus is particularly susceptible to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and elevated glucocorticoid levels. Vitamin D plays a complex role in regulating mitochondrial function and may provide neuroprotection. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic cold exposure on proteins associated with signaling pathways, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats and to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of vitamin D3 supplementation. Male Wistar rats (n = 26) were assigned to four groups: control (CON; n = 4), sham stress (WW; n = 6), chronic cold water immersion (CCWI) (CW group; n = 8), and CCWI with 600 IU/kg/day vitamin D3 (VD3) supplementation (CW + D group; n = 8). Exposure to CCWI significantly reduced the hippocampal mass of rats, an effect not reversed by vitamin D3 supplementation. However, vitamin D3 improved mitochondrial function and exhibited antioxidant effects, partially reducing markers of protein and lipid free radicals damage in neural tissue. Our findings demonstrate the antioxidant properties of VD3 and its potential role in mitigating hippocampal damage during prolonged cold exposure, although its neuroprotective effects remain limited.

AB  - In this narrative review, we summarise key findings from 38 human neuroimaging studies of resilience to stress and trauma, the majority of which have utilised structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging methods. Although prior research focused on overall differences between healthy controls and survivors of adversity, more recent studies have revealed neural markers unique to those who not only survived a potentially traumatic event but also maintained or regained their mental health following the event, thereby displaying a level of resilience. Such markers allow us to understand resilience at the level of the brain, to predict responses to adversity, and to measure outcomes of therapeutic interventions. The current body of evidence points to brain regions known to be affected by stress and trauma, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC; including the inferior and middle frontal gyri, dorsolateral and ventromedial PFC), anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which implicates them as markers of resilience. Further research is needed to identify additional neural substrates of adversity and resilience, to confirm known markers, and to determine their full implications for mental health and recovery.

AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a classic "environmental sensor", has been found to play an important role in cognitive and emotional function. Recent studies showed AhR deletion led to an attenuated fear memory, providing a potential target against fear memory, whether it is the consequence of attenuated sense of fear or memory ability deficit or both is unclear. Here this study aims to work this out. The freezing time in contextual fear conditioning (CFC) reduced significantly in AhR knockout mice, indicating an attenuated fear memory. Hot plate test and acoustic startle reflex showed that AhR knockout did not change the pain threshold and hearing, excluded the possibility of sensory impairments. Results from NORT, MWM and SBT showed that deletion of AhR had little effects on other types of memory. But the anxiety-like behaviors reduced both in naive or suffered (tested after CFC) AhR knockout mice, showing that AhR-deficient mice have a reduced basal and stressful emotional response. The basal low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio of the AhR knockout mice was significantly lower than that of the control group, indicating lower sympathetic excitability in the basal state, suggesting a low level of basal stress in the knockout mice. Before and after CFC, the LF/HF ratio of AhR-KO mice tended to be significantly lower than that of WT mice, and their heart rate was significantly lower; and the AhR-KO mice also has a decreased serum corticosterone level after CFC, suggesting a reduced stress response in AhR knockout mice. Altogether, the basal stress level and stress response were significant reduced in AhR knockout mice, which might contribute to the attenuated fear memory with little impairment on other types of memory, suggesting AhR as a "psychologic sensor" additional to "environmental sensor".

AB  - Understanding the diving behavior of semiaquatic mammals, particularly in relation to estimated aerobic dive limits and diet, is important to understand their adaptability and potential vulnerability to changes in prey type and distribution. The diving behavior of African clawless otters, Aonyx capensis, and spotted-necked otters, Hydrictis maculicollis, is poorly known, and no estimates of their dive performance in relation to targeted prey and calculated dive limits have been reported previously for freshwater environments. We investigated the diving behavior of both these otter species in freshwater environments within South Africa through video recordings of direct observations and subsequent video analyses where dive and recovery durations and dive function were recorded. African clawless otters were found to perform longer dives (mean +/- SD = 26.9 +/- 12.2 s), compared to spotted-necked otters (8.5 +/- 7.6 s). African clawless otters showed substantial variation in dive durations, with the shortest dives sometimes lasting < 5 s, and the longest recorded dive being 70 s. The majority of spotted-necked otter dives lasted < 10 s, with the shortest recorded dive lasting 0.66 s and the longest recorded dive lasting 50.9 s. Spotted-necked otters performed different dive types that were evidently dependent on prey targeted, with dives targeting crabs (16.10 +/- 1.91 s) being longer than dives targeting rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (5.58 +/- 0.17 s). The theoretical dive durations of African clawless otters were exceeded during play dives, while spotted-necked otters sometimes exceeded their theoretical dive durations when performing successful foraging dives. The results of this study suggest that spotted-necked otters can vary behavior in relation to prey and exceed theoretical dive duration during successful foraging dives to maximize the net rate of energy gain. Furthermore, when considering known individual-level dietary specialization and plasticity in these species, it may be predicted that dive behaviors are likely to vary substantially among individuals, and in relation to prey availability and localized habitat conditions.

AB  - Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) comprises a group of inherited kidney diseases, caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins localizing to primary cilia. NPHP-RC represents one of the most frequent monogenic causes of renal failure within the first three decades of life, but its molecular disease mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified biallelic ANKS6 mutations in two affected siblings with late-onset chronic kidney disease by whole-exome sequencing. We employed patient-derived fibroblasts generating an in vitro model to study the precise biological impact of distinct human ANKS6 mutations, completed by immunohistochemistry studies on renal biopsy samples. Functional studies using patient-derived cells showed an impaired integrity of the ciliary inversin compartment with reduced cilia length. Further analyses demonstrated that ANKS6 deficiency leads to a dysregulation of Hippo-signaling through nuclear yes-associated protein (YAP) imbalance and disrupted ciliary localization of YAP. In addition, an altered transcriptional activity of canonical Wnt target genes and altered expression of non-phosphorylated (active) beta-catenin and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta were observed. Upon ciliation, ANKS6 deficiency revealed a deranged subcellular localization and expression of components of the endocytic recycling compartment. Our results demonstrate that ANKS6 plays a key role in regulating the Hippo pathway, and ANKS6 deficiency is linked to dysregulation of signaling pathways. Our study provides molecular clues in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of NPHP-RC and may offer new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Octodon degus are a diurnal long-lived social animal widely used to perform longitudinal studies and complex cognitive tasks to test for physiological conditions with similitude in human behavior. They show a complex social organization feasible to be studied under different conditions and ages. Several aspects in degus physiology demonstrated that these animals are susceptible to environmental conditions, such as stress, fear, feeding quality, and isolation. However, the relevance of these factors in life of this animal depends on sex and age. Despite its significance, there are few studies with the intent to characterize neurological parameters that include these two parameters. To determine the basal neurophysiological status, we analyzed basic electrophysiological parameters generated during basal activity or synaptic plasticity in the brain slices of young and aged female and male degus. We studied the hippocampal circuit of animals kept in social ambient in captivity under controlled conditions. The study of basal synaptic activity in young animals (12-24 months old) was similar between sexes, but female degus showed more efficient synaptic transmission than male degus. We found the opposite in aged animals (60-84 months old), where male degus had a more efficient basal transmission and facilitation index than female degus. Furthermore, female and male degus develop significant but not different long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP). However, aged female degus need to recruit twice as many axons to evoke the same postsynaptic activity as male degus and four times more when compared to young female degus. These data suggest that, unlike male degus, the neural status of aged female degus change, showing less number or functional axons available at advanced ages. Our data represent the first approach to incorporate the effect of sex along with age progression in basal neural status.

AB  - Neural circuits are made of a vast diversity of neuronal cell types. While immense progress has been made in classifying neurons based on morphological, molecular, and functional properties, understanding how this heterogeneity contributes to brain function during natural behavior has remained largely unresolved. In the present study, we combined the juxtacellular recording and labeling technique with optogenetics in freely moving mice. This allowed us to selectively target molecularly defined cell classes for in vivo single-cell recordings and morphological analysis. We validated this strategy in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus by restricting Channelrhodopsin expression to Calbindin-positive neurons. Directly versus indirectly light-activated neurons could be readily distinguished based on the latencies of light-evoked spikes, with juxtacellular labeling and post hoc histological analysis providing 'ground-truth' validation. Using these opto-juxtacellular procedures in freely moving mice, we found that Calbindin-positive CA1 pyramidal cells were weakly spatially modulated and conveyed less spatial information than Calbindin-negative neurons - pointing to pyramidal cell identity as a key determinant for neuronal recruitment into the hippocampal spatial map. Thus, our method complements current in vivo techniques by enabling optogenetic-assisted structure-function analysis of single neurons recorded during natural, unrestrained behavior.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Facial eczema (FE) is a secondary photosensitization disease of farm ruminants caused by the sporidesmin A, present in the spores of the saprophytic fungus Pithomyces chartarum. This study communicates an outbreak of ovine FE in Asturias (Spain) and characterizes the local immune response that may contribute to liver damage promoting cholestasis and progression towards fibrosis and cirrhosis. Animals showed clinical signs of photosensitivity and lower gain of weight, loss of wool and crusting in the head for at least 6 months after the FE outbreak. Some sheep presented acute lesions characterized by subcutaneous edema in the head, cholestasis and nephrosis with macrophages and neutrophils present in areas of canalicular cholestasis. In chronic cases, alopecia and crusting, hepatic atrophy with regenerative nodules, fibrosis and gallstones were seen. The surviving parenchyma persisted with a jigsaw pattern characteristic of biliary cirrhosis. Concentric and eccentric myointimal proliferation was found in arteries near damaged bile ducts, where macrophages and lymphocytes were also observed.
   Facial eczema (FE) is a secondary photosensitization disease of farm ruminants caused by the sporidesmin A, produced in the spores of the saprophytic fungus Pithomyces chartarum. This study communicates an outbreak of ovine FE in Asturias (Spain) and characterizes the serum biochemical pattern and the immune response that may contribute to liver damage, favoring cholestasis and the progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Animals showed clinical signs of photosensitivity, with decrease of daily weight gain and loss of wool and crusting for at least 6 months after the FE outbreak. Serum activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase were significantly increased in sheep with skin lesions. In the acute phase, edematous skin lesions in the head, hepatocytic and canalicular cholestasis in centrilobular regions, presence of neutrophils in small clumps surrounding deposits of bile pigment, ductular proliferation, as well as cholemic nephrosis, were observed. Macrophages, stained positively for MAC387, were found in areas of canalicular cholestasis. In the chronic phase, areas of alopecia and crusting were seen in the head, and the liver was atrophic with large regeneration nodules and gallstones. Fibrosis around dilated bile ducts, "typical" and "atypical" ductular reaction and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and pigmented macrophages, with iron deposits and lipofuscin, were found. The surviving parenchyma persisted with a jigsaw pattern characteristic of biliary cirrhosis. Concentric and eccentric myointimal proliferation was found in arteries near damaged bile ducts. In cirrhotic livers, stellated cells, ductular reaction, ectatic bile ducts and presence of M2 macrophages and lymphocytes, were observed in areas of bile ductular reaction.

AB  - The sex hormone estradiol has recently gained attention in human decision-making research. Animal studies have already shown that estradiol promotes dopaminergic transmission and thus supports reward-seeking behavior and aspects of addiction. In humans, natural variations of estradiol across the menstrual cycle modulate the ability to learn from direct performance feedback ("model-free" learning). However, it remains unclear whether estradiol also influences more complex "model-based" contributions to reinforcement learning. Here, 41 women were tested twice - in the low and high estradiol state of the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle - with a Two-Step decision task designed to separate model-free from model-based learning. The results showed that in the high estradiol state women relied more heavily on model-free learning, and accomplished reduced performance gains, particularly during the more volatile periods of the task that demanded increased learning effort. In contrast, model-based control remained unaltered by the influence of hormonal state across the group. Yet, when accounting for individual differences in the genetic proxy of the COMT-Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680), we observed that only the participants homozygote for the methionine allele (n = 12; with putatively higher prefrontal dopamine) experienced a decline in model-based control when facing volatile reward probabilities. This group also showed the increase in suboptimal model-free control, while the carriers of the valine allele remained unaffected by the rise in endogenous estradiol. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that endogenous estradiol may affect the balance between model-based and model-free control, and particularly so in women with a high prefrontal baseline dopamine capacity and in situations of increased environmental volatility.

AB  - Background Porcine circovirus 2 is globally noted swine pathogen with multiple genotypes associated with vast clinical and subclinical outcomes. This study aimed to isolate and characterize PCV2 genotypes circulating in southern states of India. Methods and results A total of 434 field samples comprising of serum (n = 273), tissues (n = 109) and swabs (n = 52) collected from swine during 2019 to 2021 from southern states of India were screened for PCV2 by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Molecular prevalence of PCV2 in southern India was found to be 12.21% (n = 53). All the 53 PCV2 positive samples were further subjected to the PCR assay with designed primers targeting full length amplification of ORF2 gene of PCV2 for molecular characterization. Randomly 32 positive samples by full length PCV2-ORF2 gene PCR were sequenced for genotyping. Signature motif and phylogenetic analysis of 32 PCV2 sequences revealed 62.5% (n = 20) prevalence of PCV2d genotype followed by 21.8% (n = 7) of PCV2h or PCV2-IM1 and 15.6% (n = 5) of PCV2b genotypes. Twenty five PCR positive field samples were subjected for virus isolation in PK15 cells and characterized. Out of 25 samples processed 5 (20%) PCV2 isolates obtained in this study were confirmed by PCR and immune fluorescence assay. Molecular characterization of PK15 adapted five PCV2 isolates confirmed circulation of PCV2d, PCV2h and PCV2b genotypes in pigs under field conditions in southern India. Conclusions Isolation and molecular epidemiological study of PCV2 in southern states of India evidences high circulation of PCV2d genotypes in field conditions in comparison to other genotypes.

AB  - Gene electrotransfer (GET) of plasmids encoding interleukin 12 (IL-12) has already been used for the treatment of various types of tumors in human oncology and as an adjuvant in DNA vaccines. In recent years, we have developed a plasmid encoding human IL-12 (phIL12) that is currently in a phase I clinical study. The aim was to confirm the results of a non-clinical study in mice on pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety in a porcine model that better resembled human skin. The GET of phIL12 in the skin was performed on nine pigs using different concentrations of plasmid phIL12 and invasive (needle) or noninvasive (plate) types of electrodes. The results of our study demonstrate that the GET of phIL-12 with needle electrodes induced the highest expression of IL-12 at the protein level on day 7 after the procedure. The plasmid was distributed to all tested organs; however, its amount decreased over time and was at a minimum 28 days after GET. Based on plasmid copy number and expression results, together with blood analysis, we showed that IL-12 GET is safe in a porcine animal model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pigs are a valuable model for human gene therapy safety studies.

AB  - Carbonate alkalinity stress is a significant issue in aquaculture operations globally. In this trial, a factorial design was used to investigate the effects of alkaline exposure and camel protein hydrolysate (CPH) dietary supplementation on brain tissue histological features, antioxidant status, and the expression of metabolic genes in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. One hundred and sixty fish (16.02 +/- 0.14 g) were randomly allocated to four groups with four replicate tanks per group. The first two groups were raised in freshwater and fed either a basal diet (control) or a basal diet supplemented with 75 g CPH/kg. The third and fourth groups were reared in alkaline water and fed the above control or supplemented diet. The alkaline treatment induced neurobehavioral alterations and decreased brain total cholesterol, dopamine, and serotonin levels. In addition, the fish exposed to alkalinity displayed reduced antioxidant enzyme activity and elevated malondialdehyde, indicating oxidative stress. The brain expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and fatty acid-binding protein-2 (FABP-2) was reduced by exposure to alkaline stress. Circulatory and degenerative changes were recorded in the brain histological features of the alkaline-exposed. The neurobehavioral and brain neurotransmitter level alterations in alkaline water conditions were much reduced in Nile tilapia fed the CPH-supplemented diet. The CPH diet also mitigated oxidative stress and restored some of the brain histological features in the exposed fish. This study shows that the CPH diet helps the fish adapt to alkaline stress conditions.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring heavy metal, which can damage the brain and affect learning and memory. Sodium para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS-Na), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can readily cross the bloodbrain barrier. Our previous studies have found that PAS-Na alleviated Pb-induced hippocampal ultrastructural damage and neurodegeneration, but the mechanism has yet to be defined. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that mediate Pb-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, and the efficacy of PAS-Na in alleviating its effects. This work showed that juvenile developmental Pb exposure impaired rats cognitive ability by inducing apoptotic cell death in hippocampal neurons. Pb-induced neuronal apoptosis was accompanied by increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) expression and enhanced intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i levels, which resulted in increased phosphorylation of neuronal apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and p38. Activation of ASK1 and p38 was blocked by IP3R inhibitor and a Ca2+ chelator. Importantly, PAS-Na treatment improved the Pb-induced effects on cognitive deficits in rats, concomitant with rescued neuronal apoptosis. In addition, PAS-Na reduced the expression of IP3R and the ensuing increase in intracellular Ca2+ and decreased the phosphorylation of ASK1 and p38 in Pb-exposed neurons. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the IP3R-Ca2+-ASK1-p38 signaling pathway mediates Pb-induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, and that PAS-Na, at a specific dose-range, ameliorates these changes. Collectively, this study sheds novel light on the cellular mechanisms that mediate PAS-Na efficacy, laying the groundwork for future research to examine the treatment potential of PAS-Na upon Pb poisoning.

AB  - Degenerated intervertebral discs (IVDs) were treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) loaded into an injectable collagen scaffold in a sheep model to investigate the implant's therapeutic potential regarding the progression of degeneration of previously damaged discs. In this study, 18 merino sheep were subjected to a 3-step minimally invasive injury and treatment model, which consisted of surgically induced disc degeneration, treatment of IVDs with an ASC-loaded collagen hydrogel 6 weeks post-operatively, and assessment of the implant's influence on degenerative tissue changes after 6 and 12 months of grazing. Autologous ASCs were extracted from subcutaneous adipose tissue and cultivated in vitro. At the end of the experiment, disc heights were determined by mu-CT measurements and morphological tissue changes were histologically examined.Histological investigations show that, after treatment with the ASC-loaded collagen hydrogel implant, degeneration-specific features were observed less frequently. Quantitative studies of the degree of degeneration did not demonstrate a significant influence on potential tissue regeneration with treatment. Regarding disc height analysis, at both 6 and 12 months after treatment with the ASC-loaded collagen hydrogel implant a stabilization of the disc height can be seen. A complete restoration of the intervertebral disc heights however could not be achieved.The reported injection procedure describes in a preclinical model a translational therapeutic approach for degenerative disc diseases based on adipose-derived stem cells in a collagen hydrogel scaffold. Further investigations are planned with the use of a different injectable scaffold material using the same test model.

AB  - Collective motion, that is the coordinated spatial and temporal organisation of individuals, is a core element in the study of collective animal behaviour. The self-organised properties of how a group moves influence its various behavioural and ecological processes, such as predator-prey dynamics, social foraging and migration. However, little is known about the inter- and intra-specific variation in collective motion. Despite the significant advancement in high-resolution tracking of multiple individuals within groups, providing collective motion data for animals in the laboratory and the field, a framework to perform quantitative comparisons across species and contexts is lacking. Here, we present the swaRmverse package. Building on two existing R packages, trackdf and swaRm, swaRmverse enables the identification and analysis of collective motion 'events', as presented in Papadopoulou et al. (2023), creating a unit of comparison across datasets. We describe the package's structure and showcase its functionality using existing datasets from several species and simulated trajectories from an agent-based model. From positional time-series data for multiple individuals (x-y-t-id), swaRmverse identifies events of collective motion based on the distribution of polarisation and group speed. For each event, a suite of validated biologically meaningful metrics are calculated, and events are placed into a 'swarm space' through dimensional reduction techniques. Our package provides the first automated pipeline enabling the analysis of data on collective behaviour. The package allows the calculation and use of complex metrics for users without a strong quantitative background and will promote communication and data-sharing across disciplines, standardising the quantification of collective motion across species and promoting comparative investigations.

AB  - Cognitive reserve (CR) and busyness can boost memory, whereas stress can impair memory. Nevertheless, extant research has not yet examined busyness in conjunction with CR and stress, nor whether CR or stress moderate the relationship between busyness and episodic memory. Middle-aged and older adult participants (N = 71; ages 50-74; 31% African-American) answered lifestyle questionnaires and completed a visual paired-associate memory fMRI task. Dimension reduction techniques identified two latent CR factors-personal CR (own education; occupation complexity; socioeconomic status) and parental education (mother's/father's education), and identified two latent stress factors-external stress (neighborhood stress/violence; financial strain) and personal stress (perceived stress; work/personal stress). We cast these latent factors into a series of regression models, revealing that (1) in isolation, higher busyness predicted better episodic memory, (2) higher external stress predicted worse memory, (3) both greater personal CR and greater parental education predicted better memory, (4) busyness did not interact with stress nor with CR, and (5) in a combined model, higher parental education and lower external stress were significant independent predictors. Neuroimaging data revealed that higher CR was associated with more efficient brain activity in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate during successful episodic memory retrieval, whereas higher personal stress was associated with heightened activity in the precuneus. No interactions or main effects of busyness were observed for the fMRI data. Thus, although busyness was associated with superior episodic memory, busyness did not modulate brain activity during episodic memory retrieval, nor did CR or stress moderate the relationship between busyness and associative memory.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to gain insight into the metabolism of pigs derived from assisted reproductive technologies during their adulthood. Approximately 4h after feeding, a blood sample was taken from 3.5 year old sows born by artificial insemination (AI group, n = 7) and transfer of in vitro produced embryos (IVP group, n = 11) to determine the physiological concentrations of the main biomarkers of carbohydrates (glucose and lactate), proteins (albumin, creatinine and urea) and lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). Four weeks later, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 1.75g glucose/kg body weight) was performed after an overnight fast and 1h of water withdrawal. Blood samples were obtained prior (T = 0 min; fasting conditions) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 min after glucose intake. At each time point, glycemia was measured immediately using glucometer test strips, and serum was collected to determine the above metabolites along with insulin and glucagon. After OGTT, the area under the curve (AUC) between sampling times and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) indices were calculated. Under physiological conditions, the concentration of metabolites studied was similar between AI and IVP sows. In both groups, fasting decreased cholesterol and increased triglycerides and urea (P < 0.001). However, creatinine and lactate were similar in both groups under physiological and fasting conditions. The expected increase in albuminemia and decrease in glycaemia after fasting was only observed in IVP sows. OGTT revealed a different glucose curve pattern (monophasic in AI and biphasic in IVP group), a lower mean concentration of cholesterol, glucose, lactate, triglycerides in IVP compared to AI pigs (P < 0.01), and a higher mean concentration of albumin, creatinine and insulin in IVP compared to AI group (P < 0.05). On the contrary, no differences were found between groups for mean serum glucagon and urea levels, nor for glucose homeostasis indices HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B. The AUC differed between groups at several time points with larger AUC for creatinine, and smaller AUC for glucose, glucagon, and triglycerides, in IVP pigs than in AI pigs at 180-210 min (P < 0.05). In conclusion, under physiological conditions the metabolic profile of fully-grown AI and IVP sows is similar and within normal ranges. Glucose challenge revealed differences in metabolic and insulin responses between groups but with normal glucose tolerance in both cases.

AB  - BackgroundInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) influences various aspects of embryogenesis, including embryonic development. This study investigated the effects of IGF-1 on early embryonic development in pig embryos, focusing on its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell adhesion and proliferation.MethodsPorcine embryos were used for experiments with chemical treatments to study blastocyst development and underlying mechanism. Apoptosis, immunochemistry, gene expression, and protein quantification were performed, with statistical significance assessed.ResultsIGF-1 treatment during the early stages of embryonic development significantly enhanced developmental parameters, in particular blastocyst formation rates. Interestingly, IGF-1 increased trophectoderm (TE) cell proliferation. The TE is an essential component of the blastocyst, maintaining its structure. Successful development of pig embryos was dependent on the proper formation and function of the TE. IGF-1 upregulated the expression of functional proteins related to TE differentiation and tight junctions. Notably, these effects were more pronounced when IGF-1 treatment was performed during the last 3 days of embryonic development (days 3-6) compared to the first 3 days (days 0-3). In addition, we found that IGF-1 promoted activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, including increasing beta-catenin levels and related gene expression. To confirm the interaction between IGF-1 signaling and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in TE development, embryos were cultured with picropodophyllin, an IGF-1 receptor inhibitor. Picropodophyllin suppressed developmental parameters, beta-catenin levels, TE cell differentiation, and tight junction formation. These effects were successfully rescued by IGF-1 and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activator ChiR99021.ConclusionOur findings provide new insights into the interaction between IGF-1 and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway during embryogenesis and highlight the potential of IGF-1 to improve reproductive outcomes by enhancing TE formation and quality.

AB  - Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and intense agricultural practices in the cities and communities along the rivers have resulted in potentially toxic elements, such as heavy metals, being released into the river water and subsequently deposited into Dongting Lake, thereby posing a severe threat to fish, invertebrates, and humans. In this work, eight fish species, representing different kinds of feeding habits and living habitats, were collected from Dongting Lake, China. The concentration of heavy metals in the specimens was determined. Parameters related to fish consumption, such as food safety and health risks, were calculated. In descending order, the average heavy metal concentrations in the fish followed the trend: Zn>Cu>Pb>Cr>Cd>Hg. Moreover, some species of fish have concentrations of Cd and Pb that exceed food safety standards. The concentration of distinct heavy metals varied widely, but the total concentration trended as follows: predatory, omnivorous > filter > herbivorous, benthic > pelagic fish. The hazard quotient and hazard index values were < 1 for all trophic levels of fish, suggesting that consuming the muscle from fish retrieved from Dongting Lake may not present a potential human health risk to adults in terms of heavy metal contamination. Nevertheless, we recommend that Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, and Silurus asotus should be consumed less, and that pollution prevention and control measures should be implemented to reduce Pb, Cd and Cr pollution.

AB  - Adenosine A(1) receptors are widely expressed in the mammalian brain. Through interacting with G(alpha i/o)-coupled A(1) receptors, the neuromodulator adenosine modulates a variety of cellular and synaptic activities. To determine the linkage from A(1) receptors to a key intracellular signaling pathway, we investigated the impact of blocking A(1) receptors on a subfamily of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, that is, the Src family kinase (SFK), in different rat brain regions in vivo. We found that pharmacological blockade of A(1) receptors by a single systemic injection of the A(1) selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) induced an increase in autophosphorylation of SFKs at a consensus activation site, tyrosine 416 (Y416), in the two subdivisions of the striatum, the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens. DPCPX also increased SFK Y416 phosphorylation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not the hippocampus. The DPCPX-induced Y416 phosphorylation was time dependent and reversible. In immunopurified Fyn and Src proteins from the striatum, DPCPX elevated SFK Y416 phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity in Fyn but not in Src proteins. In the mPFC, DPCPX enhanced Y416 phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity in both Fyn and Src immunoprecipitates. DPCPX had no effect on expression of total Fyn and Src proteins in the striatum, mPFC, and hippocampus. These results demonstrate a tonic inhibitory linkage from A(1) receptors to SFKs in the striatum and mPFC. Blocking this inhibitory tone could significantly enhance constitutive SFK Y416 phosphorylation in the rat brain in a region- and time-dependent manner.

AB  - The habit of drinking tea is highly prevalent and could be utilized to introduce more health benefits through fortification with medicinal plants. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the nutritional quality and health benefits of fortified Ziziphus tea (ZT) with green tea (GT) against obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Proximate analysis and sensory evaluation were carried out on the fortified tea. In the in vivo study, 15 SD rats were used for each group. Flow cytometry was utilized for caspase 3 analysis. ELISA was used for the detection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and adiponectin levels. Real-time PCR was used to detect Notch-1 and Hes-1 gene expression. The composition of fortified (GT+ZT) showed a significant improvement in the nutritional value represented by the increase in overall protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash, carbohydrate, mineral contents, and antioxidant capacity. Treatment with GT+ZT restored the disturbance in body weight, lipid profile, liver function, glucose, insulin sensitivity index, and oxidative status. It reversed the changes in TNF-alpha and adiponectin levels. Their protective effects against NAFLD were indicated by the inhibition of hepatic caspase-3 activity, suppression of Notch-1, and Hes-1 gene expression and amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced histological alterations. Collectively, our findings, elucidate the precise mechanism of fortified ZT+GT for the attenuation of obesity-induced metabolic disorders and NAFLD via regulating lipolysis, TNF-alpha, adiponectin, apoptosis, and Notch-1 signaling pathways, and provide a foundation for an easily implemented healthy habit of drinking. Practical applications The incorporation of bioactive compounds into functional foods is a growing market. Consumer attention in well-being has increased rapidly toward a fortified diet that provides additional health effects. The fortified (GT+ZT) tea may potentially serve as an easily implemented healthy drinking habit to prevent and manage obesity and NAFLD and reduce the risk of other diseases. Fortification with ZT improved the health-promoting functionality of GT through the enhancement of total protein, carbohydrates, antioxidant, and mineral contents. This was reflected by their synergetic therapeutic activity in ameliorating the disturbance in obesity-related disorders and NAFLD via regulating lipolysis, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and Notch-1 signaling pathways. Therefore, (GT+ZT) could be considered functional foods which attribute to functional improvement and reduction in disease risk.

AB  - Glutamatergic alteration is one of the potential mechanisms of depression. However, there is no consensus on whether glutamate metabolism changes affect the myelin structure of depression in mouse models. Glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) is a novel and powerful molecular imaging technique that can visualize glutamate distribution. In this study, we used the GluCEST imaging technique to look at glutamate levels in mice under chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and how they relate to demyelination. The CUMS mice were exposed to different stress factors for 6 weeks. Evaluated of depression in CUMS mice by behavioral tests. MRI scans were then performed, including T2-mapping, GluCEST, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences. Brain tissues were collected for Luxol Fast Blue staining and immunofluorescence staining to analyze the changes in the myelin sheath. Artificially sketched regions of interest (ROI) (corpus callosum, hippocampus, and thalamus) were used to calculate the GluCEST value, fractional anisotropy (FA), and T2 value. Compared with the control group, the GluCEST value in the ROIs of CUMS mice significantly decreased. Similarly, the FA value in ROIs was lower in the CUMS group than in the CTRL group, but the T2 value did not differ significantly between the two groups. The histological results showed that ROIs in the CUMS group had demyelination compared with the CTRL group, indicating that DTI was more sensitive than T2 mapping in detecting myelin abnormalities. Furthermore, the GluCEST value in the ROIs correlates positively with the FA value. These findings suggest that altered glutamate metabolism may be one of the important factors leading to demyelination in depression, and GluCEST is expected to serve as an imaging biological marker for the diagnosis of demyelination in depression.

AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of different levels of concentrate associated or not with protected fat (calcium salts of fatty acids from soybean oil) in the diet on the feeding behaviour of feedlot lambs. Sixty-four 4 -month -old, non -castrated Santa Ines male lambs (20.07 +/- 0.25 kg BW) were distributed in a randomized complete block design, in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement [four concentrate:roughage levels (C:R level - 400:600; 500:500; 600:400 and 700:300 g/kg, dry matter basis (DM)) and two inclusion levels of protected fat (0 and 35 g/kg, dry matter basis)]. An interaction effect between the concentrate levels and the inclusion of protected fat was detected for DM intake (g/day) (P = 0.020). The intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased as the level of concentrate increased (P < 0.001), whereas it increased without the inclusion of protected fat (P = 0.003). The time spent in feeding (P < 0.05) and rumination (P < 0.001) decreased with increasing amounts of concentrate, whereas the time spent idling increased linearly (P < 0.001). The feeding efficiency (g DM/h) for DM increased (P = 0.019), and for NDF (g NDF/h) decreased (P < 0.001). Including protected fat increased feeding (g DM/h and g NDF/h) and rumination (g DM/h and g NDF/h) efficiencies (P = 0.015 and P = 0.023, respectively). The number of chews per day (P = 0.004) and number of cud chewed per day (P = 0.015) were linearly decreased as a function of the concentrate level. The DM (g) chewed per cud increased (P < 0.001) with higher levels of concentrate. The concentrate level of 700 g/kg DM increased the feedlot lambs' feeding and rumination efficiencies. Amounts higher than 35.0 g/kg DM of protected fat is not recommended considering the feeding behaviour results; mainly, DM intake and DM feeding efficiency. Nevertheless, studies based on performance and carcass yield are recommended.

AB  - Sequestration of plant secondary metabolites by herbivores can vary across both host plant phenology and herbivore ontogeny, but few studies have explored how they concurrently change in the field. We explored variation in iridoid glycoside concentration and composition in white turtlehead, Chelone glabra, as well as sequestration of iridoid glycosides by its specialist herbivore, the Baltimore checkerspot, Euphydryas phaeton, across the development of both herbivore and host plant. In 2012 we sampled plants to describe seasonal variation in the concentrations of two iridoid glycosides, aucubin and catalpol. In 2017, we sampled both host plants and caterpillars over an entire growing season and explored the relationship between plant chemistry and herbivore sequestration. We also compared iridoid glycoside concentrations of plants with and without herbivory to gain insight into whether levels of secondary compounds were impacted by herbivory. We found that total plant iridoid glycosides varied across the season and that total sequestered iridoid glycosides in caterpillars closely mirrored concentration patterns in plants. However, the magnitude of sequestration by caterpillars ranged from 2 to 20 times the concentrations in host plants, with different proportions of aucubin and catalpol. In addition, plants with herbivory had lower iridoid glycoside concentrations than plants without herbivory, although this difference changed over time. These results suggest that while variation in host plant secondary metabolites may be a dominant factor driving sequestration, other ecological factors may mitigate the relationship between host plant chemistry and herbivore sequestration.

AB  - It remains to be determined how different inputs for memory-encoding, such as the use of paper notebooks or mobile devices, affect retrieval processes. We compared three groups of participants who read dialogues on personal schedules and wrote down the scheduled appointments on a calendar using a paper notebook (Note), an electronic tablet (Tablet), or a smartphone (Phone). After the retention period for an hour including an interference task, we tested recognition memory of those appointments with visually presented questions in a retrieval task, while scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We obtained three major results. First, the duration of writing down schedules was significantly shorter for the Note group than the Tablet and Phone groups, and accuracy was much higher for the Note group in easier (i.e., more straightforward) questions. Because the input methods were equated as much as possible between the Note and Tablet groups, these results indicate that the cognitive processes for the Note group were deeper and more solid. Second, brain activations for all participants during the retrieval phase were localized in the bilateral hippocampus, precuneus, visual cortices, and language-related frontal regions, confirming the involvement of verbalized memory retrieval processes for appointments. Third, activations in these regions were significantly higher for the Note group than those for the Tablet and Phone groups. These enhanced activations for the Note group could not be explained by general cognitive loads or task difficulty, because overall task performances were similar among the groups. The significant superiority in both accuracy and activations for the Note group suggested that the use of a paper notebook promoted the acquisition of rich encoding information and/or spatial information of real papers and that this information could be utilized as effective retrieval clues, leading to higher activations in these specific regions.

AB  - The cutting technique is extensively used in tea breeding, with key emphasis on promoting the growth of adventitious roots (ARs). Despite its importance in tea cultivation, the mechanisms underlying AR development in tea remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the essential role of auxins in the initiation and progression of AR and established that the application of exogenous 1-naphthaleneacetic acid-enhanced AR formation in tissue-cultured seedlings and cuttings. Then, we found that the auxin-responsive transcription factor CsSPL9 acted as a negative regulator of AR development by reducing the levels of free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in tea plants. Furthermore, we identified CsGH3.4 as a downstream target of CsSPL9, which was activated by direct binding to its promoter. CsGH3.4 also inhibited AR development and maintained low levels of free IAA. Thus, these results revealed the inhibitory effect of the auxin-responsive CsSPL9-CsGH3.4 module on AR development by reducing free IAA levels in tea. These findings have significant theoretical and practical value for enhancing tea breeding practices.

AB  - Damage to Sertoli cell junction proteins caused by inflammation can lead to male infertility. Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays an important role in reproductive and inflammatory disease; however, whether and how NGF regulates Sertoli cell function remains unclear. Here, we aimed to assess the effect of NGF on the growth of Sertoli cells isolated from the testes of dairy goats and evaluate if NGF has a protective effect on these cells. We confirmed that Sertoli cell viability, proliferation, and ATP content increased following NGF treatment. In addition, qPCR results suggested that Sertoli cell apoptosis was inhibited after NGF treatment. To investigate the protective effect of NGF on Sertoli cells under patho-logical inflammatory conditions, LPS was used to induce inflammatory response in Sertoli cells. Post-treatment, the entangled filamentous pseudopodia of the cells loosened and no longer spanned adja-cent cells. The expression of several junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, CX-43, b-catenin, and N-cadherin), which was down-regulated after inflammatory response induction, was restored following NGF treat-ment. LPS-induced changes in cytotoxicity and transepithelial electrical resistance were reversed and the intercellular connections became tighter after NGF treatment. We further demonstrated that NGF pre-vented the inflammatory response of Sertoli cells via the PI3K/AKT/NFkB signaling pathway, similar to the effect of the PI3K-inhibitor, LY294002, which is modified by the PI3K activator, 740Y-P. These results provide insights for devising strategies for protecting the male reproductive system and curing or pre-venting associated pathological conditions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cognitive decline is one of the greatest health threats of old age and the maintenance of optimal brain function across a lifespan remains a big challenge. The hippocampus is considered particularly vulnerable but there is cross-species consensus that its functional integrity benefits from the early and continuous exercise of demanding physical, social and mental activities, also referred to as environmental enrichment (EE). Here, we investigated the extent to which late-onset EE can improve the already-impaired cognitive abilities of lifelong deprived C57BL/6 mice and how it affects gene expression in the hippocampus. To this end, 5- and 24-month-old mice housed in standard cages (5mSC and 24mSC) and 24-month-old mice exposed to EE in the last 2 months of their life (24mEE) were subjected to a Barnes maze task followed by next-generation RNA sequencing of the hippocampal tissue. Our analyses showed that late-onset EE was able to restore deficits in spatial learning and short-term memory in 24-month-old mice. These positive cognitive effects were reflected by specific changes in the hippocampal transcriptome, where late-onset EE affected transcription much more than age (24mSC vs. 24mEE: 1311 DEGs, 24mSC vs. 5mSC: 860 DEGs). Remarkably, a small intersection of 72 age-related DEGs was counter-regulated by late-onset EE. Of these, Bcl3, Cttnbp2, Diexf, Esr2, Grb10, Il4ra, Inhba, Rras2, Rps6ka1 and Socs3 appear to be particularly relevant as key regulators involved in dendritic spine plasticity and in age-relevant molecular signaling cascades mediating senescence, insulin resistance, apoptosis and tissue regeneration. In summary, our observations suggest that the brains of aged mice in standard cage housing preserve a considerable degree of plasticity. Switching them to EE proved to be a promising and non-pharmacological intervention against cognitive decline.

AB  - Herbivores are challenged when selecting a diet because many plants have limited nutritional value and some use defenses to avoid being eaten. Understanding diet selection of herbivores in most landscapes also involves choices between native versus nonnative plant species which, in turn, informs management actions to conserve the species. The New England Cottontail, Sylvilagus transitionalis (Bangs 1895)-a species on the decline-is the focus of a large conservation consortium. We conducted microhistological analyses of field collected fecal samples and field surveys of plant species available to determine winter diet of New England cottontails on Patience Island, Rhode Island. Energy density (total nitrogen, crude fat, energy, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, ash, and total phenolics) was measured for each of the available plants. A used-available framework was used to determine the selection of each species identified in their feces and how this related to the measured nutritionally relevant constituents. We hypothesized that New England cottontails would select plant species with higher protein and energy values and select native versus nonnative plant species. Unexpectedly, New England cottontails did not select plants with higher protein or energy content but rather plants with higher phenolic and ash levels. In addition, New England cottontails strongly selected native plant species. Our results support previous research that New England cottontails are generalist herbivores, but that plant defenses and whether the plants are native play a role in diet selection.

AB  - Although, it is well understood that sperm DNA damage is associated with infertility, the molecular details of how damaged sperm DNA affects fertility are not fully elucidated. Since sperm proteins play an important role in fertilization and post-fertilization events, the present study aimed to identify the sperm proteomic alterations in bulls with high sperm DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI%). Semen from Holstein-Friesian crossbred breeding bulls (n = 50) was subjected to Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay. Based on DFI%, bulls were classified into either high- (HDFI; n = 6), or low-DFI (LDFI; n = 6) and their spermatozoa were subjected to high throughput proteomic analysis. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis identified 4567 proteins in bull spermatozoa. A total of 2660 proteins were found common to both the groups, while 1193 and 714 proteins were unique to HDFI and LDFI group, respectively. A total of 265 proteins were up regulated and 262 proteins were down regulated in HDFI group. It was found that proteins involved in capacitation [heparin binding (molecular function), ERK1 and ERK2 cascade (biological process), PI3K-Akt signalling (pathway), Jak-STAT signalling (pathway)], spermatogenesis [TLR signalling (pathway), gamete generation (biological process)] and DNA repair mechanism (biological process) were significantly altered in the bulls with high DFI%.

AB  - The cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus, is a piercing-sucking insect that feeds on several plant species, including squares (pre-floral buds) of upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, causing square abscission and yield reductions. Current control of cotton fleahoppers relies on pesticide applications, but there is growing interest in using chemical ecology to develop more sustainable methods for integrated pest management. Herbivore foraging behavior is often mediated by plant-produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can serve as attractants or repellants during host-plant selection. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of cotton fleahopper herbivory on VOC emissions from cotton squares under field conditions and to investigate the behavioral responses of conspecific insects to these VOCs. Using dynamic headspace sampling, we identified seven VOCs emitted from cotton squares, with three compounds emitted in higher abundance following cotton fleahopper herbivory: (E)-beta-ocimene, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, and (E)-beta-farnesene. The total emission of VOCs from squares with cotton fleahopper herbivory was greater than non-damaged (control) cotton squares. Using dual choice olfactometer assays, we found that adult cotton fleahoppers preferred VOCs from non-damaged squares compared to VOCs from squares with conspecific herbivory. Furthermore, cotton fleahoppers were attracted to synthetic (E)-beta-ocimene but repelled by synthetic (E)-beta-caryophyllene or the combination of (E)-beta-ocimene and (E)-beta-caryophyllene. Our findings suggest that cotton VOCs influence cotton fleahopper foraging, and that compounds identified in this study have potential for development as lures or repellants to use in integrated pest management.

AB  - Providing young monogastric animals with the essential amino acids they need is challenging in organic feeding. The nutrient content of organic feeds varies widely, and additives are restricted, so feed rations must be formulated based on analysis. A survey of 56 organic pig and poultry farmers in Germany was carried out to investigate their attitudes towards ration planning and to examine and evaluate the feeding management on their farms. Principal component analysis was used to characterise the different attitudes. Cluster analysis revealed three groups: Farmers in Group 1 (n = 28) were uncertain about the nutrient requirements of organic animals. They accepted the importance of need-based feeding for health and performance, but did not recognise the importance of regular ration adjustments and were uncertain about the animals' ability to compensate for deficiencies. In Group 2 (n = 11), need-based feeding and regular ration adjustments were most important to farmers, who were more likely to have professional feeding systems. In Group 3 (n = 17), farmers were least uncertain about nutrient requirements and did not believe that animals would lower their demand when undersupplied. Although the importance of need-based feeding was recognised, regular ration adjustment was of little importance for this group. Across all farms, 60% of the feed rations examined deviated significantly from recommendations. It is concluded that organic farmers need more guidance and perhaps pressure to fulfil their responsibility to provide their animals with the nutrients they need.

AB  - Diplodiscus japonicus and Diplodiscus mehari (Trematoda: Diplodiscidae) are two important parasites in wood frogs, which have large infection rates and essential importance of ecology, economy and society. In this study, the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of D. japonicus and D. mehari were sequenced, then compared with other related trematodes in the superfamily Paramphistomoidea. The complete circular mt sequence of D. japonicus and D. mehari were 14,210 bp and 14,179 bp in length, respectively. Both mt genomes comprised 36 functional subunits, consisting of 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and one non-coding region. The mt genes of D. japonicus and D. mehari were transcribed in the same direction, and the gene arrangements were identical to those of Paramphistomoidea trematodes. In the 12 PCGs, GTG was the most common initiation codon, whereas TAG was the most common termination codon. All tRNAs had a typical cloverleaf structure except tRNA Ser1. A comparison with related Paramphistomoidea trematode mt genomes suggested that the cox1 gene of D. mehari was the longest in these trematodes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Paramphistomoidea trematodes formed a monophyletic branch, Paramphistomidae and Gastrothylacidae were more closely related than Diplodiscidae. And the further analysis with Pronocephalata branch found that the flukes parasitic in amphibians (frogs) formed one group, and the flukes from ruminants (cattle, sheep, ect) formed another group. Our study demonstrated the importance of sequencing mt genomes of D. japonicus and D. mehari, which will provide significant molecular resources for further studies of Paramphistomoidea taxonomy, population genetics and systematics.

AB  - Volatile anesthetics have been shown in different studies to reduce ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) facilitates graft evaluation, extends preservation time and potentially enables injury repair and improvement of lung quality. We hypothesized that ventilating lungs with sevoflurane during EVLP would reduce lung injury and improve lung function. We performed a pilot study to test this hypothesis in a slaughterhouse sheep DCD model. Lungs were harvested, flushed and stored on ice for 3 h, after which EVLP was performed for 4 h. Lungs were ventilated with either an FiO2 of 0.4 (EVLP, n = 5) or FiO2 of 0.4 plus sevoflurane at a 2% end-tidal concentration (Cet) (S-EVLP, n = 5). Perfusate, tissue samples and functional measurements were collected and analyzed. A steady state of the target Cet sevoflurane was reached with measurable concentrations in perfusate. Lungs in the S-EVLP group showed significantly better dynamic lung compliance than those in the EVLP group (p = 0.003). Oxygenation capacity was not different in treated lungs for delta partial oxygen pressure (PO2; +3.8 (-4.9/11.1) vs. -11.7 (-12.0/-3.2) kPa, p = 0.151), but there was a trend of a better PO2/FiO2 ratio (p = 0.054). Perfusate ASAT levels in S-EVLP were significantly reduced compared to the control group (198.1 +/- 93.66 vs. 223.9 +/- 105.7 IU/L, p = 0.02). We conclude that ventilating lungs with sevoflurane during EVLP is feasible and could be useful to improve graft function.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that the NOD-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome is associated with A beta generation and deposition, which contributes to neuronal damage and neuronal-inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. It has been reported that autophagy dysfunction can aggravate the pathological symptoms of AD and plays an important role in regulating A beta generation and clearance. We hypothesized that NLRP1 inflammasome activation may induce autophagy dysfunction contributing to the progression of AD. In the present study, we observed the relationship between A beta generation and NLRP1 inflammasome activation, as well as AMPK/mTOR mediated-autophagy dysfunction in WT 9-month-old (M) mice, APP/PS1 6 M and APP/PS1 9 M mice. Additionally, we further studied the effect of NLRP1 knockdown on cognitive function, A beta generation, neuroinflammation and AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy in APP/PS1 9 M mice. Our results indicated that NLRP1 inflammasome activation and AMPK/mTOR mediated-autophagy dysfunction are closely implicated in A beta generation and deposition in APP/PS1 9 M mice, but not in APP/PS1 6 M mice. Meanwhile, we found that knockdown of NLRP1 significantly improved learning and memory impairments, decreased the expressions of NLRP1, ASC, caspase-1, p-NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, APP, CTF-beta, BACE1 and A beta(1-42), and decreased the level of p-AMPK, Beclin 1 and LC3 II, and increased the level of p-mTOR and P62 in APP/PS1 9 M mice. Our study suggested that inhibition of NLRP1 inflammasome activation improves AMPK/mTOR mediated-autophagy dysfunction, resulting in the decrease of A beta generation, and NLRP1 and autophagy might be important targets to delay the progression of AD.

AB  - Dietary fish oil can potentially be replaced by camelina oil in aquafeeds since 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid: ALA) accounts for 35% of the fatty acids. To test the effect of camelina oil on fish lipid composition, a feeding trial with tilapia (var. GIFT Oreochromis sp.) was carried out. Four experimental diets were formulated, one containing only fish oil (TFO), two where fish oil was replaced by camelina at low (Low-CO) and medium (Med-CO) levels, and another made only with camelina oil (TCO). A commercial diet (COM) was used as a reference diet. At the end of an 8-week feeding trial, the liver, kidney, heart and brain were sampled. In terms of proportions across tissues, the liver showed the highest triacylglycerol and oleic acid content; the kidney was higher in arachidonic (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); the heart had the highest total lipids, linoleic acid (LOA) and ALA, while the brain was higher in sterols, acetone-mobile polar lipids (AMPL), phospholipids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In terms of concentration among diets within tissues, when comparing TFO vs TCO, the phospholipids and ARA increased in the kidney, while the phospholipids decreased in the heart and the DHA in the brain. The TCO diet significantly increased 20:1n-9 and ALA in all analysed tissues. As expected, the COM diet significantly increased concentrations of EPA, docosapentaenoic acid (n-3DPA) and DHA in all analysed tissues.

AB  - The growth of two pairs of co-cultures (Escherichia coli/Geotrichum candidum and Staphylococcus aureus/Geotrichum candidum) with a starter culture of lactic acid bacteria was studied in milk at temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 21 degrees C, related to the ripening of artisanal cheese. For an inoculum of approximately 10(6) CFU/mL, LAB not only induced an early stationary phase of E. coli (two isolates BR and PS2) and S. aureus (isolates 2064 and 14733) but also affected their death phase. In co-cultures with LAB and G. candidum, the numbers of E. coli and S. aureus increased in 2 logs and 1 log, respectively, reaching maximum population densities (MPDs) of less than 5 and 4 logs, respectively. After that, the populations of both bacteria represented with two isolates decreased in more than 2 logs and 3 logs within 2 days compared to their MPDs, respectively. G. candidum was found to be the subject of interactions with LAB within a given temperature range only partially. To develop a tertiary model for the growth curves of the populations, a one-step approach was used, combining the Huang-Gimenez and Dalgaard primary model with secondary square-root models for growth rate and lag time. Furthermore, the reparametrized Gompertz-inspired function with the Bigelow secondary model was used to describe the death phase of the E. coli and S. aureus isolates. The prediction ability of the growth of the H-GD tertiary model for co-cultures was cross-validated within the isolates and datasets in milk and milk medium with 1% NaCl. The study can be used as knowledge support for the hygiene guidelines of short-ripened raw milk cheeses, as was our case in Slovakia.

AB  - Simple Summary By-products are the focus of many ruminant nutrition studies in recent decades. These alternative feeds show different concentrations of ideal nutrients for feeding ruminants. These are generally less expensive than common ingredients used in traditional diets (soybean meal and corn). From the corn industry we obtain the by-product whole corn germ (WCG). The highest lipid content of corn is found in WCG (85%), which makes it useful for increasing the energy density of diets. This research aims to evaluate the inclusion in the diet of different levels of WCG, an energy source, on the metabolic and productive behavior of feedlot lambs. Although some changes in nutrient intake and digestibility were observed, the inclusion of WCG in the diet did not promote changes in nitrogen retention, productive performance, and blood parameters. In this way, the use of WCG up to 120 g/kg DM, in the total diet, is recommended as an alternative source of energy for feedlot lambs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary inclusion (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 g/kg DM) of whole corn germ (WCG), an energy source, on the metabolic and productive performance of feedlot lambs. To this end, two complementary experiments were carried out. In Experiment I, we tested the effects of WCG inclusion levels on the metabolism of 10 uncastrated Santa Ines male lambs, which were distributed into two 5 x 5 Latin squares design. Non-fibrous carbohydrates digestibility decreased (p = 0.01), whereas ether extract digestibility increased (p < 0.01) with the inclusion of WCG. Retained nitrogen did not change (p = 0.99) with the WCG inclusion. In Experiment II, we tested the effect of WCG inclusion levels on the production performance of 40 uncastrated Santa Ines male lambs, in a completely randomized design. There was a reduction in the intake of nutritional components (p < 0.05), except EE (p < 0.01), which increased with the increasing WCG levels. Production performance and blood parameters did not change. Based on the observed metabolism, performance, and feed efficiency, the use of WCG at up to 120 g/kg DM, in the total diet, is recommended as an alternative energy source for feedlot lambs.

AB  - Ethanol exposure and early life stress during brain development are associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders. We used a third-trimester equivalent model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders combined with a maternal separation (MS) protocol to evaluate whether these stressors cause sexually dimorphic behavioral and hippocampal dendritic arborization responses in adolescent rats. Wistar rat pups were divided into four experimental groups: 1) Control; 2) MS (MS, for 3 h/day from postnatal (PND) 2 to PND14); 3) EtOH (EtOH, 5 g/kg/day, i.p., PND2, 4, 6, 8, and 10); 4) EtOH + MS. All animals were divided into two cohorts and subjected to a battery of behavioral tests when they reached adolescence (PND37-44). Animals from cohort 1 were submitted to: 1) the open field test; 2) self-cleaning behavior (PND38); and 3) the motivation test (PND39-41). Animals from cohort 2 were submitted to: 1) the novel object recognition (PND37-39); 2) social investigation test (PND40); and 3) Morris water maze test (PND41-44). At PND45, the animals were euthanized, and the brains were collected for subsequent dendritic analysis. Postnatal ethanol exposure (PEE) caused anxietylike behavior in females and reduced motivation, and increased hippocampal dendritic arborization in both sexes. MS reduced body weight, increased locomotor activity in females, and increased motivation, and hippocampal dendritic arborization in both sexes. We found that males from the EtOH + MS groups are more socially engaged than females, who were more interested in sweets than males. Altogether, these data suggest that early life adverse conditions may alter behavior in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent rats.

AB  - Thyroid hormones are critical for healthy brain functions at every stage of life. Hypothyroidism can cause severe cognitive dysfunction in patients who do not receive adequate treatment. Although thyroid hormone replacement alleviates cognitive decline in hypothyroid patients, there are studies showing that there is no complete recovery. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in hypothyroid rats on spatial and recognition memory, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta load and compare these effects with T3 replacement. Hypothyroidism was induced and maintained by administration of 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) with their drinking water to 6-weeks-old male Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 weeks. The animals exercised in the treadmill according to the HIIT protocol for four weeks. T3 was injected intraperitoneally daily during the last two weeks of the study. All animals performed in the elevated plus maze test, Morris water maze test, novel object recognition test, and rotarod motor performance test in the last week of the study and then the animals were sacrificed. Amyloid beta (1-42) and TNF alpha levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus by ELISA. Anxiety-like behaviors did not significantly differ between groups. T3 replacement with or without HIIT increased motor performance in PTU-treated rats. HIIT and/or T3 replacement increased the exercise performance. HIIT and/or T3 replacement alleviated spatial and recognition memory impairments and normalized TNF alpha and amyloid-beta levels in the hippocampus in hypothyroid rats. In summary, regular physical exercise may have potential benefits in preserving cognitive functions in hypothyroid patients.

AB  - Featured Application The study showed the possibility of producing innovative vegetarian yoghurt products with plant-based ingredients, such as a soya beverage with symbiotic lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid bacteria starter cultures. This opens the way for the future development of functional cow's milk-soya fermented products, such as yoghurts, which combine the effects of both lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid bacteria. Many diet trends have emerged over the last few years, including plant-based diets with soya as an important component, while fermented milk beverages have been an integral part of the human diet for thousands of years. However, there is little research on the potential of using propionic bacteria for dairy or plant-based food fermentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of soy beverage addition and propionic bacterium application on the quality of dairy yoghurt products. Three variants of the products-based on cow's milk, soya beverages, and mixtures of both-were prepared and then fermented with yoghurt bacteria, propionic bacteria or a mixture thereof. It was found that it is possible to obtain functional yoghurt products based on cow's milk, as well as milk-soya blends, using a mixture of yoghurt and propionic cultures. The resulting milk, milk-soya, and soya yoghurt products displayed pH values in the correct range and a stable bacterial population during refrigerated storage for 21 days. The refrigerated storage time and the type of culture starter used significantly determined the quality characteristics of the milk, milk-soya and soya yoghurt products, such as their firmness, adhesiveness, and water-holding capacity.

AB  - Astaxanthin (AST) is a natural compound derived from shellfish, microorganisms, and algae, with several healthy properties. For this reason, it is widely used in the diet of humans and animals, such as pigs, broilers, and fish, where its addition is related to its pigmenting properties. Moreover, AST's ability to reduce free radicals and protect cells from oxidative damage finds application during the weaning period, when piglets are exposed to several stressors. To better elucidate the mechanisms involved, here we generate ad hoc pig and rainbow trout in vitro platforms able to mimic the intestinal mucosa. The morphology is validated through histological and molecular analysis, while functional properties of the newly generated intestinal barriers, both in porcine and rainbow trout models, are demonstrated by measuring trans-epithelial electrical resistance and analyzing permeability with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. Exposure to AST induced a significant upregulation of antioxidative stress markers and a reduction in the transcription of inflammation-related interleukins. Altogether, the present findings demonstrate AST's ability to interact with the molecular pathways controlling oxidative stress and inflammation both in the porcine and rainbow trout species and suggest AST's positive role in prevention and health.

AB  - Plant-derived products have great potential to develop novel cancer preventive and therapeutic agents. Himalayan region is known for its vast reserve of natural resources. The present study was planned with the objective to explore the anticancer potential of plants of Himalayan region. Total twenty lyophilized plant extracts were prepared after extraction with 70% ethanol. All plant extracts were evaluated for percent cytotoxicity against LC-540 Leydig Cell Testicular Tumor cell line (rats) at various concentration levels (20, 50, 100 and 200 mu g/mL) and at different exposure time (24, 48, 72 h). The results revealed that the aqua-ethanolic extract of leaves of Camellia sinensis exhibited maximum anticancer activity among all twenty extracts screened, with 42.74 +/- 4.63% and 68 +/- 1.74% cytotoxicity at 100 and 200 mu g/mL concentration respectively, followed by Lantana camara, Tinospora cordifolia and Cedrus deodara. Further exploration of in vivo antineoplastic effects and probable mechanism of action of its potent phyto-constituents could be highly useful in developing an effective herbal formulation in cancer therapeutics.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of GnRH at insemination on lambing performance of Kazak ewes. Oestrus was synchronized in 774 adult Kazak ewes using an intravaginal sponge impregnated with flurogestone acetate. The sponge was left in the vagina for 12 days followed with an injection of 330 IU of eCG at sponge removal. Each ewe was inseminated twice at 48 h and 60 h after sponge removal. The treatment group (n = 387) was intramuscularly injected at the first insemination with a dose of 25 mu g GnRH and the control group (n = 387) with saline solution. The results showed that GnRH administration significantly decreased the fertility rate. In addition, significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the twin birth rate, the abortion rate and the litter size. In conclusion, GnRH administration at insemination was not recommended in Kazak ewes undergoing the fixed time artificial insemination during the breeding season. The breed may be a critical determinant of the potential for the exploitation of GnRH application in sheep breeding programmes.

AB  - Testosterone has a dualistic effect in males by promoting sexual ornamentation at the cost of immune defence. This trade-off has been demonstrated in several taxa, such that males often host a greater parasite burden compared with female conspecifics. We suppressed testosterone in wild male eastern grey kangaroos ( Macropus giganteus) for 10 weeks using a novel gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine, Bopriva. We evaluated the impact of testosterone suppression on testes width, parameters of health, tick and worm burden in kangaroos using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design. Given the potential impact of animal movement on parasite burden, core area use of a subset of males was also determined. Bopriva significantly reduced testosterone in male kangaroos as well as reducing the combined size of testes by 9.6% (P = 0.01). There was no detectable effect of testosterone suppression on parasite burden and core area use in Treated kangaroos compared to Control (placebo) and Before treatment animals. Our results suggest that a duration of suppression longer than 10 weeks may be required to observe changes in parasite burden. Overall, this study provides a suitable framework for future studies to test whether reproductive hormones influence energy allocation, parasitism, and reproductive strategies in marsupials.

AB  - Simple Summary Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome is a viral disease that causes significant economic losses in many countries worldwide. In this study, we employed a fast, inexpensive, target-specific next-generation sequencing method that can be used for both laboratory diagnosis and epidemiologic monitoring of the disease. We found the protocol to be highly sensitive and potentially effective on clinical serum samples. The method is suitable for the detection of mixed infections and provides a preliminary insight into the microevolution of the causative virus in affected swine herds.Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major concern worldwide. Control of PRRSV is a challenging task due to various factors, including the viral diversity and variability. In this study, we evaluated an amplicon library preparation protocol targeting the ORF7 region of both PRRSV species, Betaarterivirus suid 1 and Betaarterivirus suid 2. We designed tailed primers for a two-step PCR procedure that generates ORF7-specific amplicon libraries suitable for use on Illumina sequencers. We tested the method with serum samples containing common laboratory strains and with pooled serum samples (n = 15) collected from different pig farms during 2019-2021 in Hungary. Testing spiked serum samples showed that the newly designed method is highly sensitive and detects the viral RNA even at low copy numbers (corresponding to approx. Ct 35). The ORF7 sequences were easily assembled even from clinical samples. Two different sequence variants were identified in five samples, and the Porcilis MLV vaccine strain was identified as the minor variant in four samples. An in-depth analysis of the deep sequencing results revealed numerous polymorphic sites along the ORF7 gene in a total of eight samples, and some sites (positions 12, 165, 219, 225, 315, 345, and 351) were found to be common in several clinical specimens. We conclude that amplicon deep sequencing of a highly conserved region of the PRRSV genome could support both laboratory diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance of the disease.

AB  - Depression is a serious mood disease that causes global impairment and mortality. In traditional Chinese medicine, herb compounds decoction with Gardenia jasminoides (GJ) as the main ingredient to treat depression has a history of hundreds of years in East Asian countries. Although the antidepressant effect of GJ has been well established, the antidepressant effect and target of its main component Genipin-1-b-D-gentiobioside (GG) remain unknown. In the present study, using a mouse chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model, we first examined the antidepressant effectiveness of GG. Next, we identified potential target proteins of GG in brain tissue using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), and we intersected these targets with databases of depression targets to obtain GG's antidepressant protein targets. Finally, Prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) was initially confirmed as a potential antidepressant target of GG in brain tissue by molecular docking and biolayer interferometry (BLI). The results showed that GG administration reduced depression-like behavior in CUMS mice and increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Subsequently, there was an overlapping protein target between LC-MS-based DARTS and the databases of depression targets. Finally, molecular docking and BLI kinetic analysis indicated that GG specifically bound to PREP. According to the aforementioned research, PREP is a potential antidepressant protein target of GG in the brain. This conclusion could offer a chemical and biological foundation for future research on treating depression by focusing on PREP.

AB  - Apigenin, as a natural flavonoid present in several plants is characterized with potential anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies proposed that apigenin affects depression disorder through unknown mechanistic pathways. The effects of apigenin's anti-depressive properties on streptozocin-mediated depression have been investigated through the evaluation of behavioral tests, oxidative stress, cellular energy homeostasis and inflammatory responses. The results demonstrated anti-depressive properties of apigenin in behavioral test including forced swimming and splash tests and oxidative stress biomarkers such as reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant power and coenzyme Q(10) levels. Apigenin, also, demonstrated its regulatory potency in cellular energy homeostasis and immune system gene expression through inhibiting Nlrp3 and Tlr4 overexpression. Furthermore, failure in energy production as the key factor in various psychiatric disorders was reversed by apigenin modulating effect on AMPK gene expression. Overall, 20 mg/kg of apigenin was recognized as the dose suitable for minimizing the undesirable adverse effects in the STZ-mediated depression model proposed in this study. Our data suggested that apigenin could be able to adjust behavioral dysfunction, biochemical biomarkers and recovered cellular antioxidant level in depressed animals. The surprising results were achieved by raise in COQ(10) level, which could regulate the overexpression of the AMPK gene in stressful conditions. The regulatory effect of apigenin in inflammatory signaling pathways such as Nlrp3, and Tlr4 gene expression was studied at the surface part of the hippocampus.

AB  - Sigurdson (1991) erected the monospecific genus Murphydoris to include the species Murphydoris singaporensis. This species differed from the rest of the genera in Goniodorididae by the lack of lamellae on the rhinophores and gill branches around the anus. Since its original description, Murphydoris singaporensis has only been found in Singapore and Thailand. Recently, the paratypes of Murphydoris singaporensis were studied and compared with remaining type species of Goniodorididae, showing that the apomorphies of the genus were unclear and some undescribed species reported as Goniodoridella could belong to Murphydoris. In this study, we examined four undescribed species from the Indo-Pacific region. The internal anatomy was studied by dissections, and electron microscope photographs are included to show details of their radulae, labial cuticles and penises. One specimen was also studied under micro-computed tomography. In addition, mitochondrial and nuclear partial sequences of the species were obtained. As a result, we describe in detail four new species of Murphydoris: M. adusta sp. nov., M. cobbi sp. nov., M. maracabranchia sp. nov. and M. puncticulata sp. nov. We additionally present the first phylogenetic tree that includes sequences of Murphydoris.

AB  - Introduction Herbivorous insects, including the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, are among the most damaging pests to agricultural crops worldwide, particularly rice. These insects employ a variety of strategies to overcome plant defenses, including the secretion of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that degrade plant cell walls. While CAZymes are well-studied in other insect species, their role in BPH virulence remains largely unexplored.Methods This study aims to address this gap by analyzing CAZymes in 182 insect genomes, followed by a detailed genomic and transcriptomic analysis of BPH.Results We identified 644 CAZymes in BPH, including enzymes related to plant cell wall degradation. Through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and subcellular localization experiments, we found that 5 candidate genes exhibited increased expression during feeding on the susceptible rice variety TN1, a well-characterized variety highly susceptible to BPH and these genes were localized to the plasma membrane. Our results suggest that BPH CAZymes play a critical role in the insect's ability to feed and damage rice plants.Discussion This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying insect adaptation and virulence in the co-evolutionary process between plants and herbivorous insects. By exploring the function of pest-related genes in the BPH and examining their differential responses in rice varieties with varying resistance to BPH, we aim to contribute to the development of targeted pest management strategies.

AB  - Premise Plants experiencing steep reproductive losses from herbivores should favor strategies promoting tolerance or resistance to that herbivory. However, the degree to which such strategies succeed in improving plant fitness under natural conditions needs further evaluation, especially for iterocarpic species. We tested whether reproductive effort by the iterocarpic Cirsium undulatum Spreng. (Wavyleaf thistle) provided within-season tolerance for floral herbivory through response to apical damage. Methods We imposed apical damage and manipulated floral herbivory on later-flowering, non-apical flowerheads for two seasons. We asked: (1) is there evidence of compensatory potential to tolerate apical flowerhead damage? If so, (2) does the amount of herbivore pressure on non-apical flowerheads influence the magnitude of any compensatory response; and (3) is the response to apical damage sufficient to increase plant seed production under ambient floral herbivory over the flowering season? Results Plants showed compensatory potential for apical head loss; apical damage increased seed contributions from later, lower positioned flowerheads. Further, the intensity of subsequent herbivore pressure influenced compensation outcomes. Equitable seed production under both levels of ambient herbivory occurred only in the year in which plants were larger and insect pressure was lower. Finally, the response to apical damage was sufficient to compensate for apical seed loss, but it did not consistently increase overall annual seed production under ambient floral herbivory. Conclusions Although this iterocarpic species can compensate for apical damage, tolerance for floral herbivory varied between years.

AB  - Background: Aflatoxin B1, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and kill neural cells, can contaminate traditional herbal medicines, posing a significant risk to human health. The present study examined cellular, cognitive and behavioral consequences of aflatoxin B1 contamination of the anti-osteoporotic medicine Radix Dipsaci. Methods: A mouse model of osteoporosis was created by treating the animals with all-trans-retinoic acid. Then the animals were treated intragastically with water decoctions of Radix Dipsaci that contained detectable aflatoxin B1 or not. The animals were compared in terms of mineral density and mineral salt content of bone, production of pro-inflammatory factors, neurogenesis and microglial activation in hippocampus, as well as behavior and cognitive function. Results: Contamination of Radix Dipsaci with aflatoxin B1 significantly reduced the medicine's content of bioactive saponins. It destroyed the ability of the herbal decoction to improve mineral density and mineral salt content in the bones of diseased mice, and it induced the production of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Aflatoxin B1 contamination inhibited formation of new neurons and increased the proportion of activated microglia in the hippocampus. These neurological changes were associated with anhedonia, behavioral despair, and deficits in short-term memory and social memory. Conclusion: Contamination of Radix Dipsaci with aflatoxin B1 not only eliminates the herbal decoction's antiosteoporotic effects, but it also induces neurotoxicity that can lead to cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities. Such contamination should be avoided through tightly regulated production and quality control of medicinal herbs.

AB  - Pig-to-human xenotransplantation seems to be the response to the contemporary shortage of tissue/organ donors. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic distance between pig and human implies hyperacute xenograft rejection. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that combining expression of human alpha 1,2-fucosyltransferase (hFUT2) and alpha-galactosidase A (hGLA) genes would allow for removal of this obstacle in porcine transgenic epidermal keratinocytes (PEKs). We sought to determine not only the expression profiles of recombinant human alpha 1,2-fucosyltransferase (rh alpha 1,2-FT) and alpha-galactosidase A (rh alpha-Gal A) proteins, but also the relative abundance (RA) of Gal alpha 1 -> 3Gal epitopes in the PEKs stemming from not only hFUT2 or hGLA single-transgenic and hFUT2xhGLA double-transgenic pigs. Our confocal microscopy and Western blotting analyses revealed that both rh alpha 1,2-FT and rh alpha-Gal A enzymes were overabundantly expressed in respective transgenic PEK lines. Moreover, the semiquantitative levels of Gal alpha 1 -> 3Gal epitope that were assessed by lectin fluorescence and lectin blotting were found to be significantly diminished in each variant of genetically modified PEK line as compared to those observed in the control nontransgenic PEKs. Notably, the bi-transgenic PEKs were characterized by significantly lessened (but still detectable) RAs of Gal alpha 1 -> 3Gal epitopes as compared to those identified for both types of mono-transgenic PEK lines. Additionally, our current investigation showed that the coexpression of two protective transgenes gave rise to enhanced abrogation of Gal alpha -> 3Gal epitopes in hFUT2xhGLA double-transgenic PEKs. To summarize, detailed estimation of semiquantitative profiles for human alpha-1,2-FT and alpha-Gal A proteins followed by identification of the extent of abrogating the abundance of Gal alpha 1 -> 3Gal epitopes in the ex vivo expanded PEKs stemming from mono- and bi-transgenic pigs were found to be a sine qua non condition for efficiently ex situ protecting stable lines of skin-derived somatic cells inevitable in further studies. The latter is due to be focused on determining epigenomic reprogrammability of single- or double-transgenic cell nuclei inherited from adult cutaneous keratinocytes in porcine nuclear-transferred oocytes and corresponding cloned embryos. To our knowledge, this concept was shown to represent a completely new approach designed to generate and multiply genetically transformed pigs by somatic cell cloning for the needs of reconstructive medicine and dermoplasty-mediated tissue engineering of human integumentary system.

AB  - Depression in Parkinson's disease (dPD) is a prevalent comorbidity significantly impairing patients' quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of neuroinflammation in dPD pathogenesis, particularly the interaction between neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated in mood regulation and neuroinflammatory processes, yet its role in modulating pyroptosis and microglial polarization remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization in dPD pathogenesis and explore the regulation of 5-HT on these processes. A C57BL/6 mouse model of dPD was established using injected intraperitoneally of rotenone to observe changes in body weight, sucrose preference, and exercise time. ELISA and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of relevant proteins and cytokines in the hippocampus. Co-culture experiments with HT22 and BV2 cells were conducted to explore the effect of 5-HT on neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization. Rotenone-induced dPD in mice led to reduced body weight, sucrose preference, and activity, accompanied by upregulation of pyroptosis markers (NLRP1, N-GSDMD, Cleaved-caspase-1) and increased M1 microglial polarization. Treatment with 5-HT and the pyroptosis inhibitor Pep19-2.5 reversed these changes, mitigating neuronal pyroptosis and shifting microglial polarization towards a less inflammatory profile. In vitro, 5-HTP suppressed LPS-induced neuronal pyroptosis, reducing TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-18 levels and oxidative stress while preserving microglial viability. The 5-HT inhibitor Scopolamine abolished these effects. Neuronal pyroptosis and M1 microglial polarization contribute critically to dPD pathogenesis. By inhibiting these processes, 5-HT emerges as a promising therapeutic target for managing dPD, offering new insights into its treatment mechanisms.

AB  - Studies on the system-scale pathogenesis of Listeria monocytogenes infection have classically focused on its ability to colonize in the intestines following an exposure event. However, despite this, many of the most dangerous complications arising from L. monocytogenes infection are observed days, weeks, or months after exposure, resulting indirectly from bacteria escaping this intestinal colonization hub and invading other organs. Over time, findings of various individual phenomena observed during systemic infection have accumulated, including a shift away from the principal route of intestinal dissemination, delays in bacterial colonization of the central nervous system, differing bacterial flux rates across organs, and multi-stability of bacterial population levels. To further our quantitative understanding of foodborne bacterial infection dynamics, a compartmental model of systemic infection that synthesizes these findings is proposed. Under parameterization to infection in BALB/c mice, the model is used to show a substantial decrease in bacterial populations resulting from dissemination through the mesenteric lymph nodes, as compared to the portal vein, when controlling for the number of bacteria passing through each route. Due to the compartmental nature of this model, we anticipate that this result maybe paralleled in other microbes which make use of these pathways to escape the intestinal environment. Additionally, we predict thresholds for intestinal dissemination along each of these routes, which must be surpassed to induce systemic infection, and describe how these thresholds change over time. Supplementarily, logistic curves are fitted to synthetic data as a means of robustly quantifying the dose-response relationship beyond the intestinal barrier.

AB  - Introduction: Broussonetia papyrifera is a dioecious plant that is rich in various metabolites and widely distribute in Asia. Microtus fortis is a rodent that often causes damage to crops, especially in the Dongting Lake region of China. There is a wide overlap in the distribution areas for the above species and the M. fortis feeds on the leaves of the B. papyrifera. Preliminary experiments have shown that the reproduction of M. fortis is inhibited after feeding on the leaves of the B. papyrifera. Methods: In order to explore the potential of using B. papyrifera to develop botanical pesticides, we investigated the palatability and reactive substances. The feeding frequency of M. fortis on B. papyrifera leaves to that of on daily fodder and Carex brevicuspis that is the primary food for the wild population were compared. We also attempted to identify the responsive substances in B. papyrifera leaves that were bitten by M. fortis using metabolome analysis. Results: In general, B. papyrifera leaves exhibited a stronger attraction to M. fortis. M. fortis foraged B. papyrifera leaves more frequently, and the intake was higher than that of the other two. Differential metabolites were screened by comparing normal leaves and leaves bitten by M. fortis, meanwhile with the intervention of clipped leaves. A total of 269 substances were screened, and many of these were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including terpenoids and alkaloids. These substances may be related to the defense mechanism of B. papyrifera against herbivores. Discussion: These findings support further research examining animal-plant interactions and simultaneously provide insights into the utilisation of B. papyrifera resources and the management of rodents. The good palatability and the defense of B. papyrifera leaves suggest that they have the potential to contribute in development of plant rodenticide.

AB  - Cotton is the major natural fiber-producing crop, contributing significantly to the global textile economy. However, the cotton crop encounters several biotic and abiotic stress challenges globally, causing substantial annual yield loss. Plant responses to such diverse stress conditions involve intricate molecular and physiological modifications at the cellular level. Here, we employed a genomics approach to illustrate comprehensive spatial transcriptomic profiles in response to various insect infestations, including aphids (Aphis gossypii), cotton boll weevils (Anthonomus grandis), cotton bollworms (Helicoverpa armigera), whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), and drought stress. Comparative temporal expression analysis with a strict log-fold change threshold (> 2.0) revealed distinct gene expression patterns in different tissues of cotton plants, with selected pivotal 'stress-general' and 'stress-specific' genes involved in plant defense mechanisms against various infestations and drought conditions. The expression of at least 5 insect-general transcription factor-encoding genes, WRKY28, WRKY40, WRKY53, ERF4, and ERF5, was highly upregulated across cotton leaf tissues infested by aphids, cotton bollworms, and whiteflies. Additionally, a set of highly upregulated 'stress-specific' genes, including GH3.1, ACS1, CYP74A, TIFY10A, BHLH25, ABR1, and ERF025, were identified especially after a 6-h period of cotton bollworm infestation. Similarly, various sets of such 'stress-specific' spatially upregulated genes were identified across diverse insect infestations. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes revealed the upregulation of various defense-related functions such as stress hormone signal transduction, MAPK signaling pathway, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, orchestrating the plant's defense mechanisms. Further, spatiotemporal expression analysis of 'stress-general' genes in response to abiotic stresses revealed that GhWRKY28 was highly upregulated in response to both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. The findings suggested that the identified 'stress-general' genes could serve as suitable candidates for manipulating crops for multiple stress resistance/tolerance.

AB  - Plants face attackers aboveground and belowground. Insect root herbivores can lead to severe crop losses, yet the underlying transcriptomic responses have rarely been studied. We studied the dynamics of the transcriptomic response of Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera) primary roots to feeding damage by cabbage root fly larvae (Delia radicum), alone or in combination with aboveground herbivory by cabbage aphids (Brevicoryne brassicae) or diamondback moth caterpillars (Plutella xylostella). This was supplemented with analyses of phytohormones and the main classes of secondary metabolites; aromatic, indole and aliphatic glucosinolates. Root herbivory leads to major transcriptomic rearrangement that is modulated by aboveground feeding caterpillars, but not aphids, through priming soon after root feeding starts. The root herbivore downregulates aliphatic glucosinolates. Knocking out aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis with CRISPR-Cas9 results in enhanced performance of the specialist root herbivore, indicating that the herbivore downregulates an effective defence. This study advances our understanding of how plants cope with root herbivory and highlights several novel aspects of insect-plant interactions for future research. Further, our findings may help breeders develop a sustainable solution to a devastating root pest.

AB  - Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most abundant volatiles in tea plants and have dual functions in aroma quality formation and defense responses in tea plants. Terpene synthases (TPS) are the key enzymes for the synthesis of terpenes in plants; however, the functions of most of them in tea plants are still unknown. In this study, six putative terpene biosynthesis gene clusters were identified from the tea plant genome. Then we cloned three new TPS-b subfamily genes, CsTPS08, CsTPS10 and CsTPS58. In vitro enzyme assays showed that CsTPS08 and CsTPS58 are two multiple-product terpene synthases, with the former synthesizing linalool as the main product, and beta-myrcene, alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinolene, D-limonene, cis-beta-ocimene, trans-beta-ocimene and (4E,6Z)allo-ocimene as minor products are also detected, while the latter catalyzing the formation of alpha-pinene and Dlimonene using GPP as the substrate. No product of CsTPS10 was detected in the prokaryotic expression system, but geraniol production was detected when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. CsTPS08 and CsTPS10 are two functional members of a monoterpene synthase gene cluster, which were significantly induced during both Ectropis oblique feeding and fresh leaf spreading treatments, suggesting that they have dual functions involved in tea plant pest defense and tea aroma quality regulation. In addition, the differences in their expression levels in different tea plant cultivars provide a possibility for the subsequent screening of tea plant resources with a specific aroma flavor. Our results deepen the understanding of terpenoid synthesis in tea plants.

AB  - Dioecious plants are obligate outcrossers with separate male and female individuals, which can result in decreased seed set with increasing distance between the sexes. Wind pollination is a common correlate of dioecy, yet combined wind and insect pollination (ambophily) could be advantageous in compensating for decreased pollen flow to isolated females. Dioecious, ambophilous gymnosperms Ephedra (Gnetales) secrete pollination drops (PDs) in female cones that capture airborne pollen and attract ants that feed on them. Plant sugary secretions commonly reward ants in exchange for indirect plant defense against herbivores, and more rarely for pollination. We conducted field experiments to investigate whether ants are pollinators and/or plant defenders of South American Ephedra triandra, and whether their contribution to seed set and seed cone protection varies with distance between female and male plants. We quantified pollen flow in the wind and assessed the effectiveness of ants as pollinators by investigating their relative contribution to seed set, and their visitation rate in female plants at increasing distance from the nearest male. Ants accounted for most insect visits to female cones of E. triandra, where they consumed PDs, and pollen load was larger on bigger ants without reduction in pollen viability. While wind pollination was the main contributor to seed set overall, the relative contribution of ants was distance dependent. Ant contribution to seed set was not significant at shorter distances, yet at the farthest distance from the nearest male (23 m), where 20 times less pollen reached females, ants enhanced seed set by 30% compared to plants depending solely on wind pollination. We found no evidence that ants contribute to plant defense by preventing seed cone damage. Our results suggest that, despite their short-range movements, ants can offset pollen limitation in isolated females of wind-pollinated plants with separate sexes. We propose that ants enhance plant reproductive success via targeted delivery of airborne pollen, through frequent contact with ovule tips while consuming PDs. Our study constitutes the first experimental quantification of distance-dependent contribution of ants to pollination and provides a working hypothesis for ambophily in other dioecious plants lacking pollinator reward in male plants.

AB  - Strong evidence has implicated ubiquitin signaling in the process of fear memory formation. While less abundant than ubiquitination, evidence suggests that protein SUMOylation may also be involved in fear memory formation in neurons. However, the importance of amygdala protein SUMOylation in fear memory formation has never been directly examined. Furthermore, while recent evidence indicates that males and females differ significantly in the requirement for ubiquitin signaling during fear memory formation, whether sex differences also exist in the importance of protein SUMOylation to this process remains unknown. Here we found that males and females differ in the requirement for protein SUMOylation in the amygdala during fear memory formation. Western blot analysis revealed that while females had higher resting levels of SUMOylation, both sexes showed global increases following fear conditioning. However, SUMOylation-specific proteomic analysis revealed that only females have increased targeting of individual proteins by SUMOylation following fear conditioning, some of which were heat shock proteins. This suggests that protein SUMOylation is more robustly engaged in the amygdala of females following fear conditioning. In vivo siRNA mediated knockdown of Ube2i, the coding gene for the essential E2 ligase for SUMOylation conjugation, in the amygdala impaired fear memory in males without any effect in females. Importantly, higher siRNA concentrations than what was needed to impair memory in males reduced Ube2i levels in the amygdala of females but resulted in an increase in SUMOylation levels, suggesting a compensatory effect in females that was not observed in males. Collectively, these data reveal a novel, sex-specific role for protein SUMOylation in the amygdala during fear memory formation and expand our understanding of how ubiquitin-like signaling regulates memory formation.

AB  - This study integrates analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences and morphological and acoustic data to re-evaluate the taxono-mic status of Rhinolophus rex rex, R. r. paradoxolophus and R. schnitzleri throughout their distribution ranges. Based on a dense geographic sampling of specimens hitherto referred to these taxa and contrary to the current taxonomic view, our results indicate that all examined specimens of these taxa are representatives of a single, widely distributed and morphologically variable species, R. rex. The recognition of its geographic populations as different subspecies (R. r. rex and R. r. paradoxolophus) or distinct species (R. schnitzleri) based on morphological and acoustic data should be regarded as invalid. In the light of this revision, we also reassess the conservation status of R. rex against IUCN Red List criteria as Near Threatened.

AB  - MicroRNAs are essential regulators in plant resistance to biotic stresses, but their specific roles in the plant-herbivore context require deeper investigation. Here, we studied how the Arabidopsis miR825-5p differentially modulates certain TNLs (MRT1, MRT2, and MIST1), triggering defensive responses against the sucking acari Tetranychus urticae or the chewing insect Pieris brassicae. We demonstrated that the expression of miR825-5p is downregulated following T. urticae and P. brassicae infestation and identified miRNA TNL targets whose expression is induced by both feeders. miR825-5p downregulates MRT1 and MRT2, acting as a negative modulator of Arabidopsis basal resistance against T. urticae. A similar miR825-5p-mediated regulation of basal resistance, including MRT1 and MRT2 but also MIST1 silencing, is involved in the Arabidopsis response against P. brassicae. Moreover, miR825-5p triggered the production of MIST1-derived secondary interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) and amplified silencing of MRT1 and MRT2. Taken together, our findings reveal the role of the miR825-5p/TNL module in controlling Arabidopsis response and adapting plant defenses based on the specific threat.

AB  - Plants recognize molecules related to a variety of biotic stresses through pattern recognition receptors to activate plant immunity. In the interactions between plants and chewing herbivores, such as lepidopteran larvae, oral secretions (OS) are deposited on wounded sites, which results in the elicitation of plant immune responses. The widely conserved receptor-like kinase CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) has been broadly associated with the recognition of microbial components, such as fungal chitin, but its relevance to herbivory remained unclear. In this study, we used receptor-knockout rice (Oryza sativa) and larvae of the lepidopteran pest Mythimna loreyi to demonstrate that the induction of immune responses triggered by larval OS in rice cells largely depends on CERK1 (OsCERK1). CHITIN ELICITOR-BINDING PROTEIN (CEBiP), an OsCERK1-interacting receptor-like protein that was proposed as the main chitin receptor, also contributed to the responses of rice cells to OS collected from three different lepidopteran species. Furthermore, CEBiP knockout rice seedlings showed lower OS-triggered accumulation of jasmonic acid. These results strongly suggest that the OsCERK1 and CEBiP recognize a particular OS component in chewing lepidopteran herbivores, and point toward the presence of chitooligosaccharides in the OS. Targeted perturbation to chitin recognition, through the use of fungal effector proteins, confirmed the presence of chitooligosaccharides in the OS. Treatments of wounds on rice plants with chitooligosaccharides enhanced a set of immune responses, leading to resistance against an herbivorous insect. Our data show that rice recognizes chitooligosaccharides during larval herbivory to activate resistance, and identifies chitin as a novel herbivore-associated molecular pattern.

AB  - The tea mosquito bug (TMB) or Helopeltis theivora has been reported as a significant tea pest that causes major tea crop loss. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly discovered group of the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and are known to function in gene regulation process. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) has not been explored for the detection of circRNAs during pest infestation. This is the first report of circRNAs identified in C. sinensis infested by a sap-sucking insect H. theivora. In total, we identified 709 circRNAs in six RNA-seq libraries. Analysis of the differential expression pattern revealed that 34 circRNAs got upregulated/downregulated in response to H. theivora attack. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed circRNAs showed that the circRNA-target genes were enriched in biological pathways like "tryptophan metabolism", "biosynthesis of secondary metabolites", "porphyrin metabolism", "nucleocytoplasmic transport", "N-glycan biosynthesis" etc. miRNA-mediated interaction analysis of the circRNAs also showed that 17 differentially expressed circRNAs could also act as "sponges" thus masking the miRNA-mRNA binding and subsequently repressing mRNA cleavage. These differentially expressed circRNAs were predicted to have the capacity to behave as endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for potential genes like aspartyl protease, phospholipase, lectin receptor etc.

AB  - Ammonium (NH4+) is a major nitrogen source for tea plant growth. Although NH4+-induced growth of tea plants were reported, it was still unclear to elucidate the mechanism of proteins in tea plants in responding to NH4+ resupply. In the present study, the proteomic profiles of tea leaves under N deficiency/resupply were investigated by using LC-MS/MS and PRM technique. Compared with N deficiency, there were 247 and 328 proteins significantly expressed after 3 h and 3d of N resupplied, respectively. And compared with 3 h of N resupplied, there were 186 proteins significantly expressed after 3d of N resupplied. According to bioinformatics analysis, the results showed that different expressed proteins participated in various biological processes, such as PsbO, Pbs27, PsaN, and PsaF were involved in photosynthesis, ADH1, AOC3, URE, GDH1-2, and argD were involved in amino acid metabolism, CHI and ANR were involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, GSTF9, APX, and GSS were involved in glutathione metabolism, and PdxT and PdxS were involved in vitamin B6 metabolism. Through PPI analysis, the results showed that the interactions between different expressed proteins mainly occurred in the photosynthetic pathway. Ammonium supply has a profound impact on photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism.

AB  - Key message Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of fresh leaf infestation by tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda) suggests roles for alternative pre-mRNA splicing and mRNAs in the regulation of aroma formation in tea plants. Oriental Beauty is a high-grade, oolong tea with a pronounced honey-like aroma and rich ripe fruit flavor that develops primarily as a result of the infestation of the fresh leaves by tea green leafhoppers (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda). Here, we used PacBio Iso-Seq and RNA-seq analyses to determine the full-length transcripts and gene expression profiles of fresh tea leaves in response to E. (M.) onukii herbivory. We investigated the relationship between RNA-seq, tea metabolites, and aroma response mechanisms in leaves infested by leafhoppers. We found 3644 differentially expressed genes, of which 2552 were up- and 1092 were down-regulated. A total of 49,913 alternative splicing events were predicted, including 324 differential AS events. Moreover, 3105 differentially expressed transcripts were also identified, of which 2295 were up- and 810 were down-regulated. The characterization of expression patterns of the key gene transcript isoforms involved in the aroma formation pathways identified 130 differentially expressed metabolites, 97 of which were up- and 33 were down-regulated. Two key aroma compounds (phenylacetaldehyde and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) were highly correlated with genes of the aroma formation pathways. Our results revealed that pre-mRNA AS plays a crucial role in the metabolic regulation surrounding aroma formation under leafhopper herbivory in tea plants.

AB  - Artificial milk feeding in fattening lambs would promote the functionality of the reticular groove reflex in order to avoid the rumen fermentation of selected feed supplements included in the milk replacer. However, there is a lack of information of the behavioural and welfare effects of such practice. Therefore, we studied the effects of extending or not milk replacer feeding during fattening with a high concentrate diet on the behaviour of 16 non castrated male lambs of the Manchega breed (eight lambs were in the group that were fed daily a bottle of milk, and the other eight were in the fully weaned group) by means of a video recording system. Both groups consumed the same solid diet (concentrate plus cereal straw) and were kept under the same conditions. Weaned lambs showed longer resting episodes and a higher frequency of self-grooming, whereas unweaned lambs showed a higher frequency of interaction behaviour. From the interpretation of such behaviours in the conditions of the present study, we concluded that the welfare status was almost similar in both groups.
   There is a lack of information on the behavioural and welfare effects of sustaining artificial milk feeding in fattening lambs. Therefore, the present work aimed to study the effects of prolonged artificial milk feeding during fattening with a high concentrate diet on the behaviour of lambs. The behaviour of 16 non castrated male lambs of the Manchega sheep breed (eight lambs were in the group that were fed daily a bottle of milk, and the other eight were in the weaned group) was recorded with four fixed cameras just before bottle feeding (similar to 8:30 a.m.) of the unweaned group till four hours later, every day for 7 weeks. The solid diet (pelleted concentrate plus cereal straw) and housing conditions were the same in both groups. Solid feeds were offered ad libitum. There were no differences between groups in time spent eating nor in drinking, playing, scratching and oral activity behaviours (p > 0.05), but resting episodes were longer in weaned lambs (p < 0.05). Weaned lambs presented a higher frequency of self-grooming behaviour (p < 0.05), while the unweaned group performed a higher frequency of interaction behaviour (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the behaviours of lambs that were fed daily a bottle of milk during the fattening period did not substantially differ from the weaned individuals.

AB  - The striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis, SSB) is a highly destructive insect pest in rice (Oryza sativa). SSB oral secretions (OSs) can induce plant defense responses in rice. However, the specific effectors in SSB OSs that mediate these interactions with rice remain poorly understood. In this study, hallmarks of ferroptosis-like plant defense response, such as the reprogramming of ferroptosis-related genes, reduced glutathione levels, accumulation of ferric ion, and enhanced lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), were detected in rice subjected to SSB infestation and SSB OSs treatment. Furthermore, we identified and characterized a protein from SSB OSs, the ferritin CsFer1, which plays a critical role in the regulation of plant iron homoeostasis. CsFer1 was shown to possess Fe2+ binding capacity and ferroxidase activity. Through recombinant CsFer1 protein treatment, overexpression of CsFer1 in rice and SSB larvae with silencing CsFer1 feeding in rice, we found that CsFer1 helped maintain iron homoeostasis under SSB infestation, suppressing H2O2 and JA accumulation, ultimately compromising rice resistance to herbivorous pests. Moreover, such a phenomenon about the regulation of iron homoeostasis and suppression of insect resistance was observed in the CsFer1 overexpressed tobacco. Collectively, these findings suggest that CsFer1 functions as an effector involved in the regulation of iron homoeostasis- and lipid peroxidation-related plant defense during plant-insect interaction.

AB  - Polyamines (PAs) are ubiquitous low-molecular-weight aliphatic polycations in all living organisms, which are crucial for plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The role of PAs in plant disease resistance has been well documented. However, their involvement in plant-pest interactions remains unclear. Here, the role of PAs in rice against striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis Walker), a destructive pest in rice production worldwide, was investigated. SSB larval infestation led to a substantial accumulation of free putrescine (Put) in rice seedlings, which was in parallel with an elevated expression of host PA biosynthesis genes Arginine Decarboxylase1 (ADC1) and ADC2. Moreover, SSB larval oral secretion application with wounding further raised the transcripts of ADC1 and ADC2 in rice compared with wounding treatment alone. The larval growth on both rice plants and artificial diet was promoted by the exogenous application of PA and inhibited by a PA biosynthesis inhibitor. On the other hand, the rice defense responses, including polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities, as well as protease inhibitor level, were enhanced by a Put supplement and reduced by an ADC inhibitor. Our results indicate that SSB herbivory triggers polyamine accumulation in host rice plants, which is beneficial to SSB in rice-SSB interaction.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient element for plant growth, and deficiency of inorganic phosphate (Pi) limits plant growth and yield. Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) is an important fodder crop cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical areas throughout the world. However, the mechanisms underlying efficient P use in elephant grass under Pi deficiency remain poorly understood. In this study, the physiological and molecular responses of elephant grass leaves and roots to Pi deficiency were investigated. The results showed that dry weight, total P concentration, and P content decreased in Pi-deprived plants, but that acid phosphatase activity and P utilization efficiency (PUE) were higher than in Pi-sufficient plants. Regarding Pi starvation-responsive (PSR) genes, transcriptomics showed that 59 unigenes involved in Pi acquisition and transport (especially 18 purple acid phosphatase and 27 phosphate transporter 1 unigenes) and 51 phospholipase unigenes involved in phospholipids degradation or Pi-free lipids biosynthesis, as well as 47 core unigenes involved in the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, were significantly up-regulated by Pi deprivation in leaves or roots. Furthermore, 43 unigenes related to Pi-independent- or inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent bypass reactions were markedly up-regulated in Pi-deficient leaves, especially five UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and 15 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase unigenes. Consistent with PSR unigene expression changes, metabolomics revealed that Pi deficiency significantly increased metabolites of Pi-free lipids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids in leaves and roots, but decreased phospholipid metabolites. This study reveals the mechanisms underlying the responses to Pi starvation in elephant grass leaves and roots, which provides candidate unigenes involved in efficient P use and theoretical references for the development of P-efficient elephant grass varieties.

AB  - Initiation of plant immune signaling requires recognition of conserved molecular patterns from microbes and herbivores by plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors. Additionally, plants produce and secrete numerous small peptide hormones, termed phytocytokines, which act as secondary danger signals to modulate immunity. In Arabidopsis, the Brassicae-specific SERINE RICH ENDOGENOUS PEPTIDE (SCOOP) family consists of 14 members that are perceived by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2). Recognition of SCOOP peptides elicits generic early signaling responses but knowledge on how and if SCOOPs modulate specific downstream immune defenses is limited. We report here that depletion of MIK2 or the single PROSCOOP12 precursor results in decreased Arabidopsis resistance against the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis but not the specialist Pieris brassicae. Increased performance of S. littoralis on mik2-1 and proscoop12 is accompanied by a diminished accumulation of jasmonic acid, jasmonate-isoleucine and indolic glucosinolates. Additionally, we show transcriptional activation of the PROSCOOP gene family in response to insect herbivory. Our data therefore indicate that perception of endogenous SCOOP peptides by MIK2 modulates the jasmonate pathway and thereby contributes to enhanced defense against a generalist herbivore.

AB  - Phytohormone, particularly jasmonate (JA) and salicylate (SA) signaling, plays a central role in plant responses to herbivore and pathogen attack. Generally, SA mediates resistance responses against biotrophic pathogens and phloem-feeding insects, while JA mediates responses against necrotrophic pathogens and chewing insects. The phytohormonal responses mediating rice resistance to a piercing-sucking herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH), remains unknown.
   Here, we combined transcriptome analysis, hormone measurements, genetic analysis and a field study to address this issue.
   Infestation by BPH adult females resulted in significant transcriptional reprograming. The upregulated genes were enriched in the JA signaling pathway. Consistently, the concentrations of JAs, but not SA, were dramatically increased in response to BPH attack. Two JA-deficient lines (AOC and MYC2 knockout) and two SA-deficient lines (nahG overexpression and NPR1 knockout) were constructed. BPH performed better on JA-deficient lines than on wild-type (WT) plants, but similarly on SA-deficient and WT plants. During BPH attack, the accumulation of defensive secondary metabolites was attenuated in JA-deficient lines compared with WT plants. Moreover, MYC2 mutants were more susceptible to planthoppers than WT plants in nature.
   This study reveals that JA signaling functions in rice defense against BPH.

AB  - Porcine pluripotent stem cells had been derived from different culture systems. PeNK6 is a porcine pluripotent stem cell line that we established from an E5.5 embryo in a defined culture system. Signaling pathways related with pluripotency had been assessed in this cell line, and TGF-beta signaling pathway-related genes were found upregulated significantly. In this study, we elucidated the role of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in PeNK6 through adding small molecule inhibitors, SB431542 (KOSB) or A83-01 (KOA), into the original culture medium (KO) and analyzing the expression and activity of key factors involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. In KOSB/KOA medium, the morphology of PeNK6 became compact and the nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio was increased. The expression of the core transcription factor SOX2 was significantly upregulated compared with cell lines in the control KO medium, and the differentiation potential became balanced among three germ layers rather than bias to neuroectoderm/endoderm as the original PeNK6 did. The results indicated that inhibition of TGF-beta has positive effects on the porcine pluripotency. Based on these results, we established a pluripotent cell line (PeWKSB) from E5.5 blastocyst by employing TGF-beta inhibitors, and the cell line showed improved pluripotency.

AB  - Plant domestication often alters plant traits, including chemical and physical defenses against herbivores. In squash, domestication leads to reduced levels of cucurbitacins and leaf trichomes, influencing interactions with insects. However, the impact of domestication on inducible defenses in squash remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the chemical and physical defensive traits of wild and domesticated squash (Cucurbita argyrosperma), and compared their responses to belowground and aboveground infestation by the root-feeding larvae and the leaf-chewing adults of the banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Wild populations contained cucurbitacins in roots and cotyledons but not in leaves, whereas domesticated varieties lacked cucurbitacins in all tissues. Belowground infestation by D. balteata larvae did not increase cucurbitacin levels in the roots but triggered the expression of cucurbitacin biosynthetic genes, irrespective of domestication status, although the response varied among different varieties. Conversely, whereas wild squash had more leaf trichomes than domesticated varieties, the induction of leaf trichomes in response to herbivory was greater in domesticated plants. Leaf herbivory varied among varieties but there was a trend of higher leaf damage on wild squash than domesticated varieties. Overall, squash plants responded to both belowground and aboveground herbivory by activating chemical defense-associated gene expression in roots and upregulating their physical defense in leaves, respectively. While domestication suppressed both chemical and physical defenses, our findings suggest that it may enhance inducible defense mechanisms by increasing trichome induction in response to herbivory.

AB  - Milkweed plants in agricultural landscapes throughout the United States and southern Canada are believed to be vitally important for the imperiled monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) populations. However, studies have found that these plants often assimilate a slew of pesticides from the surrounding landscape, including highly potent and widely applied neonicotinoid insecticides. This has prompted concern over the potential impacts of these compounds on monarch populations and has created a growing interest in determining the direct lethal and sublethal consequences of exposure. Fewer studies have considered how neonicotinoids may interact with milkweed defensive chemistry to indirectly influence monarch performance. Here we addressed this question by investigating whether uptake of a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, clothianidin, could alter milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) defense responses and subsequently impact monarch growth and feeding. We found that clothianidin-treated milkweed plants grew taller, and produced monarch larvae that weighed more and consumed more leaf tissue than larvae feeding on control plants. After five days of monarch herbivory, clothianidin-treated plants had higher levels of the phytohormone, jasmonic acid, but similar levels of salicylic acid relative to control plants. Neither latex nor cardenolide production was impacted by clothianidin assimilation. Overall, these findings indicate that clothianidin exposure can improve the vitality of common milkweed plants, and may subsequently impact monarch performance.

AB  - Ca2+ signaling plays crucial roles in plant stress responses, including defense against insects. To counteract insect feeding, different parts of a plant deploy systemic signaling to communicate and coordinate defense responses, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, micrografting, in vivo imaging of Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS), quantification of jasmonic acid (JA) and defensive metabolites, and bioassay were used to study how Arabidopsis seedlings regulate systemic responses in leaves after hypocotyls are wounded. We show that wounding hypocotyls rapidly activated both Ca2+ and ROS signals in leaves. RBOHD, which functions to produce ROS, along with two glutamate receptors GLR3.3 and GLR3.6, but not individually RBOHD or GLR3.3 and GLR3.6, in hypocotyls regulate the dynamics of systemic Ca2+ signals in leaves. In line with the systemic Ca2+ signals, after wounding hypocotyl, RBOHD, GLR3.3, and GLR3.6 in hypocotyl also cooperatively regulate the transcriptome, hormone jasmonic acid, and defensive secondary metabolites in leaves of Arabidopsis seedlings, thus controlling the systemic resistance to insects. Unlike leaf-to-leaf systemic signaling, this study reveals the unique regulation of wounding-induced hypocotyl-to-leaf systemic signaling and sheds new light on how different plant organs use complex signaling pathways to modulate defense responses.

AB  - Members of the genus Heliconia L. (Heliconiaceae) have evolved complex interactions with both insect herbivores and hummingbird pollinators in tropical forests and secondary growth where they are abundant and diverse. Many of these same species have also been cultivated as ornamentals around the world for hundreds of years because of their extraordinary colors and forms. Because of the large size, fleshy nature, and tropical distribution, and despite a long taxonomic history, the classification and phylogenetic relationships of species of Heliconia have not received sufficient attention to date. No complete classification has been published for the entire genus, although some preliminary attempts have been offered. In this paper we used tissue sampled from field and herbarium collections of 136 species for genomic sequencing to determine the phylogenetic patterns within Heliconia, which then served as the basis for a new evolutionary classification of the genus. This new classification, which is based on extensive field work and the phylogenomic insights provided here, includes 187 currently recognized species. The new classification of Heliconia is composed of 17 sections in five subgenera with all groups well-supported in the phylogenomic analysis. Four subgenera are each composed of two sections and one subgenus includes nine sections. One subgenus and 10 sections are described as new.

AB  - Populus cathayana x canadansis 'Xinlin 1' ('P.'xin lin 1') with the characteristics of rapid growth and high yield, is frequently attacked by herbivorous insects. However, little is known about how it defenses against Hyphantria cunea (H. cunea) at molecular and biochemical levels. Differences in the transcriptome and metabolome were analyzed after 'P. 'xin lin 1' leaves were fed to H. cunea for 0h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 16h and 24h. In the five comparison groups including 2h vs. CK, 4h vs. CK, 8h vs. CK, 16h vs. CK, and 24h vs. CK, a total of 8925 genes and 842 metabolites were differentially expressed. A total of 825 transcription factors (TFs) were identified, which encoded 56 TF families. The results showed that the top four families with the highest number of TFs were AP2/ERF, MYB, C2C2, bHLH. Analyses of leaves which were fed to H. cunea showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were significantly enriched in plant hormone signal transduction pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Additionally, there were a number of genes significantly up-regulated in MAPK signaling pathway. Some compounds involved in plant hormone signal transduction and flavonoid/flavone and flavonol/ anthocyanin pathways such as jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-Isoleucine (JA-Ile), kaempferol and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were induced in infested 'P.'xin lin 1'. This study provides a new understanding for exploring the dynamic response mechanism of poplar to the infestation of H. cunea.

AB  - The reproductive success of organisms depends on the positive and negative interactions it establishes throughout its lifetime. Pollinators and mutualists increase adaptive value, while herbivory and antagonism impair plant performance. Asteraceae flowers, simultaneously interacting with pollinators, herbivores and parasitoids with the same structure (the flower head), serve as a model for studying these interactions. In this work we describe the multi-layered interactions between Proteopsis argentea,, its pollinators, endophagous herbivores and parasitoids, aiming to understand how they influence the plant's reproductive success and whether these processes are associated with its conservation status as vulnerable. We found that P. argentea produces little, but highly energetic nectar, acting in interactions with bees, hummingbirds and lepidopterans in a generalist pollination system. Antagonistic interactions were much less diverse, dominated by Xanthaciura aff. chrysura. In addition, two morphospecies of parasitoid wasps used the flower heads of P. argentea, and may have a negative impact on antagonists. We also found that P. argentea presents a reproductive insurance strategy, via autogamy, producing seeds without pollinators. The flowers of P. argentea seem to act as efficient filters, promoting interactions with potential pollinators and parasitoids and limiting interaction with endophagous herbivores. The reproductive strategies of P. argentea, with an apparently efficient floral filter and reproductive insurance in the absence of pollinators, seems to indicate that reproduction is not a limiting factor for the species. Thus, for its conversation, measures ensuring the protection of its occurrence area should be prioritized.

AB  - Secondary chemistry mediates many important ecological interactions and often differs between sexes in dioecious plant species; however, its genetic basis is not well known for many species.
   Secondary chemistry often differs between sexes in dioecious plant species, a pattern attributed to its possible role in the evolution and/or maintenance of dioecy. We used GC-MS to measure floral volatiles emitted from, and LC-MS to quantitate non-volatile secondary compounds contained in, female and male Salix purpurea willow catkins from an F-2 family. Using the abundance of these chemicals, we then performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to locate them on the genome, identified biosynthetic candidate genes in the QTL intervals, and examined expression patterns of candidate genes using RNA-seq. Male flowers emitted more total terpenoids than females, but females produced more benzenoids. Male tissue contained greater amounts of phenolic glycosides, but females had more chalcones and flavonoids. A flavonoid pigment and a spermidine derivative were found only in males. Male catkins were almost twice the mass of females. Forty-two QTL were mapped for 25 chemical traits and catkin mass across 16 of the 19 S. purpurea chromosomes. Several candidate genes were identified, including a chalcone isomerase associated with seven compounds. A better understanding of the genetic basis of the sexually dimorphic chemistry of a dioecious species may shed light on how chemically mediated ecological interactions may have helped in the evolution and maintenance of dioecy.

AB  - Drought stress poses adverse influence on plant growth and further alters plant-herbivore interactions. Such effect is enhanced as drought occurrence is reported to increase due to global warming. Although dioecious plant species have shown sex-specific response to drought stress through the changes in growth performance and stress tolerance, whether such changes will drive sex-specific differences in defense against herbivores between male and female plant conspecifics is barely studied. In the current study, female and male poplar full-siblings were submitted to moderate (75 % field water capacity) and severe drought (50 % field water capacity) stresses, followed by herbivore growth and feeding bioassays to test the effect of plant gender on herbivore growth and feeding performance of two specialist and two generalist leaf herbivores. The results showed that although the growth of both plant sexes was inhibited by the two drought levels, male plants performed better than female conspecifics. In the paired-choice bioassays, the specialist herbivores preferred female plants while the generalist herbivores fed more on the male plants without drought stress. Both the moderate and severe drought stresses reversed such preferences. In the triple-choice bioassays, the specialist herbivores preferred female control plants while the generalist herbivores fed more on female plants under severe drought. In addition, the specialist herbivores fed on female plants from severe drought stress grew the worst while the generalist herbivores gained the highest fresh weight. The transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed that female plant leaves contained higher levels of flavonoids than males under control condition while severe drought stress remarkably reduced the levels of defensive metabolites such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids, neoflavonoids and alkaloids in female but not in male plant leaves.

AB  - Choline and folate are critical nutrients for fetal brain development, but the timing of their influence during gestation has not been previously characterized. At different periods during gestation, choline stimulation of alpha 7-nicotinic receptors facilitates the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors from excitatory to inhibitory and recruitment of GluR1-R2 receptors for faster excitatory responses to glutamate. The outcome of the fetal development of inhibition and excitation was assessed in 159 newborns by P50 cerebral auditory-evoked responses. Paired stimuli, S1 and S2, were presented 500 ms apart. Higher P50 amplitude in response to S1 (P50S1microV) assesses excitation, and lower P50S2microV assesses inhibition in this paired-stimulus paradigm. The development of inhibition was related solely to maternal choline plasma concentration and folate supplementation at 16 weeks' gestation. The development of excitation was related only to maternal choline at 28 weeks. Higher maternal choline concentrations later in gestation did not compensate for earlier lower concentrations. At 4 years of age, increased behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 years were related to both newborn inhibition and excitation. The incomplete development of inhibition and excitation associated with lower choline and folate during relatively brief periods of gestation thus has enduring effects on child development.

AB  - Drought stress significantly impairs the output of tea plants and the quality of tea products. Although Serendipita indica has demonstrated the ability to enhance drought tolerance in host plants, its impact on tea plants (Camellia sinensis) experiencing drought stress is unknown. This study assessed the response of tea plants by inoculating S. indica under drought conditions. Phenotypic and physiological analyses demonstrated that S. indica mitigated drought damage in tea plants by regulating osmotic equilibrium and antioxidant enzyme activity. Metabolome analysis showed that S. indica promoted the accumulation of flavonoid metabolites, including naringin, (-)-epiafzelechin, naringenin chalcone, and dihydromyricetin, while inhibiting the content of amino acids and derivatives, such as homoarginine, L-arginine, N6-acetyl-L-lysine, and N-palmitoylglycine, during water deficit. The expression patterns of S. indica-stimulated genes were investigated using transcriptome analysis. S. indica-induced drought-responsive genes involved in osmotic regulation, antioxidant protection, transcription factors, and signaling were identified and recognized as possibly significant in S. indica-mediated drought tolerance in tea plants. Particularly, the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was identified from the metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Moreover, flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were identified. S. indica-inoculation significantly upregulated the expression of cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) genes compared to uninoculated plants subjected to water stress. Consequently, we concluded that S. indica inoculation primarily alleviates drought stress in tea plants by modulating the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. These results will provide insights into the mechanisms of S. indica-enhanced drought tolerance in tea plants and establish a solid foundation for its application as a microbial agent in the management of drought in tea plants cultivation.

AB  - Plants synthesize an array of volatile compounds, many of which serve ecological roles in attracting pollinators, deterring herbivores, and communicating with their surroundings. Methyl anthranilate (MeAA) is an anti-herbivory defensive volatile responsible for grape aroma that is emitted by several agriculturally relevant plants, including citrus, grapes, and maize. Unlike maize, which uses a one-step anthranilate methyltransferase (AAMT), grapes have been thought to use a two-step pathway for MeAA biosynthesis. By mining available transcriptomics data, we identified two AAMTs in Vitis vinifera (wine grape), as well as one ortholog in "Concord" grape. Many angiosperms methylate the plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) to produce methyl salicylate, which acts as a plant-to-plant communication molecule. Because the Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) SA methyltransferase can methylate both anthranilate (AA) and SA, we used this enzyme to examine the molecular basis of AA activity by introducing rational mutations, which identified several active site residues that increase activity with AA. Reversing this approach, we introduced mutations that imparted activity with SA in the maize AAMT, which uncovered different active site residues from those in the citrus enzyme. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the Vitis AAMTs shares an ancestor with jasmonic acid methyltransferases, similar to the AAMT from strawberry (Frageria sp.). Collectively, these data demonstrate the molecular mechanisms underpinning AA activity across methyltransferases and identify one-step enzymes by which grapes synthesize MeAA.

AB  - In response to insect attack, plants use intricate signaling pathways, including phytohormones, such as jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), and salicylic acid (SA), to activate defenses. Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most important staple food crops around the world. Previous studies have shown that the JA and ET signaling play important roles in maize defense against insects, but little is known about whether and how SA regulates maize resistance to insect herbivores. In this study, we ectopically expressed the NahG (salicylate hydroxylase) gene in maize plants (NahG maize) to block the accumulation of SA. It was found that compared with the wild-type (WT) maize, the NahG maize exhibited decreased resistance to the generalist insects Spodoptera litura and Spodoptera frugiperda and the specialist Mythimna separata, and the compromised resistance in the NahG maize was associated with decreased levels of defensive metabolites benzoxazinoids (Bxs) and chlorogenic acid (CA). Quantification of simulated S. litura feedinginduced JA, JA-isoleucine conjugate (JA-Ile), and ET in the WT and NahG maize indicated that SA does not regulate JA or JA-Ile, but positively controls ET. We provide evidence suggesting that the SA pathway does not crosstalk with the JA or the ET signaling in regulating the accumulation of Bxs and CA. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the bHLH, ERF, and WRKY transcription factors might be involved in SAregulated defenses. This study uncovers a novel and important phytohormone pathway in maize defense against lepidopterous larvae. Copyright (c) 2024 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Chewing herbivores activate plant defense responses through a combination of mechanical wounding and elicitation by herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs). HAMPs are wound response amplifiers; however, specific defense outputs may also exist that strictly require HAMP-mediated defense signaling. To investigate HAMP-mediated signaling and defense responses, we characterized cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) transcriptome changes following elicitation by inceptin, a peptide HAMP common in Lepidoptera larvae oral secretions. Following inceptin treatment, we observed large-scale reprogramming of the transcriptome consistent with three different response categories: (i) amplification of mechanical wound responses, (ii) temporal extension through accelerated or prolonged responses, and (iii) examples of inceptin-specific elicitation and suppression. At both early and late timepoints, namely 1 and 6 h, large sets of transcripts specifically accumulated following inceptin elicitation. Further early inceptin-regulated transcripts were classified as reversing changes induced by wounding alone. Within key signaling- and defense-related gene families, inceptin-elicited responses included target subsets of wound-induced transcripts. Transcripts displaying the largest inceptin-elicited fold changes included transcripts encoding terpene synthases (TPSs) and peroxidases (POXs) that correspond with induced volatile production and increased POX activity in cowpea. Characterization of inceptin-elicited cowpea defenses via heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that specific cowpea TPSs and POXs were able to confer terpene emission and the reduced growth of beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) herbivores, respectively. Collectively, our present findings in cowpea support a model where HAMP elicitation both amplifies concurrent wound responses and specifically contributes to the activation of selective outputs associated with direct and indirect antiherbivore defenses.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential element for human health and an important nutrient for plant growth. Selenite is the main form of Se available to plants in acidic soils. Previous studies have shown that phosphate transporters (PTHs) participate in selenite uptake in plants. Research on the PHT gene family is therefore vital for production of Se-rich products. Here, 23 CsPHT genes were identified in the tea (Camellia sinensis) genome and renamed based on homology with AtPHT genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The CsPHT genes were divided into four subfamilies: PHT1, PHT3, PHT4, and PHO, containing nine, three, six, and five genes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that fewer duplication events occurred in tea plants than in A. thaliana, rice, apple, and poplar. Genes in the same subfamily tended to share similar gene structures, conserved motifs, and potential functions. CsPHT genes were differentially expressed in various tissues and in roots under different Se levels, suggesting key roles in selenite uptake, translocation, and homeostasis. The results illuminate the contributions of CsPHT genes to selenite supply in tea plants, and lay a foundation for follow-up studies on their potential functions in this plant species.

AB  - Healthy aging is accompanied by declines in the ability to learn associations between events, even when their relationship cannot be described. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have attributed these implicit associative learning (IAL) deficits to differential engagement of the hippocampus and basal ganglia in older relative to younger adults in early and late stages of the task, respectively. However, these task stages have been confounded with age group differences in learning performance that emerge later and to a lesser degree in older adults. To disentangle the effects of task stage from learning stage (i.e., when there is significant evidence of learning) on age group differences in the neural substrates of IAL, we acquired fMRI data while 28 younger (20.8 +/- 2.3 years) and 22 older (73.6 +/- 6.8 years) healthy adults completed the Triplets Learning Task, in which the location of two cues predicted the location of a target with high (HF) or low (LF) frequency. When matched for task stage, results revealed worse learning performance and increased IAL-related activity in the hippocampus during the early stage and in the globus pallidum during the late stage in older relative to younger adults. However, when matched for learning stage, there were no significant age group differences in learning performance or IAL-related activity. Thus, although learning emerges later for older adults, they are engaging similar brain regions as younger adults when learning the associations, suggesting that previous reports of age group differences reflect effects of age on task stage, but not learning stage.

AB  - Introduction Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a widely used solvent to dissolve hydrophobic substances for clinical uses and experimental in vivo purposes. While usually regarded safe, our prior studies suggest changes to behavior following DMSO exposure. We therefore evaluated the effects of a five-day, short-term exposure to DMSO on postnatal infant rats (P6-10).
   Methods DMSO was intraperitoneally injected for five days at 0.2, 2.0, and 4.0 ml/kg body mass. One cohort of animals was sacrificed 24 hr after DMSO exposure to analyze the neurometabolic changes in four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum) by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. A second cohort of animals was used to analyze chronic alterations to behavior and pathological changes to glia and neuronal cells later in life (P21-P40).
   Results 164 metabolites, including key regulatory molecules (retinoic acid, orotic acid, adrenic acid, and hypotaurine), were found significantly altered by DMSO exposure in at least one of the brain regions at P11 (p < .05). Behavioral tests showed significant hypoactive behavior and decreased social habits to the 2.0 and 4.0 ml DMSO/kg groups (p < .01). Significant increases in number of microglia and astrocytes at P40 were observed in the 4.0 ml DMSO/kg group (at p < .015.)
   Conclusions Despite short-term exposure at low, putatively nontoxic concentrations, DMSO led to changes in behavior and social preferences, chronic alterations in glial cells, and changes in essential regulatory brain metabolites. The chronic neurological effects of DMSO exposure reported here raise concerns about its neurotoxicity and consequent safety in human medical applications and clinical trials.

AB  - Antenatal synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) are a life-saving treatment in managing pre-term birth. However, off-target effects of sGCs can impact blood-brain barrier (BBB) drug transporters essential for fetal brain protection, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp/Abcb1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/Abcg2). We hypothesized that maternal antenatal sGC treatment modifies BBB function in juvenile offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the long-term impact of a single or multiple courses of betamethasone on P-gp/Abcb1 and BCRP/Abcg2 expression and function at the BBB. Pregnant guinea pigs (N = 42) received 3 courses (gestation days (GDs) 40, 50, and 60) or a single course (GD50) of betamethasone (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). Cerebral microvessels and brain endothelial cells (BEC) were collected from the post-natal day (PND) 14 offspring to measure protein, gene expression, and function of the drug transporters P-gp/Abcb1 and BCRP/Abcg2. P-gp protein expression was decreased (p < .05) in microvessels from male offspring that had been exposed to multiple courses and a single course of sGC, in utero. Multiple courses of sGC resulted in a significant decrease in P-gp function in BECs from males (p < .05), but not females. There was a very strong trend for increased P-gp function in males compared to females (p = .055). Reduced P-gp expression and function at the BBB of young male offspring following multiple prenatal sGC exposures, is clinically relevant as many drugs administered postnatally are P-gp substrates. These novel sex differences in drug transporter function may underlie potential sexual dimorphism in drug sensitivity and toxicity in the newborn and juvenile brain.

AB  - The tea plant ( Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is an important woody economic crop and often attacked by various insect pests such as tea aphids ( Toxoptera aurantii Boyer de Fonscolombe). To reveal tea plant responses to tea aphid infestation, tea aphid-resistant cultivar 'Taicha13' and-susceptible one 'Jingfeng' were first screened, and then widely targeted metabolomics profiling, biochemical parameter and RT-qPCR analyses were performed in three samples, TCN (tea aphid non-infested 'Taicha13'), JFN (tea aphid non-infested 'Jingfeng') and JFA (tea aphid-infested 'Jingfeng'). The results showed amnio acid (plus proline) and protein content, and amnio acid: sucrose ratio were significantly less abundant in TCN relative to JFN, suggesting TCN is low nutritional quality for tea aphids. Metabolite profiling revealed that flavonoids and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) were more enriched in TCN and JFA compared to JFN, proposing effective roles of flavonoids and JA-Ile in tea plant defense against tea aphid infestation. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that five JA biosynthesis genes ( CsLOX2, CsLOX3, CsOPR, CsAOC and CsJAR) ) in exception of CsAOS, , and six flavonoid biosynthesis genes ( CsPAL, CsC4H, CsCHS1, CsCHS2, CsFL and CsDFR) ) shared similarly higher abundance in TCN than in JFN, and exhibited elevated expression levels in JFA relative to JFN, further suggesting flavonoids and JA confer tea plant resistance against tea aphid feeding. Overall, our findings uncovered that tea aphid-infestation activated defensive responses and highlighted involvement of nutritional quality, flavonoids and JA-Ile in tea plant resistance against tea aphid infestation.

AB  - Despite substantial research examining caterpillar-plant interactions, changes in the feeding behaviour of lepidopteran larvae as they develop are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated ontogenetic changes in the behaviour of Helicoverpa armigera larvae feeding on reproductive structures of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan). Specifically, we examined the preference for and avoidance of pigeonpea flowers and pods of first, second, third, and fourth instar H. armigera larvae. We also conducted a no-choice assay to compare the ability of third and fourth instar larvae to penetrate pigeonpea pod walls, which act as a physical defence against herbivory. When presented with a choice between pigeonpea pods and flowers, different instars behaved differently. First and second instar larvae largely avoided pigeonpea pods, instead feeding on flowers; third instar larvae initially avoided pods, but by 24 h, did not strongly discriminate between the structures; and fourth instars demonstrated a preference for pods. When initially placed on pods, first instars were slower than other instars to leave these structures, despite pods being suboptimal feeding sites for small caterpillars. We identified a clear instar-specific ability to penetrate through the pod wall to reach the seeds. Most third instar larvae were unable to penetrate the pod wall, whereas most fourth instars succeeded. Third instars suffered a physiological cost (measured by relative growth rate) when boring through the pod wall, which was not observed in fourth instars. Our study further illuminates the insect-plant interactions of the H. armigera-pigeonpea system and provides evidence for the significant changes in feeding behaviour that may occur during lepidopteran larval development.

AB  - Camelina is an oil seed crop that is enjoying increasing interest because it has a particularly valuable fatty acid profile, is modest regarding its water and nutrient requirements, and is comparatively resilient to abiotic and biotic stress factors. The regeneration of plants from cells accessible to genetic manipulation is an essential prerequisite for the generation of genetically engineered plants, be it by transgenesis or genome editing. Here, immature embryos were used on the assumption that their incomplete differentiation was associated with totipotency. In culture, regenerative structures appeared adventitiously at the embryos' hypocotyls. For this, the application of auxin- or cytokinin-type growth regulators was essential. The formation of regenerative structures was most efficient when indole-3-acetic acid was added to the induction medium at 1 mg/L, zygotic embryos of the medium walking stick stage were used, and their hypocotyls were stimulated by pricking to a wound response. Histological examinations revealed that the formation of adventitious shoots was initiated by locally activated cell division and proliferation in the epidermis and the outer cortex of the hypocotyl. While the regeneration of plants was established in principle using the experimental line Cam139, the method proved to be similarly applicable to the current cultivar Ligena, and hence it constitutes a vital basis for future genetic engineering approaches.

We isolated an effector-like protein (Highly Accumulated Secretory Protein 1, HAS1) from cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) that is the most highly accumulated secretory protein of the nondigestive components in OS and belongs to venom R-like protein. Elimination of HAS1 by plant-mediated RNA interference reduced the suppression of OS on the defense response in plants. Plants expressing HAS1 are more susceptible to insect herbivory accompanied by the reduced expressions of multiple defense genes. HAS1 binds to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, including GoPGF involved in pigmented gland formation and defense compounds biosynthesis in cotton and MYC3/MYC4 the main regulators in jasmonate (JA) signaling in Arabidopsis. The binding activity is required for HAS1 to inhibit the activation of bHLHs on plant defense gene expressions. Together with our previous study that another venom R-like protein HARP1 in cotton bollworm OS blocks JA signaling by interacting with JASMONATE-ZIM-domain repressors, we conclude that the venom R-like proteins in OS interfere with plant defense in a dual suppression manner. Considering the venom proteins in parasitic wasp assault the immune system of its host animal, our investigation reveals their conserved function in carnivorous and herbivorous insects.

AB  - Background Timing is everything when it comes to the fitness outcome of a plant's ecological interactions, and accurate timing is particularly relevant for interactions with herbivores or mutualists that are based on ephemeral emissions of volatile organic compounds. Previous studies of the wild tobacco N. attenuata have found associations between the diurnal timing of volatile emissions, and daytime predation of herbivores by their natural enemies. Results Here, we investigated the role of light in regulating two biosynthetic groups of volatiles, terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which dominate the herbivore-induced bouquet of N. attenuata. Light deprivation strongly suppressed terpenoid emissions while enhancing GLV emissions, albeit with a time lag. Silencing the expression of photoreceptor genes did not alter terpenoid emission rhythms, but silencing expression of the phytochrome gene, NaPhyB1, disordered the emission of the GLV (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. External abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased stomatal resistance, but did not truncate the emission of terpenoid volatiles (recovered in the headspace). However, ABA treatment enhanced GLV emissions and leaf internal pools (recovered from tissue), and reduced internal linalool pools. In contrast to the pattern of diurnal terpenoid emissions and nocturnal GLV emissions, transcripts of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) biosynthetic genes peaked during the day. The promotor regions of these genes were populated with various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian regulation. Conclusions This research provides insights into the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIPV bouquets, a mechanistic complexity which rivals the functional complexity of HIPVs, which includes repelling herbivores, calling for body guards, and attracting pollinators.

AB  - Cannabis contains more than 100 phytocannabinoids. Most of these remain poorly characterized, particularly in neurons. We tested a panel of five phytocannabinoids-cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) in two neuronal models, autaptic hippocampal neurons and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Autaptic neurons expressed a form of CB1-dependent retrograde plasticity while DRGs expressed a variety of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. CBC, CBDA, and CBDVA had little or no effect on neuronal cannabinoid signaling. CBDV and THCV differentially inhibited cannabinoid signaling. THCV inhibited CB1 receptors presynaptically while CBDV acted post-synaptically, perhaps by inhibiting 2-AG production. None of the compounds elicited a consistent DRG response. In summary, we find that two of five 'minor' phytocannabinoids tested antagonized CB1-based signaling in a neuronal model, but with very different mechanisms. Our findings highlight the diversity of potential actions of phytocannabinoids and the importance of fully evaluating these compounds in neuronal models.

AB  - Regulation of responses induced by herbivory and jasmonic acid (JA) remains poorly understood in the important staple crop maize (Zea mays). MYC2 is the key transcription factor regulating many aspects of JA signaling, while mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs or MPKs) play important roles in various plant physiological processes. Using a combination of reverse genetics, transcriptome analysis, and biochemical assays, we elucidated the important role of mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) in maize resistance to insects and in JA signaling. Silencing MPK4 increased the JA and jasmonoyl-isoleucine levels elicited by wounding or simulated herbivory but decreased maize resistance to armyworm (Mythimna separata) larvae. We showed that MPK4 is required for transcriptional regulation of many genes responsive to methyl jasmonate, indicating the important role of maize MPK4 in JA signaling. Biochemical analyses indicated that MPK4 directly phosphorylates MYC2s at Thr115 of MYC2a and Thr112 of MYC2b. Compared with nonphosphorylated MYC2s, phosphorylated MYC2s were more prone to degradation and exhibited enhanced transactivation activity against the promoters of several benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes, which are important for maize defense against insects. This study reveals the essential role of maize MPK4 in JA signaling and provides insights into the functions of MAPKs in maize.

AB  - The paper by Liu et al. (2024) presents measurements of herbivory and six plant traits considered potential antiherbivore defences in seven plant species across two study plots: one mined and one adjacent unmined plot. I argue that this experimental design is inadequate for testing the authors' hypothesis that differences in herbivory and plant traits between these two plots are due to pollution impact, as the study lacks replication of pollution levels. This issue, which could have been easily addressed when designing the study, reflects insufficient attention to experimental design and seriously compromises the validity of the research findings. I briefly reiterate what pseudoreplication is and which fundamental principle of statistical inference it violates. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

AB  - Background and Aims Extrafloral nectaries are nectar-secreting structures present on vegetative parts of plants which provide indirect defences against herbivore attack. Extrafloral nectaries in Clerodendrum chinense are patelliform-shaped specialized trichomatous structures. However, a complete understanding of patelliform extrafloral nectaries in general, and of C. chinense in particular, has not yet been established to provide fundamental insight into the cellular physiological machinery involved in nectar biosynthesis and secretory processes.Methods We studied temporal changes in the morphological, anatomical and ultrastructural features in the architectures of extrafloral nectaries. We also compared metabolite profiles of extrafloral nectar, nectary tissue, non-nectary tissue and phloem sap. Further, both in situ histolocalization and normal in vitro activities of enzymes related to sugar metabolism were examined.Key Results Four distinct tissue regions in the nectar gland were revealed from histochemical characterization, among which the middle nectariferous tissue was found to be the metabolically active region, while the intermediate layer was found to be lipid-rich. Ultrastructural study showed the presence of a large number of mitochondria along with starch-bearing chloroplasts in the nectariferous region. However, starch depletion was noted with progressive maturation of nectaries. Metabolite analysis revealed compositional differences among nectar, phloem sap, nectary and non-nectary tissue. Invertase activity was higher in secretory stages and localized in nectariferous tissue and adjacent region.Conclusions Our study suggests extrafloral nectar secretion in C. chinense to be both eccrine and merocrine in nature. A distinct intermediate lipid-rich layer that separates the epidermis from nectary parenchyma was revealed, which possibly acts as a barrier to water flow in nectar. This study also revealed a distinction between nectar and phloem sap, and starch could act as a nectar precursor, as evidenced from enzymatic and ultrastructural studies. Thus, our findings on changing architecture of extrafloral nectaries with temporal secretion revealed a cell physiological process involved in nectar biosynthesis and secretion.

AB  - Glycine max (Soybean) is an oil-seed cash crop and protein-rich legume with great therapeutic and nutritional potential. Soybean is cultivated worldwide for human food and raw material for industries. The polyphagous herbivore, Spodoptera litura (common cutworm) can cause significant loss to soybean production; making it mandatory to understand the underlying defense mechanisms. In order to decipher the induced plant defense orchestration of soybean in response to S. litura-infestation, a feeding bioassay was conducted, which identified a mild-induced defense upon S. litura-infestation. Further, a comparative proteomics of soybean (Pusa-9712) identified 390 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) wherein 154 are upregulated whereas 236 are downregulated at log-fold change >= 1 and p-value <= 0.05. The function-prediction investigations revealed that most of the DAPs were involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism, biotic and abiotic stresses, cell wall organisation, transcription and trans-regulation activities. Mapman analysis showed roles of DAPs in the upregulation of a few phenylpropanoid-related proteins, PR-proteins, peroxidases and proteases whereas repression of many of the DAPs involved in biosynthesis of other phenylpropanoids, lignin, anthocyanins, dihydroflavanols, components of shikimate pathways, cell wall proteins and signalling cascades, indicating inadequate plant defense against S. litura-infestation. These DAPs involved in secondary metabolism, reactive oxygen homeostasis and signalling pathway could be potential candidates for further functional analysis and can be selected for genetic manipulation towards improving defense against S. litura-infestation.

AB  - Jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a plant defence hormone whose cellular levels are elevated upon herbivory and regulate defence signalling. Despite their pivotal role, our understanding of the rapid cellular perception of bioactive JA-Ile is limited. This study identifies cell type-specific JA-Ile-induced Ca2+ signal and its role in self-amplification and plant elicitor peptide receptor (PEPR)-mediated signalling. Using the Ca2+ reporter, R-GECO1 in Arabidopsis, we have characterized a monophasic and sustained JA-Ile-dependent Ca2+ signature in leaf epidermal cells. The rapid Ca2+ signal is independent of positive feedback by the JA-Ile receptor, COI1 and the transporter, JAT1. Microarray analysis identified up-regulation of receptors, PEPR1 and PEPR2 upon JA-Ile treatment. The pepr1 pepr2 double mutant in R-GECO1 background exhibits impaired external JA-Ile induced Ca2+cyt elevation and impacts the canonical JA-Ile responsive genes. JA responsive transcription factor, MYC2 binds to the G-Box motif of PEPR1 and PEPR2 promoter and activates their expression upon JA-Ile treatment and in myc2 mutant, this is reduced. External JA-Ile amplifies AtPep-PEPR pathway by increasing the AtPep precursor, PROPEP expression. Our work shows a previously unknown non-canonical PEPR-JA-Ile-Ca2+-MYC2 signalling module through which plants sense JA-Ile rapidly to amplify both AtPep-PEPR and jasmonate signalling in undamaged cells.
   This work shows how plant hormone, jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is sensed by cells externally using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system. Using calcium imaging, transcriptomics, hormone analysis we describe a non-canonical PEPR-JA-Ile-Ca2+-MYC2 signalling module through which plants sense JA-Ile rapidly to amplify both AtPep-PEPR and jasmonate signalling in undamaged cells.

AB  - Plants produce ethyl vinyl ketone (evk) in response to biotic stress, but the evk's identification and downstream defense response remain unclear. In this paper, it is predicted by docking for the first time that evk can be recognized by RBOH protein and assist the electron transfer of RBOHD/RBOHF by binding to its FAD or NADPH binding site. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay shows that evk indeed bind to RBOHD. Here, we show that evk treatment increased H2O2 and intracellular calcium concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll cells, as observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and non-invasive micro-test technology, and that H2O2 signaling functioned upstream of Ca2+ signaling. Yeast two-hybrid, firefly luciferase complementation imaging, and in vitro pull-down assays demonstrated that the ACA8 (AUTOINHIBITED Ca2+-ATPASE, ISOFORM 8)-CML8 (CALMODULIN-LIKE 8) interaction promoted Ca2+ efflux to return Ca2+ levels to the resting state.

AB  - Floral scent is a key mediator in plant-pollinator interactions. However, little is known to what extent intraspecific scent variation is shaped by phenotypic selection, with no information yet in deceptive plants. In this study, we collected inflorescence scent and fruit set of the deceptive moth fly-pollinated Arum maculatum L. (Araceae) from six populations north vs. five populations south of the Alps, accumulating to 233 samples in total, and tested for differences in scent, fruit set, and phenotypic selection on scent across this geographic barrier. We recorded 289 scent compounds, the highest number so far reported in a single plant species. Most of the compounds occurred both north and south of the Alps; however, plants of the different regions emitted different absolute and relative amounts of scent. Fruit set was higher north than south of the Alps, and some, but not all differences in scent could be explained by differential phenotypic selection in northern vs. southern populations. This study is the first to provide evidence that floral scents of a deceptive plant are under phenotypic selection and that phenotypic selection is involved in shaping geographic patterns of floral scent in such plants. The hyperdiverse scent of A. maculatum might result from the imitation of various brood substrates of its pollinators.</p>

AB  - Plants secrete various defence-related proteins into the apoplast, including proteases. Papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) are central components of the plant immune system. To overcome plant immunity and successfully colonize their hosts, several plant pathogens secrete effector proteins inhibiting plant PLCPs. We hypothesized that not only pathogens, but also mutualistic microorganisms interfere with PLCP-meditated plant defences to maintain endophytic colonization with their hosts. Epichloe festucae forms mutualistic associations with cool season grasses and produces a range of secondary metabolites that protect the host against herbivores. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification of Lolium perenne PLCPs, analysed their evolutionary relationship, and classified them into nine PLCP subfamilies. Using activity-based protein profiling, we identified four active PLCPs in the apoplast of L. perenne leaves that are inhibited during endophyte interactions. We characterized the L. perenne cystatin LpCys1 for its inhibitory capacity against ryegrass PLCPs. LpCys1 abundance is not altered during the mutualistic interaction and it mainly inhibits LpCP2. However, since the activity of other L. perenne PLCPs is not sensitive to LpCys1, we propose that additional inhibitors, likely of fungal origin, are involved in the suppression of apoplastic PLCPs during E. festucae infection.

AB  - Sucrose non-fermenting (SNF) related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a master regulator of energy deprivation signaling, has also been implicated in abiotic and biotic stress regulation. SnRK1 promotes stress tolerance through metabolic and transcriptional changes and plays important roles in innate immunity against various pathogens. However, whether it plays a role against insect herbivory is not understood. To test this, using the wild type (with SnRK1) and snrk1 mutant lines in rice, we examined the potential role of SnRK1 in rice against the ruinous pest, Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda. We also investigated the response of FAW towards these lines at different time intervals after exogenous application of plant hormone, Jasmonic acid (JA), and a JA blocker (Ibuprofen). Additional experiments by feeding FAW with leaf infused diet, fresh leaves, and a short-term exposure of FAW to the lines were also carried out. FAW mass gain, growth and development, and host ecophysiological traits were observed. In addition, we also quantified the major surface defenses- trichomes, and wax before and after herbivory. Our results show that FAW response did not vary between mutants and wild type rice. Meanwhile, we found plant hormonal application influenced the ecophysiological traits regardless of mutants and wild type rice. Collectively, we show that while defense against FAW in rice is JA mediated, SnRK1 has a limited role as observed through manipulative experiments with the wild type and snrk1 mutant rice lines.

AB  - Plants have developed various resistance mechanisms against herbivorous insects through prolonged coevolution. Plant defence responses can be triggered by specific compounds present in insect saliva. Apyrase, a known enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic phosphorus, has recently been identified in some herbivorous insects. However, whether insect salivary apyrase induces or inhibits plant responses remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified an apyrase-like protein in the salivary proteome of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, named Sfapyrase. Sfapyrase was primarily expressed in the salivary gland and secreted into plants during insect feeding. Transient expression of Sfapyrase in tobacco and maize enhanced plant resistance and resulted in decreased insect feeding. Knockdown of Sfapyrase through RNA interference led to increased growth and feeding of S. frugiperda. Furthermore, we showed that Sfapyrase activates the jasmonic acid signalling pathway and promotes the synthesis of secondary metabolites, especially benzoxazinoids, thereby enhancing resistance to S. frugiperda. In summary, our findings demonstrated that Sfapyrase acts as a salivary elicitor, inducing maize jasmonic acid defence responses and the production of insect-resistant benzoxazinoids. This study provides valuable insights into plant-insect interactions and offers potential targets for developing innovative insect pest management strategies.

AB  - RH (Rathu Heenati), an indica rice cultivar from Sri Lanka, is highly resistant to several different biotypes of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal, BPH). In contrast, another indica rice cultivar, TN1 (Taichung Native 1), is highly susceptible to all biotypes of BPH. To reveal the molecular biological mechanism of biotic and abiotic stress mediated by BPH suction in two rice cultivars, RH and TN1, the genome-wide gene expressional profiling of these two rice varieties at 6 h after BPH infestation and needle puncturing was conducted by performing transcriptome analysis. In total, six samples (T6C, T6N, T6B, R6C, R6N, and R6B) were collected after performing different treatments for this expressional analysis. The results provide important information for the further isolation of BPH-resistance genes from RH as well as research on the mechanism of BPH resistance in RH. The transcriptome results revealed that TN1 (a BPH-susceptible rice variety) and RH (a BPH-resistant rice variety) harbor different pathways that respond to the physical injury of acupuncture and BPH infestation. The susceptible variety TN1 is more sensitive to the physical damage caused by acupuncture, whereas in the resistant variety RH, the response to insect damage is more rapid and direct. By comparing the gene changes of various plant hormones between the two varieties under different stresses, it was found that, in addition to the traditional SA and ET pathways related to the feeding induction of piercing-sucking pests, the expression patterns of JAZrelated genes in the JA signaling pathway also changed under two stresses (acupuncture induction and brown planthopper feeding induction), while the IAA hormone pathway-related genes in the susceptible variety TN1 also changed significantly after brown planthopper feeding. Furthermore, the results of this study help us to understand the biological process of rice responses to BPH and provide a promising direction to identify BPHresistance-related genes in RH.

AB  - The calcium (Ca2+) signaling is a crucial event during plant-herbivore interaction, which involves a transient change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which is sensed by Ca2+-sensors, and the received message is transduced to downstream target proteins leading to appropriate defense response. Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) are calcium-sensing plant-specific proteins. Although CMLs have been identified in a few plants, they remained uncharacterized in leguminous crop plants. Therefore, a wide-range analysis of CMLs of soybean was performed, which identified 41 true CMLs with greater than 50% similarity with Arabidopsis CMLs. The phylogenetic study revealed their evolutionary relatedness with known CMLs. Further, the identification of conserved motifs, gene structure analysis, and identification of cis-acting elements strongly supported their identity as members of this family and their involvement in stress responses. Only a few Glycine max CMLs (GmCMLs) exhibited differential expression in different tissue types, and rest of them had minimal expression. Additionally, differential expression patterns of GmCMLs were observed during Spodoptera litura-feeding, wounding, and signaling compound treatments, indicating their role in plant defense. The three-dimensional structure prediction, identification of interactive domains, and docking with Ca2+ ions of S. litura-inducible GmCMLs, indicated their identity as calcium sensors. This study on the characterization of GmCMLs provided insights into their roles in calcium signaling and plant defense during herbivory.

AB  - Blister blight, caused by the basidiomycete Exobasidium vexans infecting on the young leaves and shoots, influence greatly in the production and quality of tea. In-planta metabolic regulations vary with the stress tolerance aptitude of the genotypes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), secondary metabolites, and antioxidative enzymes are among such parameters that have a significant impact in conferring tolerance. In situ ROS accumulation, oxidative damage, and subsequent enzymatic and non-enzymatic indicators in tender leaves of two each of susceptible (Happy Valley-39, Tukdah-78) and tolerant genotypes (Amberi valai-2, Phoobsering-312) were considered. The tolerant genotypes exhibited higher ROS, lipid peroxidation, and total protein content compared to the sensitive ones. Oxidative responses enumerate in terms of superoxide anion (O-2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and malondialdehyde, triggered activity of stress-responsive enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase. Non-enzymatic secondary metabolites, especially flavonols were observed to be augmented in the sensitive genotypes.

AB  - Increased neuroinflammation has been shown in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCHZ). This study evaluated a novel immune modulator (PD2024) that targets the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) to alleviate sensorimotor gating deficits and microglial activation employing two different rodent models of SCHZ. In Experiment 1, rats were neonatally treated with saline or the dopamine D2-like agonist quinpirole (NQ; 1 mg/kg) from postnatal day (P) 1-21 which produces increases of dopamine D2 receptor sensitivity throughout the animal?s lifetime. In Experiment 2, rats were neonatally treated with saline or the immune system stimulant polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) from P5-7. Neonatal Poly I:C treatment mimics immune system activation associated with SCHZ. In both experiments, rats were raised to P30 and administered a control diet or a novel TNF? inhibitor PD2024 (10 mg/kg) in the diet from P30 until P67. At P4546 and from P60-67, animals were behaviorally tested on auditory sensorimotor gating as measured through prepulse inhibition (PPI). NQ or Poly I:C treatment resulted in PPI deficits, and PD2024 treatment alleviated PPI deficits in both models. Results also revealed that increased hippocampal and prefrontal cortex microglial activation produced by neonatal Poly I:C was significantly reduced to control levels by PD2024. In addition, a separate group of animals neonatally treated with saline or Poly I:C from P5-7 demonstrated increased TNF? protein levels in the hippocampus but not prefrontal cortex, verifying increased TNF? in the brain produced by Poly I:C. Results from this study suggests that that brain TNF? is a viable pharmacological target to treat the neuroinflammation known to be associated with SCHZ.

AB  - Plant genotypes often exhibit varying resistance levels to herbivores. However, the impact of this genotypic variation on resistance against multiple herbivores remains poorly understood, especially in crops undergoing recent process of domestication. To address this gap, we studied the magnitude and mechanism of resistance in 12 cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) genotypes to three leaf-chewing herbivores - Sparganothis fruitworm (Sparganothis sulfureana), spotted fireworm (Choristoneura parallela), and spongy moth (Lymantria dispar) - along a domestication gradient (native 'wild' genotypes, 'early hybrid' genotypes, and 'modern hybrid' genotypes). Like cranberries, S. sulfureana and C. parallela are native to the United Sates, while L. dispar is an invasive pest. We measured the survival and growth of larvae on each genotype, as well as variation in plant performance (height and biomass) and leaf defensive chemical traits (C/N ratio, total phenolics, total proanthocyanidins, and flavonols levels) in these genotypes to elucidate potential resistance mechanisms. We found differences in C. parallela and L. dispar larval performance across genotypes, with larvae performing better on the modern hybrid genotypes, while S. sulfureana showed no differences. Morphological and chemical traits varied among genotypes, with total phenolics being the only trait correlated with C. parallela and L. dispar larval performance. Notably, the wild genotypes 'McFarlin' and 'Potter' had higher total phenolics and were more resistant to both herbivores than the modern hybrids 'Demoranville' and 'Mullica Queen.' This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of crop domestication on multiple insect herbivores, offering insights for future breeding efforts to enhance host-plant resistance against agricultural pests.

AB  - IntroductionGut microbiota dysbiosis is a key factor of the pathogenesis of post-stroke depression (PSD). PSD is associated with increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and decreased synaptic connectivity. Inulin can be involved in hippocampal neuron protection through the microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, the neuroprotective effects of inulin in PSD are still to be further investigated.MethodsBy utilizing the GEO public database, we identify differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus following inulin intake. This can help us discover key signaling pathways through functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, we validate the expression levels of signaling molecules in a rat model of PSD and examine the effects of inulin on behavioral changes and body weight. Additionally, conducting a microbiome analysis to identify significantly different microbial populations and perform correlation analysis.ResultsThe intake of inulin significantly up-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Inulin changed in the gut microbiota structure, leading to an increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 in the intestines of PSD rats, while decreasing the abundance of Ruminococcus UCG_005, Prevotella_9, Oscillospiraceae, and Clostridia UCG_014. Furthermore, the inulin diet elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 in the serum, which showed a positive correlation with the abundance of Lactobacillus. Notably, the consumption of inulin-enriched diet increased activity levels and preference for sugar water in PSD rats, while also reducing body weight.ConclusionThese findings highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of inulin in the management of depression and emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy gut microbiota for PSD.

AB  - Esketamine is verified as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of depression, but it is still unclear the detailed underlying mechanisms by which Esketamine ameliorates depression-related symptoms, which seriously limits the utilization of this drug in clinical practices. In this study, the C57BL6/J mice and mouse primary microglial cells were subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive models in vivo and in vitro, and our results confirmed that LPS-induced neuroinflammation, pyroptotic and apoptotic death contributed to the development of LPS-induced depressive symptoms. Then, the following experiments verified that low-dose Esketamine treatment decreased the expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-18 to restrain cellular inflammation, downregulated NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1, IL-1 beta and GSDMD-N to hamper pyroptotic cell death, and inhibited cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, but upregulated Bcl-2 to restrict apoptotic cell death in the LPS-treated mice hippocampus tissues and mouse microglial cells, leading to the suppression of depression development. However, high-dose Esketamine did not have those effects. Next, by conducting mechanical experiments, we verified that low-dose Esketamine downregulated GSK-3 beta to inactivate NLRP3 inflammasome, and the effects of low-dose Esketamine on cell pyroptosis, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in the LPS-treated microglial cells were all abrogated by overexpressing GSK-3 beta and NLRP3. Taken together, low-dose Esketamine ameliorated LPS-induced depressive symptoms in mice through regulating the GSK-3 beta/NLRP3 pathway, and our work suggested that appropriate doses of Esketamine were essential for the treatment of depression in clinic.

AB  - Menopause is the period in which women cease to produce the hormone estrogen, which can trigger physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes. In this context, alternatives are needed that can reduce the effects provided by menopause, specifically in terms of cognitive and behavioral aspects. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an exercise protocol that has shown the potential to improve cognition by promoting an increase in antioxidant defenses and BDNF levels. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of HIIT on behavior and hippocampal neurochemistry in ovariectomized adult rats. Four groups of rats were divided into: females without ovariectomy surgery and sedentary (SHAM-SED); females with ovariectomy surgery and sedentary (OVX-SED); females without ovariectomy surgery and trained (SHAM-HIIT); females with ovariectomy surgery and trained (OVX-HIIT). After the surgical procedure and the HIIT protocol, the animals underwent anxiety (elevated plus maze and open field) and memory (novel object recognition) tests. Corticosterone was measured in blood and BDNF levels and redox status were evaluated in the hippocampus. The OVX-SED group showed low BDNF levels and antioxidant enzymes, which may be linked to the observed memory impairments. The HIIT protocol (SHAM-HIIT and OVX-HIIT groups) increased the BDNF levels and antioxidant enzymes in the hippocampus, improving the animals' memory. However, HIIT also led to increased plasma corticosterone and anxiety-like behaviors. The ovariectomy procedure induced memory impairment probably due to reductions in hippocampal BDNF levels and redox imbalance. The HIIT protocol demonstrates promising results as an alternative to improve memory in ovariectomized rats.

AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) is a vast world health problem often associated with the somatosensory domain. This conceptualization is problematic because, unlike most other sensations that are usually affectively neutral and may present emotional, affective, and cognitive impairments. Neuronal circuits that modulate pain can increase or decrease painful sensitivity based on several factors, including context and expectation. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether subchronic treatment with Cannabidiol (CBD; 0.3, 3, and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal route -i.p., once a day for 3 days) could promote pain-conditioned reversal, in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test, in male Wistar rats submitted to chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Then, we evaluated the expression of astrocytes and microglia in animals treated with CBD through the immunofluorescence technique. Our results demonstrated that CBD promoted the reversal of CPP at 3 and 10 mg/kg. In CCI animals, CBD was able to attenuate the increase in neuronal hyperactivity, measured by FosB protein expression, in the regions of the corticolimbic circuit: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), complex baso-lateral amygdala (BLA), granular layer of the dentate gyrus (GrDG), and dorsal hippocampus (DH) -adjacent to subiculum (CA1). CBD also prevented the increased expression of GFAP and IBA-1 in CCI animals. We concluded that CBD effects on CNP are linked to the modulation of the aversive component of pain. These effects decrease chronic neuronal activation and inflammatory markers in regions of the corticolimbic circuit.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive deficits. Sleep deprivation (SD) could lead to memory deficits, and it was a candidate risk factor for AD. However, the effects of chronic SD on the cognitive functions of AD model mice and its possible mechanism are still unclear. In the present study, 8-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice and wild type (WT) littermates were subjected to chronic SD by using the modified multiple platform method (MMPM), with 20 h of SD each day for 21 days. Then, the effects of chronic SD on cognitive functions in APP/PS1 mice were tested by using behavioral tests, the potential mechanisms were investigated by in vivo electrophysiological recording, western blot and immunochemistry. The results showed that chronic SD obviously aggravated the cognitive impairments, exacerbated in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) suppression, reduced the expression level of PSD95, increased amyloid-beta (A beta) protein deposition and overactivated microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that chronic SD exacerbates the cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by accelerating the development of AD pathologies, reducing the expression of PSD95 and aggravating the LTP suppression in hippocampus. At the same time, chronic SD also impaired cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity in WT mice through down-regulating the level of PSD95 and activating microglia. These findings further clarify the electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms of exacerbated cognitive deficits in AD caused by chronic SD.

AB  - Clinical evidence suggests that neuroinflammation, activation of the immune system, and the composition of the intestinal microbiota are involved in the pathology of depression. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a probiotic intervention using Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LL95 in ameliorating mood disorders in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups and treated with 5 mg/kg LPS via intraperitoneal injection to induce depression-like symptoms, followed by oral administration of LL95 for one week (1 x 10(9) CFU/mouse). The animals were then subjected to a series of behavioral assessments, including open field, sucrose preference, and forced swimming tests. In addition, we evaluated the levels of reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta in the hippocampal tissues of these animals, and also determined their fecal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) content. LL95 intervention improved LPS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice, including decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time in the forced swim test. LL95 treatment reversed the LPS-induced increase in hippocampal levels of reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and of interleukin-1 beta to a lesser extent. Furthermore, LL95 intervention increased the fecal LAB content in these animals, suggesting changes in the gut microbiota. These findings suggest that LL95 exerts antidepressant-like effects in LPS-induced depression, which may be attributed to modulation of the oxidative status and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the hippocampus and alteration in the LAB content of the gut microbiota.

AB  - Mucus secreted by goblet cells (GCs) may play an important role in intestinal transit function. Our previous study found that Piezo1 protein is essential for GC function; however, the effect of GC Piezo1 on intestinal transit function is unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of Piezo1 in GCs on intestinal transit and the potential mechanism. We compared intestinal mucus, fecal form, intestinal transit time, intestinal epithelial cell composition, and stem cell function in WT and GC-specific Piezo1-deficient (Piezo1 & UDelta;GC) mice. Our results revealed a correlation between mucus and intestinal transit: the less mucus there was, the slower the intestinal transit. Piezo1 deficiency in GCs led to decreased mucus synthesis and also disrupted the ecological niche of colon stem cells (CSCs). Through organoid culture, we found that the capacity of proliferation and differentiation in Piezo1 & UDelta;GC mouse CSCs was significantly decreased, which also led to a reduced source of GCs. Further studies found that the reduced Wnt and Notch signals in colon crypts might be the potential mechanism. These results indicated the importance of GC Piezo1 in intestinal transit function, which acts by maintaining the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells and mucus.

AB  - WCPFSRSF, an octapeptide (Trp-Cys-Pro-Phe-Ser-Arg-Ser-Phe), has been reported to improve memory in mice, but its gastrointestinal stability is unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the gastrointestinal stability of peptide WCPFSRSF and explore the neuroprotective potential of its digestive fragments. Results showed that the content of WCPFSRSF after gastric and gastrointestinal digestion decreased to 71.64% and less than 1%, respectively. Furthermore, the antioxidant and neuroprotective ability of WCPFSRSF were also affected. Eleven and nine peptides were identified in its gastric and gastrointestinal digestive products, respectively. Multiple bioinformatics tools in combination with principal component analysis were employed to assess the physicochemical and structural properties of peptides. Novel peptides generated after gastrointestinal digestion could be classified into three groups: the first group had high bioactivity and bioavailability; the second group had high amphiphilicity, charge, and net hydrogen; and the third group had a long peptide chain. In addition, the representative peptides WCPF and SR showed neuroprotective ability.

AB  - Histone deacetylase inhibition has been shown to modulate gene expression profiles in plants, thereby influencing the regulatory mechanisms involved in gametic embryogenesis. In this investigation, we examined the impact of various concentrations of trichostatin A (TSA), a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases, on the androgenic response and the expression patterns of key genes associated with embryogenesis and histone deacetylation in anther -derived calli of Camelina sativa L through two separate experiments. Our findings revealed that TSA treatment of buds and also anther-derived calli significantly augmented embryogenesis in camelina anther cultures. The highest number of embryos (1.63 embryo per anther) was observed following pretreatment of buds with 2 mu M TSA in the first experiment. Gene expression analysis indicated marked upregulation of BBM, LEC1, WUS, AGL15, and SERK genes, pivotal regulators implicated in the initiation of embryogenesis, in response to TSA treatments. The highest transcript accumulation for the LEC1, AGL15, and WUS genes was observed in calli derived from 2 mu M TSA treated buds with expression levels 5.91-, 2.12-, and 2.08-fold higher than the control, respectively. Similarly, the application of both 1 mu M and 2 mu M TSA on the buds led to a significant increase in expression levels of BBM (9.58 and 11.16-fold higher than the control, respectively) and SERK (5.15- and 5.77-fold higher than the control, respectively). Furthermore, 2 mu M TSA administration resulted in a significant increase in the expression levels of HDAC6 and HDAC19 genes (2- and 2.71- fold higher than control, respectively) in the first experiment. In second experiment, anther-derived calli treated with 2 mu M TSA resulted to maximum percentage of embryogenic calli and mean embryo per callus (57.78% and 0.61 embryo per callus, respectively). In last experiment, transcript levels of BBM, WUS, AGL15, SERK, LEC1 and HDAC6 genes were found to be significantly elevated (9.42-, 3.90-, 3.35-, 5.60-, 19.16-, and twofold compared to controls, respectively) at a concentration of 2 mu M TSA. Also, the expression levels of HDAC19 significantly enhanced at concentrations of 1 mu M and 2 mu M TSA, reaching 2.47 and 2.71-fold higher than controls, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the expression profiles of embryogenesis genes and both the percentage of anthers producing calli and the average number of embryos per anther in the first experiment.

AB  - Plants rely on systemic signalling mechanisms to establish whole-body defence in response to insect and nematode attacks. GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) genes have been implicated in long-distance transmission of wound signals to initiate the accumulation of the defence hormone jasmonate (JA) at undamaged distal sites. The systemic signalling entails the activation of Ca2+-permeable GLR channels by wound-released glutamate, triggering membrane depolarization and cytosolic Ca2+ influx throughout the whole plant. The systemic electrical and calcium signals rapidly dissipate to restore the resting state, partially due to desensitization of the GLR channels. Here we report the discovery of calmodulin-mediated, Ca2+-dependent desensitization of GLR channels, revealing a negative feedback loop in the orchestration of plant systemic wound responses. A CRISPR-engineered GLR3.3 allele with impaired desensitization showed prolonged systemic electrical signalling and Ca2+ waves, leading to enhanced plant defence against herbivores. Moreover, this Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated desensitization of GLR channels is a highly conserved mechanism in plants, providing a potential target for engineering anti-herbivore defence in crops.

AB  - Crop plants worldwide face various stresses that detrimentally impact their productivity. To ensure sufficient food production for the growing global population, it is essential to develop effective methods for safeguarding crops. Wheat, a critical crop for global food security, was the focus of this study. The objective was to identify a method to enhance the wheat plant's defense against stresses. Among the various approaches considered, defense priming emerged as a highly efficient method for crop protection. Plant defense priming involves a deliberate and controlled strategy employed by plants to enhance their protection against threats. It also allows for the transmission of the primed state to future generations through intergenerational inheritance. In this study, defense priming in wheat against spot blotch disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana was successfully achieved using two strains of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The performance of primed plants was evaluated based on growth parameters, disease phenotype, biochemical parameters, and yield-related traits. Primed plants exhibited superior performance compared to non-primed plants under disease conditions. Interestingly, the primed defense mechanisms were not immediately activated upon PGPR priming but were triggered upon subsequent pathogen challenge. This enhanced defense is evident through increased enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, Ascorbate peroxidase, Catalase), non-enzymatic antioxidants (total phenol content, proline, ascorbic acid), and defense-related enzyme activities, including peroxidases and Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL), in primed plants compared to non-primed plants. This conservation of resources avoids unnecessary activation of defense mechanisms and wasteful consumption of photosynthates. Furthermore, the heritability of priming was investigated, and the offspring of PGPR-primed wheat demonstrated enhanced protection against B. sorokiniana compared to the offspring of non-primed wheat. Yield parameters were also improved in the progeny of primed wheat under biotic stress. Overall, this study highlights the potential of PGPR-mediated intergenerational defense priming as a cost-effective, long-lasting, chemical-free, and sustainable approach for disease management in agriculture. Implementing this strategy could effectively protect crops while minimizing fitness and environmental costs.

Autophagy plays a central role in N recycling and holds potential to improve N utilization, and many AuTophaGy-related genes (ATGs) are involved in the autophagy process. Here, CsATG3a was identified from Camellia sinensis, and the functions involved in N utilization was characterized in arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The transcript level of CsATG3a in tea leaves increases with their maturity. Relative to the wild type (WT) arabidopsis, two CsATG3a-overexpressing (CsATG3a-OE) lines exhibited improved vegetative growth, delayed reproductive stage, and upregulated expression of AtATGs (AtATG3, AtATG5 and AtATG8b) in a low N (LN) hydroponic condition. The expression levels of AtNRT1.1, AtNRT2.1, AtNRT2.2, AtAMT1.1 and AtAMT1.3 for N uptake and transport in roots were all significantly higher in CsATG3a-OE lines compared with those in the WT under LN. Meanwhile, the overexpression of CsATG3a in arabidopsis also increased N and dry matter allocation into both rosette leaves and roots under LN. Additionally, compared with WT, improved HI (harvest index), NHI (N harvest index), NUtE (N utilization efficiency) and NUE (N use efficiency) of CsATG3a-OE lines were further confirmed in a low-N soil cultured experiment. Together, these results concluded that CsATG3a is involved in N recycling and enhances tolerance to LN, indicating that CsATG3a holds potential promise to improve NUE in tea plant.

AB  - Arabidopsis Clade 3 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKEs (GLRs) are primary players in wound-induced systemic signaling. Previous studies focused on dissecting their ligand-activated channel properties involving extracellular and membrane-related domains. Here, we report that the carboxy-terminal tails (C-tails) of GLRs contain key elements controlling their function in wound signaling. GLR3.3 without its C-tail failed to rescue the glr3.3a mutant. We carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the C-tail interactors. We performed functional studies of the interactor by measuring electrical signals and defense responses. Then we mapped their binding sites and evaluated the impact of the sites on GLR functions. IMPAIRED SUCROSE INDUCTION 1 (ISI1) interacted with GLR3.3. Enhanced electrical activity was detected in reduced function isi1 mutants in a GLR3.3-dependent manner. isi1 mutants were slightly more resistant to insect feeding than the wild-type. Furthermore, a triresidue motif RFL in the GLR3.3 C-tail binds to ISI1 in yeast. Finally, we demonstrated that FL residues were conserved across GLRs and functionally required. Our study provides new insights into the functions of GLR C-tails, reveals parallels with the ionotropic glutamate receptor regulation in animal cells, and may enable rational design of strategies to engineer GLRs for future practical applications.

AB  - Plants are able to detect insect eggs deposited on leaves. In Arabidopsis, eggs of the butterfly species Pieris brassicae (common name large white) induce plant defenses and activate the salicylic acid (SA) pathway. We previously discovered that oviposition triggers a systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against the bacterial hemibiotroph pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we show that insect eggs or treatment with egg extract (EE) induce SAR against the fungal necrotroph Botrytis cinerea BMM and the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Noco2. This response is abolished in ics1, ald1 and fmo1, indicating that the SA pathway and the N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) pathway are involved. Establishment of EE-induced SAR in distal leaves potentially involves tryptophan-derived metabolites, including camalexin. Indeed, SAR is abolished in the biosynthesis mutants cyp79B2 cyp79B3, cyp71a12 cyp71a13 and pad3-1, and camalexin is toxic to B. cinerea in vitro. This study reveals an interesting mechanism by which lepidopteran eggs interfere with plant-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Plant leaves that are exposed to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) respond by increasing their defenses, a phenomenon referred to as priming. Whether this phenomenon also occurs in the roots is unknown. Using maize plants, Zea mays, whose leaves respond strongly to leaf HIPVs, we measured the impact of belowground HIPVs, emanating from roots infested by the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata, on constitutive and herbivore-induced levels of defense-related gene expression, phytohormones, volatile and non-volatile primary and secondary metabolites, growth and herbivore resistance in roots of neighbouring plants. HIPV exposure did not increase constitutive or induced levels of any of the measured root traits. Furthermore, HIPV exposure did not reduce the performance or survival of D. balteata on maize or its ancestor teosinte. Cross-exposure experiments between HIPVs from roots and leaves revealed that maize roots, in contrast to maize leaves, neither emit nor respond strongly to defense-regulating HIPVs. Together, these results demonstrate that volatile-mediated defense regulation is restricted to the leaves of maize. This finding is in line with the lower diffusibility of volatiles in the soil and the availability of other, potentially more efficient, information conduits below ground.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In temperate regions, aphid biological control in greenhouses is mostly achieved by the regular release of biocontrol agents. Due to the rapid growth rate of the aphid population, biocontrol agents must be released frequently in order to be present before pest outbreaks and to act rapidly to prevent exceeding the economic threshold. Banker plants reduce these numerous releases by providing natural enemies with a high-quality environment to develop and reproduce. Optimally, banker plants should be easy to produce, resistant to environmental conditions, provide a large amount of suitable banker prey in order to produce a high number of biocontrol agents, and resist the herbivory pressure of the banker prey. The present study aimed to compare the value of three banker plant candidates of the Poaceae family under laboratory and greenhouse conditions: barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn), and corn (Zea mays L.).
   RESULTS: Our results show that the three plants were suitable for different contexts. Finger millet yielded the biggest fresh plant biomass, supported the highest load of banker prey, and resisted aphid feeding longer than the other plant species. Corn was the cheapest to produce, and barley was the fastest to grow.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, finger millet could be more fitted for long crop cycles, pests with rapid population growth rates, and voracious or fast-reproducing biocontrol agents. Meanwhile, barley and corn may be better suited for rapid crop cycles, pests with slow population growth rates, and biocontrol agents that are not too voracious or have low reproductive rates.

AB  - Mosquito allergy has been conceived as the cutaneous reactions that appears during and after mosquito biting process; a perception that is supported by several scientific research. Additional data have led to conceive that other manifestations of allergic responses may occur as a cause of the exposure to somatic mosquito allergens. Two main phenotypes of mosquito allergy are identifiable: the cutaneous allergic reactions, induced by salivary allergens, and other manifestations of the allergic responses such as asthma and allergic rhino conjunctivitis that are caused by somatic allergens. The cutaneous reactions have kept the focus of attention of the scientific community. It appears as skin lesions that resembles the phenotype of papular urticaria with a defined natural history of the disease. Although these two phenotypes of mosquito allergy seem to be well differentiated in terms of the allergens that are involved and the routes of exposures, other factors such as geographical distribution, may participate. Mosquitoes have adapted to the host immune response against bites, producing immunomodulatory molecules that counteract such defensive response. The role that the immunomodulatory molecules have on the allergic immune response has not been studied yet and it is still not known if affects all mosquito allergy phenotypes. Only a few studies of allergen specific immunotherapy for cutaneous allergic reactions induced by mosquito bites have been done, and none for respiratory allergic responses. The clinical practice focuses on symptom management and avoiding mosquito bites as much as possible. Avoiding mosquitoes, using different well described methods, is still the best option to limit contact with these insects. The lack of knowledge of mosquito allergy have raised several questions that affects the clinical management of this allergic disease, from its diagnosis, prevention and immunotherapy.

AB  - The epidermal adhesive structure of many animals generates reliable adhesion on their engaged surfaces. However, current bio-inspired adhesion structures are difficult to function well in dry and underwater environments simultaneously. Interestingly, the male Dytiscus lapponicus attaches firmly to the rough shell of the female D. lapponicus in both dry and underwater conditions owing to the adhesive setae of its forelegs, and to the best of our knowledge, designing adhesive structures on multienvironments has never been reported. Here, a D. lapponicus-inspired adhesion structure (DIAS) is proposed and fabricated using double-exposure-fill molding technology accompanied with the material curing shrinkage, in which different structural features could be achieved by varying curing shrinkage ratios, elastic moduli, and back exposure time. The DIAS offered high, reversible, and repeatable strength in dry and underwater conditions with values of 205 and 133 kPa, respectively. By comparing the adhesion properties of different shapes via testing experiments and numerical analysis, a structural feature with an inclination of 15 degrees was found to be optimal. Finally, the potential application of the DIAS in flexible electronic smart skin-attachable devices was demonstrated on a pig skin, paving the way for further bio-inspired adhesive designs for both dry and wet scenarios.

AB  - Saponins from leaves of Quillaja lancifolia, a native species from southern Brazil, show potent immunoadjuvant activity in experimental vaccine formulations. The accumulation of the immunoadjuvant saponin fraction QB-90 is induced in cultured leaf disks and seedlings by several stresses and stress signaling molecules, such as osmotic agents, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, mechanical damage, ultrasound, UV-C radiation, and high light irradiance. These observations suggest a role in plant defense. To further examine this possibility, an investigation of the potential inhibitory role of Q. lancifolia saponins on plant and human pathogenic fungi and two herbivore models was carried out. The screening tests showed that saponin-rich fractions, particularly QB-90, were able to significantly inhibit the growth of Bipolaris micropus, Curvularia inaequalis, Fusarium incarnatum, and Cryptococcus gattii R265. The same metabolites acted as deterrents against the generalist mollusk and insect herbivores Helix aspersa and Spodoptera frugiperda, respectively. Significant reductions in consumption of leaf area and larvae body weight were recorded. Taken together, these data indicate a role for Q. lancifolia saponins in plant defense against diverse herbivores and fungi, having potential as a natural pest control agent and/or as a molecular platform for the development of new environmentally friendly biocide molecules.

AB  - Resprouting is crucial in population dynamics in response to wildfires or herbivory. This trait, common in angiosperms, is considered rare in conifers, being Pinus canariensis one of the few species able to resprout. We analyzed gene expression during wound-induced resprouting in 5 years-old Canarian pines. RNA was extracted at three different stages, including control samples from remote branches, representing immediate response to wounding (R0), resprouting initiation (R1), and elongation (R2), and then hybridized to a microarray designed with 15,000 cDNAs from Pinus canariensis transcriptome of meristematic activity. We found 1164 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), of which 903 were significant in R0, 278 in R1, and 261 in R2. Genes related to defense- and stress-response were mainly found to be overexpressed at R0, while DEGs coding for transcription factors such as GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF), FLOWERING-PROMOTING FACTOR (FPF), and the HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER Class IV (HD-ZIP IV), mainly related to outgrowth processes and lateral organogenesis in plants, showed overexpression at R1 and R2, when new shoots were emerging. This data was compared to differential gene expression during apical growth in P. canariensis, suggesting similarities between vegetative apical growth and regulation of lateral shoot development in response to mechanical wounding, but also yielding 32 DEGs exclusively overexpressed at some point during resprouting stages (R1 and/or R2). The implication of such transcription factor families, with important roles in leaf and inflorescence development also in flowering plants, suggests underlying homologies between common lateral organogenesis processes in angiosperms and resprouting in gymnosperms.

AB  - Plants have evolved constitutive and inductive defense mechanisms to protect themselves from herbivorous insects. Metabolites in plants are thought to be involved in response to herbivores. Bambusa emeiensis is an important bamboo species widely distributed in Southwest China. It is easy to attract herbivores such as Cyrtotrachelus buqueti. Through the detection and analysis of metabolites in B. emeiensis metabolomic data, 35 differential metabolites (biomarkers) were finally identified from 206 detection peaks, mainly primary metabolites. Subsequently, we conducted an association analysis between 35 biomarkers that annotated to be involved in 71 metabolic pathways in the metabolome and 324 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 207 gene expression pathways distributed in the transcriptome of B. emeiensis after feeding by C. buqueti. We also discussed the relationship between the changes in gene expression levels and metabolite content variation. A total of 47 integrated pathways containing the corresponding DEGs and biomarkers were screened out, with the amino acid synthesis pathway (ko01230) containing the most DEGs and biomarkers. In these integrated pathways, the changes in biomarkers content and the expression levels of the corresponding genes were generally consistent. For example, the increase in tryptophan content was accompanied by an increase in the expression of the corresponding catalase in the tryptophan synthesis pathway. Similar to this was glucose and trehalose in carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, this study further deepened our understanding of the defense mechanism of B. emeiensis against bamboo pests and provided new insights for the prevention and control of bamboo diseases and pests.

AB  - Crop damage by herbivorous insects remains a significant contributor to annual yield reductions. Following attack, maize (Zea mays) responds to herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating dynamic direct and indirect antiherbivore defense responses. To define underlying signaling processes, comparative analyses between plant elicitor peptide (Pep) DAMPs and fatty acid-amino acid conjugate (FAC) HAMPs were conducted. RNA sequencing analysis of early transcriptional changes following Pep and FAC treatments revealed quantitative differences in the strength of response yet a high degree of qualitative similarity, providing evidence for shared signaling pathways. In further comparisons of FAC and Pep responses across diverse maize inbred lines, we identified Mo17 as part of a small subset of lines displaying selective FAC insensitivity. Genetic mapping for FAC sensitivity using the intermated B73 x Mo17 population identified a single locus on chromosome 4 associated with FAC sensitivity. Pursuit of multiple fine-mapping approaches further narrowed the locus to 19 candidate genes. The top candidate gene identified, termed FAC SENSITIVITY ASSOCIATED (ZmFACS), encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that belongs to the same family as a rice (Oryza sativa) receptor gene previously associated with the activation of induced responses to diverse Lepidoptera. Consistent with reduced sensitivity, ZmFACS expression was significantly lower in Mo17 as compared to B73. Transient heterologous expression of ZmFACS in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in a significantly increased FAC-elicited response. Together, our results provide useful resources for studying early elicitor-induced antiherbivore responses in maize and approaches to discover gene candidates underlying HAMP sensitivity in grain crops.

AB  - Histamine H3 receptors (H3Rs) are involved in several neuropsychiatric diseases including epilepsy. Therefore, the effects of H3R antagonist E177 (5 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) were evaluated on acute pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced memory impairments, oxidative stress levels (glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)), various brain neurotransmitters (histamine (HA), acetylcholine (ACh), ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA)), and glutamate (Glu), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, and c-fos protein expression in rats. E177 (5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly prolonged step-through latency (STL) time in single-trial passive avoidance paradigm (STPAP), and shortened transfer latency time (TLT) in elevated plus maze paradigm (EPMP) (all P < 0.05). Moreover, and in the hippocampus of PTZ-treated animals, E177 mitigated abnormal levels of AChE activity, ACh and HA (all P < 0.05), but failed to modify brain levels of GABA and Glu. Furthermore, E177 alleviated hippocampal oxidative stress by significantly decreasing the elevated levels of MDA, and increasing the abnormally decreased level of GSH (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, E177 reduced elevated levels of hippocampal c-fos protein expression in hippocampal tissues of PTZ-treated animals (all P < 0.05). The observed results propose the potential of H3R antagonist E177 with an added advantage of avoiding cognitive impairment, emphasizing the H3Rs as a prospective target for future pharmacological management of epilepsy with associated memory impairments.

AB  - Onion (Allium cepa L.) is an important seasoning vegetable worldwide. It belongs to the Allium genus, which produces distinctive flavor compounds, allicin/isoallicin. It has been known that allicin/isoallicin is produced upon cell damage by vacuole-localized alliinase releasing. Pungent isoallicin and lachrymaroty factor (LF) are unique features of onions. To understand the isoallicin system of onions, we identified and characterized the biosynthesis-related genes by displaying transcriptional profiles and analyzing the isoallicin contents of onion plants. The DHW30006 onion genome encoded 64 alliinase (ALL) and 29 LF synthase (LFS) proteins, which are the key enzymes for producing of isoallicin and LF. Interestingly, when we analyzed the N-terminal signal peptide sequences (SP) necessary for transport to the vacuole, we found that 14 ALLs contained the SP (SP-ALL) and 50 ALLs did not (non-SP-ALL). We hypothesized that non-SP-ALLs stayed in the cytosol of onion cells, reacted with isoalliin, and generated isoallicin without cell damage. Our transcriptome and LC-MS/MS analyses reveal that isoallicin levels vary significantly across onion tissues and growth stages, with substantial production occurring in intact cells through cytosolic alliinases and an increase through vacuolar alliinases upon tissue disruption. This novel observation suggests that the isoallicin system in onions functions as a dual-defense mechanism: cytosolic alliinases maintain a constant level of defense against biotic stress in undamaged tissues, while vacuolar alliinases enhance isoallicin production in response to tissue damage by herbivory and insects. Together, these coordinated mechanisms demonstrate an adaptable and dynamic defense strategy against biotic stresses in Allium plants.

AB  - Insect-induced plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may function as either direct defence molecules to deter insects or indirect defence signals to attract the natural enemies of the invading insects. Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), an important leaf-based beverage crop, is mainly infested by Ectropis obliqua which causes the most serious damage. Here, we report a mechanistic investigation of tea plant-derived VOCs in an indirect defence mechanism against E. obliqua. Parasitoid wasp Parapanteles hyposidrae, a natural enemy of E. obliqua, showed strong electrophysiological response and selection behaviour towards S-linalool and beta-ocimene, two monoterpenes with elevated emission from E. obliqua-damaged tea plants. Larvae frass of E. obliqua, which also released S-linalool and beta-ocimene, was found to attract both mated female or male Pa. hyposidrae according to gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection and Y-tube olfactometer assays. In a field setting, both S-linalool and beta-ocimene were effective in recruiting both female and male Pa. hyposidrae wasps. To understand the molecular mechanism of monoterpenes-mediated indirect defence in tea plants, two novel monoterpene synthase genes, CsLIS and CsOCS-SCZ, involved in the biosynthesis of S-linalool or beta-ocimene, respectively, were identified and biochemically characterised. When the expression of these two genes in tea plants was inhibited by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, both volatile emission and attraction of wasps were reduced. Furthermore, gene expression analysis suggested that the expression of CsLIS and CsOCS-SCZ is regulated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway in the tea plant.

AB  - Sap-sucking insects cause severe damage to cotton production. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital regulatory roles in various development processes and stress response, however, the function of lncRNAs during sap-sucking insect infection in cotton is largely unknown. In this study, the transcriptome profiles between resistant (HR) and susceptible (ZS) cotton cultivars under whitefly infestation at different time points (0, 4, 12, 24, and 48 h) were compared. A total of 6,651 lncRNAs transcript and 606 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified from the RNA-seq data. A co-expression network indicated that lncA07 and lncD09 were potential hub genes that play a regulatory role in cotton defense against aphid infestation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out mutant of lncD09 and lncA07 showed a decrease of jasmonic acid (JA) content, which potentially lead to increased susceptibility toward insect infestation. Differentially expressed genes between wild type and lncRNA knock-out plants are enriched in modulating development and resistance to stimulus. Additionally, some candidate genes such as Ghir_A01G022270, Ghir_D04G014430, and Ghir_A01G022270 are involved in the regulation of the JA-mediated signaling pathway. This result provides a novel insight of the lncRNA role in the cotton defense system against pests.

AB  - Pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) inhibits pectin methylesterase (PME) activity at post-translation level, which plays core roles in vegetative and reproductive processes and various stress responses of plants. However, the roles of PMEIs in tea plant are still undiscovered. Herein, a total of 51 CsPMEIs genes were identified from tea plant genome. CsPMEI1-4 transcripts were varied in different tea plant tissues and regulated by various treatments, including biotic and abiotic stresses, sugar treatments, cold acclimation and bud dormancy. Overexpression of CsPMEI4 slightly decreased cold tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis associated with lower electrolyte leakage, soluble sugars contents and transcripts of many cold-induced genes as compared to wild type plants. Under long-day and short-day conditions, CsPMEI2/4 promoted early flowering phenotypes in transgenic Arabidopsis along with higher expression levels of many flowering-related genes. Moreover, overexpression of CsPMEI2/4 decreased PME activity, but increased sugars contents (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) in transgenic Arabidopsis as compared with wild type plants under short-day condition. These results indicate that CsPMEIs are widely involved in tea plant vegetative and reproductive processes, and also in various stress responses. Moreover, CsPMEI4 negatively regulated cold response, meanwhile, CsPMEI2/4 promoted early flowering of transgenic Arabidopsis via the autonomous pathway. Collectively, these results open new perspectives on the roles of PMEIs in tea plant.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult hippocampus are composed of multiple subpopulations. However, their origin and functional heterogeneity are still unclear. Here, we found that the contribution of murine Wnt-responsive (Axin2+) and Hedgehog-responsive (Gli1+) embryonic neural progenitors to adult NSCs started from early and late postnatal stages, respectively. Axin2+ adult NSCs were intended to actively proliferate, whereas Gli1+ adult NSCs were relatively quiescent and responsive to external stimuli. Moreover, Gli1+ NSC-derived adult-born neurons exhibited more complex dendritic arborization and connectivity than Axin2+ NSC-derived ones. Importantly, genetic cell ablation analysis identified that Axin2+ and Gli1+ adult NSCs were involved in hippocampus-dependent learning, but only Axin2+ adult NSCs were engaged in buffering stress responses and depressive behavior. Together, our study not only defined the heterogeneous multiple origins of adult NSCs but also advanced the concept that different subpopulations of adult NSCs may function differently.

AB  - Plants have evolved the ability to respond to a diverse range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Often, combining these stresses multiplies the challenge for the plants, but occasionally the combined stress can induce unexpected synergistic defences. In maize, combined flooding and herbivory induces a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defence against Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). In this study we used RNAseq and metabolic profiling to show that flavonoids are involved in maize response to combined flooding and herbivory. To assess the role of flavonoids in flood-induced S. frugiperda resistance, we analyzed the maize idf mutant that has compromised expression of chalcone synthase, the first enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. This flavonoid-deficient mutant was compromised both in flood-induced S. frugiperda resistance and in SA accumulation. These data revealed an unexpected requirement for flavonoids in SA induction. In contrast to idf, the flavonoid 3 ' hydroxylase mutant, pr1, showed enhanced SA accumulation after combinatorial treatment, which closely correlated with elevated levels of select flavonoids and the dihydroflavonol reductase, anthocyaninless1 (a1) mutant, was unaffected in its SA-induction. These data indicate that specific flavonoids likely play a role in flood-induced SA accumulation and S. frugiperda resistance.

AB  - Plants deploy cellular calcium (Ca2+) elevation in environmental stress signaling. Extracellular ATP (eATP) is released into the extracellular matrix when cells are wounded. DOES NOT RESPOND TO NUCLEOTIDES 1 (DORN1), a key legume-type lectin receptor, senses and binds eATP and activates Ca2+ signaling. No evidence directly links calcium-mediated eATP signaling to resistance against insect herbivores. Here, we report up-regulation of DORN1 transcripts in response to wounding and Spodoptera litura feeding in Arabidopsis. Loss of function of DORN1 resulted in increased S. litura feeding compared with the wild type. Plant immunity was compromised in dorn1 mutants as they showed reduced S. litura oral secretion-mediated Ca2+ elevation, jasmonic acid accumulation, and expression of jasmonate responsive genes. The herbivory-induced calcium channel, CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL 19 (CNGC19), co-expresses with DORN1. We found that eATP-induced Ca2+ elevation requires functional CNGC19. Loss of function of DORN1 and CNGC19 substantially increased the susceptibility to S. litura, mediated by reduced accumulation of jasmonates. We also demonstrated a plausible interaction of CNGC19 with DORN1. Our results indicate damage-released eATP and its receptor DORN1 in herbivory-induced defense signaling. DORN1 together with the Ca2+ channel CNGC19 generate the eATP-induced Ca2+ elevation, leading to the activation of immune signaling.

AB  - Herbivory activates responses in local and systemic leaves, and the glutamate receptor-like genes GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are critical in leaf-to-leaf systemic signalling. However, whether and how these genes mediate plant systemic resistance to insects remain largely unexplored. We show that a piercing-sucking insect Myzus persicae (green peach aphid, GPA) or chewing insect Spodoptera litura (cotton leafworm, CLW) feeding-induced systemic defences were attenuated in the glr3.3 glr3.6 mutants. In response to herbivory from either insect, glr3.3 glr3.6 mutants exhibited reduced accumulation of the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and defensive metabolites glucosinolates (GSs) in systemic (but not local) leaves. Transcriptome analysis indicated that GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 play an important role in regulating the transcriptional responses to GPA and simulated CLW feeding in both local and systemic leaves, including JA- and GS-related genes. Metabolome analysis also revealed that in response to GPA or simulated CLW feeding, GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are involved in the regulation of various metabolites locally and systemically, including amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the function of GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 in mediating transcripts and metabolites in local and systemic leaves under insect attack, and highlights their role in regulating insect resistance in systemic leaves.
   GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are essential for insect feeding-induced systemic defence by regulating transcripts and metabolites under insect attack.

AB  - The D3 dopamine receptor (DRD3) plays a major role in cognitive function and is a candidate gene for schizophrenia. DRD3 is widely distributed in the hippocampus, but whether there are potential associations between the rs6280 genotype, the hippocampus, and cognitive function in first-episode, drug-naive (FES) patients and healthy controls (HCs) is still poorly understood. First, using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data, we calculated the gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus. Then, we examined the possible interaction effect of the DRD3 genotype and the disease on the FC and GMV of the hippocampus in 52 FES patients and 51 HCs. Finally, the correlation between the FC and GMV in the hippocampus, influenced by rs6280, and the cognitive performance of subjects was analyzed. A significant interaction effect of diagnostic group by genotype of rs6280 on the GMV of the left hippocampus was found, with lower GMV in FES patients that were C carriers compared with TT homozygotes; the opposite pattern was found in the genetic subgroups of HCs. In the FES group, C carriers performed significantly worse on reasoning and problem-solving tests than TT homozygotes. The left hippocampal GMV positively correlated with reasoning and problem-solving performance in TT homozygotes, but this correlation disappeared in FES patients that were C carriers and in genetic subgroups of HCs. Together, these results suggest that FES patients that are C carriers of rs6280 have lower GMV in the hippocampus, resulting in greater cognitive impairment.

AB  - Viruses alter plant traits over time, which can further influence interactions between plants and insect vectors that transmit those viruses. However, the signaling pathways and regulators that control these temporal responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we used insect performance and preference bioassays, RNA-seq, and genetic tools to identify underlying mechanisms mediating temporal variation in plant-virus-vector interactions. We show that settlement and fecundity of the aphid vector, Myzus persicae, is increased on potato virus Y (PVY)-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants two weeks post inoculation but not after six weeks. RNA-seq analysis revealed that transcripts related to plant defense and amino acid biosynthesis are upregulated in response to PVY infection and down regulated in response to aphid herbivory, and these patterns changed over time. Based on this analysis we identified a sesquiterpene synthase gene, terpene synthase 1 (NbTPS1), that is upregulated early in PVY infection, but not later in infection. Using virus-induced gene silencing and transient overexpression in N. benthamiana, we demonstrate that PVY induction of NbTPS1 is required for increased aphid attraction to PVY-infected plants in the early stages of infection. These findings reveal that PVY temporally modulates transcriptional pathways associated with plant defense responses and volatile organic compounds that influence the behavior of aphid vectors.

AB  - Myrosinase enzymes play a key role in the chemical defense of plants of the order Brassicales. Upon herbivory, myrosinases hydrolyze the beta-S-linked glucose moiety of glucosinolates, the characteristic secondary metabolites of brassicaceous plants, which leads to the formation of different toxic hydrolysis products. The specialist flea beetle, Phyllotreta armoraciae, is capable of accumulating high levels of glucosinolates in the body and can thus at least partially avoid plant myrosinase activity. In feeding experiments with the myrosinase-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana tgg1 x tgg2 (tgg) mutant and the corresponding Arabidopsis Col-0 wild type, we investigated the influence of plant myrosinase activity on the metabolic fate of ingested glucosinolates in adult P. armoraciae beetles. Arabidopsis myrosinases hydrolyzed a fraction of ingested glucosinolates and thereby reduced the glucosinolate sequestration rate by up to 50% in adult beetles. These results show that P. armoraciae cannot fully prevent glucosinolate hydrolysis; however, the exposure of adult beetles to glucosinolate hydrolysis products had no impact on the beetle's energy budget under our experimental conditions. To understand how P. armoraciae can partially prevent glucosinolate hydrolysis, we analyzed the short-term fate of ingested glucosinolates and found them to be rapidly absorbed from the gut. In addition, we determined the fate of ingested Arabidopsis myrosinase enzymes in P. armoraciae. Although we detected Arabidopsis myrosinase protein in the feces, we found only traces of myrosinase activity, suggesting that P. armoraciae can inactivate plant myrosinases in the gut. Based on our findings, we propose that the ability to tolerate plant myrosinase activity and a fast glucosinolate uptake mechanism represent key adaptations of P. armoraciae to their brassicaceous host plants.

AB  - Tea is a popular cash crop around the world that often endures low temperatures in the spring, thereby negatively affecting tea yield and quality. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Clariodeoglomus etunicatum, on plant growth, root morphology, leaf food quality, associated gene expression, and secondary metabolite profiles in tea (Camellia sinensis cv. Fuding Dabaicha) seedlings grown at low temperatures. A seven-day low temperature (4 degrees C) treatment significantly reduced root colonization rate by C. etunicatum by 21.08%. Uninoculated plants' growth was considerably impeded by low temperatures, whereas C. etunicatum inoculation significantly increased leaf number and leaf, stem and root biomass at low temperatures. Low temperatures had little effect on root morphology, whereas C. etunicatum inoculation significantly increased root surface area at low temperatures. In addition, low temperatures reduced leaf quality variables, whereas C. etunicatum significantly increased the levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, tea polyphenols, catechin, free amino acids, and caffeine at low temperatures, along with up-regulated expression of CsGDH, CsGOGAT, and CsHMGR, as well as down-regulated expression of CsGs. Non-targeted metabolomics identified 767 differential metabolites, of which 65 differential metabolites were observed at low temperatures by C. etunicatum inoculation, including 42 (e.g., catechin, (-)-epicatechingallate, protoanemonin, epicatechin, and 4dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid) up-regulated and 23 (e.g., 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, raffinose, L-theanine, melezitose, and D-serine) down-regulated. Mycorrhiza-triggered differential metabolites enriched 268 metabolic pathways at low temperatures, including isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, lysine biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and others. These findings reveal that C. etunicatum can function as a fungal stimulant to improve the plant growth and leaf quality in tea while also changing the secondary metabolite profile at low temperatures.

AB  - Vitellogenins (Vgs) are critical for the development and fecundity of insects. As such, these essential proteins can be used by plants to reliably sense the presence of insects.We addressed this with a combination of molecular and chemical analyses, genetic transformation, bioactivity tests, and insect performance assays.The small N-terminal subunit of Vgs of the planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (NlVgN) was found to trigger strong defense responses in rice when it enters the plants during feeding or oviposition by the insect. The defenses induced by NlVgN not only decreased the hatching rate of N. lugens eggs, but also induced volatile emissions in plants, which rendered them attractive to a common egg parasitoid. VgN of other planthoppers triggered the same defenses in rice. We further show that VgN deposited during planthopper feeding compared with during oviposition induces a somewhat different response, probably to target the appropriate developmental stage of the insect.We also confirm that NlVgN is essential for planthopper growth, development, and fecundity. This study demonstrates that VgN in planthopper eggs and saliva acts as a reliable and unavoidable elicitor of plant defenses. Its importance for insect performance precludes evolutionary adaptions to prevent detection by rice plants.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), chemicals produced by plants infested by herbivorous insects, can act as kairomones that recruit natural enemies of the pest herbivore. Agrotis segetum (Denis and Schiffermuller) is a common, important pest of seedling cotton in Xinjiang Province, China, and the braconid Microplitis mediator (Haliday) is an important mortality factor of this pest's larvae. In olfactometer tests, which included healthy foliage, infested foliage, or infested roots, M. mediator preferred A. segetum-infested cotton plants to healthy cotton plants. In GC-MS analyses of plant-emitted volatiles, we found that compounds emitted increased 14.9- and 13.3- fold after leaf infestation and root infestation, respectively, compared to healthy control plants. The volatiles were mainly p-xylene, nonanal, tetradecane, decanal, benzaldehyde, beta-caryophyllene, and humulene, while linalool was only present in the leaf-infestation treatment. In addition, principal component analysis indicated that all 18 compounds were associated with the infested plants, especially beta-caryophyllene, p-xylene, and decanal. Based on the above studies and previous functional evaluations of the volatile compounds, it can be demonstrated that these compounds play a crucial role in modulating the interactions between A. segetum and M. mediator and regulating parasitoid behavior. It may be possible to enhance the biological control of A. segetum by M. mediator through the application of HIPVs.

AB  - Plant volatile signaling triggers defense responses via epigenetic transcriptional regulation of ethylene response factor genes to sustain the anti-herbivore trait.
   Plants perceive volatiles emitted from herbivore-damaged neighboring plants to urgently adapt or prime their defense responses to prepare for forthcoming herbivores. Mechanistically, these volatiles can induce epigenetic regulation based on histone modifications that alter the transcriptional status of defense genes, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. To understand the roles of such epigenetic regulation of plant volatile signaling, we explored the response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to the volatile beta-ocimene. Defense traits of Arabidopsis plants toward larvae of Spodoptera litura were induced in response to beta-ocimene, through enriched histone acetylation and elevated transcriptional levels of defense gene regulators, including ethylene response factor genes (ERF8 and ERF104) in leaves. The enhanced defense ability of the plants was maintained for 5 d but not over 10 d after exposure to beta-ocimene, and this coincided with elevated expression of those ERFs in their leaves. An array of histone acetyltransferases, including HAC1, HAC5, and HAM1, were responsible for the induction and maintenance of the anti-herbivore property. HDA6, a histone deacetylase, played a role in the reverse histone remodeling. Collectively, our findings illuminate the role of epigenetic regulation in plant volatile signaling.

AB  - Upon sensing attack by pathogens and insect herbivores, plants release complex mixtures of volatile compounds. Here, we show that the infection of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) plants with the non-host bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato led to the production of microbe-induced plant volatiles (MIPVs). Surprisingly, the bacterial type III secretion system, which injects effector proteins directly into the plant cytosol to subvert host functions, was found to prime both intra- and inter-specific defense responses in neighbouring wild tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants. Screening of each of 16 effectors using the Pseudomonas fluorescens effector-to-host analyser revealed that an effector, HopP1, was responsible for immune activation in receiver tobacco plants. Further study demonstrated that 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone and 3-octanol are novel MIPVs emitted by the lima bean plant in a HopP1-dependent manner. Exposure to synthetic 1-octen-3-ol activated immunity in tobacco plants against a virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. Our results show for the first time that a bacterial type III effector can trigger the emission of C8 plant volatiles that mediate defense priming via plant-plant interactions. These results provide novel insights into the role of airborne chemicals in bacterial pathogen-induced inter-specific plant-plant interactions.

AB  - Background: MicroRNAs like miR-146a and miR-29c are potential biomarkers for diabetes, which is linked to brain impairments such as cognitive decline and hippocampal dysfunction due to hyperglycemia and inflammation. This study investigates the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on hippocampal miR-146a and miR-29c expression and serum TNF-alpha levels in diabetic rats, highlighting its role in reducing inflammation and improving brain function. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control (Normal), 1-week diabetes (Diabetes 1 W), 6-week diabetes (Diabetes 6 W), and diabetic HIIT (Diabetes-Exe). Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (55 mg/kg) and rats with blood glucose > 250 mg/dL were included. HIIT was conducted for six weeks, and hippocampal miR-146a, miR-29c expression, and TNF-alpha serum levels were assessed using Real-Time PCR and ELISA. TNF-alpha serum levels were measured as a marker of systemic inflammation. Results: Diabetic rats exhibited decreased miR-146a and increased miR-29c expression in the hippocampus compared to controls. Additionally, TNF-alpha serum levels were significantly higher in the diabetic groups, indicating an elevated inflammatory state. HIIT in the Diabetes-Exe group resulted in a non-significant change in miR-29c expression and TNF-alpha serum levels, accompanied by a significant increase in miR-146a expression compared to the Diabetes 6 W group. Conclusion: HIIT exercise may help reduce hippocampal neuronal damage in diabetic rats by modulating miR-146a expression, improving blood glucose control, and reducing inflammation. Although HIIT did not significantly alter miR-29c expression, its potential as an effective non-pharmacological strategy for managing diabetic neuropathy complications cannot be excluded.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the triple-hit schizophrenia-like model rats (Wisket) by the assessment of (1) behavioral parameters in different test conditions (reward-based Ambitus test and HomeManner system) for a prolonged period, (2) cerebral muscarinic M1 receptor (M1R) expression, and (3) the effects of olanzapine treatment on these parameters. Wistar (control) and Wisket rats were injected for three consecutive weeks with olanzapine depot (100 mg/kg) and spent 4 weeks in large cages with environmental enrichment (HomeManner). The vehicle-treated Wisket rats spent longer time awake with decreased grooming activity compared to controls, without changes in their active social behavior (sniffing, playing, fighting) obtained in HomeManner. Olanzapine treatment decreased most of these parameters, only the passive social interaction (huddling during sleeping) enhanced mostly in the Wisket rats on the injection day, which recovered within 4 days. In the Ambitus test, vehicle-treated Wisket rats showed lower locomotor and exploratory activities and impaired cognition compared to control rats, deteriorating by olanzapine in both groups. In Wisket brain samples, the M1R mRNA expression was significantly lower in the cerebral cortex and elevated in the hippocampus, with no difference in the prefrontal cortex versus control. Olanzapine normalized the hippocampal M1R expression, but enhanced it in the prefrontal cortex. The triple-hit Wisket model rats had impaired behavioral characteristics in both acute reward-based test and undisturbed circumstances investigated for prolonged periods, and altered cerebral M1R expression. Chronic olanzapine treatment resulted deterioration of some parameters in control group, and could restore only few negative signs in model rats.

AB  - Objectives In the present study, we aimed to determine whether intraperitoneal injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) could have a neuroprotective effect on learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity impairment as well as hippocampal apoptosis in rats with hepatic encephalopathy induced by bile duct ligated (BDL). Methods The rats were divided into four groups: the control, sham, BDL+ V (vehicle), and BDL+ PRP. The BDL rats were treated with PRP immediately after the surgery, and the injection was done every 3 days for 30 days. The passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests were used for the evaluation of learning and memory. The long-term potentiation (LTP), basal-synaptic transmission, and paired-pulse ratio, as an index for measurement of neurotransmitter release probability, were evaluated by field-potential recording. After taking a blood sample for assessment of the liver enzymes, the animals were sacrificed and their hippocampus was removed for evaluation of cleaved caspase-3 by Western blot. Results Serological assessment of the liver function showed that BDL severely impaired the liver function. Also, PRP treatment could partially improve the liver dysfunction along with recovery in fear memory and spatial learning memory performance, LTP, basal-synaptic transmission, and neurotransmitter release probability. PRP-treated rats also showed a significant reduction in neuronal apoptosis in the CA1 area. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that PRP improves cognitive performance and synaptic plasticity in BDL rats via direct neuroprotective property and/or indirectly by improvement of hepatic dysfunction.

AB  - In the last decade, attention has been drawn to a defense priming mechanism between plants of the same species through volatile organic compounds so that neighboring plants can prepare for the potential arrival of herbivorous insects. The induction of plant response priming by Tetranychus urticae Koch (Tetranychidae) in Phaseolus vulgaris (Fabaceae) seedlings was evaluated through different communication pathways, focusing on resistance mechanisms (physical and chemical defenses: thickness, hardness, and foliar phenols) and plant tolerance (stem length, diameter, leaf area, and number of leaves). Five treatments were established: (1) Emitting seedling (with T. urticae); (2) direct communication (sender and recipient seedlings separated at 40 cm with free transfer of mites); (3) aerial communication (sender and recipient seedlings communicated aerially at 40 cm, but physically excluded from T. urticae); (4) positive control (seedling isolated but with T. urticae); and (5) negative control (seedling isolated and without T. urticae). Plant defense priming responses were recorded, interestingly, by different means of communication: aerial for tolerance and direct for resistance. When responses were induced by air rather than directly, trade-offs between plant resistance versus tolerance to herbivory were found. Notably, the principal component analysis showed a clear grouping of the variables of tolerance toward air communication and resistance toward direct communication. This strongly suggests the existence of different activation pathways for plant communication depending on tolerance and resistance mechanisms, a potential result of energy production costs.

AB  - The accumulation of the livestock-harming cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in the vegetative tissues limits the use of sorghum as a major pasture crop. This study integrates transcriptomics and metabolomics data from the ICSV 93046, CSH 24-MF and ICSR 14001 genotypes, which differ in drought tolerance and cyanide potential (HCNp), to understand the molecular processes of cyanogenesis under drought stress conditions. While ICSV 93046 showed drought adaptation and reduced HCNp, ICSR 14001 and CSH 24-MF exhibited decreased drought stress tolerance with HCN accumulation. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) data showed drought-related genes were significantly upregulated in ICSV 93046 but downregulated in ICSR 14001. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enriched dhurrin biosynthesis and cyanoamino acid metabolism genes, with higher expression in ICSR 14001 than in ICSV 93046. WGCNA analysis revealed that hub genes are involved in drought-induced signalling components, such as phospholipases (PLPs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs), which are implicated in membrane protection. In drought-sensitive genotypes, stress-induced membrane damages lead to the release of dhurrin into the cytoplasm, thus elevating HCN content and activating defence responses. Conversely, the drought-adapted genotype could mitigate HCN production by averting membrane injury, thereby effectively modulating the oxidative stress and preventing the release of dhurrin into the cytoplasm.

AB  - Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) is a fast-growing and low-nutrient demand plant that is widely used as a forage grass and potential energy crop in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the United States. Transgenic tobacco with the PpCCoAOMT gene from Pennisetum purpureum produces high lignin content that is associated with drought tolerance in relation to lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with higher antioxidant enzyme activities and osmotic adjustment. In this study, transgenic tobacco plants revealed no obvious cost to plant growth when expressing the PpCCoAOMT gene. Metabolomic studies demonstrated that tobacco plants tolerant to drought stress accumulated flavonoids under normal and drought conditions, which likely explains the observed tolerance phenotype in wild-type tobacco. Our results suggest that plants overexpressing PpCCoAOMT were better able to cope with water deficit than were wild-type controls; metabolic flux was redirected within primary and specialized metabolism to induce metabolites related to defense to drought stress. These results could help to develop drought-resistant plants for agriculture in the future.

AB  - Genetic adaptation, occurring over a long evolutionary time, enables host-specialized herbivores to develop novel resistance traits and to efficiently counteract the defenses of a narrow range of host plants. In contrast, physiological acclimation, leading to the suppression and/or detoxification of host defenses, is hypothesized to enable broad generalists to shift between plant hosts. However, the host adaptation mechanisms used by generalists composed of host-adapted populations are not known. Two-spotted spider mite (TSSM; Tetranychus urticae) is an extreme generalist herbivore whose individual populations perform well only on a subset of potential hosts. We combined experimental evolution, Arabidopsis thaliana genetics, mite reverse genetics, and pharmacological approaches to examine mite host adaptation upon the shift of a bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)-adapted population to Arabidopsis. We showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are required for mite adaptation to Arabidopsis. We identified activities of two tiers of P450s: general xenobiotic-responsive P450s that have a limited contribution to mite adaptation to Arabidopsis and adaptation-associated P450s that efficiently counteract Arabidopsis defenses. In approximately 25 generations of mite selection on Arabidopsis plants, mites evolved highly efficient detoxification-based adaptation, characteristic of specialist herbivores. This demonstrates that specialization to plant resistance traits can occur within the ecological timescale, enabling the TSSM to shift to novel plant hosts.

AB  - We have used vibrational optical coherence tomography (VOCT) to measure the resonant frequency, elastic modulus, and loss modulus of components of the anterior segment of pig eyes in vitro. Such basic biomechanical properties of the cornea have been shown to be abnormal not only in diseases of the anterior segment but also in posterior segment diseases as well. This information is needed to better understand corneal biomechanics in health and disease and to be able to diagnose the early stages of corneal pathologies. Results of dynamic viscoelastic studies on whole pig eyes and isolated corneas indicate that at low strain rates (30 Hz or less), the viscous loss modulus is as high as 0.6 times the elastic modulus for both whole eyes and corneas. This large viscous loss is similar to that of skin, which has been hypothesized to be dependent upon the physical association of proteoglycans with collagenous fibers. The energy dissipation properties of the cornea provide a mechanism to dissipate energy associated with blunt trauma, thereby preventing delamination and failure. The cornea possesses the ability to store impact energy and transmit excess energy to the posterior segment of the eye through its serial connection to the limbus and sclera. In this manner, the viscoelastic properties of the cornea, in concert with that of the posterior segment of the pig eye, function to prevent mechanical failure of the primary focusing element of the eye. Results of resonant frequency studies suggest that the 100-120 Hz and 150-160 Hz resonant frequency peaks reside in the anterior segment of the cornea since the removal of the anterior segment of the cornea decreases the peak heights at these resonant frequencies. These results suggest that there is more than one collagen fibril network found in the anterior portion of the cornea that provides structural integrity to prevent corneal delamination and that VOCT may be useful clinically to diagnose corneal diseases.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous and variable disease. In an allergic asthma model using guinea pigs (GPs), we identified three distinct phenotypes: those always showing an obstructive response (R), those never responding (NR), and those sometimes responding (VR). We aimed to assess and compare the functional and immunological characteristics of these groups. GPs were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) every 10 days in a plethysmographic chamber to measure the maximum obstructive response. The control group was sensitized and challenged with saline. Control and NR GPs never duplicated baseline obstruction values. At least three antigenic challenges were needed to identify each phenotype. None of the groups showed late responses. Analysis of at least six antigenic challenges in 125 GPs revealed that 48 % were R, 20 % NR, 29 % VR, and 8 % died from anaphylactic shock. R GPs did not develop antigenic tolerance. During the third or twelfth challenges, we evaluated antigen-induced airway reactivity to histamine: R GPs consistently showed hyperreactivity, NR showed hyperreactivity only on the third challenge, while VR and control groups never showed hyperreactivity. Serum levels of anti-OVA IgE and IgG1 were elevated in all groups compared to controls. IL-4 levels in the lungs and eosinophils counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of R and VR were higher than to controls and NR. The number of mast cells in the airway wall also increased in R and VR compared to controls. IFN-gamma levels were similar across all groups on the third challenge but increased significantly in NR on the twelfth challenge compared to the other groups. Neutrophil counts in BALF increased in R and VR, and in NR but only at the twelfth challenge compared to controls. Our findings suggest that R and VR guinea pigs serve as valid models for asthma, with VR representing a distinct phenotype characterized by variability and lack of hyperreactivity. Conversely, NR guinea pigs, despite their high IgE and anti-OVA IgG1 levels and hyperresponsiveness at the third challenge, do not align with typical asthma characteristics.

AB  - Pregnancy rates in ewes are markedly low after cervical insemination with frozen-thawed sperm. Sensitivity of ram sperm to freeze-thawing is related to the lipid composition of the membrane, particularly to its low sterol content. Recently, we proved that sterol content of ram sperm can be increased by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-sterol complexes and we provided mechanistic based evidence on the differential behavior of cholesterol and desmosterol in the ram sperm membrane. In the present study, we evaluated the role of increasing cholesterol and desmosterol content of ram sperm before cryopreservation, on the extent and distribution of sterols, cryocapacitation status, acrosome integrity, DNA damage associated with apoptosis and fertility competence in vitro and in vivo of post-thawed sperm. After freeze-thawing, similar levels of sterol content were evidenced in control sperm cells and in those pre-incubated with either cholesterol or desmosterol. Still, moderately higher levels of sterols were registered in treated sperm compared to the control, indicating no physiological excess of sterols after thawing or sterol losses that exceed the control. Live cell imaging of fluorescent cholesterol evidenced the presence of sperm sub-populations differentially affected by freeze-thawing. Similar unimodal frequency profiles were observed between sterol-enriched groups, while the control exhibited a sub-population of sperm compatible with low sterol content. Tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly lower when ram sperm incorporated cholesterol compared to the control. No difference in this capacitation parameter was found between the latter and desmosterol-enriched sperm. The percentage of sperm with damaged acrosomes post-thawing, assessed by a fluorescent lectin, was reduced in sperm that incorporated sterols before freezing, irrespective of the sterol class. These results suggest that sterols exert a stabilizing effect on the acrosome. No differences were found in levels of apoptotic DNA fragmentation among experimental groups. As to fertility trials, desmosterol-enriched sperm gave rise to higher rates of in vitro activated oocytes by heterologous fertilization and to significantly lower pregnancy loss in vivo. Our research provides new insights on sterol incorporation into ram sperm prior to cryopreservation, in particular on the additional benefit of incorporating desmosterol as a strategy to improve fertility outcome.

AB  - Osmotic stress caused by drought, salinity, or cold conditions is an important abiotic factor that decreases membrane integrity and causes cell death, thus decreasing plant growth and productivity. Remodeling cell membrane composition via lipid turnover can counter the loss of membrane integrity and cell death caused by osmotic stress. Sphingolipids are important components of eukaryotic membrane systems; however, how sphingolipids participate in plant responses to osmotic stress remains unclear. Here, we characterized the role of the glucosylceramidase (GCD) AtGCD1 (encoded by At1g33700) in sphingolipid remodeling and acclimation to osmotic stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). AtGCD1 to AtGCD4 are Arabidopsis homologs of human nonlysosomal GCD. We determined that AtGCD1 functions as a GCD and localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and that recombinant AtGCD1 has no substrate preference for acyl chain length. Moreover, AtGCD1 and AtGCD3 (At4g10060) are essential for osmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. In cells treated with mannitol, AtGCD1 and AtGCD3 hydrolyzed glucosylceramides to ceramides, leading to decreased glucosylceramide contents and increased glycosyl inositol phosphoceramide contents. We observed a substantial change in the molecular order of lipids and membrane tension at the PM of the Arabidopsis gcd1 gcd3 double mutant, indicating that GCDs compensate for changes in membrane properties to stabilize the membrane during osmotic stress. Notably, we found that loss of GCD1 and GCD3 enhanced plant resistance to beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). Our results suggest that sphingolipid remodeling regulates the physicochemical properties of cellular membranes during plant stress responses.
   Sphingolipid remodeling modulates the biophysical properties of cell membranes, conferring tolerance to osmotic stress and altering plant resistance to herbivorous insects.

AB  - Appropriate stallion semen handling is of great importance in equine artificial insemination (AI) industry. Optimal treatment of AI doses is aiming for best sperm preservation by excluding strong environmental influences and adding media that favour sperm survival. One method widely used in stallion sperm handling is the rotation of liquid-preserved semen samples on roller benches during storage. As previous studies in boars give rise to the fact that rotation should not be considered beneficial for spermatozoa anymore, the present study investigated the influence of continuous rotation of diluted stallion AI portions on sperm quality. Ejaculates (n = 15) were collected at a German AI centre and diluted with the two extenders EquiPlus and Gent (Minitub GmbH) to a final concentration of 50 x 10(6) sperm/mL. Afterwards, samples were placed separately on roller benches at 5(degrees)C in the dark, obtaining a rotation frequency of 5 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 36 rpm for four consecutive days following a split-sample design. Both groups were analysed daily in comparison to a control group (0 rpm) with an extended spectrum of spermatological methods including computer-assisted sperm analysis and flow cytometry. Statistical analyses were based on the calculation of generalized linear mixed models for each sperm parameter. The research revealed a decrease in sperm quality parameters of rotated samples compared to non-rotated control groups, visible in total sperm motility (rho < .001), decreased thermo-resistance (rho < .01) and a drop in pH (rho < .001). Interestingly, no differences (rho > .05) were detected between rotation frequencies of 5 and 36 rpm. We conclude that the fertilizing capacity of stallion semen was negatively affected by rotation during storage in vitro, irrespective of the rotation frequency. Further studies need to investigate whether field fertility in horses is similarly affected by semen rotation on roller benches in vivo.

AB  - Root rot, caused by a complex of soil-borne pathogens including Aphanomyces euteiches, Fusarium spp. Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium species, is a serious constraint to field pea production on the Canadian prairies. The only effective means of managing this disease are avoiding planting pea or lentil for at least 6-8 years and avoiding fields known to harbour high levels of root rot pathogens for the production of these crops. Growing a brassica crop as an intercrop with pea could, in theory, reduce the risk of root rot via the release of glucosinolates as brassica tissue decomposes. Glucosinolates break down into isothiocyanates, which interact with soil pathogens and help mitigate their impact. To test the effectiveness of pea-brassica intercropping as a root rot management tool, small plot field trials were conducted from 2018 to 2022 in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Brassica spp. included canola; brown, hybrid and yellow mustard; and camelina. Root rot severity in pea was not reduced through intercropping; however, land equivalency ratio (LER) yield benefits were observed in some site-years. Additionally, at one site, the severity of mycosphaerella blight was reduced by intercropping with hybrid brown mustard. Although intercropping with Brassica spp. does not mitigate root rot in pea, it may still be considered a worthwhile practice due to its potential yield and foliar disease management benefits.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) substantially govern plant immune reactions. Critical damage caused by insect feeding is a seroius issue that hinders agricultural productivity. MPK circuits have significance in modulating plants' ability to defend against herbivory or mechanical damage. Additionally, the expression of transcription factors and genes linked with immune response is significantly regulated by MPKs. Nevertheless, limited knowledge is available about how MPKs in crop plants such as Glycine max (soybean) reacts to insect attacks. Moreover, components of MPK pathway activated during developmental processes as well as stress conditions varies in different plants. Therefore, it is crucial to decipher components of MPK pathway in soybean activated during herbivory. The elements of the MPK network have been examined in soybean, which is heavily damaged by Spodoptera litura (cutworm), resulting in an enormous decrease in crop yield. Genome-wide identification demonstrated >60 % homology of G max's MPKs with Arabidopsis thaliana's MPKs. We have further performed expression analysis of GmMPKs, GmMKKs, and GmMEKK-like MPKKKs after S. litura feeding, mechanical injury, and signaling compounds [MeJA (methyl-jasmonates), Eth (ethylene), SA (salicylic acid)] treatment, which showed their differential expression demonstrating their involvement during plant defense. Additionally, selected GmMPKs, GmMKKs, and GmMPKKKs showing differential expression, were utilized for protein modeling and interaction analysis to predict MPK components activated during herbivory. This research article elucidates the components of the MPK network (GmMEKK1-2-GmMKK2-2/GmMKK9-3-GmMPK4/ GmMPK6) engaged in soybean during cutworm infestation, which needs further validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments.

AB  - Key messageThis study provided important insights into the complex epigenetic regulatory of H3K9ac-modified genes involved in the jasmonic acid signaling and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways of rice in response to Spodoptera frugiperda infestation. AbstractPhysiological and molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to insect herbivores have been well studied, while epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and their potential regulation at the genomic level of hidden genes remain largely unknown. Histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is an epigenetic marker widely distributed in plants that can activate gene transcription. In this study, we provided the genome-wide profiles of H3K9ac in rice (Oryza sativa) infested by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) using CUT&Tag-seq and RNA-seq. There were 3269 and 4609 up-regulated genes identified in plants infested by FAW larvae for 3 h and 12 h, respectively, which were mainly enriched in alpha-linolenic acid and phenylpropanoid pathways according to transcriptomic analysis. In addition, CUT&Tag-seq analysis revealed increased H3K9ac in FAW-infested plants, and there were 422 and 543 up-regulated genes enriched with H3K9ac observed at 3 h and 12 h after FAW feeding, respectively. Genes with increased H3K9ac were mainly enriched in the transcription start site (TSS), suggesting that H3K9ac is related to gene transcription. Integrative analysis of both RNA-seq and CUT&Tag-seq data showed that up-expressed genes with H3K9ac enrichment were mainly involved in the jasmonic acid (JA) and phenylpropanoid pathways. Particularly, two spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase genes SHT1 and SHT2 involved in phenolamide biosynthesis were highly modified by H3K9ac in FAW-infested plants. Furthermore, the Ossht1 and Ossht2 transgenic lines exhibited decreased resistance against FAW larvae. Our findings suggest that rice responds to insect herbivory via H3K9ac epigenetic regulation in the JA signaling and phenolamide biosynthesis pathways.

   The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is a serious insect pest on rice. It uses its stylet to collect sap by penetrating the phloem and at the same time it delivers saliva into the host plant, which can trigger a reaction. The molecular mechanisms by which BPH salivary proteins result in plant responses are poorly understood. In this study, we screened transcriptomic data from different BPH tissues and found a protein specific to the salivary gland, NlG14, that could induce cell death in plants. We determined that NlG14 is uniquely found in the insect family Delphacidae. Detailed examination of N. lugens showed that NlG14 was mainly localized in the A-follicle of the principal gland of the salivary gland, and that it was secreted into rice plants during feeding. Knockdown of NlG14 resulted in significant nymph mortality when BPH was fed on either rice plants or on an artificial diet. Further analysis showed that NlG14 triggered accumulation of reactive oxygen species, cell death, callose deposition, and activation of jasmonic acid signaling pathways in plants. Transient expression of NlG14 in Nicotiana benthamiana decreased insect feeding and suppressed plant pathogen infection. Thus, NlG14, an essential salivary protein of N. lugens, acted as a potential herbivore-associated molecular pattern to enhance plant resistance to both insects and plant pathogens by inducing multiple plant defense responses. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of insect-plant interactions and offer a potential target for pest management.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an indispensable macronutrient for plant growth and development, and it is involved in various cellular biological activities in plants. Camellia oleifera is a unique high-quality woody oil plant that grows in the hills and mountains of southern China. However, the available P content is deficient in southern woodland soil. Until now, few studies focused on the regulatory functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes under low inorganic phosphate (Pi) stress. In this study, we integrated small RNA, degradome, and transcriptome sequencing data to investigate the mechanism of low Pi adaptation in C. oleifera. We identified 40,689 unigenes and 386 miRNAs by the deep sequencing technology and divided the miRNAs into four different groups. We found 32 miRNAs which were differentially expressed under low Pi treatment. A total of 414 target genes of 108 miRNAs were verified by degradome sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) functional analysis of target genes found that they were related to the signal response to the stimulus and transporter activity, indicating that they may respond to low Pi stress. The integrated analysis revealed that 31 miRNA-target pairs had negatively correlated expression patterns. A co-expression regulatory network was established based on the profiles of differentially expressed genes. In total, three hub genes (ARF22, WRKY53, and SCL6), which were the targets of differentially expressed miRNAs, were discovered. Our results showed that integrated analyses of the small RNA, degradome, and transcriptome sequencing data provided a valuable basis for investigating low Pi in C. oleifera and offer new perspectives on the mechanism of low Pi tolerance in woody oil plants.

AB  - In response to herbivore attack, plants release large amounts of volatiles that can serve as attractants for the natural enemies of the attacking herbivores. Such responses are typically triggered by damage- and insect-associated factors. Cotton plants are somewhat peculiar because they release specific blends of volatiles in two waves in response to caterpillar attack. They first emit constitutively stored volatile compounds, and after about 24 h a second wave that includes various de novo synthesized compounds. The relative importance of damage-associated and insect associated-factors in this induction of cotton volatile emissions is not yet fully clear. We evaluated how cotton plants respond to mechanical damage and to the application of the oral secretion from the generalist lepidopteran pest Spodoptera exigua, by measuring the local and systemic emissions of volatile compounds from their leaves. Our results confirm that cotton plants respond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as well as to herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) present in the caterpillars' oral secretion. Interestingly, a stronger response was observed for cotton plants that were treated with oral secretion from cotton-fed caterpillars than those fed on maize. We tested the possibility that volicitin, a common fatty acid-derived elicitor in caterpillar regurgitant plays a role in this difference. Volicitin and volicitin-like compounds were detected in equal amounts in the oral secretion of S. exigua fed on either cotton or maize leaves. We conclude that other elicitors must be involved. The identification of these eliciting cues is expected to contribute to the development of novel strategies to enhance the resistance of cotton plants to insect pests.

AB  - Jasmonates accumulate rapidly and act as key regulators in response to mechanical wounding, but few studies have linked receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to wound-induced jasmonic acid (JA) signaling cascades. Here, we identified a novel wounding-induced RLCK-XII-2 subfamily member (SIZRK1) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum ) that was closely related to Arabidopsis HOPZ-ETI-DEFICIENT 1 (ZED1)-related kinases 1 based on phylogenetic analysis. SIZRK1 was targeted to the plasma membrane of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts as determined by transient co-expression with the plasma membrane marker mCherry-H+-ATPase. Catalytic residue sequence analysis and an in vitro kinase assay indicated that SIZRK1 may act as a pseudokinase. To further analyse the function of SIZRK1, we developed two stable knock-out mutants by CRISPR/Cas9. Loss of SIZRK1 significantly altered the expression of genes involved in JA biosynthesis, salicylic acid biosynthesis, and ethylene response. Furthermore, after mechanical wounding treatment, slzrk1 mutants increased transcription of early wound-inducible genes involved in JA biosynthesis and signaling. In addition, JA accumulation after wounding and plant resistance to herbivorous insects also were enhanced. Our findings expand plant regulatory networks in the wound-induced JA production by adding RLCKs as a new component in the wound signal transduction pathway.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda is a destructive and polyphagous pest of many essential food crops including maize and rice. The FAW is hard to manage, control, or eradicate, due to its polyphagous nature and voracity of feeding. Here, we report the characterization and functional analysis of the detoxification gene CYP302A1 and how S. frugieprda larvae use a detoxification mechanism to adapt host plants. Results demonstrated that CYP302A1 expression levels were much higher in midgut tissue and the older S. frugiperda larvae. Our current studies revealed the enhanced P450 activity in the midguts of S. frugiperda larvae after exposure to rice plants as compared to corn plants and an artificial diet. Furthermore, higher mortality was observed in PBO treated larvae followed by the exposure of rice plants as compared to the corn plant. The dsRNA-fed larvae showed downregulation of CYP302A1 gene in the midgut. At the same time, higher mortality, reduced larval weight and shorter developmental time was observed in the dsRNA-fed larvae followed by the exposure of rice plant as compared to the corn plant and DEPC-water treated plants as a control. These results concluded that the inducible P450 enzyme system and related genes could provide herbivores with an ecological opportunity to adapt to diverse host plants by utilizing secondary compounds present in their host plants.

AB  - Cellular calcium (Ca) transients are endogenous signals involved in local and systemic signaling and defense activation upon environmental stress, including wounding and herbivory. Still, not all Ca2+ channels contributing to the signaling have been identified, nor are their modes of action fully known. Plant annexins are proteins capable of binding to anionic phospholipids and can exhibit Ca channel-like activity. Arabidopsis ANNEXIN1 (ANN1) is suggested to contribute to Ca transport.
   Here, we report that wounding and simulated-herbivory-induced cytosolic free Ca elevation was impaired in systemic leaves in ann1 loss-of-function plants. We provide evidence for a role of ANN1 in local and systemic defense of plants attacked by herbivorous Spodoptera littoralis larvae.
   Bioassays identified ANN1 as a positive defense regulator. Spodoptera littoralis feeding on ann1 gained significantly more weight than larvae feeding on wild-type, whereas those feeding on ANN1-overexpressing lines gained less weight. Herbivory and wounding both induced defense-related responses on treated leaves, such as jasmonate accumulation and defense gene expression. These responses remained local and were strongly reduced in systemic leaves in ann1 plants.
   Our results indicate that ANN1 plays an important role in activation of systemic rather than local defense in plants attacked by herbivorous insects.

AB  - Background and Aims There are intrinsic conflicts between signalling to mutualists and concealing (camouflaging) from antagonists. Like animals, plants also use camouflage as a defence against herbivores. However, this can potentially reduce their attractiveness to pollinators.Methods Using Fritillaria delavayi, an alpine camouflaged plant with inter-population floral colour divergence, we tested the influence of floral trait differences on reproduction. We conducted pollination experiments, measured floral morphological characteristics, estimated floral colours perceived by pollinators, analysed floral scent and investigated reproductive success in five populations.Key Results We found that the reproduction of F. delavayi depends on pollinators. Under natural conditions, a flower-camouflaged population had 100 % fruit set and similar seed set to three out of four yellow-flowered populations. Bumblebees are important pollinators in the visually conspicuous yellow-flowered populations, whereas flies are the only pollinator in the flower-camouflaged population, visiting flowers more frequently than bumblebees. The camouflaged flowers cannot be discriminated from the rock background as perceived by pollinators, but may be located by flies through olfactory cues.Conclusions Collectively, our results demonstrate that the flower-camouflaged population has different reproductive traits from the visually conspicuous yellow-flowered populations. A pollinator shift from bumblebees to flies, combined with high visitation frequency, compensates for the attractiveness disadvantage in camouflaged plants.

AB  - The tea plant, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, is an economically important, perennial woody plant rich in catechins. Although catechins have been reported to play an important role in plant defences against microbes, their roles in the defence of tea plants against herbivores remain unknown. In this study, we allowed the larvae of Ectropis grisescens, a leaf-feeding pest, to feed on the plants, and alternatively, we wounded the plants and then treated them with E. grisescens oral secretions (WOS). Both approaches triggered jasmonic acid-, ethylene- and auxin-mediated signalling pathways; as a result, plants accumulated three catechin compounds: (+)-catechin, epicatechin and epigallocatechin. Not only was the mass of E. grisescens larvae fed on plants previously infested with E. grisescens or treated with WOS significantly lower than that of larvae fed on controls, but also artificial diet supplemented with epicatechin, (+)-catechin or epigallocatechin gallate reduced larval growth rates. In addition, the exogenous application of jasmonic acid, ethylene or auxin induced the biosynthesis of the three catechins, which, in turn, enhanced the resistance of tea plants to E. grisescens, leading to the coordination of the three signalling pathways. Our results suggest that the three catechins play an important role in the defences of tea plants against E. grisescens.

AB  - Light is one of the most critical ecological cues controlling plant growth and development. Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to cope with fluctuating light signals. In Arabidopsis, bHLH transcription factors MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 have been shown to play a vital role in protecting plants against herbivory and necrotrophic pathogens. While the role of MYC2 in light-mediated seedling development has been studied in some detail, the role of MYC3 and MYC4 still needs to be discovered. Here, we show that MYC4 negatively regulates seedling photomorphogenesis, while the MYC3 function seems redundant. However, the genetic analysis reveals that MYC3/MYC4 together act as positive regulators of seedling photomorphogenic growth as the myc3myc4 double mutants showed exaggerated hypocotyl growth compared to the myc3 and myc4 single mutants and Col-0. Intriguingly, the loss of MYC2 function in the myc3myc4 double mutant background (myc2myc3myc4) resulted in further enhancement in the hypocotyl growth than myc3myc4 double mutants in WL, BL and FRL, suggesting that MYC2/3/4 together play an essential and positive role in meditating optimal seedling photomorphogenesis. Besides, MYC3/MYC4 genetically and physically interact with HY5 to partially inhibit its function in controlling hypocotyl and photo-pigment accumulation. Moreover, our results suggest that COP1 physically interacts and degrades MYC3 and MYC4 through the 26S proteasomal pathway and controls their response to dark and light for fine-tuning HY5 function and seedling photomorphogenesis.

AB  - The activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is recognized as a key regulator of the plant defense mechanisms in response to insect attacks. The MAPK pathway comprises three main components: MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAPKKK), MAP Kinase Kinase (MAPKK) and MAP Kinase (MAPK). The MAPKKK is the first kinase in the MAPK cascade, which typically responds to external stimuli and activates downstream component, MAPKK, which, in turn, activates the final component, MAPK, which further plays a key role in regulating gene expression of defense-associated transcription factors. Elucidation of complete MAPK pathway and its components has been investigated in the model plants in the past, however, it has not been attempted in leguminous plant, chickpea, which is attacked vigorously by Helicoverpa armigera, causing huge loss in crop production. Therefore, the study aims to decipher and elucidate MAP kinase pathway activated during chickpeaH. armigera interaction. MAPKKK, MAPKK, MAPK are a family of genes and specific genes from each components, were identified and selected for further analysis based on their expression patterns in response to H. armigerainfestation. Further, three dimensional structure prediction, validation, docking and simulation of the selected proteins from each component of the pathway, were executed and specific components from chickpea were predicted. The probable pathway forecasted is MEKK4/Raf22 (MAPKKK)-MAPKK(4)10-MAPK12/6). This article provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in plant's response to pest attacks, unravelling the components of MAPK pathway in chickpea induced during herbivory. Further validation of this pathway by in vitro/in vivo approaches is highly recommended.

AB  - The potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is one of the most destructive pests of potato crops worldwide. Although it has been reported how potatoes integrate the early responses to various PTM herbivory stimuli by accumulatively adding the components, the broad-scale defense signaling network of potato to single stimuli at multiple time points are unclear. Therefore, we compared three potato transcriptional profiles of undamaged plants, mechanically damaged plants and PTM-feeding plants at 3 h, 48 h, and 96 h, and further analyzed the gene expression patterns of a multitude of insect resistance-related signaling pathways, including phytohormones, reactive oxygen species, secondary metabolites, transcription factors, MAPK cascades, plant-pathogen interactions, protease inhibitors, chitinase, and lectins, etc. in the potato under mechanical damage and PTM infestation. Our results suggested that the potato transcriptome showed significant responses to mechanical damage and potato tuber moth infestation, respectively. The potato transcriptome responses modulated over time and were higher at 96 than at 48 h, so transcriptional changes in later stages of PTM infestation may underlie the potato recovery response. Although the transcriptional profiles of mechanically damaged and PTM-infested plants overlap extensively in multiple signaling pathways, some genes are uniquely induced or repressed. True herbivore feeding induced more and stronger gene expression compared to mechanical damage. In addition, we identified 2976, 1499, and 117 genes that only appeared in M-vs-P comparison groups by comparing the transcriptomes of PTM-damaged and mechanically damaged potatoes at 3 h, 48 h, and 96 h, respectively, and these genes deserve further study in the future. This transcriptomic dataset further enhances the understanding of the interactions between potato and potato tuber moth, enriches the molecular resources in this research area and paves the way for breeding insect-resistant potatoes.

AB  - BackgroundLaccase (LAC) is the pivotal enzyme responsible for the polymerization of monolignols and stress responses in plants. However, the roles of LAC genes in plant development and tolerance to diverse stresses are still largely unknown, especially in tea plant (Camellia sinensis), one of the most economically important crops worldwide.ResultsIn total, 51 CsLAC genes were identified, they were unevenly distributed on different chromosomes and classified into six groups based on phylogenetic analysis. The CsLAC gene family had diverse intron-exon patterns and a highly conserved motif distribution. Cis-acting elements in the promoter demonstrated that promoter regions of CsLACs encode various elements associated with light, phytohormones, development and stresses. Collinearity analysis identified some orthologous gene pairs in C. sinensis and many paralogous gene pairs among C. sinensis, Arabidopsis and Populus. Tissue-specific expression profiles revealed that the majority of CsLACs had high expression in roots and stems and some members had specific expression patterns in other tissues, and the expression patterns of six genes by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with the transcriptome data. Most CsLACs showed significant variation in their expression level under abiotic (cold and drought) and biotic (insect and fungus) stresses via transcriptome data. Among them, CsLAC3 was localized in the plasma membrane and its expression level increased significantly at 13 d under gray blight treatment. We found that 12 CsLACs were predicted to be targets of cs-miR397a, and most CsLACs showed opposite expression patterns compared to cs-miR397a under gray blight infection. Additionally, 18 highly polymorphic SSR markers were developed, these markers can be widely used for diverse genetic studies of tea plants.ConclusionsThis study provides a comprehensive understanding of the classification, evolution, structure, tissue-specific profiles, and (a)biotic stress responses of CsLAC genes. It also provides valuable genetic resources for functional characterization towards enhancing tea plant tolerance to multiple (a)biotic stresses.

AB  - Dimefluthrin (DIM) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide commonly used for the control of pests, particularly for mosquitoes and other flying insects. However, the effects of DIM on non-target aquatic organisms are not known. In this study, we evaluated the long-term effects of DIM on juvenile Acrossocheilus fasciatus (a species of teleost fish) by exposing them to two different concentrations (0.8 mu g/L and 4 mu g/L) for 60 days. After 60 d of exposure, DIM induced a significant decrease in body weight and irregular, diffused villi in the intestines of A. fasciatus, accompanied by alterations in the expression of immune-related genes. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), all downregulated genes were enriched in processes such as small molecule/cellular amino acid metabolism, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and phosphatase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the downregulated genes were associated with processes such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, intestinal immune network for IgA production, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antigen processing and presentation. In contrast, upregulated DEGs were linked to processes such as necroptosis, phototransduction, and Hippo signaling pathway. These results demonstrate the potential toxicity of DIM to non-target aquatic organisms, indicating the broader ecological implications of its use.

AB  - When colonizing new ranges, plant populations may benefit from the absence of the checks imposed by the enemies, herbivores, and pathogens that regulated their numbers in their original range. Therefore, rates of plant damage or infestation by natural enemies are expected to be lower in the new range. Exposing both non-native and native plant populations in the native range, where native herbivores are present, can be used to test whether resistance mechanisms have diverged between populations. Datura stramonium is native to the Americas but widely distributed in Spain, where populations show lower herbivore damage than populations in the native range. We established experiments in two localities in the native range (Mexico), exposing two native and two non-native D. stramonium populations to natural herbivores. Plant performance differed between the localities, as did the abundance of the main specialist herbivore, Lema daturaphila. In Teotihuacan, where L. daturaphila is common, native plants had significantly more adult beetles and herbivore damage than non-native plants. The degree of infestation by the specialist seed predator Trichobaris soror differed among populations and between sites, but the native Ticuman population always had the lowest level of infestation. The Ticuman population also had the highest concentration of the alkaloid scopolamine. Scopolamine was negatively related to the number of eggs deposited by L. daturaphila in Teotihuacan. There was among-family variation in herbivore damage (resistance), alkaloid content (scopolamine), and infestation by L. daturaphila and T. soror, indicating genetic variation and potential for further evolution. Although native and non-native D. stramonium populations have not yet diverged in plant resistance/constitutive defense, the differences between ranges (and the two experimental sites) in the type and abundance of herbivores suggest that further research is needed on the role of resource availability and adaptive plasticity, specialized metabolites (induced, constitutive), and the relationship between genealogical origin and plant defense in both ranges.

AB  - Visual and olfactory floral signals play key roles in plant-pollinator interactions. In recent decades, studies investigating the evolution of either of these signals have increased considerably. However, there are large gaps in our understanding of whether or not these two cue modalities evolve in a concerted manner. Here, we characterized the visual (i.e., color) and olfactory (scent) floral cues in bee-pollinated Campanula species by spectrophotometric and chemical methods, respectively, with the aim of tracing their evolutionary paths. We found a species-specific pattern in color reflectance and scent chemistry. Multivariate phylogenetic statistics revealed no influence of phylogeny on floral color and scent bouquet. However, univariate phylogenetic statistics revealed a phylogenetic signal in some of the constituents of the scent bouquet. Our results suggest unequal evolutionary pathways of visual and olfactory floral cues in the genus Campanula. While the lack of phylogenetic signal on both color and scent bouquet points to external agents (e.g., pollinators, herbivores) as evolutionary drivers, the presence of phylogenetic signal in at least some floral scent constituents point to an influence of phylogeny on trait evolution. We discuss why external agents and phylogeny differently shape the evolutionary paths in floral color and scent of closely related angiosperms.

AB  - Spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) are a major threat to economically important crops. Here, we investigated the potential of tetranins, in particular Tet3 and Tet4, as T. urticae protein-type elicitors that stimulate plant defense. Truncated Tet3 and Tet4 proteins showed efficacy in activating the defense gene pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1) and inducing phytohormone production in leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris. In particular, Tet3 caused a drastically higher Ca2+ influx in leaves, but a lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to other tetranins, whereas Tet4 caused a low Ca2+ influx and a high ROS generation in the host plants. Such specific and non-specific elicitor activities were examined by knockdown of Tet3 and Tet4 expressions in mites, confirming their respective activities and in particular showing that they function additively or synergistically to induce defense responses. Of great interest is the fact that Tet3 and Tet4 expression levels were higher in mites on their preferred host, P. vulgaris, compared to the levels in mites on the less-preferred host, Cucumis sativus, whereas Tet1 and Tet2 were constitutively expressed regardless of their host. Furthermore, mites that had been hosted on C. sativus induced lower levels of PR1 expression, Ca2+ influx and ROS generation, i.e., Tet3- and Tet4-responsive defense responses, in both P. vulgaris and C. sativus leaves compared to the levels induced by mites that had been hosted on P. vulgaris. Taken together, these findings show that selected tetranins respond to variable host cues that may optimize herbivore fitness by altering the anti-mite response of the host plant.

AB  - BackgroundVirus infection and herbivory can alter the expression of stress-responsive genes in plants. This study employed high-throughput transcriptomic and alternative splicing analysis to understand the separate and combined impacts on host gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana by Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), and turnip mosaic virus (TuMV).ResultsBy investigating changes in transcript abundance, the data shows that aphids feeding on virus infected plants intensify the number of differentially expressed stress responsive genes compared to challenge by individual stressors. This study presents evidence that the combination of virus-vector-host interactions induces significant changes in hormone and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, as well as downstream factors involved in feedback loops within hormone signaling pathways. This study also shows that gene expressions are regulated through alternative pre-mRNA splicing and the use of alternative transcription start and termination sites.ConclusionsThese combined data suggest that complex genetic changes occur as plants adapt to the combined challenges posed by aphids and the viruses they vector. This study also provides more advanced analyses that could be used in the future to dissect the genetic mechanisms mediating tripartite interactions and inform future breeding programs.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) is the world's most widely grown seed legume. One of the most important pests that decrease seed quality and reduce yield of soybean crops is the southern green stink bug (Nezara viridula). Insect damage triggers accumulation of defensive compounds such as protease inhibitors (PIs), isoflavonoids and reactive oxygen species, which are regulated by the lipoxygenase (LOX)-regulated jasmonic acid (JA) to stop insect feeding. This study identified and characterised the role of LOX isoforms in the modulation of chemical defences in seeds of field-grown soybean that decreased digestive enzyme activities of N. viridula after insect attack. Stink bugs attack increased LOX 1 and LOX 2 expression, and activities of LOX 1 and LOX 3 isoenzymes in developing soybean seeds. In addition, stink bug damage and methyl jasmonate application induced expression and activity of both cysteine PIs and trypsin PIs in developing soybean seeds, suggesting that herbivory induced JA in soybean seeds. High PI activity levels in attacked seeds decreased cysteine proteases and alpha-amylases activities in the gut of stink bugs that fed on field-grown soybean. We demonstrated that LOX isoforms of seeds are concomitantly induced with JA-regulated PIs by stink bugs attack, and these PIs inhibit the activity of insect digestive enzymes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the participation of LOX in modulating JA-regulated defences against stink bugs in seeds of field-grown soybean, and our results suggest that soybean PIs may inhibit alpha-amylase activity in the gut of N. viridula.

AB  - Gray blight disease (GBD) causes significant losses in tea production in China. Although genes and biological processes involved in resistance to fungal disease in tea plants have been identified, specific mechanisms of the GBD infection process remain unknown. In this study, morphological and multi-gene (TEF-TUB-ITS) phylogenetic characteristics were used to identify isolate CLBB1 of Pseudopestalotiopsis vietnamensis. Pathogenicity tests confirmed that isolate CLBB1 from tea leaves caused GBD in the susceptible tea cultivar Wuyi Rock (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis cv. Shuixian). Spores began to germinate 24 h after infection (hai), and after 48 h, elongated fungal hyphae formed from a single conidium. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 482, 517, and 369 genes were differentially expressed at 24, 48, and 72 hai, respectively, in Wuyi Rock tea leaves. Isolate CLBB1 infection elicited phenotype-related responses and activated defense-related pathways, including plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signaling, and plant hormone signal transduction, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying phenotype-based susceptibility to CLBB1. Thus, a new Ps. vietnamensis strain causing GBD in the tea cultivar 'Shuixian' was discovered in this study. Transcriptome analysis indicated that pathogen invasion activated chitin-related MAPK pathways and that tea plants required a hormone to restrict CLBB1.

AB  - Tectona grandis (L) is a popular timber species cultivated in the Indian sub-continent and other countries because of its economic significance. However, the lack of quality planting material with special reference to defoliator herbivory is a major constraint because it negatively influences the establishment of thriving plantations. To address this, the so-called pest response in teak seedlings was investigated at the biochemical and molecular levels. The stress was levied by allowing defoliator infestation on 1-year-old seedlings for nine days at 3-day intervals, whereas control plants were maintained as uninfected. A considerable difference was observed for the considered traits among the infested plants at different intervals compared with the control. Total soluble protein, soluble sugars, tannin, and lignin accumulation increased with increasing stress intensity. Furthermore, catalase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenol content increased after defoliator feeding, whereas peroxidase activity decreased compared with control plants. In addition, six herbivory stress-responsive genes revealed the molecular response of teak. Among them, four genes viz. zinc finger protein (ZFP2), ethylene-responsive factor (ERF1), catalase-1 (Cat1) and peroxidase super family protein (Psfp) were highly expressed in the infected plants as compared with the control plants. In contrast, the MYB-DNA binding domain gene was downregulated in infected plants compared to uninfected plants. Cytochrome P450 was up-regulated in T1 and T2 plants, while it was down-regulated in T3. Genes were highly expressed as the stress frequency increased. This study offers an improved understanding of biochemical and transcriptional defense responses against the teak defoliator, which could further support teak improvement for quality planting material production.

AB  - Glycerin has a similar energy value to corn and can partially replace it. However, there is a need to find the ideal level for using glycerin in pig feed without negatively interfering with performance parameters. The objective of this study was to determine the digestibility of glycerin through a mixture (MIX) or inserted on top of feed (ONTOP) using chromium indicator (Cr) and total collection (TC) methods. Ten barrows weighed 42.63 +/- 4.23 kg in a 2 x 2 + 1 factorial scheme, with two forms of inclusion of the test ingredient (MIX or ONTOP), two digestibility methods (Cr or TC), and a basal diet (BD). The experimental design was completely randomized, and the evaluation period was used as split-plots, with two repetitions per period, totaling four repetitions per diet. The DE and ME values for glycerin were 3443 and 3356 kcal/kg (by the TC method) and 3411 and 3293 kcal/kg (by the Cr method), respectively (p < 0.05). There was no difference in MIX or ONTOP (p > 0.05), except for the digestibility coefficient (DC) of ethereal extract (p < 0.05). The DC and energy values obtained by Cr were lower than those obtained by TC. The inclusion of the test ingredients in the MIX and ONTOP forms did not present any difference, whereas Cr depreciated the nutritional value of glycerin for pigs.

AB  - Nacre is a biomaterial that has shown osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties in vitro and in vivo. These properties make nacre a material of interest for inducing bone regeneration. However, information is very limited regarding the introduction of nacre to dental implant surgery for promoting osteogenesis. This study investigated the potential of nacre powder for peri-implant bone regeneration in a porcine model. Ninety-six dental implants were placed into the tibia of twelve male domestic pigs. The dental implants were coated with nacre powder from the giant oyster before implantation. Implantations without nacre powder were used as control groups. Euthanization took place at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after implantation, after which we measured bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume density (BVD) of the implanted bone samples using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and examined the histology of the surrounding bone using histological sections stained with Stevenel's blue and Alizarin red S. The micro-CT analyses showed that the BIC of dental implantations with nacre powder were significantly higher than those without nacre powder, by 7.60%. BVD of implantations with nacre powder were significantly higher than those without nacre powder, by 12.48% to 13.66% in cortical bone, and by 3.37% to 6.11% in spongy bone. Histological study revealed more peri-implant bone regeneration toward the surface of the dental implants after implantation with nacre powder. This was consistent with the micro-CT results. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using nacre to promote peri-implant bone regeneration in dental implantation.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can prime plant defenses, leading to mycorrhiza-induced resistance (MIR) against different attackers, including insect herbivores. Still, our knowledge of the complex molecular regulation leading to MIR is very limited. Here, we showed that the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae protects tomato plants against two different chewing herbivores, Spodoptera exigua and Manduca sexta. We explored the underlying molecular mechanism through genome-wide transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics network analyses, and functional bioassays. Herbivore-triggered jasmonate (JA)-regulated defenses were primed in leaves of mycorrhizal plants. Likewise, ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and signaling were also higher in leaves of mycorrhizal plants both before and after herbivory. We hypothesized that fine-tuned ET signaling is required for the primed defense response leading to MIR. ET is a complex regulator of plant responses to stress and is generally considered a negative regulator of plant defenses against herbivory. However, ET-deficient or insensitive lines did not show AM-primed JA biosynthesis or defense response, and were unable to develop MIR against any of the herbivores. Thus, we demonstrate that hormone crosstalk is central to the priming of plant immunity by beneficial microbes, with ET fine-tuning being essential for the primed JA biosynthesis and boosted defenses leading to MIR in tomato.
   Hormonal crosstalk is essential for mycorrhiza-induced resistance against chewing herbivores. Specifically, ethylene signaling boosts jasmonate biosynthesis and defensive response in mycorrhizal plants.

AB  - Under natural and ecological interaction like biotic and abiotic stresses, plants constitutively synthesize secondary metabolites which are extremely necessary for their normal growth and survival. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are such secondary metabolites from adverse environmental conditions like different biotic/abiotic stresses where herbivory and mechanical wounding, such as leaf cuttings, are easily observed. However, BOVCs released from plucking injury on the young stem of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze has very limited understanding which is usually experienced as "pleasing aroma" in the tea plantations. Moreover, "direct volatile injection" is a common method for BOVCs molecular characterization. In this work, a modified method, i.e., vacuum pressure coupled adsorption of BVOCs in glass microfiber filter, was used to firstly explore BOVCs from the stem injured young tea foliages (TV22), followed by molecular detection of its n-hexane fraction by GC-MS analysis. GC-MS chromatogram with stable baseline has shown the presence of a 13 (thirteen) lower MW metabolites (C-2-C-12) below 3 min of runtime which has signified the successful modification of earlier methods. In terms of power consumption, time, heat sensitive volatiles, and detection of low molecular weight/concentration metabolites, this method has strong advantages over the hydrodistillation method. Coupled with other downstream analyses, this method of extraction and detection of BVOCs of "pleasing aroma" from hand-plucked tea foliages has the potential to be observed for future application in perfume industry as a room, or body freshener.

AB  - Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion leads to neuronal loss in the hippocampus and spatial memory impairments. Physical exercise is known to prevent cognitive deficits in animal models; and there is evidence of sex differences in behavioral neuroprotective approaches. The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of acrobatic training in male and female rats submitted to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Males and females rats underwent 2VO (two-vessel occlusion) surgery and were randomly allocated into 4 groups of males and 4 groups of females, as follows: 2VO acrobatic, 2VO sedentary, Sham acrobatic and Sham sedentary. The acrobatic training started 45 days after surgery and lasted 4 weeks; animals were then submitted to object recognition and water maze testing. Brain samples were collected for histological and morphological assessment and flow cytometry. 2VO causes cognitive impairments and acrobatic training prevented spatial memory deficits assessed in the water maze, mainly for females. Morphological analysis showed that 2VO animals had less NeuN labeling and acrobatic training prevented it. Increased number of GFAP positive cells was observerd in females; moreover, males had more branched astrocytes and acrobatic training prevented the branching after 2VO. Flow cytometry showed higher mitochondrial potential in trained animals and more reactive oxygen species production in males. Acrobatic training promoted neuronal survival and improved mitochondrial function in both sexes, and influenced the glial scar in a sex-dependent manner, associated to greater cognitive benefit to females after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

AB  - The chloroplastic protein CP12 from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana exhibits atypical and enigmatic structural properties that have so far hindered our understanding of its functions. Here, we used AlphaFold to generate a three-dimensional (3D) model of the structure of the protein. However, this model did not accurately describe the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data previously obtained. We have therefore undertaken a study using site-directed spin labelling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) to characterise the structural dynamics of this atypical CP12 and to investigate its dimeric organisation using double electron-electron resonance (DEER). We then performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, constrained by SAXS and DEER data, to refine the AlphaFold model and take into account the flexibility and disordered propensities of this protein. The combination of the experimental techniques together with the in silico AlphaFold and MD simulations reveals that the dimer is organised in an antiparallel arrangement of each monomer and that the C-terminal regions are highly flexible and partly disordered. Additionally, this diatom CP12 contains four structured domains likely to bind phosphoribulokinase regardless of their redox state. Our structural data therefore provide insights into the function of this protein in the regulation of the Calvin cycle and of photosynthesis in diatoms, whereas its structural organisation is completely different from any of its homologous counterparts from Plantae and cyanobacteria.

AB  - Systemin, the first signalling peptide identified in plants, mediates induced resistance against insect herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens in tomato1, 2-3. Initially, systemin was conceived as a hormone-like, long-distance messenger that triggers systemic defence responses far from the site of insect attack. It was later found to rather act as a phytocytokine, amplifying the local wound response for the production of downstream signals that activate defence gene expression in distant tissues4. Systemin perception and signalling rely on the systemin receptor SYR15. However, the specifics of SYR1-dependent signalling and how systemin signalling differs from other immune signalling pathways remain largely unknown. Here we report that systemin activates the poltergeist-like phosphatase PLL2 in a SYR1-dependent manner. PLL2, in turn, regulates early systemin responses at the plasma membrane, including the rapid inhibition of proton pumps through dephosphorylation of their regulatory C-termini. PLL2 was found to be essential for downstream defence gene induction, ultimately contributing to insect resistance.

AB  - Heat and drought are the stressors with significant adverse impacts on the yield stability of tea plants. The heat shock proteins 60 (HSP60s) play important roles in protecting plants under heat stress. However, the mechanism of HSP60s under heat and drought stresses remains unclear. Here, we identified 19 CsHSP60s (namely CsHSP60-1 to CsHSP60-19) in tea plants and classified them into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. In addition, studies on gene duplication events during the evolutionary process demonstrated that CsHSP60 members were subjected to purify selection. Analysis of cis-acting elements revealed the presence of numerous stress and hormone-responsive elements within the promoter regions of CsHSP60s. Real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses demonstrated that CsHSP60s rapidly responded to heat and combined heat and drought stress while exhibiting a delayed response to drought stress. The inhibition of eight CsHSP60 genes via antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AsODN) resulted in more severe damage and ROS accumulation. Specifically, CsHSP60-9, CsHSP60-16, and CsHSP60-19 exhibited notable reductions in Fv/Fm values and displayed increased accumulation of H2O2 and O2 & sdot;-. These observations indicated a potential role for CsHSP60 in mitigating ROS accumulation under stress conditions, thereby enhancing tea plants' resilience to heat and drought stresses. Using a yeast two- hybrid (Y2H) assay, we identified that CsHSP60-2 and CsHSP60-16 physically interact with CsCPN10-4 and CsCPN10-5, respectively. These interactions suggest a cooperative chaperone activity between CsHSP60 and CsCPN10 in response to combined heat and drought stress. These findings lay a foundation for further understanding the involvement of HSP60s in the tolerance mechanisms to compound heat and drought stresses.

AB  - Jasmonate (JA) re-programs metabolism to confer resistance to diverse environmental threats. Jasmonate stimulates the degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins that repress the activity of MYC transcription factors. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MYC and JAZ are encoded by 4 and 13 genes, respectively. The extent to which expansion of the MYC and JAZ families has contributed to functional diversification of JA responses is not well understood.
   Here, we investigated the role of MYC and JAZ paralogs in controlling the production of defense compounds derived from aromatic amino acids (AAAs).
   Analysis of loss-of-function and dominant myc mutations identified MYC3 and MYC4 as the major regulators of JA-induced tryptophan metabolism. We developed a JAZ family-based, forward genetics approach to screen randomized jaz polymutants for allelic combinations that enhance tryptophan biosynthetic capacity. We found that mutants defective in all members (JAZ1/2/5/6) of JAZ group I over-accumulate AAA-derived defense compounds, constitutively express marker genes for the JA-ethylene branch of immunity and are more resistant to necrotrophic pathogens but not insect herbivores.
   In defining JAZ and MYC paralogs that regulate the production of amino-acid-derived defense compounds, our results provide insight into the specificity of JA signaling in immunity.

AB  - Floral color and odor serve as attractants for pollinators. It remains unclear how changes in these traits in color-change species interact with pollinators and impact a plant's reproductive success. Lonicera calcarata flowers change from white (Night 1 [N1] and Day 1 [D1]) through yellow (Night 2 [N2]) and orange (Day 2 [D2]) to orange-red (Night 3 [N3] and Day 3 [D3]). Our research showed that floral characters, stigma activity, nectar production and floral spectral reflectance decreased through the flowering phases. Floral odor mainly comprised fatty acids, aldehydes, monoterpenes and alcohols, especially n-hexadecanoic acid, hexadecanal and 3-carene. Floral odor peaked on N1 and N3, largely due to the presence of fatty acids. The emission of n-hexadecanoic acid was higher on N1 and N3 compared with other phases, while hexadecanal emission remained constant throughout the flowering stages. The emission of 3-carene was highest on N1. Lonicera calcarata was mainly pollinated by the moth Chorodna strixaria, the butterfly Acosmeryx naga and three bumblebees (Bombus melanurus, B. eximius, B. sonani) and they all preferred to visit white (younger) flowers. Moths had a preference for 3-carene and no significant preference for n-hexadecanoic acid and hexadecanal. Seed sets of nocturnal pollination and control treatments were not significantly different. Lonicera calcarata could produce seeds by self-pollination; cross-pollination significantly increased the seed set. Floral color guides pollinators to visit younger flowers with more floral rewards and higher stigma activity. Different chemical compounds in floral odor may not only attract pollinators but also avoid herbivore damage.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a crucial class of protein kinases, which play an essential role in various biological processes in plants. Upland cotton (G. hirsutum) is the most widely cultivated cotton species with high economic value. To gain a better understanding of the role of the MAPK gene family, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the MAPK gene family in cotton. In this study, a total of 55 GhMPK genes were identified from the whole genome of G. hirsutum. Through an investigation of the expression patterns under diverse stress conditions, we discovered that the majority of GhMPK family members demonstrated robust responses to abiotic stress, pathogen stress and pest stress. Furthermore, the overexpression of GhMPK31 in cotton leaves led to a hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death phenotype and impaired the defense capability of cotton against herbivorous insects. Transcriptome and metabolomics data analysis showed that overexpression of GhMPK31 enhanced the expression of H2O2-related genes and reduced the accumulation of defensive related metabolites. The direct evidence of GhMPK31 interacting with GhRBOHB (H2O2-generating protein) were found by Y2H, BiFC, and LCI. Therefore, we propose that the increase of H2O2 content caused by overexpression of GhMPK31 resulted in HR-like cell death in cotton leaves while reducing the accumulation of defensive metabolites, ultimately leading to a decrease in the defense ability of cotton against herbivorous insects. This study provides valuable insights into the function of MAPK genes in plant resistance to herbivorous insects.

AB  - Female insects oviposit in sites suitable for the development of their offspring. The Oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata is a serious pest of various crops including wheat and prefers to oviposit on withered leaves rather than on fresh plant material, which is surprisingly different from other insects. Studies here showed that this oviposition tactic enables avoidance of wheat defence against eggs and emerged larvae. Intact plants responded to M. separata egg deposition by releasing oviposition-induced plant volatiles including acetophenone, tetradecene and pentadecane after 24 h. Acetophenone was identified as quantitatively accounting for the attraction of the egg parasitoid wasp (Trichogramma chilonis). Leaf jasmonic acid levels significantly increased after M. separata laid eggs, and primed the plant against emerging larvae. In addition, newly emerged M. separata larvae adopted a fast crawling behaviour and starvation tolerance compared with other noctuid larvae, which enhanced the survival of larvae on the withered leaves. The elucidation of this complex and surprising plant-insect interaction provides the first explanation for a herbivore laying eggs on withered leaves to avoid natural enemies and live-plant defence against emerging larvae.

AB  - Rapid analysis of animal welfare is a crucial component of the assessment of the meat quality supply chain, ensuring management procedures confer optimum standards of welfare. Further, there is increasing interest in monitoring the welfare state of each individual animal. This study looked at transport and pre-slaughter management in terms of meat quality evaluated in two breeds (Biellese and Sambucana) across two different farming systems. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies were implemented, including accelerometer and rumination activity ear-tag sensors, as potential welfare indicators during transportation and pre-slaughter. Significant correlations were found between sensors' parameters, such as total activity and rumination and physical and chemical meat quality characteristics such as drip loss. Lambs with lower rumination and/or lower total activity were found to have lower drip loss indicating reduced meat quality. Sensors have the potential to help detect those animals particularly sensitive to stressors during transport and pre-slaughter handling and may allow real-time measurement of the impact of transport and handling in abattoirs, enabling better animal management via specific customised strategies.

AB  - Immunomagnetic bead (IMB)-based detection has great potential for biomedical applications. Passive and active strategies, including microfluidics and magnetic actuation methods, have been developed to mix IMBs and analytes efficiently. However, cost-effective on-site detection using a simple microfluidic chip is challenging, and miniaturization of the magnetic driving device is imperative for portability. In this study, we propose a novel mixing method for an on-chip IMB swarm via magnetic actuation and mechanical vibration. A microfluidic chip system coupled with double spiral magnetic coils and a vibration motor was fabricated. The aggregation behavior of IMBs under magnetic fields and the diffusion behavior of the IMB swarm under mechanical vibration were analyzed in detail. Based on the synergetic effects of magnetic actuation and mechanical vibration, we achieved the highly efficient capturing of Vibrio parahaemolyticus DNA and goat anti-human immunoglobulin G by mixing the IMB swarm with the microfluidic chip. In this case, the antigen detection rate could reach similar to 94.4%. Given its fascinating features, such IMB-microfluidic detection demonstrates significant potential for biomedical applications.

AB  - As a widely adopted ecological agriculture model, the "pig-biogas-fruit (PBF)" system has become a key pathway for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from poultry manure into agroecosystems via biogas slurry. However, the patterns of ARGs distribution and transmission in biogas slurry of the PBF system remain poorly understood. Nine common ARGs and the Class 1 integron gene (intI1) were detected and quantified in biogas slurry samples from seven PBF farms in Huazhou City, Guangdong, China, using quantitative PCR. Gene abundances were further analyzed across different particle sizes. The results indicated that biogas slurry served as a reservoir for tetC, tetM, tetO, tetW, and sul1. The abundances of these ARGs were significantly higher than those in natural environmental samples, and their levels were comparable to or even exceeded those detected in wastewater and sludge. These findings highlighted the high risk of ARG contamination and its potential spread through the application of biogas slurry. Small particles (<250 mu m) carried significantly more ARGs than larger particles, with network analysis identifying anaerobic genera (e.g., Methanothrix) as dominant ARG potential hosts. Sub-250 mu m particles, acting as primary ARG carriers, necessitate stricter filtration control in anaerobic wetlands like rice paddies. Based on host adaptation patterns, preferential application of biogas slurry in dryland farming (e.g., orchards) is recommended to mitigate ARG dissemination risks, though field validation of host survival rates remains required. This study provides a theoretical basis for improved PBF model management.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify the factors associated with insomnia in MRI-negative epilepsy and uncover the underlying pathological mechanism driving insomnia within the context of epilepsy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with MRI-negative epilepsy recruited consecutively from December 2021 to December 2022. All subjects completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Additionally, some subjects underwent the three-dimensional pseudo continuous arterial spin labeling(3D-pCASL) imaging examination. Bilateral frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, caudate nucleus and lenticular nucleus were selected as regions of interest(ROI) and cerebral blood flow(CBF) values were measured in these regions. Subjects were classified into insomnia (ISI >= 10) or non-insomnia (ISI < 10) groups, and univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the factors associated with insomnia. Furthermore, CBF values in each ROI were compared between the two groups to identify the brain regions potentially related to the underlying pathological mechanism of insomnia in epilepsy. Results: A total of 73 patients with MRI-negative epilepsy were recruited in this study(men, 49.3 %). Among them, 14 patients(19.2 %) had insomnia. Univariate regression revealed that nocturnal seizures, number of antiseizure medication(ASM), anxiety, use of valproic acid(VPA), depression, and excessive daytime sleepiness(EDS) may be associated with insomnia in MRI-negative epilepsy (all p<0.05). Stepwise regression demonstrated that nocturnal seizures, anxiety, and EDS were independently associated with insomnia in MRI-negative epilepsy (OR [95 %CI]P: 14.64[2.02-106.27]0.008,49.35[3.06-796.61]0.006, 13.28[1.25-140.66]0.032, respectively). Furthermore, CBF values in the left amygdala were significantly lower in patients with MRI- negative epilepsy who had insomnia. Conclusion: The prevalence of insomnia in MRI-negative epilepsy is 19.2%. Nocturnal seizures, anxiety, and EDS were independently associated with insomnia in MRI-negative epilepsy. The noteworthy decrease in CBF values in the left amygdala might be connected to the underlying pathological mechanism of insomnia in epilepsy.

AB  - Estrogen exerts its action via estrogen receptors (ERs), including ER alpha and ER beta, and has effects on immunomodulation during pregnancy. It is known that there are changes in the function of the maternal immune organs during pregnancy. However, it is not clear if early pregnancy has effects on the expression of ER alpha and ER beta in the ovine maternal thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. In this study, these maternal immune organs were harvested at day 16 of the estrous cycle and at days 13, 16, and 25 of pregnancy (n = 6 for each group) after the ewes were euthanized. The mRNA and protein expression of ER alpha and ER beta were analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. The results reveal that the mRNA and protein expression of both ER alpha and ER beta were upregulated in the maternal spleen and the expression of ER alpha and ER beta in the thymus, lymph nodes, and liver was modulated during early pregnancy. In conclusion, early pregnancy modulates the expression of ER alpha and ER beta in the maternal thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver in a tissue-specific manner, which is related to the regulation of maternal immune function during early pregnancy in ewes.

AB  - BackgroundChrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum x morifolium) is one of the four major cut flowers worldwide and is valued for ornamental, culinary, and medicinal purposes. Terpenoids are key components of the fragrance of chrysanthemum; they not only serve to repel insect herbivores and promote pollination but also impact the value of the plant. However, the terpene production of chrysanthemum and the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear.ResultsWe used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify 177 compounds, including 106 terpenes, in ten chrysanthemum cultivars. Monoterpene derivatives and sesquiterpenes were the most common. Next, we identified 27 candidate hub genes for terpene production in chrysanthemum via combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis, as well as weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The three terpenes synthesis-related genes were significantly expressed in the disc florets of the different chrysanthemum cultivars. We concluded that the transcription factors TCP8, TCP5, ATHB8, ATHB7, HAT22, TGA1, TGA4, and WHY1 may regulate terpene synthesis.ConclusionsIn this study, we profiled terpenes in chrysanthemum florets and constructed a key terpene-transcription factor network related to terpene synthesis. These findings lay the groundwork for future research into the mechanism of terpene synthesis in chrysanthemum as well as in other plants.

AB  - Rhododendron decorum, a widely distributed Rhododendron species in southwestern China, is recognized not only for its significant ornamental value but also as a culinary resource for local tribes. However, the defense mechanisms underlying the ecological adaptations of R. decorum remain to be elucidated. In this study, we conducted comparative transcriptomic analyses of various organs (corolla, androecium/gynoecium and leaves) of R. decorum collected from two distinct two regions. Approximately 186.98 Gb of clean data were generated from three organs of R. decorum across these regions. Through de novo assembly, a total of 92,025 unigenes were obtained and nearly half of them (43,515 unigenes) were successfully annotated. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within three comparative groups of different organs (HQI/LFI, HQO/LFO and HQL/LFL, respectively) revealed that the distribution of R. decorum in the Heqing region exhibited an increased requirement for plant immunity, including resistance to diseases, insects, and herbivores across various plant organs. Conversely, R. decorum in the Lijiang region showed a greater reliance on environmental factors, such as cold tolerance, aromatic compounds production, and the attraction of pollinating insects. Notably, the validation of 21 pivotal genes identified from significantly regulated enrichment pathways across different organs showed functional consistency in the KEGG enrichment analysis among different organs in these two regions. The functional disparities observed in the transcriptome of R. decorum across distinct regions provide valuable insight into the understanding of its adaptive defense mechanism.

AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world and is important for global food security. However, damage caused by striped stem borer (SSB) seriously threatens rice production and can cause significant yield losses. The development and use of resistant rice varieties or genes is currently the most effective strategy for controlling SSB. We genotyped 201 rice samples using 2849855 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on observed variation data of 201 rice cultivars resistant to SSB. We obtained a quantitative trait locus (QTL)-qRSSB4 that confers resistance to SSB. Through annotation and analysis of genes within the qRSSB4 locus, as well as qRT-PCR detection in resistant rice cultivars, we ultimately selected the candidate gene LOC_Os04g34140 (named OsRSSB4) for further analysis. Next, we overexpressed the candidate gene OsRSSB4 in Nipponbare through transgenic methods, resulting in OsRSSB4 overexpressing lines (OsRSSB4OE). In addition, we evaluated the insect resistance of OsRSSB4OE lines using wild type (Nipponbare) as a control. The bioassay experiment results of live plants showed that after 20 days of inoculation with SSB, the withering heart rate of OsRSSB4OE-34 and OsRSSB4OE-39 lines was only 8.3% and 0%, with resistance levels of 1 and 0, respectively; however, the withering heart rate of the wild-type reached 100%, with a resistance level of 9. The results of the in vitro stem bioassay showed that, compared with the wild-type, the average corrected mortality rate of the SSB fed on the OsRSSB4OE line reached 94.3%, and the resistance reached a high level. In summary, we preliminarily confirmed that OsRSSB4 positively regulates the defense of rice against SSB. This research findings reveal new SSB resistance gene resources, providing an important genetic basis for SSB resistance breeding in rice crops.

AB  - Introduction: Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) infestation (SMI) is a detrimental factor for roses grown indoors. Although predatory mite (Neoseiulus californicus) antagonism (PMA) is often utilized to alleviate SMI damage, little is known about the defensive response of greenhouse-grown roses to SMI and the molecular mechanism by which PMA protects roses. Methods: To determine the transcriptome and metabolome responses of roses to SMI and PMA, the leaves of a rose cultivar ("Fairy Zixia/Nightingale") were infested with T. urticae, followed by the introduction of predator mite. Leaf samples were collected at various time points and subjected to transcriptome and metabolome analyses. Results: We found that 24 h of SMI exerted the most changes in the expression of defense-related genes and metabolites in rose leaves. KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites revealed that rose responses to SMI and PMA were primarily enriched in pathways such as sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, phytosterol biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and other pathways associated with resistance to biotic stress. Rose reacted to SMI and PMA by increasing the expression of structural genes and metabolite levels in phytosterol biosynthesis, mevalonate (MVA) pathway, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and stilbenoid biosynthesis. In addition, PMA caused a progressive recover from SMI, allowing rose to revert to its normal growth state. PMA restored the expression of 190 essential genes damaged by SMI in rose leaves, including transcription factors DRE1C, BH035, MYB14, EF110, WRKY24, NAC71, and MY108. However, after 144 h of PMA treatment, rose responsiveness to stimulation was diminished, and after 192 h, the metabolic levels of organic acids and lipids were recovered in large measure. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results offered insights on how roses coordinate their transcriptome and metabolome to react to SMI and PMA, therefore shedding light on how roses, T. urticae, and N. californicus interact.

AB  - Insect herbivory challenges plant survival, and coordination of the interactions between growth, herbivore resistance/tolerance is a key problem faced by plants. Based on field experiments into resistance to the Asian corn borer (ACB, Ostrinia furnacalis), we selected 10 inbred maize lines, of which five were resistant and five were susceptible to ACB. We conducted ACB larval bioassays, analysed defensive chemicals, phytohormones, and relative gene expression using RNA-seq and qPCR as well as agronomic traits, and found resistant lines had weaker inducibility, but were more resistant after ACB attack than susceptible lines. Resistance was related to high levels of major benzoxazinoids, but was not related to induced levels of JA or JA-Ile. Following combination analyses of transcriptome, metabolome and larval performance data, we discovered three benzoxazinoids biosynthesis-related transcription factors, NAC60, WRKY1 and WRKY46. Protoplast transformation analysis suggested that these may regulate maize defence-growth trade-offs by increasing levels of benzoxazinoids, JA and SA but decreasing IAA. Moreover, the resistance/tolerance-growth trade-offs were not observed in the 10 lines, and genotype-specific metabolic and genetic features probably eliminated the trade-offs. This study highlights the possibility of breeding maize varieties simultaneously with improved defences and higher yield under complex field conditions.

AB  - The pig is an important model for studying human diseases and is also a significant livestock species, yet its testicular development remains underexplored. Here, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptomic landscapes across multiple developmental stages of Bama pig testes from fetal stage through infancy, puberty to adulthood, and made comparisons with those of humans and mice. We reveal an exceptionally early onset of porcine meiosis shortly after birth, and identify a distinct subtype of porcine spermatogonia resembling transcriptome state 0 spermatogonial stem cells identified in humans, which were previously thought to be primate specific. We also discover the persistent presence of proliferating progenitors for myoid cells in postnatal testes. The regulatory roles of Leydig cell steroidogenesis and estrogen synthesis in supporting cell lineages are also explored, including the potential impact of estrogen on Sertoli cell maturation and spermatogenesis. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into porcine testicular development, paving the way for future research in reproductive biology, advancements in agricultural breeding, and potential applications in translational medicine.

AB  - Papain and pepsin-hydrolyzed whey protein (PAH and PEH, respectively) were prepared and characterized for its degree of hydrolysis, chemical constituents (amino acid and peptides) and antioxidant activity. A field experiment was conducted at El Salheya El Gedida City, Sharqia, Egypt, during the seasons 2019 and 2020, to investigate the biological action of the foliar spray of PAH and PEH on the growth and yield of pea plants cultivated in a clay loam soil. Foliar application of the papain and pepsin-hydrolyzed whey protein (PAH and PEH, respectively) at 1000 and 2000 mg/L was applied three times after 25, 35 and 45 days from planting. All protein foliar spray treatments had significant positive effects on the uptake of N, P and K, simultaneously increasing the contents of all the photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b and Carotenoids) in a concentration-dependent manner. The most conspicuous increase was seen in Chlorophyll b (105% increase), followed by Carotenoids (91% increase). Generally, the favorable increases caused by the second level of application (2000 mg/L) were nearly 2-3 times that of the low level (1000 mg/L). Pod growth and formation indicators, e.g., no. of pod/plant, pod length and no. of seeds/pod, responded more evidently to the hydrolyzed than the intact form of whey protein treatments. Hydrolyzed whey protein foliar spray treatments achieved significantly higher increases in the global field yield components of Pisum sativum plants than the intact form, where peptic hydrolysates were significantly superior to papain hydrolysate. The treatment PEH (2000 mg/L) can be recommended as the most effective bio-stimulating foliar spray treatment for higher plant productivity when applied 25, 35 and 45 days after planting.

AB  - Introduction: As a result of the rapid increase in population and depletion of natural resources, particularly energy and water, approximately 200 million people are expected to face hunger by 2030. Going forward, the sustainability of energy, water, and food (EWF) resources can be enhanced by considering a nexus approach, which supports effective resource management by identifying synergies and trade-offs. Furthermore, the regeneration of biomass into value-added products, such as biochar (BC), can reduce cross-sectoral environmental impacts and support the EWF nexus.Methodology: This research investigates the optimum options for utilizing BC within the context of the EWF nexus for both wastewater treatment and soil applications whilst considering the optimal blending ratio of various biomass (camel manure, date pits, sewage sludge, and coffee waste) for both single-end use and multi-end use stages to fulfill various objectives within defined scenarios based on maximum savings in energy, water, cost, and emissions.Results and discussion: The single-end use stage considered using BC for wastewater treatment (WWT) and as a soil amendment (SA) individually, and 18 optimal solutions were collected for this stage. The optimization of the multi-end use stage resulted in 70 optimal solutions, where BC was applied for both WWT and SA. The solutions that leaned toward SA application suggested that BC should consist of 97%-99% of date pits with relatively smaller proportions of the other biomass. On the other hand, the other solutions that leaned toward the WWT pathway suggested that the optimum biomass mix should consist of relatively equal proportions of camel manure, sewage sludge, and coffee waste of 29%-33% and smaller amounts of date pits of approximately 2%-5%.

AB  - Little quantitative information is available on how dietary lipids concurrently alter the main rumen microbial functions in relation with their incorporation level. In a three-period experiment, linseed (Linum usitatissimum, LO) and rapeseed (Brassica napus L., RO) oils were added at 0, 40 or 80 g/kg dry matter input (DMI) to five 1-L dual outflow fermenters that were on a maize silage-based diet for nine days per period. RO supply decreased butyrate specific production. The amount of hexoses fermented (HF) increased by 9% at 40 g/kg LO. The production of CH4 was lower at 80 g/kg LO by 46% compared with controls. Conversely, the supply of LO significantly increased H-2 and H2S productions in an antagonistic mode. The specific productions of propionate, butyrate, CH4 and H-2 were altered by LO. The supply of RO increased the ammonia daily outflow (by 23% at 40 g/kg) and decreased the organic N outflow (by 13% at 80 g/kg). The degradabilities of dietary fractions were not affected by RO, neither the OM partitioning between dietary, fermented and microbial outflows. The OM true degradability decreased at 80 g/kg LO compared with controls and 40 g/kg LO. When LO was supplied, isovalerate and ammonia-N outflows were higher, organic and microbial N outflows and EMPS were lower along with changes in the OM outflow partitioning. Overall microbial processes appeared to differ in their responses to fatty acids saturation. Moreover, most effects were present at 40 g/kg DMI and diminished or even plateaued at 80 g/kg DMI.

AB  - Landscape governance challenges, particularly in peri-urban contexts like the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) region in South India, exemplify 'wicked' problems due to their inherent complexities. These challenges arise from a mix of conflicting interests, policy ambiguities, and sociocultural dynamics, which often blur the definition of problems and hinder effective solutions. Despite apparent options for resolution, stakeholder disagreements and deep uncertainties about implementation strategies complicate governance. This study, therefore, has two broad objectives. The first objective is to analyze the local discourses surrounding planned policy interventions around the BNP region in South India. Based on the findings, the second objective is to draw insights for sustainable natural resource governance research and practice. We applied Q-methodology to understand the discourses that underpin various conflicts in the rapidly urbanizing elephant corridor at BNP. We elicited information on how various local actors frame solutions to current collective action challenges in the BNP landscape and their perspectives on the proposed eco-sensitive zone notification, as well as the functioning of current policy interventions concerning conservation and development. The study uncovers the micropolitics and power regimes underpinning various natural resource governance challenges and demonstrates the utility of the Q-methodology in bringing diverse perspectives together in response to 'wicked' governance challenges.

AB  - The determination of the live body weight of camels (required for their successful breeding) is a rather difficult task due to the problems with handling and restraining these animals. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to predict the ABW of eight indigenous camel (Camelus dromedarius) breeds of Pakistan (Bravhi, Kachi, Kharani, Kohi, Lassi, Makrani, Pishin, and Rodbari). Selected productive (hair production, milk yield per lactation, and lactation length) and reproductive (age of puberty, age at first breeding, gestation period, dry period, and calving interval) traits served as the predictors. Six data mining methods [classification and regression trees (CARTs), chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID), exhaustive CHAID (EXCHAID), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSs), MLP, and RBF] were applied for ABW prediction. Additionally, hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean distance was performed for the phenotypic characterization of the camel breeds. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values (0.84, p < 0.05) was obtained for MLP, which was also characterized by the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) (20.86 kg), standard deviation ratio (SDratio) (0.54), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (2.44%), and mean absolute deviation (MAD) (16.45 kg). The most influential predictor for all the models was the camel breed. The applied methods allowed for the moderately accurate prediction of ABW (average R2 equal to 65.0%) and the identification of the most important productive and reproductive traits affecting its value. However, one important limitation of the present study is its relatively small dataset, especially for training the ANN (MLP and RBF). Hence, the obtained preliminary results should be validated on larger datasets in the future.

AB  - Disturbances in neuroplasticity undoubtedly play an important role in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Brain neurotransmitters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known as crucial players in cerebral and behavioral plasticity. Such an important neurotransmitter as dopamine (DA) is involved in the behavioral inflexibility of ASD. Additionally, much evidence from human and animal studies implicates BDNF in ASD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, crosstalk between BDNF and the DA system has not been studied in the context of an autistic-like phenotype. For this reason, the aim of our study was to compare the effects of either the acute intracerebroventricular administration of a recombinant BDNF protein or hippocampal adeno-associated-virus-mediated BDNF overexpression on autistic-like behavior and expression of key DA-related and BDNF-related genes in BTBR mice (a widely recognized model of autism). The BDNF administration failed to affect autistic-like behavior but downregulated Comt mRNA in the frontal cortex and hippocampus; however, COMT protein downregulation in the hippocampus and upregulation in the striatum were insignificant. BDNF administration also reduced the receptor TrkB level in the frontal cortex and midbrain and the BDNF/proBDNF ratio in the striatum. In contrast, hippocampal BDNF overexpression significantly diminished stereotypical behavior and anxiety; these alterations were accompanied only by higher hippocampal DA receptor D1 mRNA levels. The results indicate an important role of BDNF in mechanisms underlying anxiety and repetitive behavior in ASDs and implicates BDNF-DA crosstalk in the autistic-like phenotype of BTBR mice.

AB  - Background Senecavirus A (SVA) caused porcine idiopathic vesicular disease (PIVD) showing worldwide spread with economic losses in swine industry. Although some progress has been made on host factors regulating the replication of SVA, the role of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) remains unclear.Methods The expression of ZBP1 in SVA-infected 3D/421 cells was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the effects of over and interference expression of ZBP1 on SVA VP2 gene and protein. Viral growth curves were prepared to measure the viral proliferation. The effect on type I interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in SVA infection was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Western blot was used to analysis the effect of ZBP1 on NF-kappa B signaling pathway and inhibitor are used to confirm.Results ZBP1 is shown to inhibit the replication of SVA by enhancing NF-kappa B signaling pathway mediated antiviral response. SVA infection significantly up-regulated the expression of ZBP1 in 3D4/21 cells. Infection of cells with overexpression of ZBP1 showed that the replication of SVA was inhibited with the enhanced expression of IFNs (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta), ISGs (ISG15, PKR, and IFIT1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha), while, infected-cells with interference expression of ZBP1 showed opposite effects. Further results showed that antiviral effect of ZBP1 is achieved by activation the NF-kappa B signaling pathway and specific inhibitor of NF-kappa B also confirmed this.Conclusions ZBP1 is an important host antiviral factor in SVA infection and indicates that ZBP1 may be a novel target against SVA.

AB  - Present paper demonstrates design and characterization of a textile based microfluidic chip sensor for the detection of milk adulteration through measuring the real part of the impedance and impedance phase angle. Polyamide (PA) based textile fabric was chemically functionalized with polyaniline and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (PANI/TiO2) nanocomposite and embedded in the microfluidic chip. Prototyping of microfluidic chip was performed by xurography and hot lamination using polyvinyl chloride foils. Morphological and chemical properties of fabricated textile-based PA-PANI/TiO2 chip sensor were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Quality of milk was accessed with fabricated textile sensor using cow and goat milk samples. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to detect the change in resistance and phase angle of pure and diluted milk. The developed PA-PANI/TiO2 chip sensor acted as a variable resistor that was able to identify adulterations and spoilage of the milk samples with sensitivity of 0.06 degrees of phase angle variation per % of water dilution. Our work promises that application of textile electronics could be efficiently exploited for food safety, point-of-care and environment monitoring applications.

Presl), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus Stapf.), clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), star anise (Illicium verum Hook.f), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) applied to the host plant, elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.). The bioassays were performed using a Y olfactometer, and the combinations of the plant extracts applied to the host plant were tested against fresh air and against the host plant without the extract. The results show that the extracts of tobacco and star anise were non-attractive to M. spectabilis adults. The extracts from the remaining plants did not alter the response of M. spectabilis to the host plant.

AB  - Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by fungi, which are ubiquitous in cereals and feed worldwide and threaten human and animal health. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins and causes a series of toxicities, especially enterotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a destructive enteropathogenic animal coronavirus, is often accompanied with DON contamination in the swine herd. Previous studies have shown that PEDV infection leads severe immunosuppression in pigs. However, whether DON exposure aggravates the PEDV-induced immunosuppression remains unclear. In this study, weaned piglet and porcine alveolar macrophage cell (PAM) models were established to explore the effects of DON on the PEDV-induced immunosuppression and to clarify its underlying mechanism. The in vivo results showed that 2.25 mg/kg feed DON significantly exacerbated the immunosuppressive effects on the PEDV-infected piglets, as demonstrated by the decreases in growth performance, the numbers of goblet cells and CD3(+)T cells, as well as the protein expressions of ZO-1, Claudin1 and Muc2, in addition to the increases in anti-inflammatory factors levels and the intestinal injury. Similarly, the in vitro results demonstrated that 3-4 mu M DON markedly aggravated apoptosis, enhanced the expressions of anti-inflammatory factors, but reduced the migration and phagocytosis abilities of the PEDV-infected PAMs. Furthermore, DON significantly suppressed the expressions of TLR4/ NLRP3 in vivo and in vitro. To contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the corresponding activator, obviously alleviated the DON-exacerbated immunosuppression. Our findings suggest that DON could aggravate host immunosuppression under the condition of PEDV infection through inhibiting TLR4/NLRP3 signaling pathway, and provide novel theoretical insights into the further studies on the immunotoxicity of DON contamination and PEDV-induced immunosuppression.

AB  - Digestion and assimilation of nutrients and energy is central to survival. At its most basic level, investigations of digestion in animals must examine digestive efficiency, or how much of a given meal (i.e., energy) or a specific nutrient an organism can acquire from its food. There are many studies examining this in reptiles, but there is large variation in methodology, and thus, in the conclusions drawn from the gathered data. The majority rely on ratio-based analyses that can jeopardize the reliability of their findings. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to identify common themes in the digestive efficiency data on reptiles. Due to the sheer number of available studies, we largely focused on lizards, but included data on all reptilian groups. As an example of what the current data can reveal, we performed a meta-analysis of digestive efficiency in lizards as a function of temperature using regression analyses. We detected a weak positive trend of soluble carbohydrate digestibility as a function of temperature, but no similar trend in broad-scale digestive efficiency, and propose that these patterns be reevaluated with non-ratio data. We conclude with calls to end conducting analyses on ratios and instead employ covariate methods, for more studies of reptilian digestive efficiency and related processes using consistent methodology, more representation of each population (e.g., many studies focus on males only), and more detailed studies examining the effects of temperature on digestion (since the current data are inconclusive).

AB  - Camellia tetracocca, a kind of tea with local popularity, is unique to southwest China, where it has an important natural heritage and cultural heritage. However, the tea plant and its sprout are frequently attacked on a large-scale by Empoasca onukii. The metabolic mechanisms of the unique plant for defending against these pest insects are unclear. Therefore, we used untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to compare the metabolite profiles between E. onukii-attacked leaves and healthy leaves. Using GC-MS, 56 metabolites (24 up-regulated, 32 down-regulated) were preliminarily identified. Additionally, 576 metabolites (280 up-regulated, 287 down-regulated) were rudimentarily identified with LC-MS. Differentially abundant metabolites were mainly enriched in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Fourteen accumulated specialized metabolites are related to insect resistance. Mainly, momordicin I and arabidopside B are reportedly involved in the resistance to the insect. Therefore, we conjectured that the accumulation of momordicin I and arabidopside B is involved in the C. tetracocca's resistance to E. onukii. Our results indicate that these specialized metabolites may be served as candidate biocontrol agents against the pest of E. onukii of C. tetracocca located in the State-owned Pubai Forest Farm.

AB  - The organophosphorus insecticide Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is widely used worldwide due to its high effectiveness. However, when ingested through the mouth and nose, it can cause severe neurotoxic effects and cognitive impairment. Natural anthocyanins show great potential in improving cognitive impairment. In this paper, we will delve into the protective effect of anthocyanins on CPF-induced cognitive impairment and its mechanism through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Morris water maze, histopathological, ELISA and western blot analyses showed that anthocyanins effectively ameliorated CPF-induced spatial learning memory impairment in mice by ameliorating CPF-induced AChE inhibition, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation and by modulating the levels of apoptosis (Caspase-3, Caspase-9) and autophagy (LC3II/ LC3I, Beclin1, p62, mTOR) biomarkers, in order to restore damaged hippocampal tissue morphology, neuron and synapse structures. To identify the action pathway of anthocyanins, we used KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis for screening prediction and western blot and molecular docking to verify that anthocyanins improve CPF-induced cognitive impairment by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - This study employs both simulation and experimental methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness of bi-sectional horizontal kinetic shading systems (KSS) with horizontal fins in enhancing daylight comfort across various climates. It emphasizes the importance of optimizing daylight levels while minimizing solar heat gain, particularly in the context of increasing energy demands and shifting climatic patterns. The study introduces a custom-designed bi-sectional KSS, simulated in three distinct climates-Wroclaw, Tehran, and Bangkok-using climate-based daylight modeling methods with the Ladybug and Honeybee tools in Rhino v.7 software. Standard daylight metrics, such as Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and Daylight Glare Probability (DGP), were employed alongside custom metrics tailored to capture the unique dynamics of the bi-sectional KSS. The results were statistically analyzed using box plots and histograms, revealing UDI300-3000 medians of 78.51%, 88.96%, and 86.22% for Wroclaw, Tehran, and Bangkok, respectively. These findings demonstrate the KSS's effectiveness in providing optimal daylight conditions across diverse climatic regions. Annual simulations based on standardized weather data showed that the KSS improved visual comfort by 61.04%, 148.60%, and 88.55%, respectively, compared to a scenario without any shading, and by 31.96%, 54.69%, and 37.05%, respectively, compared to a scenario with open static horizontal fins. The inclusion of KSS switching schedules, often overlooked in similar research, enhances the reproducibility and clarity of the findings. A physical reduced-scale mock-up of the bi-sectional KSS was then tested under real-weather conditions in Wroclaw (latitude 51 degrees N) during June-July 2024. The mock-up consisted of two Chambers '1' and '2' equipped with the bi-sectional KSS prototype, and the other one without shading. Stepper motors managed the fins' operation via a Python script on a Raspberry Pi 3 minicomputer. The control Chamber '1' provided a baseline for comparing the KSS's efficiency. Experimental results supported the simulations, demonstrating the KSS's robustness in reducing high illuminance levels, with illuminance below 3000 lx maintained for 68% of the time during the experiment (conducted from 1 to 4 PM on three analysis days). While UDI and DA calculations were not feasible due to the limited number of sensors, the Eh1 values enabled the evaluation of the time illuminance to remain below the threshold. However, during the June-July 2024 heat waves, illuminance levels briefly exceeded the comfort threshold, reaching 4674 lx. Quantitative and qualitative analyses advocate for the broader application and further development of KSS as a climate-responsive shading system in various architectural contexts.

AB  - Prion diseases are diagnosed in the symptomatic stage, when the neuronal damage is spread throughout the central nervous system (CNS). The assessment of biological features that allow the detection of asymptomatic cases is needed, and, in this context, scrapie, where pre-symptomatic infected animals can be detected through rectal biopsy, becomes a good study model. Neurogranin (Ng) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are proteins that reflect synaptic and axonal damage and have been studied as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in different neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we evaluated Ng and NfL both at the protein and transcript levels in the CNS of preclinical and clinical scrapie-affected sheep compared with healthy controls and assessed their levels in ovine CSF. The correlation between these proteins and the main neuropathological events in prion diseases, PrPSc deposition and spongiosis, was also assessed. The results show a decrease in Ng and NfL at the protein and gene expression levels as the disease progresses, and significant changes between the control and preclinical animals. On the contrary, the CSF levels of NfL increased throughout the progression of the disease. Negative correlations between neuropathological markers of prion disease and the concentration of the studied proteins were also found. Although further research is needed, these results suggest that Ng and NfL could act as biomarkers for neurodegeneration onset and intensity in preclinical cases of scrapie.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the effect of administering prostaglandin (250 mg cloprostenol) and oxytocin (10 UI) or a GnRH agonist (4.2 mg buserelin acetate) on rams' physiological responses to elec-troejaculation and the ejaculate's characteristics. The study was performed with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, according to whether it used oxytocin and prostaglandin (OXPGF) or GnRH. Therefore, there were four treatments: GControl = saline; GOXPGF = administration of PGF2 alpha and oxytocin; GGnRH = administration of GnRH; administration of GOXPGF + GnRH = GnRH and PGF2 alpha + oxytocin. An interaction between the hormonal treatments in the heart rate occurred: while the heart rate decreased when using OXPGF alone (control: 113.7 bpm vs. GOXPGF: 103.5 bpm, pooled SEM; P = 0.02), it did not modify when applying both treatments simultaneously and administering GnRH (GGnRH: 109.1 bpm vs. GOXPGF + GnRH: 111.5 bpm respectively, pooled SEM = 4.5). The respiratory rate also decreased with the administration of OXPGF (38.7 vs. 46.3 with and without OXPGF, pooled SEM = 10.0, P = 0.003). Administering OXPGF also tended to decrease the temperature (38.77 degrees C vs. 38.94 degrees C, with and without OXPGF, respectively, pooled SEM = 0.06; P = 0.056). Blood glucose increased with the administration of OXPGF from 58.7 mg/dL to 62.4 mg/dL (pooled SEM = 1.3, P = 0.014) and varied with time. CK con-centrations increased from 641.8 mg/dL to 881.7 mg/dL (pooled SEM = 50.6) with the administration of OXPGF. GnRH administration decreased cortisol concentration from 7.3 ng/mL to 2.1 ng/mL (pooled SEM = 1.4; P = 0.04). The treatments had no effects on the time required for EE, the pulse at which the animals began and ended the ejaculation, or the vocalizations emitted during EE. There were no effects in any evaluated sperm variable. The research concluded that the administration of oxytocin and analogs of PGF2alpha decreased the stress response to electroejaculation, as well as administering GnRH agonist was slightly effective as it only decreased cortisol concentration. Also, these treatments, either alone or combined, did not affect the characteristics of the ejaculate collected. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Suids, both domesticated and wild, are found on all continents except for Antarctica and provide valuable food resources for humans in addition to serving as important models for biomedical research. Continuing advances in genome sequencing have allowed researchers to compare the genomes from diverse populations of suids helping to clarify their evolution and dispersal. Further analysis of these samples may provide clues to improve disease resistance/resilience and productivity in domestic suids as well as better ways of classifying and conserving genetic diversity within wild and captive suids. Collecting samples from diverse populations of suids is resource intensive and may negatively impact endangered populations. Here we catalog extensive tissue and DNA samples from suids in collections in both Europe and North America. We include samples that have previously been used for whole genome sequencing, targeted DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). This work provides an important centralized resource for researchers who wish to access published databases.

AB  - The disorder of adult neurogenesis is considered an important mechanism underlying the learning and memory impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sporadic nonhereditary form of AD (sAD) affects over 95% of AD patients and is related to interactions between genetic and environmental factors. An intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ-ICV) is a representative and well-established method to induce sAD-like pathology. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and is used for multiple sclerosis treatment. The present study determines whether a 26-day DMF therapy ameliorates the disruption of adult neurogenesis and BDNF-related neuroprotection in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb (OB) in an STZ-ICV rat model of sAD. Considering age as an important risk factor for developing AD, this study was performed using 3-month-old (the young group) and 22-month-old (the aged group) male Wistar rats. Spatial cognitive functions were evaluated with the Morris water maze task. Immunofluorescent labelling was used to assess the parameters of adult neurogenesis and BDNF-related neuroprotection in the hippocampus and OB. Our results showed that the STZ-ICV evoked spatial learning and memory impairment and disturbances in adult neurogenesis and BDNF expression in both examined brain structures. In the aged animals, the deficits were more severe. We found that the DMF treatment significantly alleviated STZ-ICV-induced behavioural and neuronal disorders in both age groups of the rats. Our findings suggest that DMF, due to its beneficial effect on the formation of new neurons and BDNF-related neuroprotection, may be considered as a promising new therapeutic agent in human sAD.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress encountered during late gestation will not only reduce subsequent lactation performance, it will also affect the health and growth performance of calves. This study investigated the effects of seasonal heat stress during late gestation on the growth, metabolism, and immunity of calves. We found that heat stress during this period can impair hormones, oxidative stress, and immunity of calves before weaning and increase the risk of diarrhea in the first week after birth. Heat stress during late gestation could affect subsequent lactation performance, resulting in damage to the immune function, health, and growth performance of calves. This study aimed to compare the effects of 33 days of summer stress (Summer group, 70.15 < THI < 74.28) with 33 days of winter during late gestation (Winter group, 57.55 < THI < 67.25) on the growth, hormones, oxidative stress, and immune function of calves. Calves (Summer, n = 28; Winter, n = 23) were separated from cows immediately after birth and fed with 2 L colostrum within 2 h and 8-10 h after birth, respectively, and weaned at 60 days of age. Bodyweight (BW) was measured at birth and weaning. Withers height (WH), body length, and chest girth were measured at birth, 30 days, and 60 days of age. The health of calves ranging in age from 1 to 7 days was recorded. Plasma interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), superoxide dismutase (SOD), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), IgG, cortisol, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), growth hormone (GH), insulin, lipid peroxide (LPO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured in calves at 0 (before colostrum feeding), 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days of age. The pregnancy period of the Summer group was shortened by 1.44 days. The Winter and Summer groups had the same birth weight. One week after birth, the incidence of diarrhea was 57.14% and 21.74% in Summer and Winter groups, respectively. Compared with the Winter group, TNF-alpha in the Summer group increased significantly before colostrum feeding. ACTH and LPO decreased significantly at 3 days of age, ACTH and TNF-alpha decreased significantly at 7 days of age, Hsp70 increased significantly, ACTH was significantly reduced at 14 days of age, and Hsp70 increased dramatically at 7 days of age. SOD and TNF-alpha increased statistically at 28 days of age, LPO decreased significantly, and IFN-gamma decreased significantly at 56 days of age, while IgG and GH increased significantly. We conclude that maternal heat stress during late gestation can damage the oxidative stress and immune plasma indexes of offspring before weaning.

AB  - Chronic adrenergic stimulation is the dominant factor in impairment of the beta-cell function. Sustained adrenergic exposure generates dysregulated insulin secretion in fetal sheep. Similar results have been shown in Min6 under the elevated epinephrine condition, but impairments after adrenergic removal are still unknown and a high rate of proliferation in Min6 has been ignored. Therefore, we incubated primary rats' islets with half maximal inhibitory concentrations of epinephrine for three days, then determined their insulin secretion responsiveness and related signals two days after removal of adrenaline via radioimmunoassay and qPCR. Insulin secretion was not different between the exposure group (1.07 +/- 0.04 ng/islet/h) and control (1.23 +/- 0.17 ng/islet/h), but total islet insulin content after treatment (5.46 +/- 0.87 ng/islet/h) was higher than control (3.17 +/- 0.22 ng/islet/h, p < 0.05), and the fractional insulin release was 36% (p < 0.05) lower after the treatment. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of Gas, Gocz and G beta 1-2 decreased by 42.8% 19.4% and 24.8%, respectively (p < 0.05). Uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2), sulphonylurea receptor 1 (Sur1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) were significantly reduced (38.5%, 23.8% and 53.8%, p < 0.05). Chronic adrenergic exposure could impair insulin responsiveness in primary pancreatic islets. Decreased G proteins and Sur1 expression affect the regulation of insulin secretion. In conclusion, the sustained under-expression of Ucp2 and Sod2 may further change the function of beta-cell, which helps to understand the long-term adrenergic adaptation of pancreatic beta-cell.

AB  - The scarcity of donor kidneys greatly impacts the survival of patients with end-stage renal failure. Pigs are increasingly becoming potential organ donors but are limited by immunological rejection. Based on the human kidney organoid already established with the CHIR99021 and FGF9 induction strategy, we generated porcine kidney organoids from porcine naive-like ESCs (nESCs). The derived porcine organoids had a tubule-like constructure and matrix components. The porcine organoids expressed renal markers including AQP1 (proximal tubule), WT1 and PODO (podocyte), and CD31 (vascular endothelial cells). These results imply that the organoids had developed the majority of the renal cell types and structures, including glomeruli and proximal tubules. The porcine organoids were also identified to have a dextran absorptive function. Importantly, porcine organoids have a certain abundance of vascular endothelial cells, which are the basis for investigating immune rejection. The derived porcine organoids might serve as materials for immunosuppressor screening for xenotransplantation.

AB  - Information on sow nursing behavior plays an important role in improving the survival rate of weaned piglets. To obtain more information on sow nursing processing, it is necessary to introduce beginning-and end-stage nursing behavior recognition. This is defined as fine-grained nursing behavior recognition. In this paper, we attempt to automate fine-grained nursing behavior recognition with surveillance video. First, nursing behavior is divided into three subbehaviors: before piglet sucking, piglet sucking and end piglet sucking. Then, a deep neural network model with a dual-stream structure, named SlowFast, is introduced to realize preliminary sow nursing behavior recognition by extracting spatiotemporal features. Finally, for some erroneous results in behavior recognition and the recognition ambiguity in behavior transition, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is introduced to modify the behavioral label sequence by using the Viterbi algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of our method, all experiments are carried out on sow nursing videos collected in an actual breeding environment. The results show that our method achieves a 90.50% sequence coincidence degree for the recognition results on long videos containing the whole nursing behavior, and the accuracy of behavior transition times reaches 87.05%. In summary, this study refines the automatic sow nursing behavior monitoring content to provide more information for precision livestock farming.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV)-mediated eavesdropping by plants is a well-documented, inducible phenomenon that has practical agronomic applications for enhancing plant defense and pest management. However, as with any inducible phenomenon, responding to volatile cues may incur physiological and ecological costs that limit plant productivity. In a common garden experiment, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to a single HIPV would decrease herbivore damage at the cost of reduced plant growth and reproduction. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and pepper (Capsicum annuum) plants were exposed to a persistent, low dose (similar to 10 ng/h) of the green leaf volatile cis-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC), which is a HIPV and damage-associated volatile. z3HAC-treated pepper plants were shorter, had less aboveground and belowground biomass, and produced fewer flowers and fruits relative to controls, while z3HAC-treated lima bean plants were taller and produced more leaves and flowers than did controls. Natural herbivory was reduced in z3HAC-exposed lima bean plants, but not in pepper. Cyanogenic potential, a putative direct defense mechanism in lima bean, was lower in young z3HAC-exposed leaves, suggesting a growth-defense tradeoff from z3HAC exposure alone. Plant species-specific responses to an identical volatile cue have important implications for agronomic costs and benefits of volatile-mediated interplant communication under field conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of ejaculate indicates that fertility is still variable among bulls and that more stringent evaluation methods are needed to identify the ejaculates suitable for AI. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the sperm subpopulations (SP) in thawed semen doses of Nelore and Angus bulls and to evaluate the influence of these sperm subpopulations on pregnancy rate in cows submitted to fixed-time AI (FTAI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dose of post -thawed semen from each bull (n=18; consisting of Angus n = 9 and Nelore n = 9) was analyzed for: sperm kinetics; morphology and plasma membrane integrity; and the determination of the sperm subpopulations. Differences between the groups were estimated with the t-test considering a significance level of <5%. RESULTS: There was no influence between breeding bulls for sperm morphology, plasma membrane integrity, and pregnancy rate (P > 0.05). Regarding the kinetic parameters evaluated by the CASA system, Nelore had greater values, for cells with slow velocity (Angus: 16.4 %; Nelore: 21.74%; P = 0.028). In contrast, ANGUS bulls had more static cells (Angus: 27.2%; Nelore: 9.3%; P = 0.048). Based on CASA system data and clustering procedures, four sperm subpopulations were statistically established. In Angus bulls, a higher level of fast and nonlinear spermatozoa were found in SP3 (33.3%), followed by SP1 (32.7%) with fast and progressive spermatozoa. Whereas, SP1 of Nelore bulls had 33.8% fast and progressive spermatozoa, followed by 32.2% of SP3 with fast and nonlinear spermatozoa. CONCLUSION: Both breeds of bulls presented similar proportions of sperm SP. Consequently, no influence on the pregnancy rates was shown in cows submitted to the IATF programs on a large scale.

AB  - Modern Neotropical rainforests are characterized by the high intensity and host specificity with which insects feed on plants. Previous studies have shown that, during the middle-late Paleocene, the leaves of the early evolving Neotropical rainforests of tropical South America were heavily herbivorized by insects. Yet, less attention has been given to insect damage found on fossil fruits and seeds, despite the host specialization of many disseminule predators in modem forests. Here, we present and describe borings found on a fruit compression fossil of cf. Cocos (coconut) from the middle-late Paleocene Cerrejon Formation (58-60 Ma) of Colombia. We interpret the borings as constructed by palm seed beetles (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae: Pachymerina) based on size, number, position, plant reaction tissue, and plant host selection. This occurrence provides the earliest record of an ecological interaction between seed beetles and palms, suggesting that this host-specific interaction has been consistently maintained for several tens of millions of years.

AB  - Arthrospira is a filamentous cyanobacterium, rich in proteins and bioactive compounds, which is a dietary supplement for humans and animals. However, the contribution of this "superfood" on the life history traits of zooplankton is poorly addressed. We conducted Daphnia magna growth experiment using Arthrospira platensis comparing it with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as quality food, to evaluate the nutritional adequacy of A. platensis for rearing daphnids. The trichomes of A. platensis was fragmented using a bead crusher for easier ingestion by the daphnids. The growth experiments revealed that A. platensis alone did not support both survival and growth of D. magna, but the daphnid survival increased after the addition of 20% C. reinhardtii. When A. platensis was supplemented with 50% and more of C. reinhardtii, however, growth was better than to those daphnids exclusively fed on C. reinhardtii. This suggests that A. platensis have some nutritional limitations essential for daphnids survival and growth instead of less digestibility or toxicity. Carbon (C) to Phosphorus (P) ratio (C:P = 46) of A. platensis was far below the threshold for daphnid growth (C:P = 116). This implies that P limitation is unlikely in A. platensis as feed for daphnids. Although the lack of some essential biochemicals such as sterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids may be a more plausible explanation, a small addition of A. platensis to standard microalgal foods would result in better growth of zooplankton, including D. magna.

AB  - Platelets contain most of the potent mitogenic factors present in serum and follicular fluid and intraovarian injection of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) was shown to improve ovarian function and development of preantral follicles. This study evaluated the effect of PRP on caprine oocyte maturation in vitro and subsequent fertilization and embryonic development. Cumulus oocyte complexes were cultured in a maturation medium supplemented with (1) fetal bovine serum (FBS, control), (2) PRP, extracted from healthy female goats, (3) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and (4) PVA plus PRP (PVA-PRP). The degree of cumulus expansion was scored, and denuded oocytes were used for assessment of nuclear maturation, mitochondrial activity, lipid content, redox status, yield and quality of in vitro embryo development, and cryosurvival of the resulting blastocysts. PRP supported the same beneficial effects of FBS on cumulus expansion, nuclear maturation, in vitro developmental competence of oocytes, and survival of vitrified-warmed blastocysts. Moreover, PRP protected oocytes from undesirable effects FBS exerted on the mitochondrial activity and intracytoplasmic lipid content of maturing oocyte. Although PVA could support the same beneficial effects of neither FBS nor PRP on oocyte maturation, its combined addition with PRP improved the yield and quality of oocyte maturation at rates closely similar to PRP. PRP efficiently substitutes beneficial effects of serum during in vitro oocyte maturation and helps maintain the mitochondrial activity of maturing oocytes.

AB  - Investigations using preclinical models of preterm birth have much contributed, together with human neuro-pathological studies, for advances in our understanding of preterm brain injury. Here, we evaluated whether the neurodevelopmental and behavioral consequences of preterm birth induced by a non-inflammatory model preterm birth using mifepristone would differ from those after inflammatory prenatal transient hypoxia-ischemia (TSHI) model. Pregnant Wistar rats were either injected with mifepristone, and pups were delivered on em-bryonic day 21 (ED21 group), or laparotomized on the 18th day of gestation for 60 min of uterine arteries oc-clusion. Rat pups were tested postnatally for characterization of developmental milestones and, after weaning, they were behaviorally tested for anxiety and for spatial learning and memory. One month later, brains were processed for quantification of doublecortin (DCX)-and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive cells, and cholinergic varicosities in the hippocampus. ED21 rats did not differ from controls with respect to neonatal developmental milestones, anxiety, learning and memory functions, and neurochemical parameters. Conversely, in TSHI rats the development of neonatal reflexes was delayed, the levels of anxiety were reduced, and spatial learning and memory was impaired; in the hippocampus, the total number of DCX and NPY cells was increased, and the density of cholinergic varicosities was reduced. With these results we suggest that a preterm birth, in non-inflammatory prenatal environment, does not significantly change neonatal development and adult neurologic outcome. On other hand, prenatal hypoxia and ischemia (inflammation) modifies developmental trajectory, learning and memory, neurogenesis, and NPY GABAergic and cholinergic brain systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Measuring animal activity and its evolution in real time is one way of assessing animal welfare. Passive infrared sensors are a low-cost solution used in weaned piglet farming that has correlated well with human observation. In addition, using other easily measured variables that provide data about animal activity in the building, such as illuminance or noise level, is also relevant. This paper establishes relationships between animal activity as measured by passive infrared sensors, illuminance and noise levels on a conventional weaned piglet farm. Fitting a cosine model to three harmonics of animal activity has proven effective in modelling these three variables. Noise level and illuminance are easily measured variables that can provide reliable information about animal activity by implementing only one sensor, a sonometer or a lux meter. Unlike passive infrared sensors, sonometers and lux meters are not affected by the physical barriers that divide the farm.Abstract Measuring animal activity and its evolution in real time is useful for animal welfare assessment. In addition, illuminance and noise level are two factors that can improve our understanding of animal activity. This study aims to establish relationships between animal activity as measured by passive infrared sensors, and both illuminance and noise level on a conventional weaned piglet farm. First, regression models were applied, and then cosine models with three harmonics were developed using least squares with a Generalized Reduced Gradient Nonlinear method. Finally, all the models were validated. Linear models showed positive correlations, with values between 0.40 and 0.56. Cosine models drew clear patterns of daily animal activity, illuminance and noise level with two peaks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, coinciding with human activity inside the building, with a preference for inactivity at night-time and around midday. Cosine model fitting revealed strong correlations, both in the measurement and validation periods, for animal activity (R = 0.97 and 0.92), illuminance (R = 0.95 and 0.91) and noise level (R = 0.99 and 0.92). The developed models could be easily implemented in animal welfare monitoring systems and could provide useful information about animal activity through continuous monitoring of illuminance or noise levels.

AB  - Oral secretions (OS) contain diverse functional molecules that play important roles in the molecular interactions between insect herbivores and their host plants. Components of OS have been hypothesized to facilitate adaptation of specialized herbivores towards their preferred hosts. In this study, we identified an L-aminoacylase-encoding gene, SfruACY, that was preferentially up-regulated in the salivary glands of Spodoptera frugiderpa larvae when feeding on maize leaves compared to artificial diet. The protein product was confirmed to catalyze the in vitro degradation of fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs), the classic plant defense elicitors commonly found in the OS of lepidopteran caterpillars. Generation of a homozygous SfruACY knock-out line with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology further revealed that the activity of this gene could promote the growth of S. frugiperda larvae on maize leaves but was not required for larvae growth on artificial diet. Finally, comparative transcriptomic analyses of maize leaves showed more pronounced inducible defense responses when attacked by the SfruACY knocked-out larvae than the wildtype intruders. These experimental evidences support that the inducible expression of SfruACY by maize leaf diet in the salivary glands of S. frugiperda larvae can lower the FAC contents in their OS, and hence facilitate larvae growth likely by inducing weaker plant defense responses. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for a longstanding observation that S. frugiperda larvae induce weaker plant defense responses, and shed light on transcriptional regulation as a potential mean for insect herbivores to adapt towards their preferred host plant species.

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of adding allopathic doxorubicin (DOX 0.3 mu g/mL), the vehicle of ultradiluted/dynamized doxorubicin (0.2 % ethanol), different dynamizations of ultradiluted/dynamized doxorubicin (DOX 6CH, DOX 12CH and DOX 30CH), both in the absence or presence of chemical stress induced by doxorubicin at 0.3 mu g/mL on follicular survival and activation, antioxidant capacity of the medium, Catalase activity (CAT), production of reactive protein thiol, maintenance of type I and III collagen fibers and accumulation of lipofuscin in porcine ovarian tissue cultured in vitro for 48 hours. To do this, part of the ovarian tissue fragments was fixed for the uncultured control and the rest were cultured in: MEM (cultured control), DOX 0.3 mu g/mL, Ethanol, DOX 6CH, DOX 12CH, DOX 30CH, DOX (0.3 mu g/mL) + DOX 6CH, DOX (0.3 mu g/mL) + DOX 12CH, DOX (0.3 mu g/mL) + DOX 30CH treatments. The results showed that, in general, ultradiluted/dynamized doxorubicin (DOX 6CH, DOX 12CH and DOX 30CH) mitigated the toxic effect of allopathic doxorubicin (0.3 mu g/ mL) on the morphology of preantral follicles, the content of type I and III collagen fibers, and the production of lipofuscin in the tissue. However, only DOX (0.3 mu g/mL) + DOX 6CH attenuated the oxidative stress induced by DOX (0.3 mu g/mL), maintaining adequate CAT activity that was similar to the uncultured control. Additionally, when the three isolated ultradiluted/dynamized doxorubicin were considered, only DOX 12CH increased the reduced thiol levels compared to the uncultured control and MEM. In conclusion, supplementing the culture medium with ultradiluted/dynamized DOX (DOX 6CH, DOX 12CH and DOX 30CH) attenuated the toxicity induced by allopathic doxorubicin during the in vitro culture of pig preantral follicles enclosed in ovarian tissue.

AB  - Tail biting in pig farming causes economic losses as well as pain and suffering to the affected pigs. The aim of the study was to predict tail lesions to provide the farmer with the opportunity to intervene early. To do this, tail lesions were recorded during rearing (REA) and fattening (FAT) on two farms (Farm 1: 10 batches REA, 5 batches FAT; Farm 2: 7 batches REA, 4 batches FAT). In addition, tail posture, skin lesions, musculoskeletal system issues, treatment index for suckling, weight at weaning, water consumption, activity time, humidity, NH3 and CO2 concentrations were observed. Processed to daily values forming a time series, these data was used to predict the prevalence of tail lesions per pen using partial least squares (PLS) regression models, focused time-delay neural networks (FTDNN) and nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX). After training, validating and testing the methods for Farm 1, the respective methods were applied to the data of Farm 2. In addition, it was investigated whether the prevalence of tail lesions per pen could be predicted for an offset of one to five days before with PLS. The networks were used to test whether a delay of one to five days before should be included for prediction. NARX achieved the best prediction performance on both farms in REA and FAT: accuracy between true and estimated values (R 0.85-0.97), recall (REC 0.63-0.97), false positive rate (FPR 0.01-0.27), precision (PRC 0.43-0.92), F1-score (0.54-0.94) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC 0.66-0.97). PLS (R 0.49-0.81, REC 0.32-0.86, FPR 0.02-0.36, PRC 0.42-0.70, F1-score 0.40-0.77, AUPRC 0.43-0.85) and FTDNN (R 0.45-0.90, REC 0.19-1.00, FPR 0.00-0.97, PRC 0.30-0.84, F1-score 0.28-0.75, AUPRC 0.30-0.86) performed less accurately than NARX but still with sufficient prediction performance, whereby the results for Farm 2 were worse than for Farm 1. Therefore, a generalisation of the methods to other farms is possible. No noticeable difference was observed between offsets 1 to 5 and delays 1 to 5. PLS, FTDNN and NARX with all offsets and delays are suitable for predicting the prevalence of tail lesions per pen in several farms as well as in REA and FAT.

AB  - The burden of gastrointestinal parasites in zoo animals has serious implications for their welfare and the health of veterinarians and visitors. Zhuyuwan Zoo is located in the eastern suburb of Yangzhou city in eastern China, in which over 40 species of zoo animals are kept. In order to understand the infection status of GI parasites in Zhuyuwan Zoo, a total of 104 fresh fecal samples collected randomly from birds (n = 19), primates (n = 19), and non-primate mammals (n = 66) were analyzed using the saturated saline flotation technique and nylon sifter elutriation and sieving method for eggs/oocysts, respectively. Two Ascaris species were molecularly characterized. The results showed that the overall prevalence of parasitic infection was 42.3% (44/104). The parasitic infection rate in birds, primates, and non-primate mammals were 26.3% (5/19), 31.6% (6/19), and 50.0% (33/66), respectively. A total of 11 species of parasites were identified, namely, Trichostrongylidae, Capillaria sp., Trichuris spp., Strongyloides spp., Amidostomum sp., Toxascaris leonina, Baylisascaris transfuga, Parascaris equorum, Paramphistomum spp., Fasciola spp., and Eimeria spp. Paramphistomum spp. eggs were first detected from the captive Pere David's deer, and Fasciola spp. eggs were first reported from sika deer in zoo in China. A sequence analysis of ITS-2 and cox1 showed that the eggs isolated from the African lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus, 1758) were T. leonina, and the eggs from the brown bear (Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758) were B. transfuga. The public health threat posed by these potential zoonotic parasitic agents requires attention. These results lay a theoretical foundation for prevention and control of wild animal parasitic diseases at zoos in China.

AB  - To analyze the interaction between the surface soil and the soil-contacting component (65 Mn) in the camellia oleifera forest planting area in Changsha City, Hunan, China, in this study, we conducted discrete element calibration using physical and simulation tests. The chosen contact model was Hertz-Mindlin with JKR cohesion, with the soil repose angle as the response variable. The repose angle of the soil was determined to be 36.03 degrees based on the physical tests. The significant influencing factors of the repose angle determined based on the Plackett-Burman test were the soil-soil recovery coefficient, soil-soil rolling friction coefficient, soil-65 Mn static friction coefficient, and surface energy of soil for the JKR model. A regression model for the repose angle was developed using the Box-Behnken response surface optimization method to identify the best parameter combination. The optimal parameter combination for the JKR model was determined as follows: surface energy of soil: 0.400, soil-soil rolling friction coefficient: 0.040, soil-65 Mn static friction coefficient: 0.404, and soil-soil recovery coefficient: 0.522. The calibrated discrete element parameters were validated through experiments on the repose angle and steel rod insertion. The results indicated that the relative errors obtained from the two verification methods were 2.44% and 1.71%, respectively. This research offers fundamental insights for understanding the interaction between soil and soil-contacting components and optimizing their design.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by depression/anxiety and memory failure, primarily fear memory. According to the reports, neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity can play a role in the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying PTSD. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) intriguingly affects regulating of inflammatory responses and learning and memory. This study aimed to explore the effect of inhibiting Brd4 on depression/anxiety-like behaviors, spatial and fear memory, and underlying mechanisms in a model of PTSD. Inescapable foot shocks (IFS) with a sound reminder in 6 days were used to induce PTSD-like behaviors which were tested using contextual and cue fear tests, sucrose preference test, open-field test, elevated plus maze test, and Y-maze test. Meanwhile, the Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 was used as an intervention. The results found that IFS induced PTSD-like behaviors and indicated obvious Brd4 expression in microglia of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala, pro-inflammatory cytokines over-expression, microglial activation, and nuclear factor-kappa B over-expression in PFC and hippocampus but not in amygdala. Meanwhile, the alterations of immediate early genes (IEGs) were found in PFC, hippocampus, and amygdala. Besides, dendritic spine density was reduced in PFC and hippocampus but was elevated in amygdala of rats with IFS. In addition, treatment with JQ1 significantly reduced freezing time in the contextual and cue fear test, reversed the behavioral impairment, decreased the elevated neuroinflammation, and normalized the alteration in IEGs and dendritic spine densities. The results suggested that Brd4 was involved in IFS-induced PTSD-like behaviors through regulating neuroinflammation, dynamics of IEGs, and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the regulatory impact of early swimming intervention on striatal metabolism in Shank3 gene knockout ASD model rats. Methods: Shank3 gene knockout exon 11-21 male 8-day-old SD rats were used as experimental subjects and randomly divided into the following three groups: a Shank3 knockout control group (KC), a wild-type control group (WC) from the same litter, and a Shank3 knockout swimming group (KS). The rats in the exercise group received early swimming intervention for 8 weeks starting at 8 days old. LC-MS metabolism was employed to detect the changes in metabolites in the striatum. Results: There were 17 differential metabolites (14 down-regulated) between the KC and WC groups, 19 differential metabolites (18 up-regulated) between the KS and KC groups, and 22 differential metabolites (18 up-regulated) between the KS and WC groups. Conclusions: The metabolism of striatum in Shank3 knockout ASD model rats is disrupted, involving metabolites related to synaptic morphology, and the Glu and GABAergic synapses are abnormal. Early swimming intervention regulated the striatal metabolome group of the ASD model rats, with differential metabolites primarily related to nerve development, synaptic membrane structure, and synaptic signal transduction.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In their centuries-old nomadic life, since their livestock was the backbone of their lives, the Kyrgyz people used a variety of wild medicinal plants for ethnoveterinary practices. However, the plants used for the treatment of livestock ailments never have been recorded, except rarely in local publications. In this study, we present the HSHR (homemade single species herbal remedy reports), their methods of preparation and application, and the livestock ailments for which these remedies were used.Aims: The collect data from the five different high-altitude valleys of the Kyrgyz Republic on common HSHR used for the treatment of the livestock ailments and describe their preparation procedure, administration, and target animal species.Materials and methods: The plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use were collected from five different high-altitude valleys (pastures) in the Kyrgyz Republic during 2016 and 2018. Data were gathered with the help of dialog partners (experienced local shepherds, farmers and veterinarians) through semi-structured interviews. In total, 166 dialog partners were interviewed. The special characteristics of HSHR mentioned for ethnoveterinary use and practices were documented. Plant samples and voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification, and preserved for future reference.Results: A total of 2388 HSHR referred to 66 plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use belonging to 27 families and 49 genera. According to the data, species of the family Asteraceae were most frequently used HSHRs in the Kyrgyz ethnoveterinary practice (599 HSHR, 25%), followed by Polygonaceae (166 HSHR, 7%), Lamiaceae (141 HSHR, 6%), Ranunculaceae (121 HSHR, 5%), Nitrariaceae (119 HSHR, 4.9%), Apiaceae (113 HSHR, 4.7%), Cupressaceae (111 HSHR, 4.6%), Urticaceae (100 HSHR, 4.2%), Gentianaceae (92 HSHR, 3.8%), Amaranthaceae (87 HSHR, 3.6%). A total of 2785 UR (use reports) were collected for the 2388 HSHR. Infection diseases (572 UR, 20.5%), parasitic diseases (531 UR, 19%), gastrointestinal disorders (523 UR, 18.77%) and wounds (522 UR, 18.74%) were almost evenly reported indications. The largest number use reports (UR) were for cattle (967 UR, 34.7%) and horses (919 UR, 33%), followed by 607 UR (21.8%) for sheep and 292 UR (10.48%) for other domestic animals, including dogs (106 UR, 3.8%), goats (103 UR, 3.69%) and donkeys (83 UR, 2.98%).Conclusion: In this study, we identified the folk ethnoveterinary knowledge of the HSHR used by the Kyrgyz farmers in their daily veterinary practice. All the characterized HSHR are of value to the local animal breeders. This knowledge has previously been limited to local shepherds, farmers and vets. Many of these need scientific confirmation using modern methods of phytochemistry and pharmacology.

AB  - We studied risk factors for rhinitis in Japanese homes and schools. A questionnaire was sent to students in four schools (12-15 y age), 1048 (99.2%) participated. Crowdedness and furry pet allergens were measured in their classrooms. Household environment data was collected by a questionnaire. Risk factors were identified by multi-level logistic regression with mutual adjustment. The prevalence of current rhinitis was 60.3%, current rhinoconjunctivitis 24.4% and weekly rhinitis 29.5%. Window condensation (AORs1.69-1.90) and indoor painting (AORs1.72-1.76) at home were associated with rhinitis. The association between painting and rhinitis was stronger in girls (interaction p = 0.002) and in wooden homes (interaction p = 0.05). Dog allergen (Can f 1) in classroom air was associated with rhinitis (p = 0.04). In conclusion, window pane condensation and indoor painting can be household risk factors for rhinitis and dog allergen may be a risk factor in Japanese schools. Girls can be more sensitive to emissions from indoor paint than boys.

AB  - Simple Summary Several species of small mammals are very popular as companion pet animals and therefore demand professional veterinary care, including proper diagnostic and treatment procedures. The incidence of neoplastic diseases in companion pet animals has increased over time, as it has in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of cutaneous tumours in small mammal pets, including guinea pigs, rats, pet rabbits, ferrets, hamsters, degus, African pygmy hedgehogs, Mongolian gerbils and chinchillas, submitted for histopathology in 2014-2021. Malignant tumours represented the predominant group of cutaneous tumours in rats, African pygmy hedgehogs, degus and chinchillas, and represented a significant percentage of lesions in guinea pigs, pet rabbits, ferrets, hamsters and Mongolian gerbils. We also described the first case of melanocytoma in a pet rabbit, epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in a degu, cutaneous histiocytic sarcoma in a Mongolian gerbil, fibrosarcoma in two chinchillas and epithelioid haemangioma in a chinchilla. The incidence of malignant neoplasms among spontaneous integumentary tumours submitted for histopathology is high in many species of small mammal pets. Therefore, each cutaneous tumour should be sampled for further diagnosis and treatment. Since small mammals are gaining popularity as pets in Poland, the number of tumour samples submitted for histopathological examination is quite high. This study was a retrospective analysis of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours in small pet mammals submitted for histopathology in 2014-2021. The analysis included 256 tumours sampled from 103 guinea pigs, 53 rats, 43 pet rabbits, 21 ferrets, 17 hamsters, 8 degus, 5 African pygmy hedgehogs, 3 Mongolian gerbils and 3 chinchillas. Tumours were diagnosed based on routine histopathology, with additional immunohistochemistry when necessary. The results of this study revealed that the vast majority of cutaneous tumours in guinea pigs were benign, with a predominance of lipoma. Adnexal tumours constituted a significant percentage of cutaneous tumours in guinea pigs (24.3%, with the most common being trichofolliculoma), pet rabbits (46.5%, with the most common being trichoblastoma), ferrets (33.3%, mostly derived from sebaceous glands), hamsters (52.9%, with the most common being trichoepithelioma) and gerbils (66.7%, scent gland epithelioma). Soft tissue sarcomas were a predominant group of tumours in rats (52.8%, with the most common being fibrosarcoma), African pygmy hedgehogs (100%), degus (87.5%) and chinchillas (66.7%). Melanocytic tumours were only sporadically seen in small mammal pets. Mast cell tumours were diagnosed only in ferrets, while epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed only in a hamster and a degu. In summary, malignant tumours constitute a significant percentage of cutaneous tumours in many species of small mammal pets. Therefore, each cutaneous tumour should be sampled for further cytologic or histopathologic diagnosis.

AB  - This study investigates the combined effects of the neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor (NPY1R) agonist [Leu31-Pro34]NPY at a dose of 132 mu g and Ketamine at 10 mg/Kg on cognitive functions and neuronal proliferation, against a backdrop where neurodegenerative diseases present an escalating challenge to global health systems. Utilizing male Sprague-Dawley rats in a physiological model, this research employed a single-dose administration of these compounds and assessed their impact 24 h after treatment on object-in-place memory tasks, alongside cellular proliferation within the dorsal hippocampus dentate gyrus. Methods such as the in situ proximity ligation assay and immunohistochemistry for proliferating a cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and doublecortin (DCX) were utilized. The results demonstrated that co-administration significantly enhanced memory consolidation and increased neuronal proliferation, specifically neuroblasts, without affecting quiescent neural progenitors and astrocytes. These effects were mediated by the potential formation of NPY1R-TrkB heteroreceptor complexes, as suggested by receptor co-localization studies, although further investigation is required to conclusively prove this interaction. The findings also highlighted the pivotal role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mediating these effects. In conclusion, this study presents a promising avenue for enhancing cognitive functions and neuronal proliferation through the synergistic action of the NPY1R agonist and Ketamine, potentially via NPY1R-TrkB heteroreceptor complex formation, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Purpose In this study it is investigated whether typical pollution sources cause differences of heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) pollution in the soil-leafy vegetable systems.
   Materials and methods Soil and leafy vegetable samples were collected in the fields contaminated by industrial operation sources (IOS) and organic fertilizer sources (OFS), respectively, in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) areas. The differences of heavy metal pollution were compared in soil-vegetable systems contaminated by IOS and OFS (IOS- and OFS-systems). Those mainly included (1) Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn contents in soils and vegetables; (2) heavy metal fractions distribution in soils and their connection with the heavy metal in leafy vegetables; (3) the key influential factor of heavy metal accumulation of leafy vegetable; and (4) the ecological risk of heavy metal pollution in soil-vegetable systems.
   Results and discussion The mean pollution index (PI) of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn was 5.05, 1.89, 0.72, and 1.21 in IOS-soils (soils contaminated by IOS), and 2.51, 0.25, 0.64, and 0.71 in OFS-soils (soils contaminated by OFS), respectively. For PIs > 1, the percentages of Cd were 100% in both sources. The IOS caused more significant Cd and Pb pollution in vegetables, but OFS induced higher Cu and Zn accumulation. The Cd in soils had a relatively higher bioavailable fraction proportion (the sum of water-soluble, exchangeable and carbonate-bound fraction), mobility, and transferability in IOS-soils. Nevertheless, such indicators for Cu and Zn were higher in OFS-soils. Compared with IOS-soils, OFS-soils were characterized by a higher proportion of metals bound to humic acid and organic matter. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that the accumulation of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in IOS-vegetables (vegetables contaminated by IOS) was mainly controlled by F3-Cd, F5-Pb, F5-Cu, and F3-Zn in soils, respectively. Moreover, F1-Cd, F4-Pb, F2-Cu, and F2-Zn could be the dominant influential factors of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn absorption by OFS-vegetables (vegetables contaminated by OFS), respectively. Risk assessment results revealed that the IOS-systems had higher heavy metal pollution level than OFS-systems.
   Conclusions The source of heavy metals is one of the main factors for the mobility and transfer of heavy metals in the soil-plant systems. There are obvious differences in pollution characteristics between IOS- and OFS-soils. Compared with OFS, IOS caused the more serious ecological risk of heavy metal pollution to the soil-vegetable systems.

AB  - Retaking routes after a period of time usually occurs in an environment which has suffered from spatial configuration modifications. Thus, the original visual stimuli that allowed us to establish cognitive mapping using an allocentric strategy during the acquisition phase may not remain physically identical at the time of retrieval. However, in the standard experimental paradigms the cues are typically maintained constant. In this study, we explored memory retrieval with spatial modifications from learning in the Morris Water Maze. We trained rats on a reference memory protocol with five cues placed on black curtains that surrounded the pool, and seven days later, we tested memory retrieval under different conditions: maintenance of the five cues, removal of two and four of them, and the addition of three extra ones. Under full-cue and partial cue-conditions, rats showed successful memory retrieval, whereas adding extra cues resulted in impaired retrieval. Furthermore, we assessed brain oxidative metabolism through cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) histochemistry and found that, under full- and partial-cue conditions, there is an enhancement of the hippocampal, prefrontal, retrosplenial, parietal, and rhinal cortex metabolism. Rats that failed to retrieve spatial information in the extra cues condition showed similar or lower CCO activity than controls across many limbic areas. It is suggested that the presence of a partial portion of visual stimuli from learning makes it possible to reactivate the entire memory trace, but extra spatial information hinders retrieval, making it difficult to disengage the novel information from the older knowledge and establish a contextual generalization.

AB  - Simple Summary Oxidative stress in mammalian sperm can be induced during cryopreservation; therefore, it is important to inhibit oxidative stress to maintain sperm motility during cryopreservation. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of supplementing apigenin (AP), astragalus polysaccharide (APS), or their combination on an extender for bull semen freezing. Sperm viability, motility, and motion parameters; acrosome integrity and membrane integrity; endogenous antioxidant indices; and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were evaluated after semen thawing. Our results indicated that 0.2 mmol/L AP or 0.5 mg/mL APS improved the cryopreservation of bull sperm; moreover, their combination in the extender could further improve the protective effects on bull sperm post-thaw. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of apigenin and astragalus polysaccharides on the cryopreservation of bovine semen. Apigenin, astragalus polysaccharides, or their combination were added to a frozen diluent of bovine semen. Afterwards, Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA), membrane functionality, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial integrity, CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, MDA, and ROS detection were conducted. The results showed that adding 0.2 mmol/L AP or 0.5 mg/mL APS could improve the quality of frozen sperm. Compared to 0.2 mmol/L AP alone, the combination of 0.2 mmol/L AP and 0.3 mg/mL APS significantly increased the total motility (TM), average path distance (DAP), straight line distance (DSL), average path velocity (VAP), curvilinear velocity (VCL), wobble (WOB), and sperm CAT and SOD levels (p < 0.05), while reducing the ROS and MDA levels (p < 0.05). These results indicated that the addition of 0.2 mmol/L AP or 0.5 mg/mL APS alone has a protective effect on the freezing of bovine semen. Compared to the addition of 0.2 mmol/L AP, a combination of 0.2 mmol/L AP and 0.3 mg/mL APS could further improve the quality of frozen semen.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, head and neck surgical approaches need an increased level of anatomical knowledge and practical skills; therefore, the related learning curve is both flat and long. On such procedures, surgeons must decrease operating time as much as possible to reduce the time of general anesthesia and related stress factors for patients. Consequently, little time can be dedicated for training skills of students and young residents in the operating theater. Fresh human cadavers offer the most obvious surrogate for living patients, but they have several limitations, such as cost, availability, and local regulations. Recently, the feasibility of using ex vivo animal models, in particular ovine ones, have been considered as high-fidelity alternatives to cadaveric specimens. Methods: This comprehensive review explores all of head and neck otolaryngology applications with this sample. We analyzed studies about ear surgery, orbital procedures, parotid gland and facial nerve reanimation, open laryngeal and tracheal surgery, microlaryngoscopy procedures, laryngotracheal stenosis treatment, and diagnostic/operative pediatric endoscopy. For each different procedure, we underline the main applications, similarities, and limitations to human procedures so as to improve the knowledge of this model as a useful tool for surgical training. Results: An ovine model is easily available and relatively inexpensive, it has no limitations associated with religious or animal ethical issues, and it is reliable for head and neck surgery due to similar consistencies tissues and neurovascular structures with respect to humans. However, some other issues should be considered, such as differences about some anatomical features, the risk of zoonotic diseases, and the absence of bleeding during training. Conclusion: This comprehensive review highlights the potentials of an ex vivo ovine model and aims to stimulate the scientific and academic community to further develop it for other applications in surgical education.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline due to accumulating synaptic insults by toxic oligomers of amyloid beta (A beta O) and tau (TauO). There is growing consensus that preventing these oligomers from interacting with synapses might be an effective approach to treat AD. However, recent clinical trial failures suggest low effectiveness of targeting A beta in late-stage AD. Researchers have redirected their attention toward TauO as the levels of this species increase later in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that A beta O and TauO differentially target synapses and affect each other's binding dynamics. Methods Binding of labeled, pre-formed A beta and tau oligomers onto synaptosomes isolated from the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mouse and postmortem cognitively intact elderly human brains was evaluated using flow-cytometry and western blot analyses. Binding of labeled, pre-formed A beta and tau oligomers onto mouse primary neurons was assessed using immunofluorescence assay. The synaptic dysfunction was measured by fluorescence analysis of single-synapse long-term potentiation (FASS-LTP) assay. Results We demonstrated that higher TauO concentrations effectively outcompete A beta O and become the prevailing synaptic-associated species. Conversely, high concentrations of A beta O facilitate synaptic TauO recruitment. Immunofluorescence analyses of mouse primary cortical neurons confirmed differential synaptic binding dynamics of A beta O and TauO. Moreover, in vivo experiments using old 3xTgAD mice ICV injected with either A beta O or TauO fully supported these findings. Consistent with these observations, FASS-LTP analyses demonstrated that TauO-induced suppression of chemical LTP was exacerbated by A beta O. Finally, predigestion with proteinase K abolished the ability of TauO to compete off A beta O without affecting the ability of high A beta O levels to increase synaptic TauO recruitment. Thus, unlike A beta O, TauO effects on synaptosomes are hampered by the absence of protein substrate in the membrane. Conclusions These results introduce the concept that TauO become the main synaptotoxic species at late AD, thus supporting the hypothesis that TauO may be the most effective therapeutic target for clinically manifest AD.

AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, yet whether variations in the UPR among individuals influence the propensity for metabolic disease remains unexplored. Using outbred deer mice as a model, we show that the intensity of UPR in fibroblasts isolated early in life predicts the extent of body weight gain after high-fat diet (HFD) administration. Contrary to those with intense UPR, animals withmoderate UPR in fibroblasts and therefore displaying compromised stress resolution did not gain body weight but developed inflammation, especially in the skin, after HFD administration. Fibroblasts emerged as potent modifiers of this differential responsiveness to HFD, as indicated by the comparison of the UPR profiles of fibroblasts responding to fatty acids in vitro, by correlation analyses between UPR and proinflammatory cytokine-associated transcriptomes, and by BiP (also known as HSPA5) immunolocalization in skin lesions from animals receiving HFD. These results suggest that the UPR operates as a modifier of an individual's propensity for body weight gain in a manner that, at least in part, involves the regulation of an inflammatory response by skin fibroblasts.

AB  - Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major psychoactive constituent of marijuana, can substantially change the function of several brain areas, leading to behavioral impairment including memory and learning dysfunction. Given the importance of hippocampus as one of the chief parts of the brain involved in memory processing, the present study seeks to investigate structural and histological alterations in hippocampus as well as behavioral defects provoked by THC treatment. Besides, using genome-wide sequencing, we adopted a pathway-based approach to discover dysregulated molecular pathways. Our results demonstrated remarkable hippocampal atrophy, and also interrupted memory function and long term potentiation (LTP) under THC exposure. We also detected several dysregulated signaling pathways involved in synaptic plasticity as well as cell-cell interaction in the hippocampus of THC-treated rats. Overall, the results indicate a potential correlation between disrupted signaling cascades, hippocampal atrophy and memory defects caused by THC treatment.

AB  - South Africa adopts intensive livestock farming, embracing the employment of huge quantities of antibiotics to meet the increased demand for meat. Therefore, bacteria occurring in the animal products and manure might develop antibiotic resistance, a scenario which threatens public health. The study investigated the occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria from eighteen pooled samples withdrawn from a single-stage steel biodigester co-digesting pig manure (75%) and pine wood saw dust (25%). The viable counts for each bacterium were determined using the spread plate technique. The bacterial isolates were characterised based on cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics, using the Analytical Profile Index 20 e test kit. In addition, isolates were characterised based on susceptibility to 14 conventional antibiotics via the disc diffusion method. The MAR index was calculated for each bacterial isolate. The bacterial counts ranged from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu/mL, indicating manure as a potential source of contamination. Overall, 159 bacterial isolates were recovered, which displayed diverse susceptibility patterns with marked sensitivity to amoxicillin (100% E. coli), streptomycin (96.15% for Yersinia spp.; 93.33% for Salmonella spp.) and 75% Campylobacter spp. to nitrofurantoin. Varying resistance rates were equally observed, but a common resistance was demonstrated to erythromycin (100% of Salmonella and Yersinia spp.), 90.63% of E. coli and 78.57% of Campylobacter spp. A total of 91.19% of the bacterial isolates had a MAR index > 0.2, represented by 94 MAR phenotypes. The findings revealed multidrug resistance in bacteria from the piggery source, suggesting they can contribute immensely to the spread of multidrug resistance; thus, it serves as a pointer to the need for the enforcement of regulatory antibiotic use in piggery farms. Therefore, to curb the level of multidrug resistance, the piggery farm should implement control measures in the study area.

AB  - Key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include build-up of amyloid beta (A beta), which promotes synaptic abnormalities and ultimately leads to neuronal cell death. Metabolic dysfunction is known to influence the risk of developing AD. Impairments in the leptin system have been detected in AD patients, which has fuelled interest in targeting this system to treat AD. Increasing evidence supports pro-cognitive and neuroprotective actions of leptin and these beneficial effects of leptin are mirrored by a bioactive leptin fragment (leptin(116-130)). Here we extend these studies to examine the potential cognitive enhancing and neuroprotective actions of 8 six-amino acid peptides (hexamers) derived from leptin(116-130). In this study, we show that four of the hexamers (leptin(116-121, 117-122, 118-123) and (120-125)) replicate the ability of leptin to promote alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and facilitate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the pro-cognitive effects of the hexamers were verified in behavioural studies, with the administration of leptin(117-122) enhancing performance in episodic memory tasks. The bioactive hexamers replicated the neuroprotective actions of leptin by preventing the acute hippocampal synapto-toxic effects of A beta, and the chronic effects of A beta on neuronal cell viability, A beta seeding and tau phosphorylation. These findings provide further evidence to support leptin and leptin-derived peptides as potential therapeutics for AD.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-slaughtertransportstress on the protein S-nitrosylation levels of porkduring 0, 3, and 6 days of aging. Pigs (N = 16) wererandomly selected and divided into two treatments: 3 h transport (transportstress, TS) and 3 h transport followed by 3 h resting (control, CON).Results showed that the TS group at 0 and 3 days presented a highernitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and neuronal NOS (nNOS) expressionthan the CON group (P < 0.05). Additionally, nNOSwas not only abundantly localized in the membrane but also observedin small amounts in the cytoplasm. The immunoblot of overall S-nitrosylated protein showed that protein S-nitrosylation levels in the TS group were greater than in the CONgroup during postmortem aging (P < 0.05). Thiswork can deliver novel insights into the mechanism of meat qualitychanges in response to pre-slaughter stress.

AB  - Free calcium (Ca2+) is a pivotal player in different in vivo and in vitro morphogenic processes. In the induction of somatic embryogenesis, its role has been demonstrated in different species. In carrot, however, this role has been more controversial. In this work, we developed carrot lines expressing cameleon Ca2+ sensors. With them, Ca2+ levels and distribution in the different embryogenic structures formed during the induction and development of somatic embryos were analyzed by FRET. We also used different chemicals to modulate intracellular Ca2+ levels (CaCl2, ionophore A23187, EGTA), to inhibit calmodulin (W-7) and to inhibit callose synthesis (2-deoxy-D-glucose) at different times, principally during the first stages of embryo induction. Our results showed that high Ca2+ levels and the development of a callose layer are markers of cells induced to embryogenesis, which are the precursors of somatic embryos. Disorganized calli and embryogenic masses have different Ca2+ patterns associated to their embryogenic competence, with higher levels in embryogenic cells than in callus cells. The efficiency of somatic embryogenesis in carrot can be effectively modulated by allowing, within a range, more Ca2+ to enter the cell to act as a second messenger to trigger embryogenesis induction. Once induced, Ca2+-calmodulin signaling seems related with the transcriptional remodeling needed for embryo progression, and alterations of Ca2+ or calmodulin levels negatively affect the efficiency of the process.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent abnormal neuronal discharges, leading to brain dysfunction and imposing significant psychological and economic burdens on patients. Microglia, the resident immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS), play a crucial role in maintaining CNS homeostasis. However, activated microglia can excessively prune synapses, exacerbating neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction following epilepsy. Wogonin, a flavonoid from Scutellaria Baicalensis, has known neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms, but its impact on microglial activation and synaptic pruning in neurons post-epilepsy remains unclear. Methods: Synaptic density was assessed using presynaptic marker Synaptophysin and postsynaptic marker Psd95, and microglial phagocytosis was evaluated with fluorescent microspheres. Pilocarpine-induced mouse model of status epilepticus was used to evaluate synaptic density changes of mouse hippocampus following an intraperitoneal injection of wogonin (50 and 100 mg/kg). Memory and cognitive function in mice were subsequently evaluated using the Y-maze, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. Single-cell sequencing was employed to investigate the underlying causes of microglial state alterations, followed by experimental validation. Results: Microglia were transitioned to an activated state post-epilepsy, exhibiting significantly enhanced phagocytic capacity. Correspondingly, levels of synaptophysin and Psd-95 were markedly reduced in neurons. Treatment with wogonin (100 mg/kg) significantly increased neuronal synaptic density and improved learning and memory deficits in epileptic mice. Further investigation revealed that wogonin inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and synaptic phagocytosis of microglia by activating the AKT/FoxO1 pathway. Conclusions: Wogonin could alleviate excessive synaptic pruning of epileptic neurons by microglia and improve cognitive dysfunction of epileptic mice via the AKT/FoxO1 pathway.

AB  - With the expansion of transmission demand in the power system, high-voltage transmission technology has been widely applied in the field of transmission. Some high-voltage transmission lines have small spacing between circuits, especially double circuit high-voltage transmission lines on the same tower or in the same corridor. When one circuit is shut down and the other circuit is in operation, the induced voltage and current on the shutdown circuit are high, which affects the stable operation of the power system. This article first analyzes the electromagnetic induction characteristics of high-voltage transmission lines. Then, based on the actual engineering background, ATP-EMPT simulation software was applied to build a simulation model of a 500 kV double circuit transmission line on the same tower or in the same corridor, considering the effects of different line lengths, transmission currents, horizontal spacing between lines, and tower call heights on the induced voltage and current of the shutdown line. Based on this prediction, the induced voltage and current are analyzed, and then the XGboost algorithm optimized by the Guanhao Pig algorithm is used to calculate and analyze the induced voltage and current of unknown lines. The measured data and simulation results show that the prediction algorithm proposed in this paper has high accuracy, providing a certain reference basis for determining the operating parameters of transmission lines.

AB  - Elephantopus tomentosus L. is a perennial herb taxonomically belonging to the family Asteraceae, which has been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of hepatobiliary diseases. Sesquiterpenoids from this plant have broad biological activities, including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects. In this study, fifteen structurally diverse sesquiterpenoids comprised 11 germacrane-type and 4 eudesmane-type sesquiterpenoids were prioritized to isolated from Elephantopus tomentosus L. based on the HSQC-based Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART) strategy. Among them, ten sesquiterpenoids were previously unreported, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data, computational methods, single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallographic data or electronic circular dichroism calculations. In addition, the structures of two known sesquiterpenoids, molephantin A and B, which were reported to possess E -geometry for the ??1(10) double bond, were revised by reanalyzing their spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic data. Some sesquiterpenoids exhibited significant cytotoxic activities against Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines.

AB  - The alkaloid, nicotine, produced by tobacco and other Solanaceae as an anti-herbivore defence chemical is one of the most toxic natural insecticides in nature. However, some insects, such as the whitefly species, Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Bemisia tabaci show strong tolerance to this allelochemical and can utilise tobacco as a host. Here, we used biological, molecular and functional approaches to investigate the role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in nicotine tolerance in T. vaporariorum and B. tabaci. Insecticide bioassays revealed that feeding on tobacco resulted in strong induced tolerance to nicotine in both species. Transcriptome profiling of both species reared on tobacco and bean hosts revealed profound differences in the transcriptional response these host plants. Interrogation of the expression of P450 genes in the host-adapted lines revealed that P450 genes belonging to the CYP6DP subfamily are strongly upregulated in lines reared on tobacco. Functional characterisation of these P450s revealed that CYP6DP1 and CYP6DP2 of T. vaporariorum and CYP6DP3 of B. tabaci confer resistance to nicotine in vivo. These three genes, in addition to the B. tabaci P450 CYP6DP5, were also found to confer resistance to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Our data provide new insight into the molecular basis of nicotine resistance in insects and illustrates how divergence in the evolution of P450 genes in this subfamily in whiteflies may have impacted the extent to which different species can tolerate a potent natural insecticide.

AB  - Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, such as polyp resection post-colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5-7 days) post-operative adverse events-such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra- and post-procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short-term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 h). In this study, a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions is developed using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine-modified Pluronic micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. The authors' findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3-7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications. Overall, this technology offers a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.
   GastroShield, an sprayable adhesive hydrogel, offers a novel solution to postoperative gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Utilizing polyethyleneimine-modified Pluronic and oxidized dextran, the hydrogel forms an instant, durable shield upon application via endoscopic spray, proven safe and effective in multiple animal models. This hydrogel uses a new approach for GI wound care, decreasing postoperative complications such as bleeding and perforation. image

AB  - From an evolutionary perspective, it is inferred that termites evolved to build tunneling patterns in a way that optimizes search and transport efficiency. So far, there have been many studies on search efficiency, but few studies on transport efficiency due to the difficulty of direct observation under the field condition. To overcome the difficulty, we developed an individual-based model to simulate the transport process. The model was characterized by four variables: (1) the frequency of food transfer (PT), (2) the loss of food during transfer (PL), (3) the effect of tunnel curvature (PC), and (4) the number of individuals participating in the transport (N0). We explored the effect of the variables on the efficiency of food transport (E). When the distance between the food site and the nest was short, food transport with PT = 0 was advantageous for high E, whereas for long and narrow tunnels with high traffic jam frequency, transport with PT > 0 could be rather advantageous for the increase of E. Another finding was that PT had the greatest effect on E, followed by PL, and third on PC. N0 had the least impact. In the discussion section, we discussed strategies that termites could take to optimize E with respect to the findings and presented ideas worth exploring experimentally. In addition, we briefly mentioned how the model could be improved to be more realistic.

AB  - This study investigated the ability of Integrated Constructed Wetlands (ICWs) to remove critically important antimicrobial resistant organisms (AROs) from farm wastewater. Influent samples from the untreated farm waste and effluent samples taken at the end of the ICW system were collected monthly from four ICWs, serving four different farm types (suckler, dairy, dairy & poultry and pig). Using selective media to screen for the presence of carbapenemase resistant organisms, plasmid mediated and AmpC B-Lactamase producing organisms (ESBL/ pAmpC) and fluoroquinolone resistant organisms, a total of 82 AROs were obtained with the majority being E. coli (n = 79). Statistically significant were the differences on the number of AROs isolated from influent (higher) compared to effluent, as well as a seasonal effect, with less AROs recovered during winter in comparison to other seasons (P < 0.05). On the other hand, there was no significant differences in the recovery of AROs on different farms. The majority of isolates from each of the farms (99%) were multi drug resistant, with 65% resistant to seven or more antimicrobials. A high incidence of tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin resistance was common to the isolates from all four farms but there were differences in ESBL levels with 63% of the isolates recovered from Farm 4 (piggery) being ESBLs compared to 18%, 36% and 4.5% recovered from Farms 1 (suckler), 2 (dairy) and 3 (dairy & poultry), respectively. No carbapenemase producing organisms were isolated. Our results showed that ICWs are effective in removing critically important AROs from farm wastewater on all four farm types. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Researches indicate miR-3200 is closely related to tumorigenesis, However, the role of miR-3200 in human hepatocarcinogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that miR-3200 accelerates the growth of liver cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Obviously, these findings are noteworthy that miR-3200 affects the transcriptional regulation for several genes, including DSP,BABAM2, Rab7A,SQSTM1,PRKAG2,CDK1,ABCE1, BECN1,PTEN,UPRT. And miR-3200 affects the transcriptional ability of several genes, such as, upregulating CADPS, DSP,FBXO32, PPCA,SGK1, PATXN7L1, PLK2,ITGB5,FZD3,HOXC8,HSPA1A,C-Myc,CyclnD1,CyclinE, PCNA and down-regulating SUV39H1, MYO1G, OLFML3, CBX5, PPDE2A, HOXA7, RAD54L, CDC45,SHMT7, MAD2L1,P27,IQGAP3,PTEN,P57,SCAMP3,etc...On the other hand, it is obvious that miR-3200 affects the translational ability of several genes, such as, upregulating GNS,UPRT,EIFAD,YOS1,SGK1,K-Ras,PKM2,C-myc, Pim1,CyclinD1,mTOR,erbB-2,CyclinE,PCNA,RRAS,ARAF,RAPH1,etc.. and down-regulating KDM2A, AATF, TMM17B, RAB8B, MYO1G,P21WAF1/Cip1,GADD45,PTEN,P27,P18,P57,SERBP1,RPL34,UFD1,Bax,ANXA6, GSK3 beta. Strikingly, miR-3200 affects some signaling pathway in liver cancer, including carbon metabolism signaling pathway, DNA replication pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, serine and threonine metabolism signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, Fatty acid biosynthesis signaling pathway, carcinogenesis-receptor activation signaling pathway, autophagy signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results suggest that miR-3200 enhances expression of RAB7A, and then Rab7A regulates the carcinogenic function of miR-3200 by increasing telomere remodeling in human liver cancer. These results are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of human liver cancer.

AB  - Background: Pathological changes associated with spinal cord injury (SCI) can be observed distant, rostral, or caudal to the epicenter of injury. These remote areas represent important therapeutic targets for post-traumatic spinal cord repair. The present study aimed to investigate the following in relation to SCI: distant changes in the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscles. Methods: The changes in the spinal cord, the tibial nerve, and the hind limb muscles were evaluated in control SCI animals and after intravenous infusion of autologous leucoconcentrate enriched with genes encoding neuroprotective factors (VEGF, GDNF, and NCAM), which previously demonstrated a positive effect on post-traumatic restoration. Results: Two months after thoracic contusion in the treated mini pigs, a positive remodeling of the macro- and microglial cells, expression of PSD95 and Chat in the lumbar spinal cord, and preservation of the number and morphological characteristics of the myelinated fibers in the tibial nerve were observed and were aligned with hind limb motor recovery and reduced soleus muscle atrophy. Conclusion: Here, we show the positive effect of autologous genetically enriched leucoconcentrate-producing recombinant neuroprotective factors on targets distant to the primary lesion site in mini pigs with SCI. These findings open new perspectives for the therapy of SCI.

AB  - Glibenclamide is a second-generation sulfonylurea used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The primary target of glibenclamide is ATP-sensitive potassium channels inhibition; however, other possible targets include the control of inflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability, which makes this compound potentially interesting for the management of brain-related disorders. Here, we showed that systemic treatment with glibenclamide (5 mg/kg, p.o., for 21 days) could prevent the behavioral despair and the cognitive dysfunction induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice. In nonhypoglycemic doses, glibenclamide attenuated the stress-induced weight loss, decreased adrenal weight, and prevented the increase in glucocorticoid receptors in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting an impact in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Additionally, we did not observe changes in Iba-1, NLRP3 and caspase-1 levels in the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus after CUS or glibenclamide treatment. Thus, this study suggests that chronic treatment with glibenclamide prevents the emotional and cognitive effects of chronic stress in female mice. On the other hand, the control of neuroinflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is not the major mechanism mediating these effects. The behavioral effects might be mediated, in part, by the normalization of glucocorticoid receptors and HPA axis.

AB  - Objective: Our study aimed to investigate the management of patients with medically refractory epilepsy related to temporal encephaloceles, focusing on the use of ancillary testing in the pre-surgical evaluation to optimize surgical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from the Cleveland Clinic, covering the period from January 2000 to May 2020. Patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy were included if they had temporal lobe encephaloceles and required surgical intervention. We reviewed the results of ancillary studies, including invasive EEG. Results: A total of 19 patients with temporal lobe encephaloceles underwent resection for drug-resistant epilepsy treatment. Among them, 63 % reported experiencing auras commonly associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, such as autonomic, psychic, and abdominal symptoms, followed by dialeptic seizures. Ictal patterns were consistently ipsilateral, with high amplitude delta or medium amplitude theta activity at onset, predominantly localized to the frontotemporal region in more than half of the cases. In 35 % of these patients, encephaloceles were only diagnosed during surgery. Stereo-EEG evaluation revealed two distinct ictal patterns: one characterized by localized low voltage fast activity in the temporal pole evolving into a 3-4 Hz high amplitude diffuse spiky activity, and the other exhibiting low amplitude rhythmic theta activity in the temporal pole with late involvement of the amygdala/hippocampus. Surgical resection strategy was based on clinical history and ancillary data analysis. At one-year follow-up after resection, 63 % of the patients attained Engel I seizure control over an average duration of 44 months (ranging from 6 months to 7.3 years). Additionally, 18 % of the patients achieved an Engel II outcome. Significance: Tailored resection of the encephalocele and the surrounding temporal pole, while preserving the mesial temporal structures, can effectively control seizures in patients with temporal encephaloceles identified through MRI. Patients presenting with temporal lobe symptoms and scalp ictal patterns characterized by polymorphic high delta theta activity with frontotemporal evolution should be evaluated for temporal encephaloceles as a potential underlying cause of their seizures, especially when the MRI is otherwise unrevealing.

AB  - Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder which is accompanied with behavioral and psychiatric alternations. Current evidences have shown that (-)-alpha-bisabolol (BSB) possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in several animal studies. Here, we conducted present study to evaluate its neuroprotective effects against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in rats. We used fifty male rats and they were randomly assigned into 5 groups control, BSB100, PTZ, BSB50 + PTZ, BSB100 + PTZ. The animals intraperitoneally received PTZ (45 mg/kg) for ten consecutive days to induce epilepsy model. BSB in doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg was administrated orally one hour before PTZ administration for ten days. The elevated plus maze (EPM) test was carried out to assess anxiety -like behavior. The seizure intensity was evaluated according to modifies Racine's convulsion scale (RCS). Y -maze and passive avoidance were utilized to assess working memory and aversive memory. The expression of pro -inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress factors were measured using the enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The neuronal cell loss in the hilar region was assessed using Nissl staining. Results showed that PTZ-treated rats had more seizure intensity, anxiety -like behavior, memory deficits, higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL -1 beta, and oxidative markers. Pre-treatment with BSB 100 significantly inhibited seizure intensity, anxiety -like behavior, and memory deficits; reduced levels of TNF-alpha, IL -1 beta, and MDA oxidative markers. Collectively, outcome of this work shows that BSB at the dose of 100 mg/kg may exert neuroprotective effects by mitigating seizures, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, and ameliorates memory and anxiety disorders in the PTZ-induced seizure rats.

AB  - Background: Acute and chronic brain damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) determines the need to investigate the neuroprotective potential of glucose-lowering drugs. The purpose was to directly compare the neuroprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) with different duration of action and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) in type 2 diabetic rats with and without stroke. Methods: DM was modelled using high-fat diet and nicotinamide+streptozotocin protocol. The following groups (n = 15 each) were formed: DM without treatment, treatment with liraglutide, dulaglutide, canagliflozin as well as control group without DM and treatment. After 8 weeks, 10 rats from each group underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion. In the reperfusion period neurological deficit, neuroglial damage markers and brain necrosis were evaluated. Brain slices from the remaining 5 animals in each group were histologically examined for microglial activation and neuronal damage. Results: Brain damage was similar in "DM" and "Control" (17.53 [14.23; 26.58] and 15.87 [13.40; 22.68] % of total brain volume, respectively). All study drugs diminished damage volume comparing with "DM" and "Control" whereas the necrosis volume in "DM+Liraglutide" was smaller than in "DM+Canagliflozin" and did not significantly differ from "DM+Dulaglutide" (2.9 [1.83; 4.71], 6.17 [3.88; 8.88] and 4.57 [3.27; 7.90] %). The neurological deficit was more prominent in "DM" than in "Control", while all the drugs demonstrated similar positive effect. Neurofilament light chains (NLC) did not differ between "DM" and "Control". Dulaglutide and canagliflozin caused a marked decrease in NLC. Protein S100BB level was similar in "DM" and "Control". Liraglutide caused the largest S100BB decrease, while canagliflozin did not influence it. In chronic brain ischaemia, all drugs increased the number of normal neurons, but GLP-1RAs had a more pronounced effect. DM was accompanied by increased number of activated microglial cells in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 hippocampal region. Both GLP-1RAs reduced the number of Iba-1-positive cells, with dulaglutide being more effective than liraglutide, whereas canagliflozin did not affect this parameter. Conclusions: GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2i have neuroprotective properties against acute and chronic brain damage in diabetic rats, although the infarct-limiting effect of GLP-1RAs may be more pronounced. GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2i exert their protective effects by directly influencing neuronal survival, whereas GLP-1RAs also affect microglia.

AB  - Featured Application In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for a pregnant sow piggery with centralized ventilation to reveal the distribution of temperature, humidity, and airflow velocity. After verifying the CFD model, the location of the air outlets and the velocity at the air inlets was also examined to obtain the optimal structure and control parameters. The average values, non-uniformity coefficient, and comfort levels were used to evaluate the performance of the piggery under these different parameters. (1) Background: The thermal environment in a pregnant sow piggery is affected by physical parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, and airflow velocity. However, it is challenging to conduct experimental studies due to the high cost. (2) Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to study the distribution characteristics of airflow in a pregnant sow piggery with centralized ventilation. (3) Results: The results show that the maximum difference between the simulated and experimental temperature was less than 1.54 degrees C, and the simulated and tested relative humidity difference was less than 10% RH. Incorporation of a middle air outlet is beneficial for increasing the uniformity of temperature distribution, as studied by comparing the temperature and humidity uniformity coefficient of the two air outlet locations, but the uniformity of humidity distribution will be reduced. With an increase in velocity, the temperature shows a downward trend and the relative humidity shows an upward trend. (4) Conclusions: The most suitable position for the outlet is the middle, with an associated airflow velocity of 0.5 m/s. This study revealed the variation in flow field distribution and air distribution in the pregnant sow piggery as a consequence of changes in ventilation structure, which has certain significance as a reference for the optimization of airflow in intensive pregnant sow piggeries.

AB  - A striking proportion of long non-coding RNAs are expressed specifically in the mammalian brain. Advances in genome-wide sequencing detected widespread diversity in neuronal lncRNAs based on their expression pattern, localization and function. A growing body of literature proposes that localization of lncRNAs is a critical determinant of their function. A rising number of recent findings documented distinct cytoplasmic functions of lncRNAs that are linked to activity-induced control of synaptic plasticity. However, the comprehensive role of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in neuronal functions is less understood. This review surveys our current understanding of lncRNAs that regulate the cytoplasmic life of mRNAs. We discuss the necessity of subcellular localization of lncRNAs in neuronal dendrites and the impact of their compartmentalized positioning on localized translation at the synapse. We have highlighted how lncRNAs modify a functional compartment to meet the demand for inputspecific control of synaptic plasticity and memory.

AB  - Neurotransmitter release is a highly controlled process by which synapses can critically regulate information transfer within neural circuits. While presynaptic receptors - typically activated by neurotransmitters and modulated by neuromodulators - provide a powerful way of fine-tuning synaptic function, their contribution to activity-dependent changes in transmitter release remains poorly understood. Here, we report that presynaptic NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) at mossy fiber boutons in the rodent hippocampus can be activated by physiologically relevant patterns of activity and selectively enhance short-term synaptic plasticity at mossy fiber inputs onto CA3 pyramidal cells and mossy cells, but not onto inhibitory interneurons. Moreover, preNMDARs facilitate brain-derived neurotrophic factor release and contribute to presynaptic calcium rise. Taken together, our results indicate that by increasing presynaptic calcium, preNMDARs fine-tune mossy fiber neurotransmission and can control information transfer during dentate granule cell burst activity that normally occur in vivo.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an infectious disease that can cause reproductive disorders in sows and affect the breathing of piglets, seriously endangering pig breeding worldwide. In this study, Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 was used as the expression delivery vector of foreign proteins, and a single-chain antibody was designed based on an mAb-PN9cx3 sequence. Three recombinant strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, namely, NC8/pSIP409-pgsA'-PN9cx3-scFV(E), NC8/pSIP409-pgsA'-PN9cx3-HC(E), and NC8/pSIP409-pgsA'-PN9cx3-LC(E), were successfully constructed. In an in vitro test, the viral load of each experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.01). In the piglet challenge protection test, the percentage of CD3+CD8+T cells in the blood of piglets given complex lactic acid bacteria was significantly increased before and after the challenge (p < 0.01); the body temperature of piglets in this group was normal, the viral load of each organ was reduced, and the obvious pathological changes in each tissue were alleviated. At the same time, the abundance of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and other bacteria in the intestinal tracts of the piglets changed, affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids and the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells. This experiment provides a feasible strategy and method for the design of a PRRSV vaccine.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the different fermentation and drying methods in valorising Artemisia argyi H.Le & PRIME;v. & Vanio as herbal tea by comparing its bioactive compounds, in vitro anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and sensory quality with commercial Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze tea. The total phenolic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities of C. sinensis were higher (p < 0.05) than A. argyi. Microwave drying and freeze drying increased the total phenolic, tannin, flavonoid, and antioxidant activity in fermented A. argyi. However, fermentation process decreased (p < 0.05) the anti-lipoxigenase activity in A. argyi. The browning index of leaf samples was significantly correlated (r = 0.888, p < 0.001) with the fermentation index. Principle component analysis showed that 65% of the accumulated variances in total phenolic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and sensory data of A. argyi were attributed to the different fermentation processes (35%) and thermal drying methods (30%). Although the consumer acceptance scores for C. sinensis tea was higher than A. argyi tea, freeze drying and microwave drying were identified as the preferred post-harvest processing methods for fermented A. argyi tea with optimal antiinflammatory and antioxidant effect.

AB  - We compared commonly used BAPTA-derived chemical Ca2+ dyes (fura2, Fluo-4, and Rhod-2) with a newer genetically encoded indicator (R-GECO) in single cell models of the heart. We assessed their performance and effects on cardiomyocyte contractility, determining fluorescent signal-to-noise ratios and sarcomere shortening in primary ventricular myocytes from adult mouse and guinea pig, and in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Chemical Ca2+ dyes displayed dose-dependent contractile impairment in all cell types, and we observed a negative correlation between contraction and fluorescence signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for fura2 and Fluo-4. R-GECO had no effect on sarcomere shortening. BAPTA-based dyes, but not R-GECO, inhibited in vitro acto-myosin ATPase activity. The presence of fura2 accentuated or diminished changes in contractility and Ca2+ handling caused by small molecule modulators of contractility and intracellular ionic homeostasis (mavacamten, levosimendan, and flecainide), but this was not observed when using R-GECO in adult guinea pig left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Ca2+ handling studies are necessary for cardiotoxicity assessments of small molecules intended for clinical use. Caution should be exercised when interpreting small molecule studies assessing contractile ef-fects and Ca2+ transients derived from BAPTA-like chemical Ca2+ dyes in cellular assays, a common platform for cardiac toxicology testing and mechanistic investigation of cardiac disease physiology and treatment.

AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is characterized by incomplete closure of the diaphragm. Although the ensuing compression to the fetal lung causes lung hypoplasia, specific cellular phenotypes and developmental signaling defects in the alveolar epithelium in CDH are not fully understood. Employing lung samples from human CDH, a surgical lamb model, and a nitrofen rat model, we investigated whether lung compression impairs alveolar epithelial differentiation and Yes-associated protein (YAP)-mediated mechanosensing. We showed that CDH in humans and lambs caused defective alveolar epithelial differentiation manifested by more alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, fewer ATI cells, and the emergence of cells coexpressing ATI and ATII markers. Associated with these alveolar epithelial defects, we found a decrease in the level and nuclear localization of YAP. Reduced YAP and abnormal distal lung development were evident as early as 21 weeks of gestation in human CDH. In addition, rat fetuses with CDH also showed diminished nuclear YAP and more abundant ATII cells. In contrast, the littermates without the hernia had no such alveolar phenotypes. Furthermore, fetal tracheal occlusion in the surgical lamb model of CDH fully normalized nuclear YAP and rescued alveolar epithelial defects in a gestational age-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings across species indicate that lung compression in CDH is sufficient to disrupt alveolar epithelial differentiation and impair YAP signaling. Tracheal occlusion can restore nuclear YAP and rescue the alveolar defects in CDH, depending on the timing and the duration of this prenatal surgical intervention.

AB  - Waxes are critical in limiting non-stomatal water loss in higher terrestrial plants by making up the limiting barrier for water diffusion across cuticles. Using a differential extraction protocol, we investigated the influence of various wax fractions on the cuticular transpiration barrier. Triterpenoids (TRPs) and very long-chain aliphatics (VLCAs) were selectively extracted from isolated adaxial leaf cuticles using methanol (MeOH) followed by chloroform (TCM). The water permeabilities of the native and the solvent-treated cuticles were measured gravimetrically. Seven plant species (Camellia sinensis, Ficus elastica, Hedera helix, Ilex aquifolium, Nerium oleander, Vinca minor, and Zamioculcas zamiifolia) with highly varying wax compositions ranging from nearly pure VLCA- to TRP-dominated waxes were selected. After TRP removal with MeOH, water permeability did not or only slightly increase. The subsequent VLCA extraction with TCM led to increases in cuticular water permeabilities by up to two orders of magnitude. These effects were consistent across all species investigated, providing direct evidence that the cuticular transpiration barrier is mainly composed of VLCA. In contrast, TRPs play no or only a minor role in controlling water loss.

AB  - The highly variable cytoplasmic N-terminus of the plant diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) has been shown to have roles in oligomerization as well as allostery; however, the biological significance of the variation within this region is not understood. Comparing the coding sequences over the variable N-termini revealed the Poaceae DGAT1s contain relatively high GC compositional gradients as well as numerous direct and inverted repeats in this region. Using a variety of reciprocal chimeric DGAT1s from angiosperms we show that related N-termini had similar effects (positive or negative) on the accumulation of the recombinant protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When expressed in Camelina sativa seeds the recombinant proteins of specific chimeras elevated total lipid content of the seeds as well as increased seed size. In addition, we combine N- and C-terminal as well as internal tags with high pH membrane reformation, protease protection and differential permeabilization. This led us to conclude the C-terminus is in the ER lumen; this contradicts earlier reports of the cytoplasmic location of plant DGAT1 C-termini.

AB  - Microarrays with immobilized protein probes are used to analyze protein samples. Selection of materials for biochip fabrication, functionalization of the carrier surface, construction of ordered cell matrices, immobilization of protein molecular probes in cells, and improvement of the sensitivity of protein sample analysis are key tasks of biochip technology. The following methodological approaches were used in this work. To preserve affinity of protein probes, mild conditions were used to immobilize the probes in biochip cells. To achieve a high concentration and spatial accessibility of the probes, three-dimensional cells to immobilize the probes were made of dynamically mobile polymer brushes, in which only one end of a polymer molecule is attached to the substrate. A cell array was formed on a substrate surface by photoinduced radical polymerization of monomers with reactive chemical groups (photolithography), according to a photomask template. A comparative analysis was performed for polymer brush structures prepared on a polybutylene terephthalate substrate by photoinduced radical polymerization. The structures consisted of units formed by one or more monomers. The efficiency of protein probe immobilization in cells was studied as dependent on the method used to activate the reactive groups in polymer chains. The composition of acrylate monomers used to form biochip cells was tested for the effect on the specific binding of response proteins to protein probes immobilized in the cells. A new method of biochip fabrication was developed. Substrates made of nonphotoactive polybutylene terephthalate were coated with a thin layer of the photoactive polymer polyvinyl acetate. Cells obtained by monomer photopolymerization on the modified substrate showed no degradation or detachment from the surface in aqueous solutions. Substrates coated with polyvinyl acetate did not adsorb proteins. Streptavidin and human immunoglobulins were used as model protein probes, and biotinylated goat immunoglobulins and goat antibodies against human immunoglobulins served as response proteins. Polymers with irregular structures were found to promote a higher concentration of protein probes and their uniform distribution within the cells, thus ensuring a higher efficiency of specific binding with response proteins. Biochips with cells made of brush polymers on black polybutylene terephthalate substrates were found to be promising for further improvement, aiming to employ them in immunofluorescence analyses of target proteins and to develop the lab-on-a-chip microanalysis technologies.

AB  - The importance of plant cuticular waxes in plant-herbivore interactions has become an area of increasing interest, but it has been poorly explored in chrysomelid beetles, one of the most important groups of insect pests. In this study, we investigated the effects of cuticular wax on feeding behaviors of Aulacophora femoralis (Chyrosomelidae), a pest of Cucurbitaceae crops. We analyzed chemical compositions of leaf cuticular waxes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The compositions were significantly different among plant species; in particular, host (Cucumis maxima, C. pepo, C. sativus, Cucurbitaceae) and non-host (Pueraria lobata, Fabaceae) leaves had distinctive compositions of cuticular waxes. We examined if the cuticular wax induces feeding behaviors based on a bioassay using filter papers treated with cuticular wax extract from host or non-host leaves, or a synthetic mixture of straight-chain alkanes (n-alkanes), major components of the host cuticular waxes shared among different host species. We found that the beetles frequently left bite marks on the filter papers treated with n-alkanes but less frequently on those treated with cuticular wax extracts of host leaves. These results indicate that leaf cuticular wax n-alkanes stimulate feeding behavior, but are not cues for host selection.

AB  - The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), which have been partially attributed to the epigenetic disinhibition of the transcription repressor RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor/Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor (REST/NRSF). Additionally, VPA changes post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) brain metabolism to create a neuroprotective environment. To address the interconnection of neuroprotection, metabolism, inflammation and REST/NRSF after TBI, we subjected C57BL/6N mice to experimental TBI and intraperitoneal VPA administration or vehicle solution at 15 min, 1, 2, and 3 days post-injury (dpi). At 7 dpi, TBI-induced an up-regulation of REST/NRSF gene expression and HDACi function of VPA on histone H3 acetylation were confirmed. Neurological deficits, brain lesion size, blood-brain barrier permeability, or astrogliosis were not affected, and REST/NRSF target genes were only marginally influenced by VPA. However, VPA attenuated structural damage in the hippocampus, microgliosis and expression of the pro-inflammatory marker genes. Analyses of plasma lipidomic and polar metabolomic patterns revealed that VPA treatment increased lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), which were inversely associated with interleukin 1 beta (Il1b) and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) gene expression in the brain. The results show that VPA has mild neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects likely originating from favorable systemic metabolic changes resulting in increased plasma LPCs that are known to be actively taken up by the brain and function as carriers for neuroprotective polyunsaturated fatty acids.

AB  - Objective: To elucidate the incidence and risk factors for paradoxical effects (i.e., increased seizure fre-quency, increased seizure severity, or onset of new seizure types) of levetiracetam (LEV) in people with epilepsy (PWE) and identify the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) in predicting these effects. Methods: We examined data for consecutive PWE treated with LEV. All PWE underwent EEG and mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) before LEV administration. We also evaluated the incidence of paradoxical LEV effects and conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the associated factors. Results: In total, 210 (66.2%) of 317 PWEs treated in our department had a history of LEV use. The inci-dence of paradoxical LEV effects was 5.2% (n = 11) and was significantly associated with a high LEV dose (p = 0.029), high seizure frequency (p = 0.005), temporal lobe epilepsy (p = 0.004), focal awareness seizure (p = 0.004), focal impaired awareness seizure (p = 0.007), spike (p = 0.015), rhythmic epileptiform discharges (REDs; p = 0.003), and MRI-identified focal cortical dysplasia (FCD; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that REDs (odds ratio [OR] = 5.35, p = 0.048, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01- 28.21) were independently associated with paradoxical LEV effects. Conclusions: Paradoxical LEV effects occurred in PWE, particularly in those with drug-resistant focal epi-lepsy. Furthermore, the occurrence of REDs in EEG was an independent factor associated with the para-doxical effects of LEV in PWE. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no cures. Familial cases with known genetic causes make up less than 10% of these diseases, and little is known about the underlying mechanisms that contribute to sporadic disease. Accordingly, it is important to expand investigations into possible pathways that may contribute to disease pathophysiology. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2 or GDPD5) is a membrane-bound enzyme that acts at the cell surface to cleave the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor that tethers distinct proteins to the membrane. GDE2 abnormally accumulates in intracellular compartments in the brain of patients with AD, ALS, and ALS/FTD, indicative of GDE2 dysfunction. Mice lacking GDE2 (Gde2KO) show neurodegenerative changes such as neuronal loss, reduced synaptic proteins and synapse loss, and increased A beta deposition, raising the possibility that GDE2 disruption in disease might contribute to disease pathophysiology. However, the effect of GDE2 loss on behavioral function and learning/memory has not been characterized.Results Here, we show that GDE2 is expressed throughout the adult mouse brain in areas including the cortex, hippocampus, habenula, thalamus, and amygdala. Gde2KO and WT mice were tested in a set of behavioral tasks between 7 and 16 months of age. Compared to WT, Gde2KO mice display moderate hyperactivity that becomes more pronounced with age across a variety of behavioral tests assessing novelty-induced exploratory activity. Additionally, Gde2KO mice show reduced startle response, with females showing additional defects in prepulse inhibition. No changes in anxiety-associated behaviors were found, but Gde2KOs show reduced sociability. Notably, aged Gde2KO mice demonstrate impaired short/long-term spatial memory and cued fear memory/secondary contextual fear acquisition.Conclusions Taken together, these observations suggest that loss of GDE2 leads to behavioral deficits, some of which are seen in neurodegenerative disease models, implying that loss of GDE2 may be an important contributor to phenotypes associated with neurodegeneration.

AB  - Theanine is an important secondary metabolite endowing tea with umami taste and health effects. It is essential to explore the metabolic pathway and regulatory mechanism of theanine to improve tea quality. Here, we demonstrated that the expression patterns of CsGGT2 (gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase), participated in theanine synthesis in vitro in our previous research, are significantly different in the aboveground and underground tissues of tea plants and regulated by light. Light up-regulated the expression of CsHY5, directly binding to the promoter of CsGGT2 and acting as an activator of CsGGT2, with a negative correlation with theanine accumulation. The enzyme activity assays and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that CsGGT2, acting as bifunctional protein, synthesize and degrade theanine in vitro and in planta. The results of enzyme kinetics, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and targeted gene-silencing assays showed that CsGGT2 had a higher substrate affinity of theanine than that of ethylamine, and performed a higher theanine degradation catalytic efficiency. Therefore, light mediates the degradation of theanine in different tissues by regulating the expression of the theanine hydrolase CsGGT2 in tea plants, and these results provide new insights into the degradation of theanine mediated by light in tea plants.

AB  - Natural wild habitats are either destroyed or shrunk due to human interventions. Therefore, habitat evaluation is crucial for managing wildlife populations and designing robust conservation strategies. Species presence data and geographic information system (GIS) coupled with ground-breaking powerful statistical techniques have made such assessments possible. We used maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to identify suitable habitats for Kashmir markhor (Capra falconeri cashmeriensis) in Malakand Division, Pakistan. MaxEnt was applied to 169 markhor sighting points and topographical and current bioclimatic variables. Results showed that the accuracy of the MaxEnt model was good (AUC = 0.889). Of the total area studied (8407.09 km(2)), 22.35% (1878.75 km(2)) was highly suitable and 32.63% (2743.53 km(2)) was moderately suitable for markhor. Protected areas including Chitral Gol National Park (CGNP), Tooshi-Sasha Conservancy (TSC), and Gehrait-Golain Conservancy (GGC) and their buffers were included in highly suitable habitats. MaxEnt also predicted highly suitable habitats in Kumrat and Kalam valleys. We believe that moderately suitable habitats identified in Jinjeret, Ursoon, Birir valley, and Bumborait valley have the potential to host markhor populations. Based on the results obtained in the current study, we strongly recommend expanding the current protected areas (PAs) network in the study area and strengthening it by inclusive conservation management with local communities.

AB  - Introduction Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a hereditary neurodevelopmental condition influenced by genetic alterations, particularly in genes regulating neural development and synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence suggests that the Mex3c gene plays a role in energy metabolism and neuronal development, indicating its potential relevance to ASD pathogenesis.Methods To investigate the role of Mex3c in ASD, we generated Mex3c knockout (KO) mice and conducted a series of behavioral tests, histological analyses, and molecular assays. Behavioral phenotyping included elevated plus maze, open-field test, and three-chamber social interaction test. Histological assessments included Nissl staining, Golgi-Cox staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular evaluations included Western blotting and analysis of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1 alpha signaling pathway.Results Mex3c KO mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors, including social deficits and anxiety-like traits. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by reduced neuronal number, decreased dendritic spine density, and impaired synaptic protein expression in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction were observed, alongside suppression of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1 alpha signaling pathway.Conclusion Our findings suggest that Mex3c gene deletion induces ASD-like phenotypes in mice, potentially through disruption of mitochondrial function and synaptic integrity via the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1? pathway. These results support the candidacy of Mex3c as a susceptibility gene for ASD and highlight mitochondrial signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Preterm birth results in an increased risk of neonatal brain injury and neurobehavioural disorders. Despite the seriousness of these adverse outcomes, there are currently no effective therapies to protect the vulnerable developing brain. We propose that neurosteroid replacement therapy may be a novel approach in reducing detrimental neurological outcomes following preterm birth. The use of guinea pig primary neuronal and oligodendrocyte cultures with relevance to late gestation allows insight into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of these treatments. Primary neuronal and oligodendrocyte cultures were derived from fetal guinea pig frontal cortex brain tissue at gestational age 62 (GA62). Cell cultures were pre-treated with either etifoxine (5 mu M) or zuranolone (1 mu m) for 24 h prior to insult. Cells were then exposed to either oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD; 0% O2 and no glucose DMEM; preterm birth insult) or sham (standard cell culture conditions; 25 mM DMEM) for 2 h. Lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) was performed following OGD as a measure of cytotoxicity. Relative mRNA expression of key neuronal and oligodendrocyte markers, as well as neuronal receptors and transporters, were quantified using high throughput (Fluidigm) RT-PCR. OGD significantly increased cellular cytotoxicity in both neurons and oligodendrocytes. Additionally, key neuronal marker mRNA expression was reduced following OGD, and oligodendrocytes displayed arrested mRNA expression of key markers of lineage progression. Treatment with etifoxine restored a number of parameters back to control levels, whereas treatment with zuranolone provided a robust improvement in all parameters examined. This study has demonstrated the neuroprotective potential of neurosteroid replacement therapy in a model of hypoxia related to preterm birth. Neuroprotection appears to be mediated through glutamate reduction and increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Future work is warranted in examining these treatments in vivo, with the overall aim to suppress preterm associated brain damage and reduce long term outcomes for affected offspring.

AB  - Zoo animals may harbor various zoonotic pathogens and may pose a potential risk to humans through close contact. Nevertheless, epidemiological data on zoonotic diseases are scarce. Here, we conducted an epidemiological investigation and genetic characterization of Coxiella burnetii, Cryptosporidium species, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Giardia duodenalis in zoo animals in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and evaluated their zoonotic potential. A total of 261 fecal samples were collected from 27 animal species at one zoo between July 2022 and December 2023. Out of the four pathogens tested, one (0.4 %), twelve (4.5 %), and one (0.4 %) animals were found positive for C. burnetii, E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis, respectively. Cryptosporidium species were not detected in zoo animals. Sequence analysis of C. burnetii based on the IS1111 gene revealed that one sequence obtained from a black goat (Capra hircus) exhibited 100 % homology with those reported from a rodent in the ROK. A zoonotic assemblage B (n = 1) of G. duodenalis was identified in Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum). Of the 12 E. bieneusi-positive samples, eleven novel genotypes (KRZB1-4 and KRZS2-8) were identified in four Asian black bears (Ursus thibetanus ussuricus) and eight squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Phylogenetically, ten novel genotypes belonged to group 1 with zoonotic potential, and one novel genotype, KRZB4, was assigned to group 10. This study showed that C. burnetii, E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis infections were identified in zoo animals in the ROK. Our findings highlight the need for ongoing monitoring and effective strategies to prevent and control these zoonotic pathogens.

AB  - We studied hippocampal variability in relation to the multiyear population density cycle and the action of density-dependent autoregulatory mechanisms associated with behavior. A study of field collections of the morphological material of bank voles (Clethrionomysglareolus, Rodentia) revealed annual variability in the hippocampal size against changes in the population density. The absolute and relative mass of the hippocampus was significantly higher in young autumn voles in the year of population peak against the background of a pronounced stress reaction manifested in an increased mass of the adrenal glands. This peculiarity of brain morphology persisted throughout the life cycle of animals born in the year of a population peak. Possible factors and mechanisms of hippocampal variability in connection with the dynamics of population density are discussed.

AB  - Under chronic stress, the pro-arrhythmic effect and mechanism of circulating humoral factors in human cardiomyocytes remain unknown. In the present study, we observed the effect of serum from chronic-stress mice on the electrical activity of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Male C57/BL6J mice were subjected to 35 days of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The serum from CUMS mice induced arrhythmia-like events (cell arrhythmias) in hiPSC-CMs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Patch clamp recordings in the heterologous expression system demonstrated that the serum derived from CUMS mice exerted an inhibitory effect on the cloned human potassium currents (Ito, IKr, IKs) that mediate action potential repolarization. In addition, serum from CUMS reduced the expression of relevant channel proteins. Moreover, both heat-inactivated serum and deproteinized serum evoked similar severity of cell arrhythmias in hiPSC-CMs as the untreated serum, indicating that circulating substances with small molecules were mainly involved in the occurrence of arrhythmias. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis showed that 90 small-molecule metabolites increased and 390 decreased in CUMS serum. We concluded that circulating humoral substances under chronic stress conditions have direct arrhythmogenic effects by inducing ion channel dysfunction in myocardial cells.

AB  - The impairments of maternal fenvalerate exposure have been well documented in previous study, but little was known about the effects of paternal fenvalerate exposure. The current study aimed to assess the effects of paternal fenvalerate exposure on spatial cognition and hippocampus across generations. Adult male mice (F0) were orally administered with fenvalerate (0, 2 or 20 mg/kg) for 5 weeks. F0 males were mated with untreatedfemales to generate F1 generation. F1 males were mated with F1 control females to generate F2 generation. For F1 and F2 adult offspring, spatial learning and memory were detected by Morris water maze. Results showed that spatial learning and memory were impaired in F1 females but not F1 males derived from F0 males exposed to 20 mg/kg FEN. Furthermore, significant impairment of spatial learning and memory were found in F2 females but not F2 males derived from F0 males exposed to 20 mg/kg FEN. As expected, histopathology showed that neural density in hippocampal CA3 region was reduced in F1 and F2 females but not F1 and F2 males derived from F0 males exposed to 20 mg/kg FEN. Mechanistically, hippocampal thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TR alpha 1) was down-regulated in F1 and F2 females derived from F0 males exposed to 20 mg/kg FEN. Correspondingly, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B and p75 neurotrophin receptor, three downstream genes of TR signaling, were down-regulated in F1 and F2 females. Taken together, the present study firstly found that paternal fenvalerate exposure transgenerationally impaired spatial cognition in a genderdependent manner. Hippocampal TR signaling may, at least partially, contribute to the process of cognitive impairment induced by paternal fenvalerate exposure. Further exploration in the mode of action of fenvalerate is critically important to promote human health and environmental safety.

AB  - Satellite cells (SC) are a population of muscle resident stem cells that are responsible for postnatal muscle growth and repair. With investigation into the genomic regulation of SC fate, the role of the epigenome in governing SC myogenesis is becoming clearer. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been demonstrated to be effective at enhancing the myogenic program of SC, but their role in altering the epigenetic landscape of SC remains undetermined. Our objective was to determine how an HDAC inhibitor, butyrate, promotes myogenic differentiation. SC from tributyrin treated neonatal piglets showed a decrease relative to SC from control animals in the expression of enhance of zeste homologue-2 (EZH2), a chromatin modifier, ex vivo. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis of SC isolated from tributyrin treated pigs showed a global reduction of the tri-methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) repressive chromatin mark. To determine if reductions in EZH2 was the primary mechanism through which butyrate affects SC behavior, SC were transfected with siRNA targeting EZH2, treated with 0.5 mM butyrate, or both. Treatment with butyrate reduced paired-box-7 (Pax7) and myogenic differentiation-1 (MyoD) gene expression, while siRNA caused reductions in EZH2 had no effect on their expression. EZH2 depletion did result in an increase in differentiating SC, but not in myotube hypertrophy. These results indicate that while EZH2 reduction may force myogenic differentiation, butyrate may operate through a parallel mechanism to enhance the myogenic program.

AB  - The Yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1) is an essential regulator of human Hippo signaling pathway and functions through interaction with TEA domain-4 (TEAD4) transcription factor involved in the tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal cancer. Previously, a parallel helix-helix interaction (PHHI) was identified as the key hotspot at YAP1-TEAD4 complex interface and has been exploited as an attractive druggable target to disrupt the complex. In this study, we investigated a roughly orthogonal cation-pi-pi stacking system across the crystal PHHI packing interface by integrating computational modeling and binding assay, which forms between one YAP1 helical residue Phe69 and two TEAD4 helical residues Phe373/Lys376. A synergistic effect between cation-pi and pi-pi interactions was observed; they separately represent two wings of the stacking system. The pi-electron is primarily responsible for the synergistic effect. Combination between diverse aromatic/charged amino acids. as well as neutral alanine on the cation-pi-pi stacking, revealed that the presence of aromatic tryptophan and charged arginine at, respectively, the residues 373 and 376 of TEAD4 helix can considerably improve PHHI binding affinity by similar to 6-fold, whereas neutral alanine substitution on each residue and on both would reduce the affinity significantly, confirming a strong synergistic effect involved in the roughly orthogonal cation-pi-pi stacking system at YAP1-TEAD4 PHHI interface.

AB  - Simple Summary The miR-200b has been shown to play an important role in preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. Herein, we explored the role of miR-200b in ovine adipocyte development, using Oil Red O staining, cell viability analysis, EdU and RT-qPCR. The results showed that miR-200b facilitated proliferation and suppressed the differentiation of preadipocytes. The dual fluorescent reporter vector experiments showed that miR-200b directly targeted p27 and KLF9. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that p27 significantly inhibited the proliferation, while KLF9 significantly promoted the differentiation of preadipocytes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulatory molecules in lipid deposition and metabolism. However, the effect of miR-200b on the regulation of proliferation and adipogenesis of ovine preadipocytes is unknown in the sheep (Ovis aries). In this study, the expression profiles of miR-200b were investigated in the seven tissues of Tibetan ewes and differentiated preadipocytes. The effect of miR-200b, as well as its target genes p27 and KLF9, on the proliferation of ovine preadipocytes and adipogenesis was also investigated, using cell viability analysis, EdU staining, Oil Red O staining and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qRCR). The miR-200b was expressed in all the tissues investigated, and it was highly expressed in lung, liver, subcutaneous adipose and spleen tissues. The expression of miR-200b continuously decreased when the differentiation of ovine preadipocytes initiated. The miR-200b mimic dramatically accelerated the proliferation but inhibited differentiation of ovine preadipocytes. The miR-200b inhibitor resulted in an opposite effect on the proliferation and differentiation of ovine preadipocytes. The dual luciferase reporter assay results showed that miR-200b mimic significantly decreased the luciferase activity of p27 and KLF9 in HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type dual luciferase reporter vectors. This suggests that p27 and KLF9 are the target genes of miR-200b. In over-expressed-p27 preadipocytes, the number of EdU-labeled preadipocytes and the expression levels of proliferation marker genes CDK2, CDK4, CCND1 and PCNA significantly decreased. In addition, the transfection of over-expressed-KLF9 vector into adipocytes remarkably increased the accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression levels of differentiation marker genes aP2, PPAR gamma, LPL and GLUT4. These results suggest that miR-200b accelerated the proliferation but inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of ovine preadipocytes by targeting p27 and KLF9, respectively.

AB  - Stress is associated with contextual memory deficits, which may mediate avoidance of trauma-associated contexts in posttraumatic stress disorder. These deficits may emerge from impaired pattern separation, the independent representation of similar experiences by the dentate gyrus-Cornu Ammonis 3 (DG-CA3) circuit of the dorsal hippocampus, which allows for appropriate behavioral responses to specific environmental stimuli. Neurogenesis in the DG is controlled by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and may contribute to pattern separation. In Experiment 1, we performed RNA sequencing of the dorsal hippocampus 16 days after stress in rats that either develop conditioned place avoidance to a predator urine-associated context (Avoiders), or do not (Non-Avoiders). Weighted genome correlational network analysis showed that increased expression of oxidative phosphorylation-associated gene transcripts and decreased expression of gene transcripts for axon guidance and insulin signaling were associated with avoidance behavior. Based on these data, in Experiment 2, we hypothesized that Avoiders would exhibit elevated hippocampal (HPC) ROS production and degraded object pattern separation (OPS) compared with Nonavoiders. Stress impaired pattern separation performance in Non-Avoider and Avoider rats compared with nonstressed Controls, but surprisingly, Avoiders exhibited partly preserved pattern separation performance and significantly lower ROS production compared with Non-Avoiders. Lower ROS production was associated with better OPS performance in Stressed rats, but ROS production was not associated with OPS performance in Controls. These results suggest a strong negative association between HPC ROS production and pattern separation after stress, and that stress effects on these outcome variables may be associated with avoidance of a stress-paired context.

It was observed in our previous research that diabetic symptoms were improved by Lactobacillus plantarum SHY130 (LPSHY130) isolated from yak yogurt in a murine model of T2D. This study sought to investigate the LPSHY130-mediated hepatic metabolic regulation in a murine model of T2D. RESULTSTreatment with LPSHY130 improved liver function and pathological damage in diabetic mice. Untargeted metabolome analysis revealed that T2D-induced changes in 11 metabolites were regulated after LPSHY130 treatment, mainly involving purine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and choline metabolism and pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis pathways. In addition, correlation analysis indicated that hepatic metabolic changes can be adjusted by the intestinal microbiota. CONCLUSIONOverall, this study suggests that treatment with LPSHY130 relieves liver injury and regulates liver metabolism in a murine model of T2D, thus providing a theoretical basis for the use of probiotics as dietary supplements to regulate hepatic metabolic disorders associated with T2D.

AB  - Milk contains about 4% fat globules with its surface covered by polar lipids. Despite the abundant consumption of dairy products, the biological effects of dietary milk polar lipids on metabolic health have only been sparsely examined. Maternal obesity results in neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairment in offspring. Considering the importance of maternal nutrition, the effects of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) supplementation to dams during pregnancy and lactation on neurodevelopment and its long-term programming effects on offspring cognition were examined. Female Sprague-Dawley rats consumed 8-week control diet (CON) or high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity before mating. Then, female rats were fed CON or HFD with or without the supplementation of 400 mg/kg body weight MFGM-PL during pregnancy and lactation. The offspring were fed 11-week HFD after weaning. MFGM-PL supplementation to obese dams suppressed body weight gain and hyperinsulinemia in both dams and offspring. Offspring born to obese dams displayed delayed neurological reflexes development, impaired neurogenesis before weaning, and cognitive impairment in adulthood, which were recovered by maternal MFGM-PL supplementation. Insulin resistance and aberrant brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling were induced in the hippocampus of neonatal and adult offspring due to maternal and progeny HFD, but recovered by maternal MFGM-PL administration. This study demonstrates that maternal MFGM-PL supplementation can promote neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects against HFD-induced cognitive impairment in offspring via alleviating hippocampal insulin resistance. Hence, MFGM-PL is a promising ingredient for exerting beneficial programming effects on the brain health of offspring.

AB  - Pattern separation, the ability of a network to distinguish similar inputs by transforming them into distinct outputs, was postulated by the Marr-Albus theory to be realized by divergent feedforward excitatory connectivity. Yet, there is evidence for strong but differential regulation of pattern separation by local circuit connectivity. How do we reconcile the conflicting views on local-circuit regulation of pattern separation in circuits receiving divergent feedforward connectivity? Here, we quantitatively examined a population of heterogeneous dentate gyrus (DG) spiking networks where identically divergent feedforward connectivity was enforced. We generated 20 000 random DG networks constructed with thousands of functionally validated, heterogeneous single-neuron models of 4 different DG neuronal subtypes. We recorded network outputs to morphed sets of input patterns and applied quantitative metrics that we developed to assess pattern separation performance of each network. Surprisingly, only 47 of these 20 000 networks (0.23%) manifested effective pattern separation showing that divergent feedforward connectivity alone does not guarantee pattern separation. Instead, our analyses unveiled strong contributions from the 3 interneuron subtypes toward granule cell sparsity and pattern separation, with pronounced network-to-network variability in such contributions. We traced this variability to differences in local synaptic weights across pattern-separating networks, highlighting synaptic degeneracy as a key mechanism that explains diversity in interneuronal regulation of pattern separation. Finally, we found heterogeneous DG networks to be more resilient to synaptic jitter compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Together, our findings reconcile conflicting evidence by revealing degeneracy in DG circuits, whereby similar pattern separation efficacy can arise through diverse interactions among granule cells and interneurons.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to fill in the gaps in previous knowledge of the faunistics and distribution of Plecoptera species in Lebanon, by sampling throughout the entire country. 13 catchments of the largest river systems and two brooks, not previously taken into account, were studied between 1984 and 2015, including a great diversity of running waters, from springs and streamlets to lower river reaches. This faunal program was extended up to 200 stations during 35 years. At 62 sites, within the range of 0 to 2150 m elevation, 3560 fauna samples representing 7215 stoneflies belonging to the families Taeniopterygidae, Nemouridae, Leuctridae, Capniidae, Perlodidae, Perlidae and Chloroperlidae were collected. 17 species of these 7 families were recorded, of which 9 are new for Lebanese fauna and 7 are new for science. A probably unknown Leuctra species of the hippopus s.l. group is added, but in the absence of male, we think it is inappropriate to name it. An endemic species ( Capnia bicornata), reported by an author, is absent from my samples. The total number of potential species of these 7 families all over the Lebanese territory is raised to 18.

AB  - A variety of avemetatarsalian and non-archosaurian reptile tracks have been discovered in the lower Cretaceous Hekou Group in western China, where they occur alongside a herbivorous dinosaur skeletal fauna. A new track assemblage has recently been identified in the upper Hekou Group in Matan Natural Village, Jingyuan County, situated to the east of the primary track assemblage. The track-bearing bed is composed of sandstone-dominated, gypsum-included mottled clastic deposits, which indicate an arid braided river environment. All of the tracks in this site are classified as Cretaceous ichnospecies of Grallator, G. ssatoi, which are distributed in northern China. Additionally, the specimens exhibit members exceeding the original definition of Grallator (<= 15 cm). These well-preserved tracks not only demonstrate the widespread distribution of this ichnospecies in the Lower Cretaceous of China, but also provide insight into the relationship between the metatarsophalangeal pad traces of G. ssatoi and preservation. The sliding traces among them can indicate the ability of trackmakers to maintain balance while walking. Furthermore, the closely associated parallel trackways suggest that the trackmakers may have exhibited gregarious behaviour, and that such aggregation during marching may have been related to their self-preserving strategy.

AB  - In zoos and aquariums globally, studbooks provide a format by which threatened or important species populations can be carefully managed. These documents can be used to answer complex questions about animal population demographics, animal husbandry, breeding success and mortality. Given the time-intensive nature of studbook collation, only a subset of all animal species held in zoological facilities are managed using these programs. The purpose of this project was to identify how studbooks are being used by researchers, the topics being investigated, and the taxa being covered. To achieve this, data were collected on the types of research paper being produced using studbook information. A literature search, covering several zoo and aquarium journals, was utilized. Data on the types of studbook available were additionally collected for three international zoo organizations. A Poisson regression was run to determine the predictive power of taxonomic class, animal threat status and studbook type on a studbook featuring in published research. Overall, the study identified that taxonomic class and threat status were significant predictors of the number of published studbook papers, with threatened species being more likely to appear in papers. Additionally, population demography was the most common use of studbook data, followed by genetics and reproduction. Not all taxonomic groups were featured in the literature, with mammals featuring much more frequently than would be expected based on the types of studbook available.

AB  - . Toxoplasma gondii (Nicolle & Manceaux, 1908) is a highly prevalent zoonotic protozoan parasite found globally in various bird and mammal species, including humans. Migratory birds play an important epidemiological role by facilitating the spread of pathogens, including T. gondii, to new regions. Armenia is particularly significant in this context being located at the crossroads of three global migration flyways; however, research on T. gondii infection in wild birds in this region has not been previously conducted. This study marks the first molecular detection of active T. gondii infection in the blood of wild birds, assessing the prevalence associated with the risk factors such as age, sex, migratory status, and feeding habits of birds. Research was carried out in the Megri Region of Syunik Province in 2013, 2014, and 2018 in the breeding season. The presence of parasite in 116 Passerines was determined using PCR with specific primers derived from the RE gene with mean prevalence of T. gondii in 12%. The highest infection rates were observed in Upcher's Warbler, Hippolais languida (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833), at 36% (4 out of 11), Eastern Black-eared Wheatear, Oenanthe melanoleuca (Guldenstadt, 1775), at 33% (2 out of 6), and Eastern Orphean Warbler, Curruca crassirostris (Bates, 1936), at 19% (5 out of 27). Long-distance migrants exhibited a higher frequency of T. gondii occurrence compared to resident birds (chi 2 = 7.11, DF = 2, p = 0.029). The infection rates did not show a dependence on the sex or age of the birds. The relationship between infection and feeding behavior in local toxoplasmosis distribution remains unclear, necessitating further research with new methodologies, additional animal species, broader geographic coverage, and larger sample sizes.

AB  - There are various forms of waste with a recycling potential. These wastes can be converted into valuable goods (such as chemicals and animal foods with minimising adverse environmental effects), thus contributing to sustainable development. This study highlights the ability of different types of waste and their prospects in contributing to Pakistan's circular economy. The research combines quantitative techniques (regression) with qualitative techniques (fuzzy Delphi method) to determine the amount of energy extracted from Pakistani crop residue and animal manure. Then it employs expert opinions to obtain more comprehensive results for recycling these wastes. The regression models estimate the potential of biomass in Pakistan till 2036, whereas the fuzzy Delphi method uses expert feedback to determine the forest residue potential. The results indicate that Pakistan has a great potential for waste recycling subject to modern technologies. The results indicate that the total crop residue in Pakistan will increase by 57% by 2036 compared to the 2018 level, subsequently increasing the potential for biogas production and energy by the same percentage. At the crop level, the residue from wheat, maize, rice, sugarcane, and cotton is expected to rise by 8%, 114%, 63%, 40%, and 82%, respectively, during the same period. Similarly, power generation potential from buffaloes is expected to increase to 79,339,451 MWh (40% to 2016 level) by 2026 and to 106,000,000 MWh (34% to 2016 level) by 2036, respectively. Whereas, the power generation capacity from cattle waste is expected to grow by 14.53% (to the 2016 level) by 2026 and by 12.69% (to the 2016 level) by 2036, respectively. The research provides insight for policymaking and possible direction to explore this important but ignored area that has the potential to benefit the economy and can help the country achieve sustainable development goals.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the long-term effects of prenatal and early-life WIFI signal exposure on neurodevelopment and behaviors as well as biochemical alterations of Wistar rats. On the first day of pregnancy (E0), expectant rats were allocated into two groups: the control group (n = 12) and the WiFi-exposed group (WiFi group, n = 12). WiFi group was exposed to turn on WiFi for 24 h/day from E0 to postnatal day (PND) 42. The control group was exposed to turn-off WiFi at the same time. On PND7-42, we evaluated the development and behavior of the offspring, including body weight, pain threshold, and swimming ability, spatial learning, and memory among others. Also, levels of proteins involved in apoptosis were analyzed histologically in the hippocampus in response to oxidative stress. The results showed that WiFi signal exposure in utero and early life (1) increased the body weight of WiFi + M (WiFi + male) group; (2) no change in neuro-behavioral development was observed in WiFi group; (3) increased learning and memory function in WiFi + M group; (4) enhanced comparative levels of BDNF and p-CREB proteins in the hippocampus of WiFi + M group; (5) no neuronal loss or degeneration was detected, and neuronal numbers in hippocampal CA1 were no evidently differences in each group; (6) no change in the apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 and Bax) levels; and (7) no difference in GSH-PX and SOD activities in the hippocampus. Prenatal WiFi exposure has no effects on hippocampal CA1 neurons, oxidative equilibrium in brain, and neurodevelopment of rats. Some effects of prenatal WiFi exposure are sex dependent. Prenatal WiFi exposure increased the body weight, improved the spatial memory and learning function, and induced behavioral hyperactivity of male rats.

AB  - This study explores the role and recycling feasibility of pig manure biochar (PB) in anaerobic digestion (AD), with particular emphasis on alterations in PB surface functional groups, with a reduction of acidic groups on PB by approximately 30 % during the acidogenic phase; however, microbial aggregation appeared to buffer this dissolution effect. In the methanogenic phase, increased PB oxidation was observed, marked by a reduction in lactone groups and an increase in phenolic hydroxyl groups, which together contributed to the stability of PB's electron exchange capacity (EEC). In comparison, PB showed a more pronounced enhancing effect on AD performance than straw biochar (SB). Recycling experiments indicated a substantial enhancement in cumulative methane production, as recycled PB yielded 94 mL CH4/g VS at a dosage of 0.5 g biochar/g TSfed, outperforming fresh biochar. These findings underscore the stable structural and functional properties of PB during AD, supporting its potential for long-term recycling and sustainable use in waste management and bioenergy production.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is being increasingly recognized as a vital factor in the development of various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), an outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria, can trigger innate immune responses, resulting in neuroinflammation and subsequent cognitive deficits. The expression of glutamate receptors (GluRs) on glial cells can induce glial activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that repeated LPS exposure can increase GluR levels, promoting microglial activation and ultimately affecting synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. In this study, C57/BL6 mice were repeatedly exposed to LPS to construct a neuroinflammation animal model. The levels of GluRs, inflammatory cytokines, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, postsynaptic density protein 95, synaptophysin 38, NMDA receptor 2 A, and NMDA receptor 2B (GluN2B) were measured in the hippocampi. Furthermore, dendritic spine density in the CA1 hippocampal region was determined. Repeated LPS exposure induced cognitive impairments and microglial activation and increased GluR1 and GluR2 levels. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in GluN2B expression and dendritic spine density in the hippocampi. However, CFM-2, an alpha-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor antagonist, reversed these anomalies. Furthermore, minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, reversed these anomalies and downregulated GluR2 but not GluR1 expression. In summary, we demonstrated that GluR2 plays an essential role in microglia-induced neuroinflammation, resulting in synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment induced by repeated exposure to LPS.

AB  - Studies on the ways in which viroids are transmitted are important for understanding their epidemiology and for developing effective control measures for viroid diseases. Viroids may be spread via vegetative propagules, mechanical damage, seed, pollen, or biological vectors. Vegetative propagation is the most prevalent mode of spread at the global, national and local level while further dissemination can readily occur by mechanical transmission through crop handling with viroid-contaminated hands or pruning and harvesting tools. The current knowledge of seed and pollen transmission of viroids in different crops is described. Biological vectors shown to transmit viroids include certain insects, parasitic plants, and goats. Under laboratory conditions, viroids were also shown to replicate in and be transmitted by phytopathogenic ascomycete fungi; therefore, fungi possibly serve as biological vectors of viroids in nature. The term "mycoviroids or fungal viroids" has been introduced in order to denote these viroids. Experimentally, known sequence variants of viroids can be transmitted as recombinant infectious cDNA clones or transcripts. In this review, we endeavor to provide a comprehensive overview of the modes of viroid transmission under both natural and experimental situations. A special focus is the key findings which can be applied to the control of viroid diseases.

AB  - Egypt tends to construct new cities to provide social housing for its citizens. However, the planning of urban residential districts (URDs) in these cities lacks provisions for natural ventilation (NV), and indoor-outdoor thermal comfort, resulting in increased energy consumption during the summer months. This research aims to create a sustainable design through biomimicry to reduce the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) values in the URD in New Aswan thereby enhancing outdoor thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption inside buildings at the level of URD. In this research, the approach of prairie dogs in building their burrows was followed to rearrange and reorient the buildings. Autodesk CFD, Rhino7, Grasshopper, Ladybug, Honeybee, and Dragonfly software was used in the simulation. The rearrangement of the buildings, specifically the oriented design in the east-west direction, caused a difference in pressure between the buildings, leading to improved NV between the buildings. The improvement of NV resulted in a 4.2 degrees C reduction in UTCI values during specific hours over the six different days in the six summer months, resulting in significant energy savings of 10407.28946 KWh in the URD. The occurrence of a pressure difference between buildings not only improved NV but also enhanced outdoor and indoor thermal comfort, promoting energy conservation. Therefore, careful consideration of the arrangement and orientation of buildings is essential to establish sustainable URDs. Although the difference between the results is slight, it creates substantial differences in the long term for UTCI values, thus the energy conservation in the URDs.

AB  - Since the human population is growing beyond the earth's ability to sustain it, more people are being brought into contact with wildlife, leading to increasing human-wildlife conflict. The Asian elephant, a wide-ranging megaherbivore, is being increasingly threatened by human-elephant conflict [HEC]. Its conservation depends on identifying the causes of HEC and implement measure to mitigate the HEC effectively. We studied the drivers of HEC among five forest divisions in Western Ghats, India, that support a high density of elephants across Asia. Comparing the last six years' data on HEC with 26 ecological covariates in the GLMM framework, we identified spatiotemporal variations and drivers of crop, and property damages and human casualties. Spatially, HEC was highest in the territorial division and lowest in those declared as Protected Areas earlier. The comparison of crop damage with covariates showed that crop damage decreased with the grass biomass index, elephant density, extent of dry-thorn, and deciduous habitats, and forest range area, while it increased with adult male % and forest range perimeter. Similarly, the property damage by elephants increased with crop damage frequency and human settlement/cultivation area, but decreased with grass biomass, forest range area, and deciduous habitat area. Human casualties due to elephants increased with property damage, ambient temperature, and forest range perimeter, but decreased with grass biomass. Overall, the decrease in HEC with grass biomass, and the increase in HEC with human settlement and forest range perimeter indicate that anthropogenic pressure that decreases the grass biomass and degrades the habitat is the likely root cause of HEC, and minimizing it would reduce overall HEC.

AB  - The cuttage rooting method for Acer species is difficult to achieve a good efficacy as trees maintain good characteristics at the rejuvenation stage, thus improving the rooting of Acer species. The addition of exogenous hormones and rejuvenation can improve the rooting effect of cuttings; however, the specific regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Here, Acer mono Maxim rejuvenation and non-rejuvenation cuttings were used as test subjects, to investigate the effects of exogenous hormones on the activities of endogenous hormones and antioxidant enzymes in the rooting process of young cuttings. The results showed that exogenous growth-regulating substances significantly improved the rooting rate of A. mono. Exogenous hormones naphthylacetic acid (NAA) + indolebutyric acid (IBA) increased the initial levels of the endogenous hormones, indoleacetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA), and the enzyme activities of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Rejuvenation treatment prolonged the time of increase in ABA content and indoleacetic acid oxidase (IAAO) activity at the root primordium induction stage, while increasing trans-zeatin riboside (ZR) content and decreasing POD enzyme activity in cuttings. These results demonstrate that A. mono cuttings can achieve the purpose of improving the rooting rate by adding the exogenous hormone (NAA + IBA), which is closely related to the changes of endogenous hormone content and enzyme activity, and these changes of A. mono rejuvenation cuttings are different from non-rejuvenation cuttings.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide is involved in multiple life processes and closely related to the development of various diseases. Therefore, the rapid, simple and low-cost detection of H2O2 in blood is significant. Here we developed a one-step method to prepare ferric oxide and carbon nanotube nanocomposites (Fe3O4/CNTs) for nonenzymatic electrochemical detection of H2O2. Fe3O4/CNTs were synthesized when growing CNTs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with salt supported Fe2O3 nanoparticles (Fe2O3/NaCl) as catalysts. The results showed that the Fe3O4/CNTs nanocomposites 0.5Fe-4H2O-3 obtained with 0.5 wt%-Fe2O3/NaCl catalyst, ethyl acetate: water: oxygen molar ratio of 1:4:2, growth duration of 3 hours exhibited the optimal detection performance. The linear detection range of the sensor was 10 similar to 750 mu M and 0.75 similar to 19 mM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.9 mu M (S/N = 3) at a detection potential of -0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Furthermore, this sensor demonstrated excellent anti-interference performance and stability, achieving good recovery rates when detecting H2O2 in pig serum. The 0.5Fe-4H2O-3 nanocomposites possess the highest Fe3O4 exposure and significantly lower electron transfer resistance compared to the mechanically mixed samples. Therefore, the one-step synthesis method can enhance the interaction between the oxide and the carbon nanotubes, thereby reducing impedance and improving the electrochemical detection performance.

AB  - Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) fruits were evaluated at three harvest dates, both in terms of ease of harvesting and nutritional value, with attention paid to the visual effect in the form of the color of the harvested fruits. The high values of the ratio of fruit bonding strength to individual fruit mass indicated the challenges of effectively harvesting common sea buckthorn using mechanical shakers. However, a decrease in this measure was observed with later harvest dates, as well as differentiation in fruit bonding strength among the tested sea buckthorn cultivars in the seventh and eighth years of plantation growth. As the harvest date was delayed, antioxidant properties and total polyphenol content decreased, while sugar content, individual fruit mass, and fruit length increased. Across the analyzed harvest dates, color differences were more pronounced between cultivars than between individual harvest dates. The numerous interactions observed between sea buckthorn cultivars and harvest dates highlight the need for further research, particularly by increasing the number and frequency of harvest dates for this species.

AB  - BackgroundDepression and memory loss are prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, with diabetic patients facing an elevated risk of brain dysfunction. Methylglyoxal (MGO) formation, which is heightened in diabetes owing to hyperglycemia and gut dysbiosis, may serve as a critical link between diabetes and brain diseases. Despite the high prevalence of MGO, the precise mechanisms underlying MGO-induced depression and memory loss remain unclear.ResultsWe investigated the effect of MGO stress on depression like-behavior and memory loss to elucidate the potential interplay between MGO-induced tryptophan (Trp) metabolism impairment and oxidative stress in the brain. It demonstrates that MGO induces depression-like behavior in mice, as confirmed by the OFT, TST, FST, SPT, and EPM behavioral tests. MGO led to the depletion of Trp and related neurotransmitters as 5-HT, EPI, and DA in the mouse brain. Additionally, MGO reduced the cell count in the DG, CA1, and CA3 hippocampal regions and modulated TPH2 levels in the brain. Notably, co-treatment with MGO and Trp mirrored the effects observed after Trp-null treatment in neurons, including reduced TPH1 and TPH2 levels and inhibition of neuronal outgrowth. Furthermore, MGO significantly altered the expression of key proteins associated with neurodegeneration, such as p-Tau, p-GSK-3 beta, APP, oA beta, BDNF, NGF, and p-TrkB. Concurrently, MGO activated MAPKs through ROS induction, triggering a redox imbalance by downregulating Nrf-2, Ho-1, TXNRD1, Trx, Sirt-3, and Sirt-5 expression levels, NAD+, and CAT activity in the mouse brain. This led to an accelerated neuroinflammatory response, as evidenced by increased expression of Iba-1, p-NF-kappa B, and the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Importantly, Trp treatment ameliorated MGO-induced depression like-behavior and memory loss in mice and markedly mitigated increased expression of p-Tau, APP, p-ERK1/2, p-pJNK, and p-NF-kappa B in the brain. Likewise, Trp treatment also induced the expression of MGO detoxifying factors GLO-I and GLO-II and CAT activity, suggesting the induction of an antioxidant system and reduced inflammation by inhibiting IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion.ConclusionsOur data revealed that MGO-induced depression like-behavior and memory deficits resulted from disturbances in Trp, 5-HT, BDNF, and NGF levels, increased p-Tau and APP expression, neuroinflammation, and impaired redox status (Nrf-2/Ho-1/TXNRD1/Sirt3/5) in the brain.

AB  - Global autobiographical amnesia is a rare disorder that is characterized by a sudden loss of autobiographical memories covering many years of an individual's life. Generally, routine neuroimaging studies such as CT and MRI yield negative findings in individuals with global autobiographical amnesia. However, in recent case reports, functional analyses such as SPECT and fMRI have revealed changes in activity in various areas of the brain when compared with controls. Studies using iomazenil (IMZ) SPECT with individuals with global autobiographical amnesia have not been reported. We report the case of a 62-year-old Japanese woman with global autobiographical amnesia who had disappeared for similar to 4 weeks. [I-123]-IMZ SPECT showed reduced IMZ uptake in her left medial temporal lobe and no significant reduction on N-isopropyl-[I-123] p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT in the identical region. Because IMZ binds to the central benzodiazepine receptor, this dissociation between IMZ and IMP SPECT was thought to reflect the breakdown of inhibitory neurotransmission in the left medial temporal lobe. Moreover, when the woman recovered most of her memory 32 months after fugue onset, the IMZ SPECT-positive lesion had decreased in size. Because the woman had long suffered verbal abuse from her former husband's sister and brother, which can also cause global autobiographical amnesia, it is difficult to conclude whether the IMZ SPECT-positive lesion in the left medial temporal lobe was the cause or the result of her global autobiographical amnesia. Although only one case, these observations suggest that IMZ SPECT may be useful in uncovering the mechanisms underlying global autobiographical amnesia.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chow (ZSS), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been historically used to treat insomnia and neurological disorders. Jujuboside A, a triterpenoid saponin isolated from ZSS, represents its core bioactive component with purported sedative properties, yet its mechanism of action remains underexplored. Aim of the study: To validate the anti-insomnia efficacy of Jujuboside A and elucidate its GABAergic regulatory mechanisms through integrated in vivo and in vitro approaches. Materials and methods: A chronic sleep deprivation mouse model was established using modified multi-platform water environment. Behavioral assessments (open-field test, pentobarbital-induced sleep test) were combined with histopathological analysis (H&E staining), flow cytometry (apoptosis), ELISA (GABA/Glu quantification), and Western blot (GABA A/GABA B, NMDA/AMPA receptors). Pharmacological inhibition of GABA signaling was performed using GABA-IN-1. Results: Jujuboside A significantly shortened sleep latency and prolonged sleep duration vs. model group. Histopathology revealed Jujuboside A-mediated restoration of hippocampal neuronal density and mitigation of nuclear pyknosis. Jujuboside An upregulated GABA levels while suppressing Glu and neuronal apoptosis, with concomitant increases in GABA A and GABA B receptor expression. Crucially, GABA-IN-1 abolished these therapeutic effects, confirming GABA dependency. Conclusions: Jujuboside A ameliorates insomnia by restoring GABA/Glu homeostasis and enhancing GABA receptor expression, thereby validating ZSS's traditional use through modern pharmacological evidence.

AB  - Premenopausal hysterectomy is associated with a greater relative risk of dementia. We previously demonstrated cognitive impairments in adult rats six weeks after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation compared with intact sham-controls and other gynecological surgery variations. Here, we investigated whether hysterectomy-induced cognitive impairments are transient or persistent. Adult rats received sham-control, ovariectomy (Ovx), hysterectomy, or Ovx-hysterectomy surgery. Spatial working memory, reference memory, and anxiety-like behavior were tested either six-weeks post-surgery, in adulthood; seven-months post-surgery, in early middle-age; or twelve-months post-surgery, in late middle-age. Hysterectomy in adulthood yielded spatial working memory deficits at short-, moderate-, and long-term post-surgery intervals. Serum hormone levels did not differ between ovary-intact, but differed from Ovx, groups. Hysterectomy had no significant impact on healthy ovarian follicle or corpora lutea counts for any post-surgery timepoint compared with intact sham-controls. Frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex were assessed for activity-dependent markers. In entorhinal cortex, there were alterations in FOSB and & UDelta;FOSB expression during the early middle-age timepoint, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels at the adult timepoint. Collectively, results suggest a primary role for the uterus in regulating cognition, and that memory-related neural pathways may be modified following gynecological surgery. This is the first preclinical report of long-term effects of hysterectomy with and without ovarian conservation on cognition, endocrine, ovarian, and brain assessments, initiating a comprehensive framework of gynecological surgery effects. Translationally, findings underscore critical needs to decipher how gynecological surgeries, especially those involving the uterus, impact the brain and its functions, the ovaries, and overall aging from a systems perspective.

AB  - Simple Summary To understand the developmental changes in hare femora, this study aimed to examine the mechanical properties, mineralization, and general geometric properties of the thigh bone (femur) throughout the growth and maturation process. The study involved analyzing the strength, stiffness, bone mineral density, and structure of the femur in both young and adult hares. Additionally, the study sought to establish a connection between bone properties and the ecological functions of hares in their natural habitats. Understanding the changes in hare femora as they grow and mature is crucial for many reasons as it provides valuable insights into the effects of aging on wild hares, shedding light on their adaptability and survival strategies. Lagomorphs, which include hares, rabbits, and pikas, are herbivorous animals renowned for their exceptional running abilities. The femur, the largest and strongest bone in their bodies, plays a crucial role in supporting their weight and facilitating movement. This study aimed to investigate the structural and functional changes in the femora of hares during their development in a sex-dependent manner, and the influence of aging on femur structure and function. Various mechanical properties, including stiffness and strength, as well as densitometry and morphology, were evaluated. The study was conducted on n = 24 hares collected from a hunting district in the Lublin region of Poland and divided into four groups: young females, adult females, young males and adult males (n = 6 animals each). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD), and a three-point bending test was performed to assess mechanical properties. The findings revealed age-related differences in bone properties, with adult males exhibiting increased BMC, and BMD compared to young males. Geometrical properties of the femora mid-diaphysis, such as cortical index and cross-sectional area, remained relatively unchanged during maturation. Regarding mechanical properties, the femora of young males exhibited higher elastic work compared to those of young females, while the femora of adult males exhibited higher elastic and breaking work than those of adult females. The stiffness of femora was higher in adult females compared to young females. The results provide insights into the development and aging of hare femora and contribute to our understanding of the relationship between bone mechanical properties, musculoskeletal system, and aging in the wild. This knowledge can inform animal husbandry practices in captivity and enhance our broader understanding of the ecological functions of lagomorphs.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates different 3 '- untranslated regions (3 ' UTRs) to regulate gene expression and localization, and affects a variety of biological pro-cesses. Here, we characterized the 3 ' UTR dynamics during the oocyte- to- zygote transition by analysing our previously reported porcine single- cell RNA- seq (scRNA-seq) datasets (in vitro matured metaphase II (MII) oocytes, in vitro fertilized zygotes (IVF1) and parthenogenetically activated 1- cell embryos (PA1)). After IVF1 versus MII comparison, dynamic analyses of APA from RNA- seq (DaPars) method identified 139 mRNAs with significantly different 3 ' UTRs (p(adj). <= .05), mainly enriched in cell cycle, regulation of cyclin- dependent protein kinase activity, histone modification, mRNA surveillance, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. For PA1 versus MII comparison, 105 mRNAs with significantly different 3 ' UTRs (p(adj). <= .05) were identified to be mainly enriched in intracellular transport, mitotic spindle organization, cell cycle, pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, there were 7 mRNAs with more significant 3 ' UTR differences (|?PDUI| >_ 0.45 and |log2[PDUI ratio]| >_ 0.59) re- spectively in IVF1 versus MII (Lrp2bp, Mtfr2, Nhlrc2, Psip1, Smu1, Ssr1 and Wtap) and PA1 versus MII (Asf1b, Dimt1, Nap1l1, Ncoa4, Nudt21, Pnn and Rpl15) comparisons. Integrative genomics viewer analysis further identified that 3 ' UTRs of Psip1, Smu1, Ssr1 and Wtap had more than 140 nt average length changes, whereas those of Dimt1, Nap1l1 and Rpl15 were shortened with more than 460 nt. Regulatory elements (PAS, CPE, microRNA binding sites and m6A sites) in 3 ' UTRs of different lengths were pre- dicted. Our findings provide useful information to further investigate the molecular mechanism of 3 ' UTR in regulating the oocyte- to- zygote transition of pig embryos.

AB  - The chestnut leaf miner was found in Vologda, Veliky Novgorod, and in all districts of Leningrad region, with the exception of Podporozhsky and Lodeynopolsky, and was not found in Petrozavodsk in Karelia. In Leningrad region, chestnut damage by Cameraria ohridella caterpillars was highest in its central part from Volkhov to Kirovsk, Vsevolozhsk, St. Petersburg, Zelenogorsk, Oranienbaum, and Sosnovy Bor; in the west, in Gatchina, Volosovo, and Kingisepp; and in the south, in Kirishi and in Luga. In 2024, the maximum damage to chestnut leaves by chestnut leaf miner caterpillars was recorded in Vsevolozhsk (75-100%, 93.4% on average). The lowest damage (0.8-1.3%) to leaves was observed in the north of the region in the Vyborg and Priozersk districts, as well as in the eastern districts of Tikhvin (2.5%) and Boksitogorsk (0.2%) and in Vologda (1.2%) with an average January temperature below -9 degrees C. In the Vyborg and Priozersk districts, the chestnut moth developed in two generations; in the Tikhvin, Boksitogorsk districts and in Vologda, in one generation; and in the remaining districts of the Leningrad Region, in three full generations per year. For the first time, the differences in the biological characteristics of the development of 6th and 7th instar chestnut moth caterpillars, an increase in the size of moth caterpillars in cooler climates, and the main factors in the spread of C. ohridella in Leningrad region were also established.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also known as lipoglycans or endotoxins, form part of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies have described the various harmful impacts of LPS on humans and animals. Nevertheless, many aspects of these effects are still not fully explained. One of them is the influence of endotoxins on the neurochemical characterization of neurons within the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is found in the intestinal wall and plays important adaptive roles during pathological processes and exposures. In this study, the impact of a low single dose of Salmonella Enteritidis LPS on the duodenal enteric neurons immunoreactive to substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP-27), and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) was studied using a double immunofluorescence technique. During the study, it was shown that even a low dose of LPS affects the number of enteric neurons containing the neuropeptides studied, and these changes were dependent on the type of the enteric plexus. The most visible changes concerned the SP-like immunoreactive (LI) neurons in the outer submucous plexus (LPS caused an increase in the percentage of these neurons from15.74 +/- 0.61 to 21.72 +/- 0.79%). Furthermore, the VIP-LI neurons in the inner submucous plexus were seen to decrease from 12.64 +/- 0.83 to 5.96 +/- 0.58%. The mechanisms behind these noted fluctuations are not clear, but it may be connected with the pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic activity of LPS.

AB  - Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) has increased rapidly in children, but information on the effects of RF-EMF exposure to the central nervous system in children is limited. In this study, pups and dams were exposed to whole-body RF-EMF at 4.0 W/kg specific absorption rate (SAR) for 5 h per day for 4 weeks (from postnatal day (P) 1 to P28). The effects of RF-EMF exposure on neurons were evaluated by using both pups' hippocampus and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The total number of dendritic spines showed statistically significant decreases in the dentate gyrus (DG) but was not altered in the cornu ammonis (CA1) in hippocampal neurons. In particular, the number of mushroom-type dendritic spines showed statistically significant decreases in the CA1 and DG. The expression of glutamate receptors was decreased in mushroom-type dendritic spines in the CA1 and DG of hippocampal neurons following RF-EMF exposure. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the CA1 and DG was significantly lower statistically in RF-EMF-exposed mice. The number of post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) puncta gradually increased over time but was significantly decreased statistically at days in vitro (DIV) 5, 7, and 9 following RF-EMF exposure. Decreased BDNF expression was restricted to the soma and was not observed in neurites of hippocampal neurons following RF-EMF exposure. The length of neurite outgrowth and number of branches showed statistically significant decreases, but no changes in the soma size of hippocampal neurons were observed. Further, the memory index showed statistically significant decreases in RF-EMF-exposed mice, suggesting that decreased synaptic density following RF-EMF exposure at early developmental stages may affect memory function. Collectively, these data suggest that hindered neuronal outgrowth following RF-EMF exposure may decrease overall synaptic density during early neurite development of hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Growth factors regulate ovarian follicle development and they signal through intracellular pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, which is negatively regulated by a subfamily of 23 dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP). Using sheep granulosa cells as a model, we detected mRNA encoding 16 DUSPs in vivo and in vitro. Stimulation of cells in vitro with FGF2 increased (p < 0.05) abundance of DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP5 and DUSP6 mRNA, and abundance of DUSP1 and DUSP6 proteins (p < 0.05). In contrast, neither FGF8b nor FGF18 had any major effect on DUSP mRNA abundance. Inhibition of DUSP6 action with the inhibitor BCI significantly increased (p < 0.05) MAPK8 (JNK) phosphorylation but not phosphoMAPK14 (p38) or MAPK3/ 1 (ERK1/2) abundance. This study suggests that FGFs stimulate DUSP protein abundance, that DUSP6 regulates MAPK8 phosphorylation in granulosa cells, and DUSPs are involved in the differential MAPK signaling of individual FGF ligands.

AB  - Abnormal tau accumulation and spatial memory loss constitute characteristic pathology and symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Yet, the intrinsic connections and the mechanism between them are not fully understood. In the current study, we observed a prominent accumulation of the AD-like hyperphosphorylated and truncated tau (hTau N368) proteins in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells of 3xTg-AD mice. Further investigation demonstrated that the ventral DG (vDG) mossy cell-specific overexpressing hTau for 3 months induced spatial cognitive deficits, while expressing hTau N368 for only 1 month caused remarkable spatial cognitive impairment with more prominent tau pathologies. By in vivo electrophysiological and optic fiber recording, we observed that the vDG mossy cell-specific overexpression of hTau N368 disrupted theta oscillations with local neural network inactivation in the dorsal DG subset, suggesting impairment of the ventral to dorsal neural circuit. The mossy cell-specific transcriptomic data revealed that multiple AD-associated signaling pathways were disrupted by hTau N368, including reduction of synapse-associated proteins, inhibition of AKT and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta. Importantly, chemogenetic activating mossy cells efficiently attenuated the hTau N368-induced spatial cognitive deficits. Together, our findings indicate that the mossy cell pathological tau accumulation could induce the AD-like spatial memory deficit by inhibiting the local neural network activity, which not only reveals new pathogenesis underlying the mossy cell-related spatial memory loss but also provides a mouse model of Mossy cell-specific hTau accumulation for drug development in AD and the related tauopathies.

AB  - Pasteurella multocida, a zoonotic pathogen that produces a 146-kDa modular toxin (PMT), causes progressive atrophic rhinitis with severe turbinate bone degradation in pigs. However, its mechanism of cytotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we expressed PMT, purified it in a prokaryotic expression system, and found that it killed PK15 cells. The host factor CXCL8 was significantly upregulated among the differentially expressed genes in a transcriptome sequencing analysis and qPCR verification. We constructed a CXCL8-knockout cell line with a CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that CXCL8 knockout significantly increased resistance to PMT-induced cell apoptosis. CXCL8 knockout impaired the cleavage efficiency of apoptosis-related proteins, including Caspase3, Caspase8, and PARP1, as demonstrated with Western blot. In conclusion, these findings establish that CXCL8 facilitates PMT-induced PK15 cell death, which involves apoptotic pathways; this observation documents that CXCL8 plays a key role in PMT-induced PK15 cell death.

AB  - The effects of feeding frequency on Hippocampus reidi broodstock were examined using oocyte fatty acid profile, reproduction, and larval resistance to starvation as evaluation criteria. Twelve breeding pairs (approx. 27 g; 18 cm per individual) were fed to satiation with defrosted enriched caridean shrimp Palaemon sp. in one (F1), two (F2), three (F3), or four (F4) meals per day. Three broodstock pairs were subjected to each feeding regime and treatments were continued for 101 days. Fish of both sexes fed once a day had lower weight gain and specific growth rates than broodstock from the other treatments (p < 0.05). Newly born larvae produced by the pairs in F3 and F4 treatments presented similar weight and length (mean 2.06 +/- 0.11 mg; 7.9 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively) and were larger than those produced by pairs that received one or two daily feedings (mean 1.62 +/- 0.17 mg; 6.7 +/- 0.05 mm) (p < 0.05). Mean number of larvae per parturition in F3 and F4 (928.5) was almost two times the mean number of larvae in F1 and F2. The total mortality of the starved larvae was observed after 72 h in the couples of treatments F1 and F2, while in treatments F3 and F4 it occurred after 96 h. The highest concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were observed in the oocytes produced by fish subjected to the F4 treatment. It is recommended that when broodstock H. reidi are given defrosted enriched shrimp to apparent satiation, they should be fed three to four times per day to promote egg production and to give good quality larvae.

AB  - Essential oils and their constituents are presently known to interfere with herbivorous insects' behavioral and physiological activities. The effects of Ajwain (Carum copticum, L.) (Apiaceae) essential oil (AEO) and its main components were studied on Chilo suppressalis Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a serious pest of rice cropping in several parts of the world. The study included the toxicity of each component of AEO and the estimation of their synergistic or antagonistic effect on C. suppressalis larvae. The bioassay data showed the high insecticidal activity of AEO and thymol against the C. suppressalis larvae with LD50 values of 13.10 and 17.11 mu g/larvae, respectively. The insecticidal activity was increased by binary mixtures of thymol + gamma-terpinene or p-cymene, while the composition of p-cymene + gamma-terpinene showed an antagonistic effect on the insects. The biochemical experiments demonstrated that treatment of AEO and its components enhanced the activities of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, and inhibited acetylcholinesterase. Among these compounds, thymol may be recommended as a potent biopesticide in controlling C. suppressalis populations, both insecticidal and compatible with other components with high AChE inhibition properties.

AB  - Background: : Herb-derived therapeutics is an attractive strategy to treat depression. Here we report the ameliorating effects of Sulfuretin, an anti-inflammatory compound in a depressive mouse model.
   Methods:: Immobility times were obtained in the tail suspension test and forced swim test performed from day 14 to day 16. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to measure brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway of the hippocampus tissue on day 17. SL327 was used to block the ERK pathway in mice to evaluate the interaction between Sulfuretin and the ERK pathway. Mice were treated with Sulfuretin for 14 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (0.83 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for two days.
   Results: : Behavior tests showed that Sulfuretin dose-dependently decreased immobility times correlated with depression symptoms. BDNF levels and ERK signaling were significantly restored in the Sulfuretin-treated mice, showing the improvement of brain function. Blocking the p-ERK signaling abrogated the effects of Sulfuretin in improving behaviors and levels of BDNF.
   Conclusion: : Our study suggests that Sulfuretin exhibits anti-depressive function in LPS-induced depressive mice, in which the ERK signaling plays an essential role.

AB  - Background COVID-19 patients, especially the patients requiring hospitalisation, have a high risk of several complications such as opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections. Mucormycosis is a rare and opportunistic fungal infection that mainly affects diabetic and immunocompromised patients. An increase has been observed in the number of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital, Kermanshah, Iran, since October 2020. This is a report of the frequency, risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19 associated with mucormycosis infection. Methods The medical records of COVID-19 patients with rhino-orbital mucormycosis who were diagnosed in an educational therapeutic hospital in Kermanshah, west of Iran were surveyed. Several parameters were analysed including demographic, clinical, therapeutic and laboratory characteristics. Results Twelve patients with COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital mucormycosis were identified from 12 October to 18 November 2020. All cases reported as proven mucormycosis had a history of hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Comorbidities mainly included diabetes mellitus (83.33%) and hypertension (58.33%). Seventy-five per cent of patients received corticosteroids for COVID- 19 treatment. The sites of involvement were rhino-sino-orbital (83%) and rhino-sino (17%). Amphotericin B/liposomal amphotericin B alone or in combination with surgical debridement or orbital exenteration was used as the first-line therapy. The overall mortality rate was 66.7% (8/12). Conclusions We found a high incidence of mucormycosis among COVID-19 patients. Diabetes mellitus and corticosteroid use were the dominant predisposing factor of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a life-threatening and opportunistic infection; therefore, physicians should know the signs and symptoms of the disease so that a timely diagnosis and therapy can be performed.

AB  - Hipposideros khaokhouayensis is a globally rare and vulnerable species. Since information about its distribution and echolocation was very limited, the author conducted a series of bat surveys in northwestern Vietnam with an emphasis on this species between 2022 and 2023. Bats were captured using harp traps and mist nets then identified in the field based on their morphological diagnoses. Echolocation calls were recorded under three different situations (free-flying while emerging from caves, handheld, and flying within a flight tent) using the PCTape system. A colony of the species was discovered in Son La Province. The adults of this colony were found to be considerably larger than all individuals described in previous publications. The species emits multiharmonic calls with the most energy in the second harmonic. Each usual call comprises two components: a constant-frequency (CF) component followed by a downward frequency-modulated terminal sweep (tFM). Special calls, which were not mentioned in any literature, were recorded in-between usual calls. Each special call comprises three distinct components: an upward frequency-modulated initial sweep (iFM) followed by a CF and a tFM. The frequency of the CF component and the pulse duration of the adult bats from Son La Province are higher and longer than those in published descriptions. The present study results indicate that H. khaokhouayensis emits a single call or calls in groups up to seven signals. The new distributional record, morphological features and echolocation characteristics demonstrated herewith, provide essential information for monitoring and conservation of this vulnerable species at national and international scales.

AB  - Adrenal medullary chromaffin (AMC) cells in the perinatal period and carotid body glomus cells after birth respond to hypoxia with catecholamine secretion. The hypoxia detection mechanism in such O2- sensitive cells is still not well defined. One hypothesis is that a decrease in cellular ATP may be involved in the hypoxia detection. This idea is based on ATP dependence of TASK channel activity that regulates the resting membrane potential and is suppressed by hypoxia in glomus cells. Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor factor-1 (IF1), a physiological regulator of ATP synthase, helps prevent ATP hydrolysis under hypoxic conditions. In cells where IF1 expression is high, exposure to hypoxia is expected to have no effect on TASK channel activity. This possibility was electrophysiologically and immunocytochemically explored. Single channel recordings revealed that 36-pS TASK3-like channels contribute to the resting membrane potential in young rat adrenal cortical (AC) cells. TASK3-like channel activity in a cell-attached patch was not affected by bath application of mitochondrial inhibitors. Consistent with this finding, IF1- like immunoreactive material was well expressed in rat AC cells. In further support of our hypothesis, IF1- like immunoreactive material was well expressed in adult rat AMC cells that are known to be hypoxia-insensitive and minimally expressed in newborn AMC cells that are hypoxia-sensitive. These results provide evidence for the functional relevance of IF1 expression in excitability in O2-sensitive cells in response to mitochondrial inhibition. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Memory consolidation during sleep depends on the interregional coupling of slow waves, spindles, and sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), across the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus, linking the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus, may facilitate interregional coupling during sleep. To test this hypothesis, we used intracellular, extracellular unit and local field potential recordings in anesthetized and head restrained non-anesthetized cats as well as computational modelling. Electrical stimulation of the reuniens evoked both antidromic and orthodromic intracellular mPFC responses, consistent with bidirectional functional connectivity between mPFC, reuniens and hippocampus in anesthetized state. The major finding obtained from behaving animals is that at least during NREM sleep hippocampo-reuniens-mPFC form a functional loop. SWRs facilitate the triggering of thalamic spindles, which later reach neocortex. In return, transition to mPFC UP states increase the probability of hippocampal SWRs and later modulate spindle amplitude. During REM sleep hippocampal theta activity provides periodic locking of reuniens neuronal firing and strong crosscorrelation at LFP level, but the values of reuniens-mPFC crosscorrelation was relatively low and theta power at mPFC was low. The neural mass model of this network demonstrates that the strength of bidirectional hippocampo-thalamic connections determines the coupling of oscillations, suggesting a mechanistic link between synaptic weights and the propensity for interregional synchrony. Our results demonstrate the presence of functional connectivity in hippocampo-thalamo-cortical network, but the efficacy of this connectivity is modulated by behavioral state.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartic acid type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play critical roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity, the dysregulation of which leads to cognitive defects. Here, we identified a rare variant in the NMDAR subunit GluN2A (K879R) in a patient with intellectual disability. The K879R mutation enhanced receptor expression on the cell surface by disrupting a KKK motif that we demonstrated to be an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Expression of GluN2A_K879R in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons enhanced the excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by GluN2A-NMDAR but suppressed those mediated by GluN2B-NMDAR and the AMPA receptor. GluN2A_K879R knock-in mice showed similar defects in synaptic transmission and exhibited impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, both LTP and LTD were severely impaired in the KI mice, likely explaining their learning and memory defects. Therefore, our study reveals a new mechanism by which elevated synaptic GluN2A-NMDAR impairs long-term synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory.

AB  - This study examines the quality and availability of daylight in childcare facilities, focusing on compliance with Polish Technical Conditions (TCs) and comparing them with international certification systems such as BREEAM, LEED, and WELL. Polish regulations regarding sunlight exposure require revisions to support the sustainable development of buildings, impacting children's well-being, their health, and the building's energy efficiency. Daylight's significance for children's health and development underpins the investigation, highlighting its impact on the circadian rhythm, cognitive abilities, and well-being. The research utilized computational simulations with Rhinoceros 7 and Ladybug and Honeybee plugins to model a preschool room's daylight performance under various window configurations and orientations. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted, focusing on parameters such as Daylight Factor (DF), Daylight Autonomy (DA), and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI). The findings revealed that while the TCs' requirements ensure minimum daylight access, they result in nonoptimal lighting quality as defined by international standards. Almost half of the surveyed rooms in the case with a WFR of one-eighth did not meet the condition for having acceptable daylight levels, as defined in the study. In the same study, only about one-third of the analyzed variants achieved the threshold for good daylight quality. At a WFR of one-eighth, no room variant reached the level considered to indicate excellent daylight quality. The results show the need for revised regulations incorporating comprehensive metrics like Climate-Based Daylight Modeling (CBDM). This study suggests that integrating advanced methods of assessing daylight quality could significantly improve daylight conditions in childcare environments. This research is a starting point for discussing the need to modernize the Polish Technical Conditions (TC) to support the sustainable development of childcare facilities in Poland.

AB  - Wearable sensing technologies can be used for precision livestock production and to study foraging strategies to better understand the relationships between herbivores, vegetation, and landscape. In this context, monitoring grazing behavior (i.e. chew and bite events) can provide critical information for livestock management. This study presents a computational tool that utilizes wearable sensing and deep learning to distinguish chew and bite events in horses. A micro camera equipped with a microphone (0?18 kHz) was used to obtain video/audio data from horses during grazing. The collected audio data were treated in a pre-processing filtering step, then used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to detect and distinguish chews, bites, and noise events. A post-processing sliding window technique was used to filter events with low confidence levels and lengths. Initial evaluation of this system showed an accuracy of 88.64% for bite identification and an accuracy of 94.13% for chew identification. The distinction between events and evaluation of responses to different pasture species and structure can provide useful information on the plant-animal interface. That is aligned to information such as bite rate, bite mass, and grazing time, and can help determine management strategies that optimize intake and provide data for modeling foraging behavior to predict pasture use and animal performance.

AB  - The objective of this research was to optimize the composition and performance of chitosan-coated solid lipid nanoparticles carrying insulin (Ch-In-SLNs) and to assess the potential of piperine in enhancing the intestinal permeability of insulin from these SLNs in vitro. The SLNs were formulated from glyceryl behenate (GB), soya lecithin, and poloxamer (R) 407, and then coated with a combination of chitosan and piperine to facilitate insulin penetration across the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa. A Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was utilized to optimize the Ch-In-SLNs formulations, with PDI, particle size, zeta potential, and association efficiency (AE) serving as the response variables. The resulting Ch-In-SLNs exhibited excellent monodispersity (PDI = 0.4), optimal particle size (654.43 nm), positive zeta potential (+36.87 mV), and low AE values. The Ch-In-SLNs demonstrated sustained release of insulin for 12 h in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and intestinal fluid (SIF), with increased release in the latter. After incubation in SGF and SIF for 12 h, the insulin SLNs retained 54 and 41 % of their initial insulin load, respectively, indicating effective protection from gastric enzymes. Permeation studies using goat intestine and Caco-2 cell lines indicated improved insulin permeation in the presence of piperine. Additionally, cell uptake studies confirmed the role of piperine in enhancing insulin permeation.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer, a chronic and heterogeneous disease, is the leading cause of cancer-related death on a global scale. Presently, despite a variety of available treatments, their effectiveness is limited, often resulting in considerable toxicity and adverse effects. Additionally, the development of chemoresistance in cancer cells poses a challenge. Trilobolide-6-O-isobutyrate (TBB), a natural sesquiterpene lactone extracted from Sphagneticola trilobata, has exhibited antitumor effects. Its pharmacological properties in NSCLC lung cancer, however, have not been explored. Purpose: This study evaluated the impact of TBB on the A549 and NCI-H460 tumor cell lines in vitro, examining its antiproliferative properties and initial mechanisms of cell death. Methods: TBB, obtained at 98 % purity from S. trilobata leaves, was characterized using chromatographic techniques. Subsequently, its impact on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vitro, TBB-induced cytotoxicity in LLC-MK2, THP-1, AMJ2-C11 cells, as well as its effects on sheep erythrocytes, and the underlying mechanisms of cell death, were assessed. Results: In silico predictions have shown promising drug-likeness potential for TBB, indicating high oral bioavailability and intestinal absorption. Treatment of A549 and NCI-H460 human tumor cells with TBB demonstrated a direct impact, inducing significant morphological and structural alterations. TBB also reduced migratory capacity without causing toxicity at lower concentrations to LLC-MK2, THP-1 and AMJ2-C11 cell lines. This antiproliferative effect correlated with elevated oxidative stress, characterized by increased levels of ROS, superoxide anion radicals and NO, accompanied by a decrease in antioxidant markers: SOD and GSH. TBB-stressinduced led to changes in cell metabolism, fostering the accumulation of lipid droplets and autophagic vacuoles. Stress also resulted in compromised mitochondrial integrity, a crucial aspect of cellular function. Additionally, TBB prompted apoptosis-like cell death through activation of caspase 3/7 stressors. Conclusion: These findings underscore the potential of TBB as a promising candidate for future studies and suggest its viability as an additional component in the development of novel anticancer drugs prototypes.

AB  - In exchange for extrafloral nectar, ants deter herbivores from the plants decreasing the herbivore damage, and increasing plant performance in terms of growth and survival. Plants of different sexes may exhibit differences in the investment of resources for defence, thereby differentially decreasing the amount of energy available to other physiological processes. In this context, little is known about sex-related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). In the present study, we conducted ant-exclusion experiments in the field to test for sex-related differences in the outcome of ant-plant interactions in vegetative and reproductive buds of Opuntia robusta in individuals of different sexes in two populations: trioecious and dioecious. We applied tanglefoot to some plant and others were allowed ant access, and measured herbivory, relative growth rates and survival probabilities of buds during the growing season when EFNs are active. We counted the number of ants foraging in EFNs of flowers and cladodes of different sexes. We hypothesized that differences in resource investment to defence between sexes change the outcome of ant-plant interactions in terms of the number of ants foraging on EFNs, herbivory, growth, and survival probabilities. Our results suggest sex-specific strategies in the investment of resources for defence mediated by EFNs in O. robusta, wherein males, females and hermaphrodites from both populations respond differentially to ant presence and herbivores. These sex-related differences affected the outcome of the ant-plant interactions, influencing changes in number of ants foraging on EFNs, and the resulting herbivory, growth and survival of flowers and cladodes among the different sexes and among populations. Our results suggest that the maintenance of EFNs in O. robusta is costly, reflecting some trade-offs between growth/survival and defence. Buds visited by ants tended to grow slowly and survive worse in the trioecious population; in the dioecious population they grew slower but survived better. Overall, a greater number of ants visiting EFNs was related to lower herbivore damage, greater growth and survival of flowers and cladodes. Our study underscores the importance of considering plant sex in the outcome of ant-plant interactions. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDG, DGDG), the main lipids of plant photosynthetic membranes, represent a large but unexploited reservoir of fatty acids on earth. They are dispersed in plant biomass (milligrams per gram of dry mass) and not as accessible as vegetable oils by simple physical means. The identification and characterization of galactolipid acyl hydrolases, or galactolipases, raise the possibility to use these biocatalysts for the bioconversion of galactolipids. Here, we show that two enzymes of mammalian and microbial origins, pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 from guinea pig (GPLRP2) and cutinase from Fusarium solani, have the capacity to directly and fully release the fatty acids of MGDG and DGDG present in various plant leaves and green wastes. This high substrate accessibility to enzymes was further explored by performing alcoholysis reactions in situ and showing the conversion of galactolipid fatty acids into fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAE) when the enzyme and leaves were incubated in the presence of 6 or 2.5 M ethanol. These findings pave the way to the recovery of fatty acids dispersed in green biomass and the exploitation of an additional and renewable source of fatty acids for oleochemistry and nutrition in a context of competition for vegetable oils.

AB  - The combination of saccharides in the composition of a cryopreservation medium may represent a promising method for the preservation of the reproductive cells of male birds. In the current study, cryoprotective media with a combined composition of mono- and di-saccharides were developed. The degree of penetration of reducing saccharide molecules (maltose-Mal20 medium) and non-reducing disaccharide molecules (trehalose-Treh20 medium) from the cryoprotective medium into the cytosol of rooster spermatozoa was studied. LCM control media without disaccharides were used as the control. The number of maltose molecules penetrating from the outside into the cytosol of the spermatozoon was 1.06 x 10(4), and the number of trehalose molecules was 3.98 x 10(4). Using a combination of maltose and fructose, the progressive motility of frozen/thawed semen and the fertility rates of eggs were significantly higher ((p < 0.05) 40.2% and 68.5%, respectively) than when using a combination of trehalose and fructose in a cryoprotective diluent (33.4% and 62.4%, respectively). A higher rate of chromatin integrity at the level of 92.4% was obtained when using Treh20 versus 74.5% Mal20 (p < 0.05). Maltose positively affected the preservation of frozen/thawed sperm in the genital tract of hens. On the seventh day from the last insemination when using Mal20, the fertilization of eggs was 42.6% and only 27.3% when using Treh20. Despite the same molecular weight, maltose and trehalose have different physicochemical and biological properties that determine their function and effectiveness as components of cryoprotective media.

AB  - The Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is a large migratory demersal flatfish species that occupies a top trophic role in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea ecosystems, where it also supports various fisheries. As a first attempt to characterize the endocrine mechanisms driving sexual maturation in this important species, we collected pituitary, ovarian and blood samples from Pacific halibut females captured in the wild that were classified histologically into various female developmental stages. We conducted gene expression analyses of gonadotropin beta subunits in the pituitary and observed that mRNA expression levels of fshb gradually increased throughout vitellogenesis, remained elevated until before ovulation and declined after spawning. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of lhb markedly increased during oocyte maturation and remained elevated until after spawning. Ovarian mRNA expression levels of the gonadotropin receptor genes fshr and lhr peaked during oocyte maturation and before spawning, respectively, immediately following the developmental stage at which pituitary fshb and lhb mRNA expression first reached maximum levels. The ovarian gene expression patterns of steroidogenic enzyme genes cyp19a1 and hsd20b2 paralleled those of fshr and lhr, respectively. Testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) plasma levels increased concomitantly with fshr and cyp19a1 mRNA expression levels, and vitellogenin plasma levels increased throughout vitellogenesis and reached maximum levels prior to spawning. These results are consistent with the notion that in female Pacific halibut, as in other teleosts, vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation and ovulation are likely under the control of pituitary gonadotropic hormones Fsh and Lh, respectively.

AB  - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are located near CpG sites have the potential to influence DNA methylation levels, leading to distinct patterns of DNA methylation. These methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can influence methylation levels across the entire genome, thereby impacting phenotypic traits. In this study, we utilised reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) to analyse DNA methylation in muscle tissue samples collected from 140 Yorkshire pigs. Additionally, we assessed SNPs using the Porcine 50K chip, examined 17 fatty acid traits, and conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our investigation revealed numerous associations between DNA methylation and fatty acid traits, including C16:0, C18:0, C20:3n-3, and C22:6n-3. Notably, a substantial portion of these associations was specifically identified by EWAS and not GWAS. Subsequently, we performed GWAS to identify meQTLs using methylation levels of significant CpGs from the EWAS as traits. The results revealed the predominance of trans-meQTLs; however, we also discovered a cis-meQTL on SSC12. Finally, we reported a crucial CpG site (SSC12:3735523) and its cis-meQTL on SSC12, which are located in close proximity to the FASN gene. Our findings contribute to the identification of CpG sites and their cis-meQTLs associated with fatty acid traits, utilising comprehensive genome and methylome data. Moreover, our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying fatty acid traits in pigs.

AB  - High-sugar diet (HSD), high-cholesterol diet (HCD), and high-fat diet (HFD) all modulate the levels of lipids. However, there is a lack of comparative data on the effects of different diets on phospholipids (PLs). Given their important role in physiology and disease, there has been an increasing focus on altered PLs in liver and brain disorders. This study aims to determine the effects of HSD, HCD, and HFD for 14-week feeding on the PL profile of the mouse liver and hippocampus. Quantitative analysis of 116 and 113 PL molecular species in liver and hippocampus tissues revealed that the HSD, HCD, and HFD significantly affected the PLs in liver and hippocampus, especially decreased the levels of plasmenylethanolamine (pPE) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Overall, the impact of HFD on liver PLs was more significant, consistent with the morphological changes in the liver. Compared to HSD and HCD, HFD induced a significant decrease in PC (P-16:0/18:1) and an increase in LPE (18:0) and LPE (18:1) in liver. In the liver of mice fed with different diets, the expression of the key enzymes Gnpat, Agps in the pPE biosynthesis pathway and peroxisome-associated membrane proteins pex14p were decreased. In addition, all diets significantly reduced the expression of Gnpat, pex7p, and pex16p in hippocampus tissue. In conclusion, HSD, HCD, and HFD enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver, led to liver injury, significantly affected the liver and hippocampus PLs, and decreased the expression of genes related to plasmalogen synthesis in mouse liver and hippocampus, which caused severe plasmalogen reduction.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) overexposure induces learning and memory impairments in mice by disrupting the functions of syn-apses and synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the hippocampus, which is associated with alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) overexpression. Rab26-dependent autophagy is a key signaling step required for impaired SV clearance; however, it is unclear whether Mn-induced alpha-Syn overexpression is linked to dysregulated Rab26-dependent autophagy in presynaptic neurons. In this study, we developed manganism models in male C57BL/6 mice and hippocampal primary neurons to observe the associations between Mn-induced alpha-Syn overexpression and impaired SV accumulation. The results of the in vivo experiments showed that 100 and 200 mu mol/kg Mn exposure significantly impaired memory and synaptic plas-ticity in the mice, which was related to the accumulation of impaired SVs in the hippocampus. Consistent with the in vivo outcomes, the level of in vitro injured SVs in the 50 and 100 mu mol/L Mn-exposed neuron group were higher than that in the control group. Moreover, 100 mu mol/L Mn suppressed the initiation of Rab26-dependent autophagy at the synapse. Then, we transfected neurons with LV-alpha-Syn short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and exposed the neurons to Mn for an additional 24 h. Surprisingly, the area of colocalization between Rab26 and Atg16L1 and the expression level of LC3II-positive SVs were both higher in Mn-exposed LV-alpha-Syn shRNA-transfected neurons than those in Mn-treated normal or Mn-treated LV-scrambled shRNA-transfected neurons. Thus, Mn-induced alpha-Syn overexpression was responsible for the dysregulation of Rab26-dependent autophagy, thereby promoting the accumulation of injured SVs, and causing synaptotoxicity and cognitive and memory deficits in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUNDReasonable nitrogen (N) supply is critical for increasing rice yield while improving grain quality and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). However, the trade-off relationship between yield, quality and NUE of rice under N management has not been well understood enough. In the present study, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to identify optimal N fertilizer management practices that resulted in high-yield, high-quality and high-NUE by using the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) with entropy weight (EW) method. RESULTSAll the parameters of rice yield, quality and efficiency were remarkably affected by fertilization treatments. Compared with farmer's fertilization practice (FFP), optimizing N fertilizer treatment (OPT) and substituting 20% of N fertilizer with pig manure based on OPT treatment (OPTM) increased grain yield (2.87-6.62%) by maintaining higher 1000-grain weight and filled grains rate. The agronomic NUE (AE) and N partial factor productivity (PFP) under OPT and OPTM treatment were also remarkably increased by 32.81-43.01% and 28.59-33.28% with respect to the value under FFP treatment, respectively. Meanwhile, OPT and OPTM significantly improved the milling quality of rice by increasing brown rice rate (0.71-1.17%) and head rice rate (1.34-2.31%). OPT and OPTM significantly improved appearance quality by decreasing chalkiness and eating quality by reducing amylose content in 2020. The TOPSIS with EW showed that rice comprehensive evaluation could be maintained at a high level under OPT and OPTM. CONCLUSIONOPT and OPTM were nutrient management modes of high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency, and promising practice to improve rice comprehensive productivity. This strategy is also highly-consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Tight junctions are a barrier-forming cell-cell adhesion complex and have been proposed to regulate cell proliferation. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we used cells deficient in the junction scaffold ZO-1 alone or together with its paralog ZO-2, which disrupts the junctional barrier. We found that ZO-1 knockout increased cell proliferation, induced loss of cell density-dependent proliferation control, and promoted apoptosis and necrosis. These phenotypes were enhanced by double ZO-1/ZO-2 knockout. Increased proliferation was dependent on two transcriptional regulators: YAP and ZONAB. ZO-1 knockout stimulated YAP nuclear translocation and activity without changes in Hippo-dependent phosphorylation. Knockout promoted TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activation and increased expression of the RhoA activator GEF-H1. Knockdown of ZO-3, another paralog interacting with ZO1, was sufficient to induce GEF-H1 expression and YAP activity. GEF-H1, TBK1, and mechanotransduction at focal adhesions were found to cooperate to activate YAP/TEAD in ZO-1-deficient cells. Thus, ZO-1 controled cell proliferation and Hippo-independent YAP activity by activating a GEF-H1- and TBK1-regulated mechanosensitive signalling network.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Correlations between the number of milk somatic cells (SCC), the number of microorganisms, and the content of basic components of milk were studied on five farms (F1-F5) with cows of the same breed, but with different milking systems. Materials and Method. From each farm, 50 Holstein Friesien milk samples were collected once a month (250 samples/ month; n=3,000) during March 2022 - February 2023. Samples from farms F1 and F5 were tested for fat, protein, lactose, no fat dry matter content (FTIR spectroscopy), for the SCC (Fossomatic 7), and for the differential cells (Vetscan DC -Q). Results. The highest fat content was confirmed on farm F5 (3.85 +/- 1.70%) and F4 (3.82 +/- 0.21%) with automatic milking system (AMS). However, from the point of view of protein content, these farms showed slightly lower values (<0.05). F1 did not meet the minimum required amount for fat content (2.84 +/- 0.81%) set by the legislation of the Slovakia. The comparison shows that there is not much difference in cell size between healthy cells and mastitis cells. The average size of healthy cells was approximately 8.77 +/- 0.49 mu m. In the monitored period, the average values determined were at the level of 292,000/mL (5.46 +/- 0.72 log10 SCC) in cow milk samples, while for the rest of the year, the values remained at 256,000/mL (5.40 +/- 0.80 log10 SCC). F1 was categorized as a positive farm with a high TLC (total milk leucocyte count) concentration (5.58 log10 cells/mL, 406.65 +/- 53.80 x 10 3 cells/mL) and a predominant NEU fraction (61%). Farms F2, F4, and F5 were classified as negative farms (TLC was 4.70 +/- 0.26 log10 cells/ml). Conclusions. According to the results, the size of SCCs in healthy milk does not differ from SCCs found in mastitis milk. From the results, it can be concluded that the transition to the latest generation of robotic milking method can positively affect milk production and its quality.

AB  - Hair-related genes in mammals play important roles in the development and maintenance of hair and other keratinous structures in mammals. The peptidyl arginine deiminase 3 (PADI3) gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine residues to citrulline. The S100 calcium binding protein A3 (S100A3) gene encodes a protein that is highly expressed in the hair cuticle and contains arginine residues that are converted to citrullines by PADI enzymes. In this study, we investigated the pseudogenization events of PADI3 and S100A3 in cetaceans and Hippopotamus amphibius. We found that PADI3 underwent three independent pseudogenization events during cetacean evolution, in baleen whales, toothed cetaceans other than Physeter catodon, and P. catodon. Notably, the entire PADI3 gene is absent in the baleen whales. Pseudogenization of S100A3 occurred independently in cetaceans and H. amphibius. Interestingly, we found that in cetaceans S100A3 underwent pseudogenization before PADI3, suggesting that differential selection pressures were acting on the two genes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular evolution of these genes in cetaceans and hippopotamuses, highlighting their importance for understanding the evolution of hair-related genes.

AB  - How to optimize the industrial symbiosis network and quantify its evolution are still an opened problem in industrial ecology. A typical iron and steel industrial symbiosis network (ISISN) was chosen to find the changes of indicators screened of carbon flow and iron flow with symbiotic measures added or adjusted. And indicators applied in this study are to comprehensively quantify and characterize the evolution of the structure, function, and performance of two metabolisms in different scenarios. Results show that Average Path Length (APL), Finn Cycling Index (FCI), Detritivory to Herbivory ratio (D:H) mainly be used to quantify the function characteristics related to structure of the medium flow metabolism, and Mean Trophic Level (MTL), Keystoneness (KS), Structural Information (SI) mainly quantify the structure characteristics related to function. Flow-based Information indices are mainly applied to quantify the structure, function and organization characteristics of symbiosis network. Carbon metabolism is in a subordinate position with more development potential and redundancy in the symbiosis network which is in a stable structure of intra-firm symbiosis while iron metabolism is the key with strong dominance and more efficient. All the indicators are sensitive to symbiotic components and symbiotic measures increased that reveal the performance improved and able to comprehensively detect the evolution of carbon and iron metabolisms of the symbiosis networks. Furthermore, these indicators may be used for decision makers to measure and assess industrial symbiosis network though there is still no testing applicability of indicators accurately due to industry type and a single case.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health challenge, increasingly affecting patients' finances, mental health, and functional abilities as the global population ages. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs) have emerged as a promising cell-free therapeutic approach for AD, although their precise mechanisms remain unclear. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SC-EVs in treating AD. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up to December 31, 2023, identifying studies investigating SC-EVs therapy in AD rodent models. Outcome measures included Morris water maze and Y maze tests, beta-amyloid pathology, and inflammatory markers. Statistical analyses utilized Stata 15.1 and R software. Results: This meta-analysis of 16 studies (2017-2023, 314 animals) demonstrates significant efficacy of SC-EVs therapy in AD models. Pooled analyses demonstrated that SC-EVs therapy significantly increased the learning function as measured by Morris water maze tests (MWM) by -1.83 (95% CI = -2.51 to -1.15, p < 0.0001), Y maze test by 1.66 (95% CI = 1.03 to 2.28, p < 0.0001), decreased A beta plaques in the hippocampal by -2.10 (95% CI = -2.96 to -1.23, p < 0.0001), and proinflammatory cytokines Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) by -2.61 (95% CI = -4.87 to -0.35, p < 0.05), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by -2.37 (95% CI = -3.68 to -1.05, p < 0.001). Conclusions: SC-EVs therapy shows promise in enhancing cognitive function and mitigating AD progression in preclinical models. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies and comparing SC-EVs isolation techniques and dosing strategies to facilitate clinical translation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to produce edible films using ovine second cheese whey (SCW) powder, alone or combined with whey protein isolate (WPI). SCW is a by-product obtained in the manufacture of ovine whey cheeses. In this instance, it was dehydrated after increasing the protein concentration by ultrafiltration/diafiltration. Furthermore, the effects of the addition of oregano (Origanum compactum) essential oil (EO) in two proportions to the films produced with a mixture of SCW powder and WPI were studied. The water vapor permeability, solubility, color, opacity, antioxidant activity, and the mechanical properties of the films were determined. In addition, we determined the films' structure, by FTIR; thermal stability, by TGA; and microstructure and crystallinity, by XRD. SCW combined with WPI can be used to prepare edible films, but their properties were found to be affected depending on the proportion of each product. The substitution of WPI by SCW caused decreases in water solubility (from 81.44 to 66.49% D.M.), modified the color and decreased tensile strength (from 1.57 to 0.17 MPa), and decreased the elongation at break (from 52.17 to 3.57%), the puncture strength (from 2.40 to 0.20 MPa) and the deformation (from 18.92 to 0.93%) of the films. EO addition to the SCW-WPI films increased the antioxidant activity of the films (from 0.97 to 2.19 mg DPPH/g). It also modified other characteristics of the films such as the water solubility and the tensile strength. Both SCW and EO incorporations influenced the secondary structure of proteins and the thermal stability, microstructure and crystallinity of the films.

AB  - The increasing discharge and ubiquitous occurrence of novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) in aquatic environments have initiated intense global concerns; however, little information is available regarding their structure-related trophodynamics in marine food webs. In this study, a tropical marine food web including 29 species (18 fish and 11 invertebrate species) was collected from coral reef waters of the Xisha Islands, the South China Sea, for an analysis of 11 representative NBFRs. The mean Sigma NBFR concentrations generally increased in the following sequence: sea cucumbers (0.330 ng/g lw) < crabs (0.380 ng/g lw) < shells (2.10 ng/g lw) < herbivorous fishes (2.30 ng/g lw) < carnivorous fishes (4.13 ng/g lw), with decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and hexabromobenzene (HBB) as the predominant components. Trophic magnification was observed for all of the investigated NBFRs, with trophic magnification factors (TMFs) ranging from 1.53 (tetrabromobisphenol A bis(dibromopropyl ether)) to 5.32 (HBB). Significant negative correlations were also found between the TMFs and the tested in vitro transformation clearance rates (CLin vitro) for the target NBFRs except for bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-phthalate (TBPH) (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that the transformation rate is a more powerful predictor for TMFs than the hydrophobicity of NBFRs in this marine food web.

AB  - In Octodon degus, the aging process is not equivalent between sexes and worsens for females. To determine the beginning of detrimental features in females and the ways in which to improve them, we compared adult females (36 months old) and aged females (72 months old) treated with Andrographolide (ANDRO), the primary ingredient in Andrographis paniculata. Our behavioral data demonstrated that age does not affect recognition memory and preference for novel experiences, but ANDRO increases these at both ages. Sociability was also not affected by age; however, social recognition and long-term memory were lower in the aged females than adults but were restored with ANDRO. The synaptic physiology data from brain slices showed that adults have more basal synaptic efficiency than aged degus; however, ANDRO reduced basal activity in adults, while it increased long-term potentiation (LTP). Instead, ANDRO increased the basal synaptic activity and LTP in aged females. Age-dependent changes were also observed in synaptic proteins, where aged females have higher synaptotagmin (SYT) and lower postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) levels than adults. ANDRO increased the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B) at both ages and the PSD95 and Homer1 only in the aged. Thus, females exposed to long-term ANDRO administration show improved complex behaviors related to age-detrimental effects, modulating mechanisms of synaptic transmission, and proteins.

AB  - Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) feeding negatively impacts many plant species, including grapes, potentially reducing fruit quality and yield. Chemical control, representing the current grower standard, relies on frequent broadcast applications of broad-spectrum insecticides, with alternative management strategies mostly lacking. Attract-and-kill (A&K) is a behavioral management strategy that combines semiochemical attractants and a killing agent on a substrate. This study assessed the impact of A&K on (i) the number of P. japonica adults and (ii) the percent of P. japonica feeding injury on grape foliage compared to the grower standard in commercial vineyards. This 2-year study was conducted at 3 commercial vineyards with 4 paired plots consisting of a grower standard control and an A&K treatment. The A&K treatment consisted of commercial lures, each placed on outside-edge grapevines, and weekly applications of carbaryl on the plants holding lures. The grower standard received broadcast insecticide applications at the grower's discretion. The A&K treatment experienced similar numbers of P. japonica adults and similar proportions of leaf injury compared to the grower standard. The use of A&K reduced by 96% the crop area treated with insecticides compared to the grower standard. The area treated by A&K was at the edge of the vineyards, where more leaf injury occurred regardless of treatment. A&K is a targeted approach that was effective at managing P. japonica and reducing chemical inputs on a small scale. It has the potential to be scaled up and refined to provide growers with a new management strategy.

AB  - Habituation (accepting food sources previously rejected) and cross-habituation (accepting food sources containing deterrents after exposure to unrelated deterrents) induced by dietary experience are observed in lepidopteran larvae, but the physiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood. In this study, behavioural and electrophysiological responsiveness to three unrelated deterrents were investigated in larvae of Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Caterpillars were fed with one of four diets: 'normal' artificial diet or diet with low amounts of the alkaloid strychnine, the phenolic chlorogenic acid (CA), or the diterpene fumaropimaric acid (FA). These three chemicals are structurally different and are all deterrent to A. ipsilon caterpillars. In behavioural, dual-choice assays with chemical-treated leaf discs, caterpillars reared on normal diet fed less on treated discs, i.e., were highly deterred by the three chemicals. However, caterpillars fed on chemical-infused diets did not distinguish between treated and non-treated discs, i.e., they showed behavioural habituation. In triple-choice leaf disc assays, larvae fed with CA were deterred by both CA and FA and vice versa, i.e., larvae fed diet with CA or FA showed cross-habituation. There was no cross-habituation between strychnine and CA/FA. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that the same deterrent neuron in the lateral sensilla styloconica responds to CA and FA. Desensitisation of this neuron, through exposure to CA or FA in diet, was correlated with the observed cross-habituation. A different deterrent neuron, in the medial sensilla styloconica, responded to strychnine. Thus, no generalisation of either habituation or desensitisation occurred to deterrents that elicited responses from different deterrent neurons in the lateral and the medial sensilla styloconica. Cross-habituation to deterrents correlated with desensitisation of the corresponding deterrent neuron.

AB  - Larval frass in herbivorous lepidopterans is mainly composed of plant-derived material and microbes from the gut. Despite the fact that frass from conspecific larvae repels female moths in Spodoptera littoralis from oviposition, the role of frass volatiles on larval foraging behavior is largely unknown. Here, we show that larvae of S. littoralis walk upwind to larval frass volatiles in a wind tunnel assay. We identified the frass volatile guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) as key ligand for the S. littoralis odorant receptor (OR) SlitOr59 which we expressed heterologously. We isolated guaiacol-producing bacteria identified as Serratia marcescens from frass of larvae that were fed on cotton, and Enterobacter cloacae, E. ludwigii and Klebsiella sp. from frass derived from cabbage-fed larvae. In addition to guaiacol, we also identified volatiles acetoin, 3-methyl-1-butanol and dimethyl disulfide, in large proportions in headspace collections from the bacteria. A Y-tube olfactometer assay showed that fourth instar S. littoralis larvae are attracted to guaiacol. Moreover, cotton leaves treated with the insecticide Spinosad and guaiacol were highly attractive to the larvae. Our results provide a basis for management of the pest by directly targeting larvae, based on an attract-and-kill strategy. Further studies are needed to test the application of guaiacol for semiochemical-based pest management of Spodoptera pest species.

AB  - In this study, the effect of gamma irradiation (10 kGy) on proteins extracted from animal hide, scales, and wool was evidenced by calorimetric (mu DSC) and spectroscopic (IR, circular dichroism, and EPR) methods. Keratin was obtained from sheep wool, collagen and bovine gelatin from bovine hide, and fish gelatin from fish scales. The mu DSC experiments evidenced that gamma irradiation influences the thermal stability of these proteins differently. The thermal stability of keratin decreases, while a resistance to thermal denaturation was noticed for collagen and gelatins after gamma irradiation. The analysis of the IR spectra demonstrated that gamma irradiation determines changes in the vibrational modes of the amide groups that are associated with protein denaturation, most meaningfully in the case of keratin. As evidenced by circular dichroism for all proteins considered, exposure to gamma radiation produces changes in the secondary structure that are more significant than those produced by UV irradiation. Riboflavin has different effects on the secondary structure of the investigated proteins, a stabilizing effect for keratin and fish gelatin and a destabilizing effect for bovine gelatin, observed in both irradiated and non-irradiated samples. The EPR spectroscopy evidences the presence, in the gamma-irradiated samples, of free radicals centered on oxygen, and the increase in their EPR signals over time due to the presence of riboflavin.

AB  - Oxidative stress and membrane damage are believed to be principally involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This study aimed to assess the effects of phenosanic acid (PA), an antioxidant and membrane protector, in acute pentylenetetrazole and chronic lithium-pilocarpine seizure models in male Wistar rats. PA was administered acutely (ip, 120 mg/kg BW ip, or 240 mg/kg BW per os) or chronically (80 mg/kg BW/day per os). Indices of free radical oxidation, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and the nitrergic system were assessed in blood and brain regions. Morphological analysis of the hippocampus was performed in the lithium-pilocarpine model. PA exerted an acute anti-seizure effect in the pentylenetetrazole model. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, acute PA treatment decreased the death rate and corticosterone levels in the neocortex and brainstem. In contrast, the level of free radical oxidation products reacting with thiobarbituric acid declined in the brain stem in response to chronic PA treatment. In the lithium-pilocarpine model, the neuronal density in the dentate gyrus was elevated, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive (PCNA+) cell counts in the subgranular zone did not differ between groups. Doublecortin positive (DCX+) cell count was significantly increased after chronic PA treatment. PA-induced reduction in mortality in the lithium-pilocarpine epilepsy model may be partially mediated by decreasing the lipid peroxidation and corticosterone levels in different brain regions. Chronic PA treatment may affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis by either prolonging the action of factors that increase neurogenesis after status epilepticus or by slowing down the neuronal differentiation rate. These data suggest that PA may be a disease-modifying AED able to hamper epileptogenesis.

AB  - Background: Chronic stress is one of the most important causes of depression, accompanied by neuminflammation and hippocampal injuries. Long-term elevation of glucocorticoid leads to activation of NF-kappa B and inhibition of GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway, which is pivotal for neuroprotection and neumgenesis. The present study thus was designed to determine the relationship between NF-kappa B and GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway.
   Methods: Depressive-like behaviors were induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (GUMS) and chronic restraint stress (CRS) in mice. Corticosterone, inflammatory cytokines, and GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway were determined by ELISA and Western Blot assays. The activation of NF-kappa B and inhibition of GPR39 were connected by bioinformatic analysis and experimentally validated in hippocampus cells by knock-in and knock-down techniques.
   Results: GUMS and CRS led to an elevation of serum corticosterone and depressive-like behaviors in mice, with activation of NF-kappa B subunit p65 in the hippocampus and elevations of TNF alpha and IL-6. The expression of GPR39/ CREB/BDNF pathway in the hippocampus was inhibited. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that four miRNAs, miR96, miR-143, miR-150, and miR-182, were potentially transcribed by NF-kappa B and bound with GPR39 mRNA. NF-kappa B overexpression increased miR-182 expression and decreased GPR39 expression in hippocampus cells. Its inhibitor led to reverse effects. miR-182 mimics or inhibitors also regulated GPR39 expression in hippocampus cells and more importantly, blocked the regulation of NF-kappa B on GPR39.
   Conclusions: The results suggested that activation of NF-kappa B inhibited GPR39/CREB/BDNF pathway through increasing miR-182 in chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. The negative-regulation features of miRNAs might be important for neuroinflammation-induced inhibition of neurofunction in depression.

AB  - Background: In dementia, synaptic dysfunction appears before neuronal loss. Stem cell therapy could potentially provide a promising strategy for the treatment of dementia models. The carbamylated erythropoietin fusion protein (CEPO-Fc) has shown synaptotrophic effects. This study aimed to determine the efficiency of the combined use of hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) and CEPO-Fc in the basal synaptic transmission (BST) and long-term plasticity (LTP) of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) rats.Methods: We divided 64 adult rats into control, sham, CCH+vehicle, CCH+CEPO, CCH+HFSC, and CCH+HFSC+CEPO groups. The CEPO-Fc was injected three times/week for 30 days. HFSC transplantation was done on days 4, 14, and 21 after surgery. The Morris water maze test and passive avoidance were used to assess memory. BST and LTP were assessed by a field-potential recording of the CA1 region. The hippocampal mRNA expression of IGF-1, TGF-beta 1, beta 1-Catenine, NR2B, PSD-95, and GSk-3 beta was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR.Results: Following combination therapy, spatial memory retention, and BST showed significant improvement relative to HFSC and CEPO-Fc groups. These effects were also confirmed by recovered mRNA expression of beta 1catenin, TGF-beta 1, and NR2B. GSK-3 beta expression was downregulated in all treatment groups. The upregulated PSD-95 was identified in HFSC and combination groups compared to the vehicle group.Conclusions: These findings indicate that the combined use of HFSC and CEPO-Fc may be more advantageous for treating memory disruption in the CCH model than CEPO-Fc or HFSC alone. This type of combination therapy may hopefully lead to a new approach to treatment for dementia.

AB  - With the growing popularity of touchscreen cognitive testing in rodents, it is imperative to understand the fundamental effects exposure to this paradigm can have on the animals involved. In this study, we set out to assess hippocampal-dependant learning in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on two highly translatable touchscreen tasks - the Paired Associate Learning (PAL) task and the Trial Unique Non-Matching to Location (TUNL) task. Both of these tests are based on human tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and are sensitive to deficits in both mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Mice were assessed for deficits in PAL at 9-12 months of age, then on TUNL at 8-11 and 13-16 months. No cognitive deficits were evident in APP/PS1 mice at any age, contrary to previous reports using maze-based learning and memory tasks. We hypothesized that daily and long-term touchscreen training may have inadvertently acted as a cognitive enhancer. When touchscreen-tested mice were assessed on the Morris water maze, they showed improved task acquisition compared to naive APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls. In addition, we show that touchscreen-trained WT and APP/PS1 mice show increased cell proliferation and immature neuron numbers in the dentate gyrus compared to behaviorally naive WT and APP/PS1 mice. This result indicates that the touchscreen testing paradigm could improve cognitive performance, and/or mask an impairment, in experimental mouse models. This touchscreen-induced cognitive enhancement may involve increased neurogenesis, and possibly other forms of cellular plasticity. This is the first study to show increased numbers of proliferating cells and immature neurons in the hippocampus following touchscreen testing, and that touchscreen training can improve cognitive performance in maze-based spatial navigation tasks. This potential for touchscreen testing to induce cognitive enhancement, or other phenotypic shifts, in preclinical models should be considered in study design. Furthermore, touchscreen-mediated cognitive enhancement could have therapeutic implications for cognitive disorders.

AB  - ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins mediated by the activity of a variety of ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) enzymes, such as the Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) family of proteins. This PTM is diverse in both form and biological functions, which makes it a highly interesting modification, but difficult to study due to limitations in reagents available to detect the diversity of ADPRylation. Recently we developed a set of recombinant antibody-like ADP-ribose (ADPR) binding proteins using naturally occurring ADPR binding domains (ARBDs), including macrodomains and WWE domains, functionalized by fusion to the constant " Fc " region of rabbit immunoglobulin. Herein, we present an expansion of this biological toolkit, where we have replaced the rabbit Fc sequence with the sequence from two other species, mouse and goat. These new reagents are based on a previously characterized set of naturally occurring ARBDs with known specificity. Characterization of the new reagents demonstrates that they can be detected in a species-dependent manner by secondary immunological tools, recognize specific ADPR moieties, and can be used for simultaneous detection of mono ADPR and poly ADPR at single-cell resolution in various antibody-based assays. The expansion of this toolkit will allow for more multiplexed assessments of the complexity of ADPRylation biology in many biological systems.

AB  - Jesters, butterflies in the genus Symbrenthia Hubner, 1819, comprise 14 species mainly distributed in the Oriental region. Although this genus has attracted the attention of many researchers in the past, its taxonomy and biogeographic history remain unclear. In this study, we investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships inferred from one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear genes (ArgKin, wingless), using both likelihood and Bayesian approaches. With the exception of S. hippalus, which we find to be either sister to Mynes Boisduval, 1832 or sister to Symbrenthia + Mynes + Araschnia, all species of Symbrenthia form a single monophyletic group. We describe a new genus Mynbrenthia Fric & Rindos gen. nov. to accommodate the taxon hippalus. The genus Symbrenthia splits into four sub-groups, "Brensymthia " (with S. niphanda and S. sinoides), "hypselis " (with S. hypselis, S. brabira, S. leoparda and S. doni), "intricata " (with S. intricata and S. hypatia) and "hippoclus " group (including S. platena and a complex of S. hippoclus and S. lilaea). The genus probably originated in Sundaland or continental Asia during the Eocene. The history of the genus Symbrenthia was more influenced by dispersal events and then by subsequent vicariances. Whereas the "hypselis " group colonised the Indo-Australian Archipelago from the Asian continent, the "hippoclus " group dispersed to continental Asia from the Indo-Australian Archipelago.

AB  - Lead (Pb), a pervasive and ancient toxic heavy metal, continues to pose significant neurological health risks, particularly in regions such as Southeast Asia. While previous research has primarily focused on the adverse effects of acute, high-level lead exposure on neurological systems, studies on the impacts of chronic, low-level exposure are less extensive, especially regarding the precise mechanisms linking ferroptosis - a novel type of neuron cell death - with cognitive impairment. This study aims to explore the potential effects of chronic low-level lead exposure on cognitive function and hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis. This research represents the first comprehensive investigation into the impact of chronic low-level lead exposure on hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis, spanning clinical settings, bioinformatic analyses, and experimental validation. Our findings reveal significant alterations in the expression of genes associated with iron metabolism and Nrf2-dependent ferroptosis following lead exposure, as evidenced by comparing gene expression in the peripheral blood of lead-acid battery workers and workers without lead exposure. Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo experimental results strongly suggest that lead exposure may precipitate cognitive dysfunction and induce hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis. In conclusion, our study indicates that chronic low-level lead exposure may activate microglia, leading to the promotion of ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Simple Summary Leaf beetle Ophraella communa is considered an effective biocontrol agent against the common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. However, there are no studies that assess the antennal sensilla and chemosensory proteins expression profiles of O. communa. In this study, the types and morphology of sensilla on the antennae were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that there are six types of sensilla (sensilla trichodea, sensilla chaetica, sensilla basiconica, sensilla styloconica, sensilla coeloconica, and Bohm bristles) distributed on the antennae. We also found that the expression levels of five chemosensory proteins in male and female antennae were higher than those in other tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results lay the foundation for interpreting the olfactory functions of adult O. communa. Ophraella communa is an efficient biocontrol agent used against the invasive weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia. It is an herbivorous insect that feeds on specific plants; the olfactory functions of this insects plays an important role in their search for host plants. There are no reports on O. communa sensilla types, morphology, or chemosensory protein (CSP) genes. In this study, we observed the external structure and distribution of antennal sensilla in adult O. communa antennae by scanning electron microscopy; moreover, we cloned 11 CSPs (CSP1-CSP11) and elucidated their tissue-expression profiles using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Six types of sensilla were identified: sensilla trichodea (including two subtypes), sensilla chaetica, sensilla basiconica (including two subtypes), sensilla styloconica, sensilla coeloconica, and Bohm bristles. Both male and female antennae had all six types of sensilla, and no sexual dimorphism was noted in sensillar types or distribution. We also found that the expression levels of CSP2, CSP3, CSP4, CSP6, and CSP7 in male and female antennae were higher than those in other tissues, which suggests that these five CSPs may be related to olfactory function in O. communa. Ultimately, our results lay the foundation for interpreting the olfactory functions of adult O. communa.

AB  - In order to meet the increasing demands from an exploding human population, sustainable agriculture relies on the availability of crop varieties with high yields and optimal defenses to pests. However, ample work has suggested that domesticated plants could have reduced defenses at the expense of increased biomass or yield, and these potential trade-offs can vary among plant species and genotypes. Herbivory coping mechanisms such as tolerance and resistance can be expressed differently among plant genotypes, with variable relationships and inherent fitness costs. Knowledge of the connection between growth and defense mechanisms in cultivated plants is still limited, especially in tropical crops and is needed to guide theories on plant defenses and crop improvement efforts. Using twenty Sorghum bicolor landraces from the tropics, we evaluated genetic variation in growth and defense measures in response to herbivory from Chilo partellus, a major pest of S. bicolor. Specifically, we tested for trade-offs among tolerance and resistance and their association to growth traits. We found significant genetic differences among landraces in terms of their growth, tolerance, and constitutive resistance to herbivory. There was no apparent trade-off between tolerance and resistance, suggesting that it is possible to enhance both defense strategies in S. bicolor. There were contradictory results in terms of potential growth costs associated with constitutive and induced resistance, and tolerance to C. partellus. Landraces with higher resistance and tolerance had lower biomass, but at the same time had a higher number of stems. Future efforts should be directed at understanding the genetic source of resistance and tolerance, and their inclusion for crop improvement.

AB  - In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the pivotal role of host plants in shaping the intricate interactions between herbivorous insects and their pathogens. Recent decades have seen a surge in studies that demonstrate that host plants are crucial drivers of the interactions between insects and pathogens, providing novel insights into the direct and indirect interactions that shape tri-trophic interactions. These studies have built on a wide range of pathogens, from viruses to bacteria, and from protozoans to fungi. We summarise these studies, and discuss the mechanisms of plant-mediated insect resistance to infection, ranging from the toxicity of plant chemicals to pathogens to enhancement of anti-pathogen immune responses, and modulation of the insect's microbiome. Although we provide evidence for the roles of all these mechanisms, we also point out that the majority of existing studies are phenomenological, describing patterns without addressing the underlying mechanisms. To further our understanding of these tri-trophic interactions, we therefore urge researchers to design their studies to enable them specifically to distinguish the mechanisms by which plants affect insect susceptibility to pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the meat industry, inefficient management of organic waste exists, therefore the study aims to evaluate different bovine and poultry organic residues as food substrates during larval development of the black soldier fly, such as a sustainable alternative to obtain high protein meal.
   METHODS: The research evaluates the use of organic waste from cattle and poultry slaughterhouses, as food substrate for black soldier fly larvae, including raw beef blood T1, raw beef viscera T2, cooked beef blood T3, cooked beef viscera T4, raw chicken viscera T6 and cooked chicken viscera T7; further, as a control measure balanced feed (7 treatments and 5 replicates). Larvae were fed for 5 days and processed to make meal by drying and grinding; evaluating mortality, weight, size, proximal chemical composition, and apparent digestibility to determine the most viable substrate, analyzing effects and significance by multifactorial ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis.
   FINDINGS: The results show Mortality (F = 917,81, p < 0,0001): T1 y T3 with 76,40 +/- 2,86 (%) (F = 917,81, p <0,0001), following T6 with 69,67 +/- 4,55%, T7 with 24,00 +/- 3,48%, T2 with 4,60 +/- 1,92 %, T5 y T4, both with 4,20 +/- 2,00%. Weight (F = 825,62, p < 0,0001): T2 with 1,78 +/- 0,22 gram outperformed the control T5 (1,76 +/- 0,50 gram), T4 with 1,45 +/- 0,06 g and T7 with 1,66 +/- 0,07 gram. Size (F = 248,95, p <0,0001): T5 with 16,03 +/- 0,34 m m, T2 with 15,86 +/- 0,22 mm, T4 with 14,72 +/- 0,35 mm and finally, 14,51 +/- 0,14 millimeter in T7. Proximal chemical analysis of crude protein and fat: T2 resulted in the following results 50,81 % and 21,88 %, T4 with 53,90% y 15,04%, T7 with 42,63 % and 32,03%, and T5 con 41,1 % and 19.55%, respectively. Digestibility: T5 with 20,39%, T2 with 12,66%, T4 with 10,61% and T7 with 5,97%. T2 raw beef viscera were determined to be the most viable substrate, followed by T4 cooked beef viscera and T7 cooked chicken viscera.
   CONCLUSION: Testing the effectiveness of cattle viscera as substrate, the experimental data presented may help design a process for an effective treatment method for slaughterhouse waste, which might benefit developing nations in managing their waste effectively, generating high protein meal, with the potential for a circular bioeconomy.

AB  - Social isolation (SI) stress is increasingly recognized as a concern, associated with detrimental effects on mood and emotional well-being. Myelin Transcription Factor 1 (MyT1) is known for its pivotal role in nervous system development and mood regulation. This study delves into the potential of MyT1 to mitigate SI-induced behavioral abnormalities in mice. Utilizing a chronic SI model involving neonatal and post-weaning SI, male and female mice were subjected to lentiviral overexpression of MyT1 specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A battery of behavioral assessments, including novelty-suppressed feeding, sucrose preference, sucrose splash, tape grooming, tail suspension, and forced swim tests, revealed notable antidepressant-like effects in both sexes upon MyT1 overexpression. Enhanced MyT1 expression corresponded with increased feeding initiation, sucrose preference, and self-grooming, alongside decreased immobility time. Importantly, the upregulation of MyT1 was accompanied by a significant reduction in cortical synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) level. These findings underscore the involvement of MyT1 in mitigating SI-induced depression-like behavior. Moreover, the observed alterations in behavior are closely associated with changes in cortical Syt1 expression, suggesting its potential role as a target for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying mood disorders induced by SI. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay between MyT1 and cortical function in modulating responses to SI, paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions targeting these pathways.

AB  - Seasonal changes in peripheral inflammation are well documented in both humans and animal models, but seasonal changes in neuroinflammation, especially the impact of seasonal lighting environment on neuroinflammation remain unclear. To address this question, the present study examined the effects of environmental lighting conditions on neuroinflammation in a diurnal rodent model, Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). Male and female grass rats were housed in either bright (brLD) or dim (dimLD) light during the day to simulate a summer or winter light condition, respectively. After 4 weeks, microglia markers Iba-1 and CD11b, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, were examined in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and dorsal hippocampus (dHipp). The results revealed that winter-like dim light during the day leads to indicators of increased neuroinflammation in a brain site- and sex-specific manner. Specifically, relatively few changes in the neuroinflammatory markers were observed in the ACC, while numerous changes were found in the BLA and dHipp. In the BLA, winter-like dimLD resulted in hyper-ramified microglia morphology and increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, but only in males. In the dHipp, dimLD led to a higher number and hyper-ramified morphology of microglia as well as increased expression of CD11b and TNF-alpha, but only in females. Neuroinflammatory state is thus influenced by environmental light, differently in males and females, and could play a role in sex differences in the prevalence and symptoms of psychiatric or neurological disorders that are influenced by season or other environmental light conditions.

AB  - Neuronal K(v)7/Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q (KCNQ) potassium channels underlie M-current that potently suppresses repetitive and burst firing of action potentials (APs). They are mostly heterotetramers of K(v)7.2 and K(v)7.3 subunits in the hippocampus and cortex, the brain regions important for cognition and behavior. Underscoring their critical roles in inhibiting neuronal excitability, autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 2 (KCNQ2) and Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 3 (KCNQ3) genes are associated with benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE) in which most seizures spontaneously remit within months without cognitive deficits. De novo mutations in KCNQ2 also cause epileptic encephalopathy (EE), which is characterized by persistent seizures that are often drug refractory, neurodevelopmental delay, and intellectual disability. Heterozygous expression of EE variants of KCNQ2 is recently shown to induce spontaneous seizures and cognitive deficit in mice, although it is unclear whether this cognitive deficit is caused directly by K(v)7 disruption or by persistent seizures in the developing brain as a consequence of K(v)7 disruption. In this study, we examined the role of K(v)7 channels in learning and memory by behavioral phenotyping of the KCNQ2(+/-) mice, which lack a single copy of KCNQ2 but dos not display spontaneous seizures. We found that both KCNQ2(+/-) and wild-type (WT) mice showed comparable nociception in the tail-flick assay and fear-induced learning and memory during a passive inhibitory avoidance (IA) test and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Both genotypes displayed similar object location and recognition memory. These findings together provide evidence that heterozygous loss of KCNQ2 has minimal effects on learning or memory in mice in the absence of spontaneous seizures.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether antler fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increases mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle strength in vitro and in vivo. LAB from a strain library were grown in antler extract agar at the Yakult Central Research Institute of Korea. Isolated LAB, named Lactobacillus curvatus HY7602, were used to ferment antlers. Analysis of the effects of fermented antler (FA) revealed that it enhanced the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), signaling pathway and mitochondrial metabolic activity in mouse skeletal myotube (C2C12) cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of non-fermented antler (NFA) and FA on exercise performance in C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that HY7602-FA increased treadmill exercise capacity and forced swimming endurance. Furthermore, blood markers associated with muscle fatigue, endurance, and energy supply (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, creatine kinase, and lactate) in the FA-intake group were lower than in the NFA-intake group. In addition, the expression index of genes associated with muscle protein synthesis, and with mitochondrial energy production and supply, in muscle tissue was remarkably higher in the FA group than in the control and NFA groups. Taken together, these results suggested that HY7602-FA may be an effective functional food and health supplement.

AB  - Inflammatory responses have been shown to induce hyperglycemia, yet the underlying mechanism is still largely unclear. GLP-1 is an important intestinal hormone for regulating glucose homeostasis; however, few studies have investigated the influence of digestive tract Salmonella infection on enteroendocrine L cell secretions. In this study, we established a model of Salmonella-infected piglets by oral gavage in order to analyze the effects of Salmonella infection on enteroendocrine L cell function. Furthermore, in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered to STC-1 cells to clarify its direct effect on GLP-1 secretion. The results showed that significantly increased blood glucose in the group of Salmonella-infected piglets was observed, and Salmonella infection decreased blood GLP-1 content. Then, ileal epithelium damage was observed by histological detection, and this was further verified by TUNEL staining. We identified activation of TLR signaling demonstrating up-regulated expressions of TLR4 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Kappa B). Furthermore, it was shown that Salmonella induced pyroptosis of enteroendocrine L cells and enhanced the secretion of IL-1 beta through augmenting gene and protein expressions of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxyl-terminal CARD (ASC), Caspase 1, and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Meanwhile, in vitro LPS treatment induced the pyroptosis of STC-1 cells and reduced the secretion of GLP-1. Altogether, the results demonstrated that Salmonella infection can reduce secretion of GLP-1 by inducing pyroptosis of intestinal L cells, which may eventually result in hyperglycemia. The results provided evidence for the cause of hyperglycemia induced by inflammation and shed new light on glucose homeostasis regulation.

AB  - IntroductionDespite half a century of research on vitamin D (Vit. D), its link to substance abuse and dependence has only been discussed in recent decades. Evidence also shows the involvement of Vit. D in the evolution of dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an increase in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, and the regulation of dopaminergic processes. The novel idea for this work is taken from a hypothesis given about the effectiveness of Vit. D on dopamine signaling pathway. It is therefore presumed that Vit. D can be considered an effective therapeutic approach for narcotic addiction and substance abuse. MethodsThe animals were assigned into six groups (control, vehicle, Morphine [Mor.], and Vit. D [250, 500, and 1000 IU/kg, i.p.]). Following each conditioning session in a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, the animals received Vit. D. Afterward, the locomotor activity of the animals was assessed using open-field apparatus. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiol, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured in the brain. The relative DRD2 and GDNF expressions (%) were also measured in the hippocampus. ResultsVit. D administration after Mor. caused a significant increase in the place preference index in the acquisition phase (p < .05). Vit. D altered the oxidation/antioxidation profiles (CAT, SOD, MDA, NO, TAC, and Thiol). Vit. D was more effective than Mor. in the expression of GDNF (p < .0001); however, in the expression of DRD2, this was only the case for 1000 IU Vit. D (p < .0001). ConclusionsConsidering the increased place preference index induced by Mor., it can be concluded that Vit. D interacts via the oxidative pathway and DRD2-GDNF signaling to potentiate the Mor. effect.

AB  - Simple Summary Traditional treatment protocols for piglets suffering from iron deficiency anaemia are currently lacking from both cost, labour and welfare perspectives. Dietary iron supplements during the suckling phase are problematic due to variable habituation to creep feed consumption. Maternal flavour conditioning may resolve this variability. This study evaluated the role of anise flavoured, iron supplemented creep, with or without maternal anise conditioning on the iron status and growth performance of piglets. Anise flavoured, iron supplemented creep achieved comparable haemoglobin and body weight status to groups receiving an iron injection. These findings merit further evaluation of iron-fortified creep feed as a supplementary strategy for piglets.Abstract Iron injections are vital but imperfect against iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). This experiment explored the effects on piglets of maternal flavour conditioning and the voluntary intake of anise flavoured, iron-supplemented creep feed compared with iron injections. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement: +/- maternal exposure to dietary anise flavour and +/- intramuscular injections of piglets. Twenty-three sows and their litters (242 piglets) were randomly allocated to one of four treatments (n = 5 or 6 per treatment): no flavour plus no injection (NF + NI); no flavour plus iron injection (NF + I); flavour plus no injection (F + NI); and flavour plus iron injection (F + I). All piglets could access anise flavoured, iron-supplemented creep feed (organic and inorganic forms) from D2 of birth. Sow feed intake and milk anethole concentration, piglet body weight (BW) and average daily gain (ADG), creep feed disappearance, piglet behavioural time budgets, and piglet blood glucose and haemoglobin concentrations were determined. Over the four-week study, the only significant differences found were that iron-injected piglets had reduced blood glucose (p = 0.036) on D14 and that maternal flavour provision increased the frequency of piglet creep feed interaction (p = 0.023) and decreased the frequency of suckling events (p = 0.009). In summary, maternal flavour conditioning reduced piglet creep feed neophobia without influencing consumption. The supplementation of creep feed with iron and anise flavour to piglets under the conditions of this trial was effective in preventing IDA, regardless of exposure to maternal flavouring conditioning.

AB  - During a 2018 antimicrobial resistance surveillance of Escherichia coli isolates from diarrheal calves in Xinjiang Province, China, an unexpectedly high prevalence (48.5%) of fosfomycin resistance was observed. This study aimed to reveal the determinants of fosfomycin resistance and the underlying transmission mechanism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening showed that all fosfomycin-resistant E. coli carried the fosA3 gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and southern blot hybridization revealed that the 16 fosA3-positive isolates belonged to four different PFGE patterns (i.e., A, B, C, D). The fosA3 genes of 11 clonally related strains (pattern D) were located on the chromosome, while others were carried by plasmids. Whole-genome and long-read sequencing indicated that the pattern D strains were E. coli O101:H9-ST10, and the pattern C, B, and A strains were O101:H9-ST167, O8:H30-ST1431, and O101:H9 with unknown ST, respectively. Among the pattern C strains, the bla(CTX-M-14) gene was colocalized with the fosA3 gene on the F18:A-:B1 plasmids. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (cgSNPs) showed that the O101:H9-ST10 strains were closely related to a Australian-isolated Chroicocephalus-origin E. coli O101:H9-ST10 strain producing CTX-M-14 and FosA3, with a difference of only 11 SNPs. These results indicate possible international dissemination of the high-risk E. coli clone O101:H9-ST10 by migratory birds.

AB  - Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression by modulating synaptic structural remodeling and functional transmission. Previously, we have demonstrated that the ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) presents a novel antidepressant-like effect via BDNF-TrkB signaling in the hippocampus of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-exposed mice. However, the underlying mechanism through which Rb1 counteracts stress-induced aberrant hippocampal synaptic plasticity via BDNF-TrkB signaling remains elusive.
   Methods: We focused on hippocampal microRNAs (miRNAs) that could directly bind to BDNF and are regulated by Rb1 to explore the possible synaptic plasticity-dependent mechanism of Rb1, which affords protection against CUMS-induced depression-like effects.
   Results: Herein, we observed that brain-specific miRNA-134 (miR-134) could directly bind to BDNF 3'UTR and was markedly downregulated by Rb1 in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed mice. Furthermore, the hippocampus-targeted miR-134 overexpression substantially blocked the antidepressant-like effects of Rb1 during behavioral tests, attenuating the effects on neuronal nuclei-immunoreactive neurons, the density of dendritic spines, synaptic ultrastructure, long-term potentiation, and expression of synapse-associated proteins and BDNF-TrkB signaling proteins in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed mice.
   Conclusion: These data provide strong evidence that Rb1 rescued CUMS-induced depression-like effects by modulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity via the miR-134-mediated BDNF signaling pathway. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ObjectivePrenatal stress (PS) is a problematic situation resulting in psychological implications such as social anxiety. Ubiquitous extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) have been confirmed as a potential physiological stressor; however, useful neuroregenerative effect of these types of electromagnetic fields has also frequently been reported. The aim of the present study was to survey the interaction of PS and ELF-EMF on anxiety-like behavior. MethodA total of 24 female rats 40 days of age were distributed into four groups of 6 rats each: control, stress (their mothers were exposed to stress), EMF (their mothers underwent to ELF-EMF), and EMF/stress (their mothers concurrently underwent to stress and ELF-EMF). The rats were assayed using elevated plus-maze and open field tests. ResultsExpressions of the hippocampus GAP-43, BDNF, and caspase-3 (cas-3) were detected by immunohistochemistry in Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Anxiety-like behavior increased in all treatment groups. Rats in the EMF/stress group presented more serious anxiety-like behavior. In all treatment groups, upregulated expression of cas-3 was seen in PFC, DG, and CA1 and downregulated expression of BDNF and GAP-43 was seen in PFC and DG and the CA1. Histomorphological study showed vast neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and PFC. ConclusionThe results showed ,female rats that underwent PS or/and EMF exhibited critical anxiety-like behavior and this process may be attributed to neurodegeneration in PFC and DG of the hippocampus and possibly decreased synaptic plasticity so-called areas.

This is important because of the connections between the vestibular system and the hippocampus area. However, there is ongoing debate over the role of the vestibular system in developing spatial abilities. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) across three planes and spatial abilities. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 50 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 with normal stress levels and mental health and no neurological, audiological, or vestibular complaints. The Trail-Making Test (TMT) Forms A and B for the assessment of executive functions, the DVA test battery for the evaluation of visual motor functions, and the Virtual Morris Water Maze Test (vMWMT) for the assessment of spatial learning and spatial memory were performed. All participants also underwent the Benton Face Recognition Test (BFRT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Tests (DSST) to assess their relation with spatial memory. Results: DVA values in horizontal (H-DVA), vertical (V-DVA), and sagittal (S-DVA) planes ranged from (-0.26) to 0.36 logMAR, (-0.20) to 0.36 logMAR, and (-0.28) to 0.33 logMAR, respectively. The latency of three planes of DVA was affected by vMWMT (Horizontal, Vertical, and Sagittal; Estimate: 22.733, 18.787, 13.341, respectively p < 0.001). Moreover, a moderately significant correlation was also found, with a value of 0.571 between the Virtual MWM test and BFRT and a value of 0.539 between the DSST (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Spatial abilities in healthy adults were significantly influenced by dynamic visual functions across horizontal, vertical, and sagittal planes. These findings are expected to trigger essential discussions about the mechanisms that connect the vestibular-visual system to the hippocampus. The original vMWMT protocol is likely to serve as a model for future studies utilizing this technology.

AB  - Simple Summary Retrospective CCTV footage was analysed by trained observers to assess the welfare of horses co-slaughtered with a conspecific present or slaughtered individually, restrained or unrestrained. Co-slaughtered horses were found to move around the kill pen more but were less likely to slip/fall in the pen. Both individually slaughtered horses and loose (unrestrained) horses were more likely to show agitated behaviour and resist entry to the pen, with unrestrained horses also showing increased agonistic behaviour towards abattoir personnel. Horses showed affiliative behaviour towards each other when co-slaughtered, with the shooting of the first horse seldom eliciting a startled response from the second horse. This study shows that enabling abattoirs to co-slaughter unrestrained horses could minimise stress and maximise both human safety and horse welfare. The results of this study are relevant on a wider scale, with countries across the world slaughtering high numbers of unhandled or semi-feral horses, and encourage further research to guide welfare improvements in this area. Current legislation in the United Kingdom stipulates that horses should not be slaughtered within sight of one another. However, abattoir personnel anecdotally report that, for semi-feral horses unused to restraint, co-slaughtering alongside a conspecific could reduce distress through social buffering and improve safety, but there is a lack of evidence to support this. CCTV footage from an English abattoir was assessed retrospectively with welfare indicators from when horses entered the kill pen until they were killed. Of 256 horses analysed, 12% (32/256) were co-slaughtered (alongside a conspecific) and 88% (224/256) individually. Co-slaughtered horses moved more in the pen, but individually slaughtered horses showed more agitated behaviour, required more encouragement to enter the kill pen, and experienced more slips or falls. Unrestrained horses (40%; 102/256) showed increased agitation, movement, and agonistic behaviour towards the operator and resisted entry to the kill pen compared to restrained horses (60%; 154/256). Positive interactions between conspecifics were seen in 94% (30/32) of co-slaughtered horses, and only 6% (1/16) showed a startled response to the first horse being shot, with a median time of 15 s between shots. This study highlights the impact that both conspecific and human interactions can have on equine welfare at slaughter. Semi-feral or unrestrained horses appear to experience increased distress compared to horses more familiar with human handling, and the presence of a conspecific at slaughter mitigated this.

AB  - This study compared the effects of embryonic and neonatal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) exposure (E-LPS and N-LPS) on oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation in the hippocampus of male rats and explored the protective effect of the antioxidant alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ). Using SD rats, LPS exposure occurred either intraperi-toneally in dams between gestational days 15 and 16 (50 mu g/kg body weight/time) or in male pups on postnatal day (PND) 3 (1 mg/kg body weight). Under both regimens, AGIQ at 0.5% (w/w) was supplemented, to dams from the gestation period (before LPS exposure) until weaning on PND 21 and to male offspring from weaning until PND 77 (adulthood). Compared with a control treatment, E-LPS treatment resulted in fewer NG2+ OL progenitor cells (OPCs) and an upregulation of Tcf4 at PND 6; by PND 21, low NG2+ OPC number persisted, but OLIG2+ OL lineage cells increased, while CNPase+ mature OLs counts were unchanged. By contrast, N-LPS treatment resulted in fewer OLIG2+ cells and an upregulation of Bmp4 at PND 6; by PND 21, NG2+ OPCs decreased, while GFAP+ astrocytes increased at both PND 6 and 21. After N-LPS treatment, Kl and Yy1 were downregulated and there were fewer Klotho+ and CNPase+ cells at PND 21. Results suggest that E-LPS treatment facilitates OPC differentiation into pre-and immature OLs until weaning, while N-LPS treatment suppresses OPC differentiation into mature OLs but facilitates astrocyte generation; however, these changes spontaneously recovered by adulthood under both regimens. AGIQ treatment ameliorated the effects of LPS treatment of both regimens, suggesting that LPS-induced disruption of OPC/OL differentiation occurs via neuroinflammation.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that occurs following exposure to somatic or psychotic trauma. Physical activity is known to improve symptoms of certain neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the role of exercise on acquired PTSD-like phenotype was not examined. The present study investigated the effects of prior moderate treadmill exercise on anxiety-like behaviors, serum corticosterone and BDNF levels, hippocampal BDNF and mRNA expression of apoptotic -related proteins in the single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of PTSD in rats. Male and female rats underwent a regular treadmill exercise regimen (4 weeks, 5 days per week). Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging <0.05 to <0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging <0.05 to <0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

AB  - Hypoxic stress occurs in various physiological and pathological states, such as aging, disease, or high-altitude exposure, all of which pose a challenge to many organs in the body, necessitating adaptation. However, the exact mechanisms by which hypoxia affects advanced brain function (learning and memory skills in particular) remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxic stress on hippocampal function. Specifically, we studied the effects of the dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation using global proteomics. First, we found that hypoxic stress impaired cognitive and motor abilities, whereas it caused no substantial changes in the brain morphology or structure of mice. Second, bioinformatics analysis indicated that hypoxia affected the expression of 516 proteins, of which 71.1% were upregulated and 28.5% were downregulated. We demonstrated that mitochondrial function was altered and manifested as a decrease in NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 4 expression, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species generation, resulting in further neuronal injury. These results may provide some new insights into how hypoxic stress alters hippocampal function via the dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

AB  - Herbivore insects deploy salivary effectors to manipulate the defense of their host plants. However, it remains unclear whether small RNAs from insects can function as effectors in regulating plant-insect interactions. Here, we report that a microRNA (miR29-b) found in the saliva of the phloem-feeding whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) can transfer into the host plant phloem during feeding and fine-tune the defense response of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. We show that the salivary gland-enriched BtmiR29-b is produced by BtDicer 1 and released into tobacco cells via salivary exosomes. Once inside the plant cells, BtmiR29-b hijacks tobacco Argonaute 1 to silence the defense gene Bcl-2-associated athanogene 4 (NtBAG4). In tobacco, NtBAG4 acts as the positive regulator of phytohormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), enhancing plant defense against whitefly attacks. Interestingly, we also found that miR29-b acts as a salivary effector in another Hemipteran insect, the aphid Myzus persicae, which inhibits tobacco resistance by degrading NtBAG4. Moreover, miR29-b is highly conserved in Hemiptera and across other insect orders such as Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, and Blattaria. Computational analysis suggests that miR29-b may also target the evolutionarily conserved BAG4 gene in other plant species. We further provide evidence showing BtmiR29-b-mediated BAG4 cleavage and defense suppression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Taken together, our work reveals that a conserved miR29-b effector from insects fine-tunes plant SA- and JA-mediated defense by cross-kingdom silencing of the host plant BAG4 gene, providing new insight into the defense and counter-defense mechanisms between herbivores and their host plants.

AB  - The brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens) is a piercing-sucking insect pest specific to rice plants and may cause severe declines in rice yields. Therefore, it is of great theoretical significance and practical application value to elucidate the molecular mechanism of rice resistance to BPH. Previous studies have shown that an ethylene (ET) signaling pathway gene, OsEBF1, positively regulates BPH resistance in rice. OsEBF1 is an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of another ET pathway gene, OsEIL1. OsEBF2 is the homologous gene of OsEBF1, and the sequence identity between the two genes is 78.5%. Our results indicated that OsEBF2 can directly interact with OsEIL1 and positively regulate rice resistance to BPH. More importantly, there were no obvious differences in agronomic traits between WT and OsEBF2OE transgenic lines. The resistance mechanism of the OsEBF2 gene may be to reduce the content of ET in rice by inhibiting the expression of ethylene response factor genes. This study revealed that OsEBF2 is an F-box protein that positively regulates the rice resistance to BPH and can be used as an effective target gene for rice BPH resistance breeding.

AB  - The phytohormones ethylene (ET) and jasmonate (JA) regulate plant development, growth, and defense responses; however, the molecular basis for their signaling crosstalk is unclear. Here, we show that JA-ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which repress JA signaling, repress trichome initiation/branching and anthocyanin accumulation, and inhibit the transcriptional activity of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-MYB members (GLABRA3 (GL3)-GL1 and TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8)-MYB75) of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB (WBM) complexes. The ET-stabilized transcription factors ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) were found to bind to several members of WBM complexes, including GL3, ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), TT8, GL1, MYB75, and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1). This binding repressed the transcriptional activity of the bHLH-MYB proteins and inhibited anthocyanin accumulation, trichome formation, and defenses against insect herbivores while promoting root hair formation. Conversely, the JA-activated bHLH members GL3, EGL3, and TT8 of WBM complexes were able to interact with and attenuate the transcriptional activity of EIN3/EIL1 at the HOOKLESS1 promoter, and their overexpression inhibited apical hook formation. Thus, this study demonstrates a molecular framework for signaling crosstalk between JA and ET in plant development, secondary metabolism, and defense responses.

AB  - High oil residue camelina meal (HORM) was included in low fish meal, low fish oil diets for juvenile Atlantic salmon at a dietary inclusion level of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 g/kg to determine the effect of diet on growth performance, carcass composition, morphology and inflammatory biomarker gene expression in the distal intestine. Diets were fed to Atlantic salmon (mean weight +/- standard deviation: 2.3 +/- 0.1 g/fish; 50 fish/40 L tank; 3 tanks/treatment) for 16 weeks. Salmon fed 0, 20 and 40 g/kg HORM had significantly higher weight gain, growth rate, protein efficiency, and lower feed conversion ratio, than salmon fed 60, 80 and 100 g/kg HORM. Distal intestinal morphology showed lamina propria were wider in salmon fed 60 g/kg HORM, compared with salmon fed the other dietary treatments. Transcript expression of the distal intestine showed significant differential expression across treatments, as determined by qPCR. IL17Ar and GILT1 were down-regulated 1.3- to 1.5-fold in salmon fed 80 and 100 g/kg HORM, compared with 0 g/kg HORM. Nfkb2 was also down-regulated in salmon fed 40, 80 and 100 g/kg HORM, compared with the control treatment. The transcript encoding thioredoxin was 1.9-fold upregulated in salmon fed 100 g/kg HORM compared with 0, 20 and 40 g/kg HORM-fed groups. This study finds that inclusion of dietary HORM at 20 and 40 g/kg results in acceptable growth. In general, transcript expression of some inflammation-relevant genes responded to dietary HORM; however, further research is needed to determine whether the higher levels of HORM (>= 60 g/kg) are associated with inflammation and detrimental to fish health.

AB  - Recent research in the southern Central Balkans has resulted in the discovery of the first Middle Paleolithic sites in this region. Systematic excavations of Velika and Mala Balanica, and Pesturina (southern Serbia) revealed assemblages of Middle Paleolithic artifacts associated with hominin fossils and animal bones. This paper focuses on Pesturina Layer 4, radiometrically and biostratigraphically dated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, which yielded traces of temporary hunting camps. The remains of large ungulate prey are associated with predominantly Quina-type artifacts made of quartz. Artifacts from Pesturina Cave have no parallels at Mousterian sites in the Balkans but are rather similar to the Central European Charentian, which demonstrates that this cultural unit was widespread during MIS 5, not only in the southern Pannonian Basin but also in the Central Balkans. The position of the site - on the outskirts of the known spread of the Quina model of techno-economic behavior during MIS 5 - raises several questions related to population movements, residential mobility, and technological variability in the early Middle Paleolithic of Central and Southeast Europe.

AB  - Polystyrene micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) are globally recognized environmental concerns due to their widespread pollution and detrimental effects on physiological functions. However, the neurotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms of MPs/NPs on brain function in adolescents remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the effects of polystyrene MPs/NPs on neurobehavioral function in adolescent mice, utilizing multiomic analysis and molecular biology assays to explore potential mechanisms. Following oral exposure of MPs (5 mu m) or NPs (0.5 mu m) at 0.5 mg/day for 4 weeks, NPs induced more severe cognitive impairment in mice than MPs, as assessed by the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. This impairment might be associated with the neuron loss and neurogenesis inhibition caused by NPs, while dendritic spine loss mediated by MPs in the hippocampus. Furthermore, analysis of hippocampal transcriptome and Western blotting indicated the potential involvement of the PI3K/AKT pathway in NPs-induced neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, exposure to NPs induced more pronounced disruptions in the hippocampal metabolome and gut microbiota, and strong correlations were observed between changes in hippocampal metabolites and gut bacteria. This study elucidated the toxicity mechanism of MPs and NPs in inducing cognitive impairment in adolescent mice, providing insights into their toxicological impacts and potential strategies for intervention.

AB  - In agroecosystems, plants are constantly exposed to attack from diverse herbivorous insects and microbes, and infestation with one species may change the plant defense response to other species. In our investigation of the relationships among rice plants, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (St & aring;l) and the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, we observed a significant increase in the resistance of rice treated with rice blast to N. lugens, as evidenced by improved plant survival rates in a small population resistance study. Subsequent transcriptome data analysis revealed that the rice blast fungus can induce the expression of genes in the jasmonic acid (JA) and flavonoid pathways. Similar to the flavonoid pathway, the JA pathway also contains 2 types of genes that exhibit similar and opposite trends in response to N. lugens and rice blast. Among these genes, the osjaz1 mutant and the osmyc2 mutant were phenotypically confirmed to positively and negatively regulate rice resistance to N. lugens and rice blast, respectively. Subsequent mass spectrometry and quantification experiments showed that the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can induce the accumulation of eriodictyol, naringenin and quercetin, as well as the expression of OsF3H, Os4CL5 and OsCHI in the flavonoid pathway. This suggests a close connection between the JA pathway and the flavonoid pathway. However, OsF3'H, which negatively regulates rice resistance to N. lugens and rice blast, did not show increased expression. Phenotypic and molecular experiments confirmed that OsMYC2 can bind to and inhibit the expression of OsF3'H, thus revealing the mechanism of rice resistance to N. lugens after treatment with rice blast. These findings will deepen our understanding of the interactions among rice, N. lugens and rice blast.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is a disabling disease with the number of affected individuals increasing each year. Current antidepressant treatments take between three to six weeks to be effective with forty percent of patients being resistant to treatment, making it necessary to search for new antidepressant treatments. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, given intravenously, induces a rapid antidepressant effect in humans. In mice, it causes increased neurogenesis and antidepressant-like effects. However, it also produces psychomimetic effects in humans and in rodents increases the locomotor activity. In contrast, melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland and synthesized in extrapineal sites, increases new neuron formation and causes antidepressant-like effects in adult rodents with no collateral effects. Here, we assessed the effects of a non-effective dose of ketamine in combination with melatonin (KET/MEL), both on neurogenesis as well as on the antidepressant-like effect in mice. Our results showed that KET/MEL combination increased neurogenesis and produced antidepressant-like effects without altering locomotor activity after both single and triple administration protocols. Our data strongly suggest that KET/MEL combination could be used to simultaneously promote neurogenesis, reverting neuronal atrophy and inducing antidepressant-like effects.

AB  - BackgroundA growing body of evidence suggests that inflammation and changes in glutamate neurotransmission are two pathophysiological mechanisms underlying depression. Electroacupuncture (EA) is a common therapeutic tool for the treatment of depression. However, the potential antidepressant mechanism of EA remains obscure. The change of the kynurenine pathway (KP) is the research priority of antidepressant mechanisms. This study will investigate the role of EA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior and explore its possible mechanism of action. MethodsLipopolysaccharide was used to induce depression-like behavior, and EA was given at Hegu (L14) and Taichong (LR3) acupoints in C57BL/6J mice. Depression-like behaviors were measured by behavioral tests, including tail suspension test (TST), sucrose preference test (SPT), force swim test (FST), and open field test (OFT). The levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and KP enzyme IDO1 were measured by qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed to detect the content of prefrontal cortex and hippocampal as well as serum glutamate, tryptophan (TRP), kynurenic (KYN), and quinolinic acid (QA). ResultsThe results showed that (1) as evidenced by increased spontaneous locomotor activities, decreased immobility duration, and a stronger preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, EA reversed LPS-challenged depressive-like behavior. (2) EA at L14 and LR3 decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited IDO1, and regulated KP metabolisms, as well as lowered the concentration of glutamate. (3) EA may exert anti-depression effects by acting on the kynurenine pathway. ConclusionThis study evaluated the effects of EA on depression-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its regulation of inflammation and the glutamatergic system. Our results suggest that EA can ameliorate depression-like behaviors, lower the level of inflammation, and reduce the release of glutamate, possibly through the regulation of the kynurenine pathway in the brain.

AB  - In bony vertebrates, skeletal mineralization relies on the secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (Scpp) family whose members are acidic extracellular proteins posttranslationally regulated by the Fam20 degrees C kinase. As scpp genes are absent from the elephant shark genome, they are currently thought to be specific to bony fishes (osteichthyans). Here, we report a scpp gene present in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) that evolved from local tandem duplication of sparc-L 5' exons and show that both genes experienced recent gene conversion in sharks. The elasmobranch scpp is remarkably similar to the osteichthyan scpp members as they share syntenic and gene structure features, code for a conserved signal peptide, tyrosine-rich and aspartate/glutamate-rich regions, and harbor putative Fam20 degrees C phosphorylation sites. In addition, the catshark scpp is coexpressed with sparc-L and fam20 degrees C in tooth and scale ameloblasts, similarly to some osteichthyan scpp genes. Despite these strong similarities, molecular clock and phylogenetic data demonstrate that the elasmobranch scpp gene originated independently from the osteichthyan scpp gene family. Our study reveals convergent events at the sparc-L locus in the two sister clades of jawed vertebrates, leading to parallel diversification of the skeletal biomineralization toolkit. The molecular evolution of sparc-L and its coexpression with fam20 degrees C in catshark ameloblasts provides a unifying genetic basis that suggests that all convergent scpp duplicates inherited similar features from their sparc-L precursor. This conclusion supports a single origin for the hypermineralized outer odontode layer as produced by an ancestral developmental process performed by Sparc-L, implying the homology of the enamel and enameloid tissues in all vertebrates.

AB  - Human Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator network that controls organ development and has been implicated in various cancers. Transcriptional enhanced associate domain-4 (TEAD4) is the final nuclear effector of Hippo pathway, which is activated by Yes-associated protein (YAP) through binding to two separated YAP regions of alpha 1-helix and Omega-loop. Previous efforts have all been addressed on deriving peptide inhibitors from the YAP to target TEAD4. Instead, we herein attempted to rationally design a so-called 'YAP helix(alpha 1)-trap' based on the TEAD4 to target YAP by using dynamics simulation and energetics analysis as well as experimental assays at molecular and cellular levels. The trap represents a native double-stranded helical hairpin covering a specific YAP-binding site on TEAD4 surface, which is expected to form a three-helix bundle with the alpha 1-helical region of YAP, thus competitively disrupting TEAD4-YAP interaction. The hairpin was further stapled by a disulfide bridge across its two helical arms. Circular dichroism characterized that the stapling can effectively constrain the trap into a native-like structured conformation in free state, thus largely minimizing the entropy penalty upon its binding to YAP. Affinity assays revealed that the stapling can considerably improve the trap binding potency to YAP alpha 1-helix by up to 8.5-fold at molecular level, which also exhibited a good tumor-suppressing effect at cellular level if fused with TAT cell permeation sequence. In this respect, it is considered that the YAP helix(alpha 1)-trap-mediated blockade of Hippo pathway may be a new and promising therapeutic strategy against cancers.

AB  - Cetaceans, well-known for their exceptionally long lifespans and substantial body masses, demonstrate a lower risk of cancer mortality compared to other mammals, consistent with Peto's paradox. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of cancer resistance, possibly evolved due to large body size, remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an evolutionary analysis of 50 cell cycle-related genes, which play crucial role in both cancer progression and organismal body mass modulation, to investigate the mechanisms underlying the trade-off between body size and cancer resistance in cetaceans. We found that 66.7% (4/6) rapidly evolving genes (i.e. CDK2, CDT1, ORC3, and DBF4) and 50% (2/4) positively selected genes (ORC2 and ORC3) identified in cetaceans are involved in regulating cell cycle checkpoints, which halt the cell cycle in response to damage to allow repair and prevent cancer induction. Additionally, we identified four-body mass-associated genes (CCNE1, ORC5, E2F3, and DBF4) known to regulate cell growth; mutations or dysregulation of these genes can drive uncontrolled proliferation and cancer development. Interestingly, convergent evolution was observed in the African elephant and the bowhead whale at the tumor suppressor gene MYT1, potentially revealing a convergent mechanism of cancer resistance in large-bodied species. Notably, in vitro assays revealed that a cetacean-specific mutation M155T in the rapidly evolving gene CCND1 more effectively suppressed tumor cell proliferation and migration. Overall, our study has provided new insights into how the evolution of cell cycle-related genes balances body mass and cancer resistance in cetaceans, offering molecular support for Peto's paradox.

AB  - Key message Jasmonate-induced accumulation of anti-herbivore compounds mediates rice resistance to the leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis. The rice leaf folder (LF), Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, is one of the most destructive insect pests in the paddy field. LF larvae induces leaf folding and scrapes the upper epidermis and mesophyll tissues reducing photosynthesis and yield in rice. Identifying plant defense pathways and genes involved in LF resistance is essential to understand better this plant-insect interaction and develop new control strategies for this pest. Jasmonate (JA) signaling controls a plethora of plant defenses against herbivores. Using RNA-seq time series analysis, we characterized changes in the transcriptome of wild-type (WT) leaves in response to LF damage and measured the dynamics of accumulation of JA phytohormone pools in time-course experiments. Genes related to JA signaling and responses, known to mediate resistance responses to herbivores, were induced by LF and were accompanied by an increment in the levels of JA pools in damaged leaves. The accumulation of defense compounds such as phenolamides and trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI) also increased after LF infestation in WT but not in JA mutant plants impaired in JA biosynthesis (aoc-2) and signaling (myc2-5). Consistent with all these responses, we found that LF larvae performed better in the JA mutant backgrounds than in the WT plants. Our results show that JA signaling regulates LF-induced accumulation of TPI and phenolamides and that these compounds are likely an essential part of the defense arsenal of rice plants against this insect pest.

AB  - Estrogens, particularly 17 beta-estradiol (estradiol, E-2), regulate memory formation. E2 acts through its intracellular receptors, estrogen receptors (ER) ER alpha and ER beta, as well as a recently identified G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). Although the effects of E2 on memory have been investigated, studies examining the effects of GPER stimulation are scarce. Selective GPER agonism improves memory in ovariectomized female rats, but little information is available regarding the effects of GPER stimulation in male rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the GPER agonist, G1, on consolidation and reconsolidation of inhibitory avoidance (IA) and object recognition (OR) memory in male rats. Animals received vehicle, G1 (15, 75, 150 mu g/kg; i.p.), or the GPER antagonist G15 (100 mu g/kg; i.p.) immediately after training, or G1 (150 mu g/kg; i.p.) 3 or 6 h after training. To investigate reconsolidation, G1 was administered immediately after IA retention Test 1. Results indicated that G1 administered immediately after training at the highest dose enhanced both OR and IA memory consolidation, while GPER blockade immediately after training impaired OR. No effects of GPER stimulation were observed when G1 was given 3 or 6 h after training or after Test 1. The present findings provide evidence that GPER is involved in the early stages of memory consolidation in both neutral and emotional memory tasks in male adult rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND Apoptosis activation is an essential research to reveal the triggering mechanism of flesh quality deterioration. This study was aimed at explaining apoptotic mechanism of postmortem fish in terms of caspases activation, cytochrome c (cyt-c) release, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl2-associated X (Bax) protein levels, transcriptional levels of its molecules, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation at 4 degrees C for 5 days. RESULTS Activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-3 and the release of mitochondrial cyt-c were observed during storage. The decreased Bcl-2 protein levels, increased Bax protein expressions and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were major steps for inducing apoptosis. Collectively, transcriptional regulation of Fas ligand (FasL), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) indicated that extrinsic apoptotic pathways (FasL/caspase-8/caspase-3) and intrinsic pathway [(JNK and p38 MAPK)/(Bcl-2, Bax and Mcl-1)/cyt-c/Apaf-1/caspase-9/caspase-3] were involved in apoptotic process. Mitochondrial AIF translocation to nuclear indicated that AIF mediated caspase-independent pathway. CONCLUSION Therefore, transcriptional and translational alterations of multiple signaling molecules acted important roles in regulating apoptosis activation in postmortem process.

AB  - Introduction Most living marine organisms have a biphasic life cycle dependent on metamorphosis and settlement. These critical life-history events mean that a developmentally competent larva undergoes a range of coordinated morphological and physiological changes that are in synchrony with the ecological transition from a pelagic to a benthonic lifestyle. Therefore, transition from a pelagic to a benthonic habitat requires multiple adaptations, however, the underlying mechanisms regulating this process still remains unclear. Epigenetic regulation and specifically DNA methylation, has been suggested to be particularly important for organisms to adapt to new environments. Seahorses (Family Syngnathidae, Genus Hippocampus) are a fascinating group of fish, distinguished by their unique anatomical features, reproductive strategy and behavior. They are unique among vertebrate species due to their "male pregnancy", where males nourish developing embryos and larvae in a brood pouch until hatching and parturition occurs. After birth, free-swimming offspring are pelagic and subsequently they change into a demersal lifestyle. Therefore, to begin to address the question whether epigenetic processes could be involved in the transition from a planktonic to a benthonic lifestyle observed in seahorses, we studied global DNA methylation profiles in a tropical seahorse species (Hippocampus reidi) during postnatal development and settlement. Results We performed methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) along with quantitative expression analysis for genes suggested to be involved in the methylation machinery at six age groups: 1, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days after male's pouch release (DAR). Results revealed that the H. reidi genome has a significantly different DNA methylation profile during postnatal development and settlement on demersal habitats. Moreover, gene expression analysis showed up- and down-regulation of specific DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) encoding genes. Conclusion Our data show that the differences in the DNA methylation patterns seen among developmental stages and during the transition from a pelagic to a benthonic lifestyle suggest a potential for epigenetic regulation of gene expression (through DNA methylation) in this species. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms could be necessary for seahorse settlement. Nevertheless, if these epigenetic mechanisms come from internal or if they are initiated via external environmental cues should be further investigated.

AB  - Simple Summary Habituation to deterrent plant compounds has been found in generalist and specialist insect herbivores. The rate at which plant-feeding insects habituate and at which sensitivity of taste neurons detecting deterrents changes has not been compared among closely related species. The generalist Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) and the specialist Helicoverpa assulta (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) differ strongly in degree of host-plant specialism. Both species habituated to the alkaloid strychnine after dietary exposure; however, the specialist H. assulta displayed habituation to strychnine faster (at 48 h) than the generalist H. armigera (at 72 h). Electrophysiological recordings from taste sensilla on mouthparts revealed that a deterrent-sensitive neuron in the medial sensillum styloconicum of both species displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to the deterrent that coincided in time with the onset of habituation. Our findings show that physiological changes in taste neuron sensitivity coincide with habituation to plant compounds that are initially avoided. The two closely related moth species, Helicoverpa armigera and H. assulta differ strongly in their degree of host-plant specialism. In dual-choice leaf disk assays, caterpillars of the two species that had been reared on standard artificial diet were strongly deterred by the plant-derived alkaloid strychnine. However, caterpillars of both species reared on artificial diet containing strychnine from neonate to the 5th instar were insensitive to this compound. Fifth instar caterpillars of H. assulta and 4th or 5th instars of H. armigera not exposed to strychnine before were subjected to strychnine-containing diet for 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, or 72 h. Whereas H. assulta displayed habituation to strychnine after 48 h, it took until 72 h for H. armigera to become habituated. Electrophysiological tests revealed that a deterrent-sensitive neuron in the medial sensillum styloconicum of both species displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to strychnine that correlated with the onset of habituation. We conclude that the specialist H. assulta habituated faster to strychnine than the generalist H. armigera and hypothesis that desensitization of deterrent-sensitive neurons contributed to habituation.

AB  - The maize leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a specialist herbivore that develops on maize plants (Zea mays L., Poaceae). Every year, it is responsible for considerable reductions in yields of the maize fields of the Americas, because alongside its direct damages it is also a vector of three relevant plant pathogens. The transmitted diseases come to have a high incidence, resulting in significant yield losses, thereby forcing farmers and technicians to attempt a tight control of the fields mostly using non-specific insecticides. Decision support systems based on mathematical models may be valuable in helping to reduce the use of agrochemicals in this regard, as they can provide a projection of the future situation based on past and present data. With this precondition, this work aims to apply and validate a physiologically based model to describe populations of D. maidis developing in two experimental fields located in Argentina, which are characterised by different climatic conditions. Experimentation in the two fields involved a 3-year survey during the growing seasons 2009, 2010, and 2011, where the adult populations of maize leafhoppers were monitored from the sowing of maize plants to the end of the phenological stage at which they are most susceptible to D. maidis activity. Results showed a good response of the model in describing maize leafhopper populations, also allowing the possibility of setting a threshold for intervention and a projection of the situation if any control action is applied.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) availability and loss risk are linked to P species; however, their alternations in the soil amended with biochar-blended organic fertilizer is not well known, particularly under contrasting soil properties and land management. In this study, the variance of soil P species extracted by sequential chemical extraction (SCE) and 31P NMR techniques, as well as the degree of P saturation (DPS), were investigated throughout three paddy and three vegetable fields. These fields were amended with three different fertilizers at the same P application rate: chemical fertilizer (CF), organic fertilizer substitution (sheep manure/biogas slurry, SM/BS), and biochar-blended organic fertilizer substitution (BSM/BBS). Results showed that the BSM/BBS and SM increased the total P contents by 7.5% and 5.9% (TP) and available P contents by 30.1% and 19.2% (AP), but decreased the DPS values by 19.4% and 11.7%, compared to the CF treatment. Yet, the BS decreased the TP and AP contents but increased the DPS values across the experimental sites. In the BSM/BBS amended soils, high AP contents were due to the increased inorganic P (NaHCO3-Pi), while the increased organic P (monoester and DNA) induced low DPS values and reduced soil P loss risk. Our study highlights that biochar-blended organic fertilizer is an effective agronomic way for improving P availability and decreasing P loss risk via the alteration of soil P species.

AB  - Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), the two-spotted spider mite, is a pest that limits strawberry production in Mexico. Little is known about the interactions that occur between T. urticae and healthy strawberry plants or strawberry plants infested by conspecific spider mites. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the attraction of T. urticae to healthy strawberry plants mediated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and to plants damaged by conspecifics mediated by herbivore-induce plant volatiles (HIPVs). First, we conducted dual-choice tests using a Y-tube olfactometer with plants and extracts obtained through dynamic aeration. The volatile composition of the extracts was identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Once the compounds were identified, we also conducted dual-choice tests with selected synthetic compounds. Tetranychus urticae exhibited greater attraction to both healthy and damaged plants compared to the control (clean air). However, when healthy and damaged plants were offered simultaneously, there was no significant preference observed. Bioassays with extracts obtained by dynamic aeration yielded similar results. The identified compounds were terpenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. We found qualitative and quantitative changes between the VOCs emitted by the healthy plant and the HIPVs from mite-damaged plants. The individual compounds alpha-pinene (10 ng), pseudocumene (10 ng), and limonene (1 ng) and 10 ng of the blend made of alpha-pinene + pseudocumene + mesitylene + limonene (5:34:57:4) attracted more T. urticae than the control. However, the binary blend of pseudocumene + limonene (91:9) was more attractive than the other binary or three-compound blends evaluated. These results may contribute to developing strategies for the management of this pest.

AB  - Different types of insect feeding can activate distinct plant resistance mechanisms and trigger the generation of specific volatile compounds. Transcriptomic changes and the genomic basis underlying plant defense in response to chewing herbivores or phloem-feeding insects have been relatively well investigated, while better insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the plant defense response, in particular, volatile emissions triggered by sap-feeding insects such as the green plant bug Apolygus lucorum is needed. Here, we monitored transcriptomic and volatile metabolomic changes in cotton over time during A. lucorum infestation. RNA-seq analysis showed that 1614 transcripts were differentially expressed (log(2)|Ratio| >= 1; q <= 0.05) in cotton leaves infested by A. lucorum. All differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in jasmonic acid (JA; 48 genes) and salicylic acid (SA; 5 genes) pathways were upregulated, highlighting a central role of JA in A. lucorum-induced signaling without attenuating the SA pathway. Moreover, all DEGs (30 genes) involved in herbivore-induced volatile biosynthesis were upregulated. Consistently, A. lucorum-induced cotton volatile blends and synthetic methyl salicylate significantly attracted the parasitoid Peristenus spretus. The present data indicated that cotton plants after A. lucorum infestation undergo rapid, extensive transcriptome reprogramming mediated by complex signaling networks in which the JA and SA pathways act synergistically, leading to a specific volatile profile involved in an indirect plant defense.

AB  - The current research aimed to evaluate the potential of Gynura procumbens (G. procumbens) as forage by evaluating its growth, yield, nutritional characteristics, and palatability which were cultivated from different-position stem cutting. The experiments were laid out under completely randomized design. The treatments were three positions of cutting stem: top (P1), middle (P2), and bottom (P3), with 50 replications. The observed parameters were the growth (morphological cutting stem, plant height, the number of leaves, and branches), yield (forage biomass), then the composite sample from all treatments was analyzed for nutrient composition, in vitro digestibility, phytochemical content, and palatability. Data were analyzed statistically using R i386 3.6.1 through analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Tukey contrast test was conducted to determine the level of significant differences among different treatments. The results showed that there were differences in cutting stem diameter and weight from different positions (P <= 0.05). The cutting stem on top position increased the number of branches, plant height, and forage biomass (P <= 0.01; P <= 0.05), yet the number of leaves had no different effects. G. procumbens plant growth had different patterns on the number of leaves and branches and plant height. The crude protein, ash, and digestibility in leaves were higher than in the stalk. The degree of palatability was higher for cattle and goats. It was concluded from this study that the best position to induce G. procumbens plant growth was the top stem-cutting and its yield could be utilized as forage from leaves and stems based on the in vitro digestibility, forage biomass, nutritional characteristics, and palatability.

AB  - Heat stress can impair organismal growth by inducing ubiquitination, proteasome-mediated degradation, and subsequent cellular damage. Vitamin C (VC) has been shown to potentially mitigate the detrimental effects of abiotic stresses on cells. Nevertheless, the impact of heat stress on growth plate chondrocytes remains unclear, and the underlying protective mechanisms of VC in these cells warrant further investigation. In this study, we focused on pig thoracic vertebral chondrocytes (PTVCs) that are crucial for promoting the body's longitudinal elongation and treated them with 41 degrees C heat stress for 24 h, under varying concentrations of VC. Our findings reveal that, while oxidative stress induced by heat triggers apoptosis and inhibits the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway, the addition of VC alleviates heat-stress-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, mitigates cell cycle arrest, and promotes cellular viability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VC enhances the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis pathway by promoting the expression of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, which thereby stabilizes the ubiquitin-mediated degradation machinery, alleviates the apoptosis, and enhances cell proliferation. Our results suggest the involvement of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway in the effects of VC on PTVCs under heat stress, and offer a potential strategy to make use of VC to ensure the skeletal growth of animals under high temperature pressures in summer or in tropical regions.

AB  - One of the most promising areas in Kazakhstan at present is the production of feed additives based on plant materials with mineral components. This article describes the use of a feed additive made from green plant materials obtained by growing the traditional cereal crop Hordeum vulgare (barley) from the family Poaceae, and the non-traditional fodder crop Rumex confertus (sorrel) from the family Polygonaceae, with the addition of locally produced montmorillonite and additional ingredients - calcium phosphate, potassium iodide and urea, which are necessary for metabolic processes in a growing organism and improve the nutritional qualities of milk and meat. The effect of a combination of plant components with the addition of mineral additives on the biochemical parameters of young sheep is shown. A significant (2-3 times) increase in concentration of protein, glucose, cellular enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and urea was noted, which may indicate a high calorie content of the additive and the absence of factors contributing to pathological deviations in the development of animals.

AB  - The tea aphid Toxoptera aurantii Boyer (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a destructive pest that infests tea plants. The resistance mechanisms of the tea plant against T. aurantii infestation are largely unexplored. This study investigates the defensive response of tea plants to T. aurantii feeding using an aphid-resistant Camellia sinensis cultivar 'Qiancha1' (QC1) and an aphid-susceptible C. sinensis cultivar 'Huangjinya' (HJY). Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses were conducted on 4 samples: QCCK (T. aurantii non-infested QC1), HJYCK (T. aurantii non-infested HJY), QC24 (T. aurantii-infested QC1 for 24 h), and HJY24 (T. aurantii-infested HJY for 24 h). The results showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in the 2 comparison groups (QCCK vs. QC24 and HJYCK vs. HJY24) were primarily enriched in metabolic pathways, including hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. Following aphid infestation, the resistant cultivar QC1 exhibited more DEGs and DAMs than the susceptible cultivar HJY, indicating a stronger response to T. aurantii feeding stress. Additionally, the expression of phenylpropanoid- and flavonoid-related genes (CYP, 4CL, FLS, F3H, and LAR) was significantly upregulated in the resistant cultivar QC1 compared with that in the susceptible cultivar HJY. Metabolites involved in phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathways, such as p-coumaroyl-CoA, caffeoylquinic acid, and feruloyl-CoA, were exclusively induced in QC1. These findings suggest that phenylpropanoid/flavonoid pathways play pivotal roles in tea plant resistance to T. aurantii infestation, providing valuable insights for the breeding and utilization of resistant germplasms.

AB  - Insects have to obtain sterols from food due to the inability to synthesize this essential nutrient de novo. For lepidopteran insects, they can convert a variety of phytosterols into cholesterol to meet their growth needs. The final step of the cholesterol biosynthesis is the metabolism of desmosterol catalyzed by 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24). In this study, we identified a DHCR24 homolog in the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, designated as H. armigera 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (HaDHCR24)-1. The quantitative expression analyses indicated that HaDHCR24-1 was highly enriched in the midgut where dietary sterol uptake occurs. Compared to the control, the DHCR24-1 mutant larvae generated by clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 technology accumulated more desmosterol in the gut, while the content of cholesterol was significantly reduced. A similar phenomenon was observed when the DHCR24 inhibitor, amiodarone, was applied to the insects. Moreover, DHCR24-1 played an important role for the usage of beta-sitosterol, a major sterol in plants, in H. armigera, and loss of function of DHCR24-1 resulted in higher mortality on beta-sitosterol. However, the DHCR24 homolog does not necessarily exist in the genomes of all insects. The loss of this gene occurred more frequently in the insects feeding on animals, which further support the role of DHCR24-1 in using phytosterols. This gene may have important potential in developing new strategies to control herbivory pests in Lepidoptera and other insect orders.

AB  - Insect herbivores assess plants by integrating responses elicited by a variety of external and internal cues and signals mediated by physical and chemical traits. We investigated host assessment behaviours of adult females of the Eucalyptus-feeding psyllid, Glycaspis brimblecombei Moore (Hemiptera: Aphalaridae), on 10 species and subspecies (comprising preferred and non-preferred hosts) using video recordings, electrical penetration graph (EPG) technology, and histological examination of tissues surrounding secondary veins. Our video recordings indicated that the shortest first searching time (mean 7.5 s) occurred on preferred hosts. Females placed on novel (non-preferred) hosts jumped off leaves in <10 s. We found that host acceptance occurred surprisingly rapidly after stylet penetration, e.g., between 7 and 11 s on preferred eucalypts, suggesting a strong role for gustatory cues. Our histological studies provided no evidence of physical barriers to phloem access. Females produced eight EPG waveforms, as observed for other psyllids and aphids, but the durations of PG (xylem activity) and PE2 (phloem ingestion), in particular, were unlike those recorded for any other hemipteran. On preferred hosts, phloem ingestion represented 21.5% (mean duration 4 h 18 min) of individual feeding bouts, whereas on non-preferred hosts, there was almost no ingestion from phloem. Xylem ingestion on non-preferred hosts represented 20.1% (mean duration 4 h 1 min) of feeding bouts, presumably to imbibe water. Thus, contrary to widespread belief, female G. brimblecombei did not feed exclusively from phloem even on preferred hosts, but also regularly ingested from the xylem. This is surprising considering that nymphs construct lerps consisting of approximately 16% sugars, and suggests that adults feed from phloem for shorter periods than offspring. Rapid assessment of hosts could also mean that positive stimuli induced by sugars are opposed by negative gustatory stimuli experienced in non-vascular tissues. The most likely source of such stimuli are water-soluble polyphenolic compounds that are widespread in cell vacuoles.

AB  - 1. The herbivorous flea beetles (Chrysomelidae: Alticini) have evolved a masquerading strategy by hiding among their own feeding damage. Similarities between beetle bodies and their feeding damage may act as a defence that reduces detection by visual predators. 2. We analyse the evolutionary origin of flea beetles' camouflage using the French fauna (284 species) as a case study. We assess two competing hypotheses: (H1) the type of leaf tissue is the primary determinant of the colour and size of beetle species feeding on them, because each type of leaf tissue may have a tendency to result in a particular type of damage or, (H2) the morphological characteristics of the beetle explain the damage pattern, because beetle species evolve strategies to produce feeding damage that matches its own characteristics. 3. We assessed bipartite networks of feeding interactions (beetle species and host plants). Beetle-host interactions were non-randomly distributed and highly modular, with more than 25% of the network modules showing beetle colour and size distributions significantly different from null expectations. 4. Our results suggest that the evolutionary origin of flea beetles masquerading can be partially explained by both hypotheses. Some host plants seem to restrict feeding damage appearance on their leaves, favouring the survival of specific beetles with matching colour and size (H1). However, in most plant taxa, it is suggested, the existence of beetle-associated constraints exert a selective pressure for the beetle to damage leaves in a particular way, similar to its own colour and size (H2).

AB  - Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neuromodulator that has been implicated in multiple roles across the brain, including the central auditory system, where it sets neuronal excitability and gain and affects plasticity. In the cerebral cortex, subtypes of GABAergic interneurons are modulated by ACh in a subtype-specific manner. Subtypes of GABAergic neurons have also begun to be described in the inferior colliculus (IC), a midbrain hub of the auditory system. Here, we used male and female mice (Mus musculus) that express fluorescent protein in cholinergic cells, axons, and boutons to look at the association between ACh and four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells that differ in their associations with extracellular markers, their soma sizes, and their distribution within the IC. We found that most IC cells, including excitatory and inhibitory cells, have cholinergic boutons closely associated with their somas and proximal dendrites. We also found that similar proportions of each of four subtypes of GABAergic cells are closely associated with cholinergic boutons. Whether the different types of GABAergic cells in the IC are differentially regulated remains unclear, as the response of cells to ACh is dependent on which types of ACh receptors are present. Additionally, this study confirms the presence of these four subtypes of GABAergic cells in the mouse IC, as they had previously been identified only in guinea pigs. These results suggest that cholinergic projections to the IC modulate auditory processing via direct effects on a multitude of inhibitory circuits.

AB  - Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), widely grown in India, suffers significant yield losses due to pod borers (Helicoverpa armigera and Maruca vitrata). Therefore, studying the host resistance mechanism is pivotal for crop improvement. In this study, we conducted transcriptome analysis on two wild-type (WT) Cajanus scarabaeoides accessions (ICP15761 and ICP-15738) having high levels of resistance to pod borers and two cultivated C. cajan genotypes, ICPL332 (moderately resistant) and ICPL-87 (susceptible), following simulated herbivory with H. armigera oral secretions (OS). Differential gene expression analysis identified 3573 and 4677 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ICP-15761 and ICP-15738, whereas 4149 and 3639 DEGs were documented in ICPL-332 and ICPL-87, respectively. Genes related to chloroplast biogenesis, photosynthesis, and chlorophyll metabolism exhibited significant differential expression, indicating chloroplast reprogramming under simulated herbivory. Significant upregulation of key defense genes, including chitinases and cysteine proteases, in C. scarabaeoides accessions highlighted robust defense pathway activation. A genotype-specific shift in transcription factors, phytohormones, and calcium signaling-related gene expression was noted. Higher levels of expression of aspartic proteinases and pathogenesis-related proteins in cultivated genotypes suggesting adaptive evolutionary traits. This is a novel insight on molecular mechanism of defense in a wild type, C. scarabaeoides and cultivated genotypes of pigeon pea under simulated herbivory. The information on cytosolic and organellar gene changes in pigeon pea due to H. armigera OS mediated-simulated herbivory may help develop pigeon pea varieties that are resistant to pod borer infestations.

AB  - Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) act as key signal transduction enzymes in plants, especially in response to diverse stresses, including herbivory. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the CDPK gene family in upland cotton revealed that GhCPKs are widely expressed in multiple cotton tissues and respond positively to various biotic and abiotic stresses. We developed a strategy for screening insect- resistance genes from a CRISPR-Cas9 mutant library of GhCPKs. The library was created using 246 single-guide RNAs targeting the GhCPK gene family to generate 518 independent T0 plants. The average target-gene coverage was 86.18%, the genome editing rate was 89.49%, and the editing heritability was 82%. An insect bioassay in the field led to identification of 14 GhCPK mutants that are resistant or susceptible to insects. The mutant that showed the clearest insect resistance, cpk33/74 (in which the homologous genes GhCPK33 and GhCPK74 were knocked out), was selected for further study. Oral secretions from Spodoptera litura induced a rapid influx of Ca2+ in cpk33/74 leaves, resulting in a significant increase in jasmonic acid content. S-adenosylmethionine synthase is an important protein involved in plant stress response, and protein interaction experiments provided evidence for interactions of GhCPK33 and GhCPK74 with GhSAMS1 and GhSAM2. In addition, virus-induced gene silencing of GhSAMS1 and GhSAM2 in cotton impaired defense against S. litura. This study demonstrates an effective strategy for constructing a mutant library of a gene family in a polyploid plant species and offers valuable insights into the role of CDPKs in the interaction between plants and herbivorous insects.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play key roles in plant-plant communication, especially in response to pest attack. E-2-hexenal is an important component of VOCs, but it is unclear whether it can induce endogenous plant resistance to insects. Here, we show that E-2-hexenal activates early signaling events in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mesophyll cells, including an H2O2 burst at the plasma membrane, the directed flow of calcium ions, and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. Treatment of wildtype Arabidopsis plants with E-2-hexenal increases their resistance when challenged with the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L., and this phenomenon is largely lost in the wrky46 mutant. Mechanistically, E-2-hexenal induces the expression of WRKY46 and MYC2, and the physical interaction of their encoded proteins was verified by yeast two -hybrid, firefly luciferase complementation imaging, and in vitro pulldown assays. The WRKY46-MYC2 complex directly binds to the promoter of RBOHD to promote its expression, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter, yeast one -hybrid, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This module also positively regulates the expression of E-2hexenal-induced naringenin biosynthesis genes (TT4 and CHIL) and the accumulation of total flavonoids, thereby modulating plant tolerance to insects. Together, our results highlight an important role for the WRKY46-MYC2 module in the E-2-hexenal-induced defense response of Arabidopsis, providing new insights into the mechanisms by which VOCs trigger plant defense responses.

AB  - Second-generation antipsychotics are the drugs of choice for the treatment of neurodevelopmental-related mental diseases such as schizophrenia. Despite the effectiveness of these drugs to ameliorate some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, specifically the positive ones, the mechanisms beyond their antipsychotic effect are still poorly understood. Second-generation antipsychotics are reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroplastic properties. Using the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (nVHL) in the rat, an accepted schizophrenia-related model, we evaluated the effect of the second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine (OLZ) in the behavioral, neuroplastic, and neuroinflammatory alterations exhibited in the nVHL animals. OLZ corrected the hyperlocomotion and impaired working memory of the nVHL rats but failed to enhance social behavior disturbances of these animals. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), OLZ restored the pyramidal cell structural plasticity in the nVHL rats, enhancing the dendritic arbor length, the spinogenesis and the proportion of mature spines. Moreover, OLZ attenuated astrogliosis as well as some pro-inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptosis-related molecules in the PFC. These findings reinforce the evidence of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neurotrophic mechanisms of second-generation antipsychotics in the nVHL schizophrenia-related model, which allows for the possibility of developing more specific drugs for this disorder and thus avoiding the side effects of current schizophrenia treatments.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Byrsonima fagifolia Niedenzu (Malpighiaceae) and other Byrsonima species are popularly employed in Brazilian traditional medicine in the form of preparations as cicatrizing, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial.
   Aim of the study: To characterize the phytochemical profile of the hydromethanolic extract obtained from B. fagifolia leaves (BF extract) and to evaluate the toxicity and the antifungal activity.
   Materials and methods: The compounds from BF extract were isolated by HPLC and the structures were elucidated based on extensive analyses of 1D and 2D NMR spectra (HMQC, HMBC and COSY) data. The antifungal effect was determined by the broth microdilution method and the toxicity was evaluated on erythrocytes from sheep's blood and Galleria mellonella larvae.
   Results: Phytochemical investigation of the BF extract led to the isolation and characterization of pyrogallol, n-butyl gallate, 3,4-di-O-galloylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-galloylquinic acid, 3,4,5-tri-O-galloylquinic acid, and 1,3,4,5-tetra-O-galloylquinic acid. The BF extract showed high content of galloylquinic acid derivatives reaching more than twenty-times the quercetin derivatives content, according to the quantification by HPLC. These galloylquinic acid derivatives, obtained during this study, and quercetin derivatives, previously isolated, were submitted to the antifungal assays. The BF extract inhibited yeast growth mainly against Cryptococcus spp., at concentrations of 1-16 mu g/mL, comparable to isolated compounds galloylquinic acid derivatives. However, the quercetin derivatives as well as quinic acid, gallic acid, and methyl gallate showed lower antifungal effect compared with galloylquinic derivatives. In addition, the BF extract had no hemolytic effect and no toxicity on G. mellonella.
   Conclusion: The phytochemical analysis revealed that galloylquinic acid derivatives are the major compounds in the leaves of B. fagifolia and they are associated to anti-cryptococcal activity and presented reduced toxicity.

AB  - Ceramides (Cers) with alpha-hydroxylated acyl chains comprise about a third of all extractable skin Cers and are required for permeability barrier homeostasis. We have probed here the effects of Cer hydroxylation on their behavior in lipid models comprising the major SC lipids, Cer/free fatty acids (C (16)-C (24))/cholesterol, and a minor component, cholesteryl sulfate. Namely, Cers with (R)-alpha-hydroxy lignoceroyl chains attached to sphingosine (Cer AS), dihydrosphingosine (Cer AdS), and phytosphingosine (Cer AP) were compared to their unnatural (S)-diastereomers and to Cers with non-hydroxylated lignoceroyl chains attached to sphingosine (Cer NS), dihydrosphingosine (Cer NdS), and phytosphingosine (Cer NP). By comparing several biophysical parameters (lamellar organization by X-ray diffraction, chain order, lateral packing, phase transitions, and lipid mixing by infrared spectroscopy using deuterated lipids) and the permeabilities of these models (water loss and two permeability markers), we conclude that there is no general or common consequence of Cer alpha-hydroxylation. Instead, we found a rich mix of effects, highly dependent on the sphingoid base chain, configuration at the alpha-carbon, and permeability marker used. We found that the model membranes with unnatural Cer (S)-AS have fewer orthorhombically packed lipid chains than those based on the (R)-diastereomer. In addition, physiological (R)-configuration decreases the permeability of membranes, with Cer (R)-AdS to theophylline, and increases the lipid chain order in model systems with natural Cer (R)-AP. Thus, each Cer subclass makes a distinct contribution to the structural organization and function of the skin lipid barrier.

AB  - Cytochrome P450s of the CYP79 family catalyze two N-hydroxylation reactions, converting a selected number of amino acids into the corresponding oximes. The sorghum genome (Sorghum bicolor) harbours nine CYP79A encoding genes, and here sequence comparisons of the CYP79As along with their substrate recognition sites (SRSs) are provided. The substrate specificity of previously uncharacterized CYP79As was investigated by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and subsequent transformation of the oximes formed into the corresponding stable oxime glucosides catalyzed by endogenous UDPG-glucosyltransferases (UGTs). CYP79A61 uses phenylalanine as a substrate, whereas CYP79A91, CYP79A93, and CYP79A95 use valine and isoleucine as substrates, with CYP79A93 showing the ability also to use phenylalanine. CYP79A94 uses isoleucine as a substrate. Analysis of 249 sorghum transcriptomes from two different sorghum cultivars showed the expression levels and tissue-specific expression of the CYP79As. CYP79A1 is the committed gene in dhurrin formation and was the highest expressed gene in most tissues/organs. CYP79A61 was primarily expressed in fully developed leaf blades and leaf sheaths. CYP79A91 and CYP79A92 were expressed mainly in roots >200 cm below ground, while CYP79A93 and CYP79A94 were most highly expressed in the leaf collar and leaf sheath, respectively. The possible signalling effects of the oximes and their metabolites produced in different sorghum tissues are discussed.

AB  - The comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) with alcohol use disorders (AUD) is common and there is an association between the serotonin transporter (SERT) genetic variation and the comorbid conditions of GAD and AUD. However, few mechanistic studies have systematically explored the role of direct SERT manipulation in stress-elicited mood disorders. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether reductions in SERT expression in the hippocampus were sufficient to ameliorate anxiety- and ethanol-related behaviors in socially defeated mice. Following stress exposure, and using stereotaxic surgery, SERT was knocked down using specific shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors and anxiety-like behavior was evaluated by open-field, elevated plus maze, and marbles burying test. The two-bottle choice (TBC) drinking paradigm was used to assess stress-induced voluntary ethanol intake and preference. Results showed that hippocampal SERT loss-of-function prevented stress-elicited anxiogenic-like effects with no differences in spontaneous locomotor activity. Moreover, in the TBC paradigm, SERT shRNA-injected mice consistently showed a significantly decreased consumption and preference for ethanol when compared to Mock-injected controls. In contrast to ethanol, SERT shRNA-injected mice exhibited similar consumption and preference for saccharin and quinine. Interestingly, we confirmed that SERT hippocampal mRNA expression correlated with measures of anxiety- and ethanol-related behaviors by Pearson correlation analysis. Our findings show that social defeat recruits hippocampal serotoninergic system and that these neuroadaptations mediate the heightened anxiety-like behavior and voluntary alcohol intake observed following stress exposure, suggesting that this system represents a major brain stress element responsible for the negative reinforcement associated with the "dark side" of alcohol addiction.

AB  - During the transitional period, i.e., during the autumn and spring migrations, the lesser horseshoe bats Rhinolophus hipposiders (Borkhausen, 1797) use transition roosts. In this paper, we try to characterize this type of roost using the example of the basement of an old distillery. The results of many years of monitoring the number of bats (2007-2020), microclimate analysis prevailing in the bat roost, and the dynamics of bat numbers conducted at the turn of 2015/2017 were also presented. During this period, 1 to 13 lesser horseshoe bats were recorded in the roost. Most bats were found in September, October, and April. Bats stayed in the roost at some distance from the inlet, preferring places with a temperature of 10-14oC. Bats were significantly more often found in the central chambers of the basement, chambers number 2 (F = 3.07; p=0.041). However, there was no statistically significant higher intensity (more bats) in the use of the roost (basement) between spring and autumn (F = 1.237, p=0.272). No statistically significant correlation was found between the number of lesser horseshoe bats in the roost and the temperature outside. In this roost, the Brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus (Linnaeus, 1758) was also noted. Results of ringing bats` recapture show that lesser horseshoes bats can be attached to their transition roost and can spend longer periods there. The bat ringed in the transition roost wintered in a cave, 19.5 km away, while they spent the summer in the colony 3 km away.

AB  - Respiratory diseases are a major health concern for lambs, affecting their well-being and growth. Veterinarians need effective methods to diagnose these diseases early to provide better care and reduce antibiotic use. This study highlights the suitability of ultrasound in diagnosing lung diseases in lambs. Traditional methods, such as lung auscultation and clinical examination, are useful but may fail to detect early or hidden infections. Ultrasound allows for earlier and more accurate detection, enabling timely treatment and reduced antibiotic use. This can improve animal welfare, minimize economic losses, and help combat antibiotic resistance. Therefore, veterinarians can adopt ultrasound as a practical and effective tool for improving respiratory disease management in lambs. The ovine respiratory complex significantly affects lamb welfare and production efficiency, necessitating accurate diagnostic methods for pulmonary lesions. This study explores the relationship between clinical scoring, auscultation, ultrasonography, and macroscopic post-mortem evaluation to assess respiratory disease in 111 lambs. A standardized clinical scoring system, adapted from bovine models, evaluated ocular and nasal discharge, head tilt, cough, and rectal temperature. Auscultation categorized pulmonary sounds, while ultrasonography identified lung abnormalities, including B-lines, consolidations, pleural effusion, and abscesses. Macroscopic post-mortem examinations confirmed lesion extent. Kendall-Tau-B correlation coefficient analysis revealed significant associations between the methods (p < 0.01), with a high correlation between auscultation and clinical scoring tau of 0.634 (95% CI: 0.489 to 0.765), auscultation and ultrasonography tau of 0.611 (95% CI: 0.500 to 0.710), and ultrasonography and post-mortem findings tau 0.608 (95% CI: 0.460 to 0.731). While auscultation and clinical scoring provided useful insights, ultrasonography exhibited superior sensitivity in detecting subclinical and early-stage lesions, aligning closely with post-mortem evaluations. These findings emphasize ultrasonography as an effective tool for diagnosing respiratory disease in lambs, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling timely interventions to mitigate disease impact and reduce antimicrobial use.

AB  - During their co-evolution with herbivorous insects, plants have developed multiple defense strategies that resist pests, such as releasing a blend of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that repel pests or recruit their natural enemies. However, the responses of insects to HIPVs in maize (Zea mays L.) are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the Asian corn borer (ACB, Ostrinia furnacalis), a major insect pest of maize, shows a preference for maize pre-infested with ACB larvae rather than being repelled by these plants. Through combined transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis of ACB-infested maize seedlings, we identified two substances that explain this behavior: (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT) and (3E,7E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). DMNT and TMTT attracted ACB larvae, and knocking out the maize genes responsible for their biosynthesis via gene editing impaired this attraction. External supplementation with DMNT/TMTT hampered the larvae's ability to locate pre-infested maize. These findings uncover a novel role for DMNT and TMTT in driving the behavior of ACB. Genetic modification of maize to make it less detectable by ACB might be an effective strategy for developing maize germplasm resistant to ACB and for managing this pest effectively in the field.

AB  - Defensive metabolites and nutrient restriction of host plants are 2 major obstacles to the colonization of insect herbivores. The green peach aphid (GPA) Myzus persicae (Sulzer) broadly colonizes plants with diverse nutritional and defensive traits. However, how GPA adapts to nutritional and defensive traits within different plants remains largely unknown. To elucidate this, we first investigated the performances and transcriptomes of GPA feeding on cabbage Brassica oleracea and pepper Capsicum annuum. The green peach aphid had lower weight and fecundity when feeding on cabbage than on pepper. The transcriptomic analysis found 824 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 13 of the top 20 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways are related to nutrient metabolism, energy metabolism, and detoxification. Specifically, we found 160 DEGs associated with the metabolism of protein and amino acids, sugar and lipids, and xenobiotic substances, 86 upregulated in cabbage-fed GPA. Fourteen cathepsin B genes were strongly upregulated in cabbage-fed GPA, and were enriched in lysosome pathway and 2 dominated gene ontology terms peptidase activity and proteolysis. In addition, cabbage-fed GPA upregulated sugar and lipid digestion, while downregulated lipid biosynthesis processes. Furthermore, 55 metabolic detoxification enzyme genes were differentially expressed between GPA on 2 hosts, and detoxification enzyme activities of GPA indeed changed accordingly to the host. Then, we found that cabbage has lower amino acids nutrition quality for GPA compared to pepper. Our results suggested that adjustment of nitrogen nutrient metabolism, sugar and lipid metabolism, and metabolic detoxification in a host-specific manner play crucial roles in the adaptations of GPA to different host plants.

AB  - Herbivorous insects and host plants have developed a close and complex relationship over a long period of co-evolution. Some plants provide nutrients for insects, but plants' secondary metabolites also influence their growth and development. Urtica cannabina roots and leaves are poisonous, yet Aglais urticae larvae feed on them, so we aimed to clarify the mechanism enabling this interaction. At present, studies on the detoxification mechanism of the A. urticae are rare. In our study, first, we used the A. urticae larval odor selection behavior bioassay and choice feeding preference assay to analyze the feeding preferences of A. urticae on its host plant, U. cannabina. Next, we used transcriptome sequencing to obtain the unigenes annotated and classified by various databases, such as KEGG and GO. In this study, we found that U. cannabina could attract A. urticae larvae to feed via scent, and the feeding preference assay confirmed that larvae preferred U. cannabina leaves over three other plants: Cirsium japonicum, Cannabis sativa, and Arctium lappa. The activity of detoxifying enzymes GST and CarE changed in larvae that had consumed U. cannabina. Furthermore, through transcriptomic sequencing analysis, 77,624 unigenes were assembled from raw reads. The numbers of differentially expressed genes were calculated using pairwise comparisons of all life stages; the expression of detoxification enzyme genes was substantially higher in larvae than in the pupal and adult stages. Finally, we identified and summarized 34 genes associated with detoxification enzymes, such as UDP-glucose 4-epimerase gene, 5 Glutathione S-transferase genes, 4 Carboxylesterase genes, 4 Cytochrome P450 genes, 10 ATP-binding cassette genes, 4 Superoxide dismutase, and Peroxidase. Moreover, we identified 28 genes associated with the development of A. urticae. The qRT-PCR results were nearly consistent with the transcriptomic data, showing an increased expression level of four genes in larvae. Taken together, this study examines the correlation between A. urticae and host plants U. cannabina, uncovering a pronounced preference for A. urticae larvae toward host plants. Consistent with RNA-seq, we investigated the mechanism of A. urticae's interaction with host plants and identified detoxification-related genes. The present study provides theoretical support for studying insect adaptation mechanisms and biological control.

AB  - Simple Summary Mythimna separata and Spodoptera frugiperda are two destructive pests worldwide. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated their sterol metabolic capacity. The results showed that Spodoptera frugiperda required less sterol for normal growth, which helped them survive better when cholesterol was unavailable. Both insects consistently showed high fitness when they fed on cholestanol. Cholestanone enabled most individuals of S. frugiperda to pupate but caused remarkable lethality to M. separata at their early developmental stage. Comparative studies indicated that S. frugiperda was more efficient in converting ketone into available stanol than M. separata. Therefore, they perform differently in terms of their sterol demand and metabolism although these two species are closely related. The divergences in sterol nutritional biology between the two closely related insect species reflect adaptive and evolutive changes in sterol metabolism, which may help us to better understand the potential of using phytosterol-manipulated plants to control pests. Insects are sterol auxotrophs and typically obtain sterols from food. However, the sterol demand and metabolic capacity vary greatly among species, even for closely related species. The low survival of many insects on atypical sterols, such as cholestanol and cholestanone, raises the possibility of using sterol-modified plants to control insect herbivore pests. In this study, we evaluated two devastating migratory crop pests, Mythimna separata and Spodoptera frugiperda, in response to atypical sterols and explored the reasons that caused the divergences in sterol nutritional biology between them. Contrary to M. separata, S. frugiperda had unexpectedly high survival on cholestanone, and nearly 80% of the individuals pupated. Comparative studies, including insect response to multiple diets and larval body sterol/steroids analysis, were performed to explain their differences in cholestanone usage. Our results showed that, in comparison to M. separata, the superiority of S. frugiperda on cholestanone can be attributed to its higher efficiency of converting ketone into available stanol and its lower demand for sterols, which resulted in a better survival when cholesterol was unavailable. This research will help us to better understand insect sterol nutritional biology and the potential of using atypical sterols to control herbivorous insect pests.

AB  - Papilio machaon hippocrates C. Felder et R. Felder, 1864 (Papilionidae) larvae are pests of plants of the family Apiaceae. It is unclear whether Apiaceae plants show induced defensive responses against P. machaon hippocrates larvae, and if so, how these responses are induced. Comparison of the fatty acid (FA) composition of the leaves of host plants and the regurgitant of P. machaon hippocrates larvae by LC-MS revealed a great increase in a-linolenic acid (alpha-LA) in the regurgitant compared with the FAs contained in the leaves. However, specific FA amino acid conjugates, known as elicitor compounds, such as volicitin, were not detected. Sterile host plants (Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk., Apiaceae) were treated with alpha-LA to mimic the damage made by P. machaon hippocrates larvae. After alpha-LA treatment to leaves, induced defensive reactions, i.e., release of volatile compounds such as alpha- and beta-pinene and camphene (possible induced indirect defense) and the accumulation of specialized metabolites such as (R)-falcarinol and bergapten (possible induced direct defense) were observed. These findings highlight the role of alpha-LA in the interaction between P. machaon hippocrates larvae and Apiaceae host plants.

AB  - Modified LDL-induced inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Recent studies have also shown that modified LDL activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to mediate retinal injury. However, the mechanism by which modified LDL activates TLR4 and the potential role of the TLR4 coreceptor myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) are not known. In this study, we inhibited MD2 with the chalcone derivatives L2H17 and L6H21 and showed that MD2 blockade protected retinal Muller cells against highly oxidized glycated-LDL (HOG-LDL)-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. MD2 inhibition reduced oxidative stress by suppressing NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4). Importantly, HOG-LDL activated TLR4 and increased the interaction between NOX4 and TLR4. MD2 was required for the activation of these pathways, as inhibiting MD2 prevented the association of NOX4 with TLR4 and reduced NOX4-mediated reactive oxygen species production and TLR4-mediated inflammatory factor production. Furthermore, treatment of diabetic mice with L2H17 significantly reduced LDL extravasation in the retina and prevented retinal dysfunction and apoptosis by suppressing the TLR4/MD2 pathway. Our findings provide evidence that MD2 plays a critical role in mediating modified LDL-induced cell injury in the retina and suggest that targeting MD2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy.
   Diabetes: Specific protein inhibitors could reduce blindness Blocking the activity of a protein involved in triggering inflammation and oxidative stress in the retina may reduce diabetes-induced visual impairment and blindness. Besides hyperglycemia, plasma lipids and lipoproteins have also been proposed as potential risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. However, the precise mechanisms controlling low-density lipoprotein-induced retinal damage are unclear. In experiments on mice, Yi Wang at Wenzhou Medical University in Wenzhou, China, and co-workers found that retinal injury caused by highly oxidized glycated-LDL is mediated by the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2). Blocking MD2 with an inhibitor suppressed two key signaling pathways, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory signaling proteins in the retina. Further investigations are needed, but the team believe MD2 could be a vital therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common disease in the brain, is associated with cognitive and mitochondrial dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that endurance training and Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merrill and Perry (Myrtaceae) (commonly referred to as clove) are effective interventions to maintain oxidative balance and improve cognitive function. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of endurance training and clove oil affect spatial memory, apoptosis, mitochondrial homeostasis, and cognitive function in Alzheimer's rats. Materials and methods: 81 rats were randomly assigned to 9 groups: Healthy (H), sham (sh), Healthy-exercise (HE), Healthy-clove (HC), Healthy-exercise-clove (HEC), Alzheimer's (A), Alzheimer's-exercise (AE), Alzheimer's-clove (AC), and Alzheimer's-exercise-clove (AEC). Alzheimer's induction was induced by the injection of 1-42 amyloid into the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The exercise training protocol was performed for 3 weeks, every day for 30 min in swimming training, and clove oil supplementation (0.1 mg/kg) was gavaged daily for 3 weeks in the supplement rat. Shuttle box test was used to measure spatial memory after the last training session, and to determine the mRNAs and protein levels and apoptosis, Real-Time PCR, immunofluorescent, and tunnel methods were used, respectively. Results: Alzheimer's caused a significant decrease in the PRDX6 and GCN5L1 mRNAs and protein levels and a significant increase in apoptosis in the hippocampus of the Alzheimer's group compared to the control group (P = 0.001). Alzheimer's also reduced the time delay in entering the dark environment and increased the time spent in the dark environment (P = 0.001). Following endurance training and consumption of clove oil, spatial memory (P = 0.001), apoptosis (P = 0.001) and mRNAs and protein levels of PRDX6 (P = 0.001) and GCN5L1 (P = 0.017), were recovered in AE, AC and AEC groups, as compared with A group. Conclusion: Swimming training and consumption of clove can possibly be considered as an effective intervention to maintain oxidative balance and improve mitochondrial homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - A chromosome-level genome assembly of the Xingguo gray goose enables deeper insight into Chinese indigenous geese genetic origins and evolution.
   Geese are herbivorous birds that play an essential role in the agricultural economy. We construct the chromosome-level genome of a Chinese indigenous goose (the Xingguo gray goose, XGG; Anser cygnoides) and analyze the adaptation of fat storage capacity in the goose liver during the evolution of Anatidae. Genomic resequencing of 994 geese is used to investigate the genetic relationships of geese, which supports the dual origin of geese (Anser cygnoides and Anser anser). Chinese indigenous geese show higher genetic diversity than European geese, and a scientific conservation program can be established to preserve genetic variation for each breed. We also find that a 14-bp insertion in endothelin receptor B subtype 2 (EDNRB2) that determines the white plumage of Chinese domestic geese is a natural mutation, and the linkaged alleles rapidly increase in frequency as a result of genetic hitchhiking, leading to the formation of completely different haplotypes of white geese under strong artificial selection. These genomic resources and our findings will facilitate marker-assisted breeding of geese and provide a foundation for further research on geese genetics and evolution.

AB  - The adaptation of phytophagous insects to host defense is an important aspect of plant-insect interactions. The reciprocal adaptability between specialist insects and their hosts have been adequately explored; however, the mechanisms underlying the adaptation of tephritid fruit fly specialists, a group of notorious pests worldwide, to unripen host fruits remain elusive. Here, plant metabolomes and insect transcriptomes were analyzed for the first time to explore the interaction between unripe citrus fruits and the Chinese citrus fly Bactrocera minax. Eighteen citrus secondary metabolites, mainly flavones, alkaloids and phenylpropanoids, were identified in the unripe citrus fruit metabolome, and they accumulated during larval feeding. Three detoxification genes (1 P450 gene, 2 ABCs genes) were highly expressed in B. minax larvae collected from unripe citrus fruits compared with the ones fed on artificial diets and ripe citrus fruits. Based on omics data, a novel ABC gene was screened through plant allelopathy tests, and the gene was significantly upregulated in B. minax larvae treated with defensive secondary metabolites (N-Methylcytisine, tryptamine, coixol, limonin, nomilin and quercetin), respectively; additionally, the mortality rate of the larvae reached 51% after silencing the ABC gene by RNAi technique. Overall, these results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the biological interactions between tephritid fruit fly specialists and host fruits.

AB  - Cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) release the Ca2+ from intracellular stores that is essential for cardiac myocyte contraction. The ion channel opening is tightly regulated by intracellular factors, including the FK506 binding proteins, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. The impact of these proteins on RyR2 activity and cardiac contraction is debated, with often apparently contradictory experimental results, particularly for FKBP12. The isoform that regulates RyR2 has generally been considered to be FKBP12.6, despite the fact that FKBP12 is the major isoform associated with RyR2 in some species and is bound in similar proportions to FKBP12.6 in others, including sheep and humans. Here, we show time- and concentration-dependent effects of adding FKBP12 to RyR2 channels that were partly depleted of FKBP12/12.6 during isolation. The added FKBP12 displaced most remaining endogenous FKBP12/12.6. The results suggest that FKBP12 activates RyR2 with high affinity and inhibits RyR2 with lower affinity, consistent with a model of negative cooperativity in FKBP12 binding to each of the four subunits in the RyR tetramer. The easy dissociation of some FKBP12/12.6 could dynamically alter RyR2 activity in response to changes in in vivo regulatory factors, indicating a significant role for FKBP12/12.6 in Ca2+ signalling and cardiac function in healthy and diseased hearts.This article is part of the theme issue 'The heartbeat: its molecular basis and physiological mechanisms'.

AB  - Jasmonic acid (JA), an important plant hormone, plays a crucial role in defending against herbivorous insects. In this study, we have identified a new Bowman-Birk type protease inhibitor (BBTI) protein in maize that is regulated by the JA pathway and exhibits significant antifeedant activity, which is notably induced by exogenous Methyl Jasmonate and Ostrinia furnacalis feeding treatments. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant differences in the BBTI protein among different maize inbred lines, except for the conserved domain. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were constructed and expressed, and combined with bioassays, it was demonstrated that the antifeedant activity of BBTI is determined by protein modifications and conserved domains. Through RT-qPCR detection of BBTI and JA regulatory pathway-related genes' temporal expression in different maize inbred lines, we identified the regulatory mechanism of BBTI synthesis under the JA pathway. This study successfully cloned and identified the MeJA-induced anti-feedant activity gene BBTI and conducted functional validation in different maize inbred lines, providing valuable insights into the response mechanism of insect resistance induced by the plant JA pathway. The increased expression of the anti-feedant activity gene BBTI through exogenous MeJA induction may offer a potential new strategy for mediating plant defense against Lepidoptan insects.

AB  - Systemin, the first peptide hormone identified in plants, was initially isolated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves. Systemin mediates local and systemic wound-induced defense responses in plants, conferring resistance to necrotrophic fungi and herbivorous insects. Systemin is recognized by the leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) receptor SYSTEMIN RECEPTOR1 (SYR1), but how the systemin recognition signal is transduced to intracellular signaling pathways to trigger defense responses is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that SERK family LRR-RLKs function as co-receptors for SYR1 to mediate systemin signal transduction in tomato. By using chemical genetic approaches coupled with engineered receptors, we revealed that the association of the cytoplasmic kinase domains of SYR1 with SERKs leads to their mutual trans-phosphorylation and the activation of SYR1, which in turn induces a wide range of defense responses. Systemin stimulates the association between SYR1 and all tomato SERKs (SlSERK1, SlSERK3A, and SlSERK3B). The resulting SYR1-SlSERK heteromeric complexes trigger the phosphorylation of TOMATO PROTEIN KINASE 1B (TPK1b), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that positively regulates systemin responses. Additionally, upon association with SYR1, SlSERKs are cleaved by the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopB1, further supporting the finding that SlSERKs are activated by systemin-bound SYR1. Finally, genetic analysis using Slserk mutants showed that SlSERKs are essential for systemin-mediated defense responses. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the systemin-mediated association of SYR1 and SlSERKs activates defense responses against herbivorous insects.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the response of Charolais and Ile-de-France meat sheep breeds to stimulate superovulation with various follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) preparations. A total of 14 adult ewes of meat sheep breeds were used in our study as donors, including Charolais breed (n = 8) and Ile-de-France breed (n = 6). Donors ewes were randomly divided into two groups in equal numbers (first group, n = 7; second group, n = 7), every group included Charolais breed (n = 4) and Ile-de-France breed (n = 3). Ewes in the first group were treated with Folltropin-V (total dose of 200 mg per ewe, seven injections), and ewes in the second group were treated with FSH-P (total of 280 IU per ewe, six injections). Thirty-seven ewes of Edilbay breed used as recipients were divided into two groups (first group, n = 20; second group, n = 17). Our results showed that the number of corpora lutea in donor groups treated with Folltropin-V was significantly higher than in donor groups treated with FSH-P (p < .01). A greater number of embryos recovery and embryos suitable for transplantation were found in the first group compared with the second group of donors. After 30 days from transplantation, transabdominal ultrasonography showed that the presence of pregnancy in recipients groups was found in 16 recipient ewes (43.2%), in the first group of recipients were registered nine pregnant ewes of 20 recipient ewes (45.0%), and in the second group of recipients were registered seven pregnant ewes of 17 recipient ewes (41.2%). In conclusion, using Folltropin-V in Charolais and Ile-de-France meat sheep breeds is a more effective scheme for stimulating superovulation than using FSH-P.

AB  - The positive balance of soil organic matter (SOM) in amble land is the main issue of sustainable agriculture. Organic fertilization via composting is an effective method of soil productivity support. The deficit of traditional organic fertilizers creates the need to explore new sources of organic matter such as agricultural waste, sewage sludge. municipal and industrial waste.
   The different types of organic materials were researched of their use as fertilizers by the method of composting with natural soils for circular economy purposes. That, on the one hand, is related to full use of resources, and on the other for a positive balance of humus in soils under conditions of intensive agriculture. The study included both environmental bioresources (biochar and compost) as well as traditionally known manure (cow and sheep mature) and sewage sludge from domestic wastewater.
   The composting is done with two soil types - Alluvial-meadow soil and Smolnitza. The following phisico-chemical and agrochemical parameters were analyzed: pH in water; electrical conductivity; cation exchange capacity and base of saturation; the content and composition of the organic matter, total nitrogen; mobile forms of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
   The studied indicators reflect a more profound change with the addition of organic materials to Alluvial meadow soil compared with the Smolnitza soil type. This is mainly due to changes in CEC characteristics of both soil types. Changes in the content and composition of soil organic matter are highly indicative of the composting process. They are more sensitive for the Alluvial-meadow soil, where the soil organic matter from humic-fulvic type is converted to humic type by addition of all organic materials, except the cow mature.

AB  - The study was designed to examine the distribution and chemical coding of somatostatin-immunoreactive (SOMIR) nerve fibers supplying the urinary bladder wall and to establish the distribution and immunohistochemical characteristics of the subpopulation of paracervical ganglion (PCG) SOM-IR neurons projecting to this organ in female pigs. The PCG-urinary bladder projecting neurons (PCG-UBPN) were visualized with retrograde neuronal tracer Fast Blue (FB). Double-labeling immunohistochemistry performed on cryostat sections from the urinary bladder wall revealed that the greatest density of SOM-IR nerve fibers was found in the muscle layer and around blood vessels, a moderate number of these nerve terminals supplied the submucosa and only single SOM-IR axons were encountered beneath the urothelium. In all the investigated sections the vast majority of SOM-IR nerve fibers were immunopositive to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and many SOM-IR axons contained immunoreactivity to neuropeptide Y (NPY). Approximately 65 % of FB-positive (FB+) PCG-UBPN were immunoreactive to SOM. Moreover, PCG FB+/SOM + nerve cells were simultaneously immunoreactive to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; 64.6 +/- 0.6 %), NPY (59.7 +/- 1.2 %), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; 46.1 +/- 0.7 %), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 29.9 +/- 2.2 %), Leu5-enkephalin (L-ENK; 19.5 +/- 6.3 %), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (D beta H; 14.9 +/- 1.9 %) or pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP; 14.8 +/- 2.4 %). The present study reveals the extensive expression of SOM in both the nerve fibres supplying the porcine urinary bladder wall and the PCG neurons projecting to this organ, indicating an important regulatory role of SOM in the control of the urinary bladder function.

AB  - Cashewnut leaf spot is an important foliar disease in cashewnut seedling in West Bengal, India. The present study was aimed to identify and characterize the causal organism associated with cashewnut leaf spot and also to find out its best management strategies. Two cashewnut nurseries at Jhargram and Mohanpur were surveyed and four isolates of the pathogen were isolated from infected leaf tissue. The pathogen was identified as Pestalotiopsis oxyanthi (Thumen) Steyaert based on morphological features and ITS sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis using sequence data placed the four isolates in a single clade. Disease progress rate was positively correlated with the weather parameters like maximum relative humidity (RH), mean RH and rainfall data in both years. Pyraclostrobin inhibited mycelial growth of the pathogen most followed by thiophanate methyl and carbendazim + mancozeb against pathogen with ED50 values of 0.362, 0.839 and 1.137 ppm, respectively. All the tested fungicides revealed significant effect on disease severity of leaf spot and reduced disease severity after four sprayings. It has been observed from two years pooled data that pyraclostrobin treated seedling showed lowest disease severity (DS), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and highest percent disease reduction over untreated control of 23.00%, 1200.00 and 61.02%, respectively.

AB  - Termite gut comprises a long tube divided into several compartments. The well-developed hindgut includes five distinct portions, in which microbial communities are harbored, being responsible for different physiological and digestive processes. An enlarged compartment of the hindgut, the paunch, comprises a sac-like structure whose morphological features differ among termite taxa. The Neotropical termite Serritermes serrifer is the unique inquiline lower termite, and its cryptic habit results in sampling difficulties. Thus, studies regarding this termite species are rare. Here we provide a morphological approach of the gut regions in pseudergates and soldiers of S. serrifer, highlighting the ultrastructure features of the paunch, especially what concerns its function and association with microbial communities. The general morphology of the gut resembles those reported for other "lower termites ", and comprises a short foregut with a small stomodeal valve, a midgut devoid of mixed segment, and a long-compartmentalized hindgut. Eight Malpighian tubules are attached at the mesenteric-proctodeal transition, some of them extending towards the rectum. The ultrastructure of the paunch epithelium reinforces an involvement in content uptake, especially due to the extensive apical invaginations associated with mitochondria. Bacteria are attached to the paunch cuticle by an electron-dense material or are freely distributed in the lumen. The paunch of S. serrifer shares morphological similarities to that of Rhinotermitidae, but cup-like depressions, a likely synapomorphy for the Reticulitermes + Coptotermes + Heterotermes group, were absent. It suggests that bacterial attachment in S. serrifer paunch, as well as the uptake of compounds and microbial metabolites, occur along the epithelium rather than in specific sites, reinforcing the close relationship with basal rhinotermitids, in which such structures are also absent. Moreover, such characters also resemble those reported for Termitidae species.

AB  - Plants and insects are developing strategies to avoid each other's defense systems. Host plants may release volatile compounds to attract the natural enemies of herbivores; insect pests may also select host plants that are deterrent to natural enemies to avoid such predation. Here we investigated whether the host plant preference of Hyphantria cunea correlates with the attractiveness of these plants to Chouioia cunea, a parasitoid wasp that serves as the primary natural enemy of H. cunea. We found Morus alba was the preferred host plant for female H. cunea. Although M. alba provided suboptimal nutritional value for H. cunea growth and development compared to other plants, it attracted fewer C. cunea relative to alternative host plants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analysis identified six distinct compounds among the herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) produced following H. cunea feeding. Notably, M. alba was the sole plant species that did not emit tridecane. These results suggest that H. cunea utilizes M. alba as a reduced predation enemy-free space, thereby minimizing parasitization by C. cunea. Our research emphasizes the importance of considering adaptive responses of herbivores within the context of multi-trophic relationships, rather than solely focusing on optimizing herbivore growth on the most nutritionally suitable plant host.

AB  - Alien plants' chemical defenses against herbivores contribute to how successful they are at invading, but the defensive chemicals and their biosynthesis are sometimes poorly characterized, which limits pest management and control of invasive species. Here, the chemical defenses of invasive plant Phytolacca americana and noninvasive Phytolacca icosandra in China against generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura were compared. When plants were free from herbivores' attack, P. americana repelled S. litura females to P. icosandra. After being infested with S. litura, P. americana formed an ecological trap, which attracted S. litura to lay eggs but caused the emerged larvae to grow poorly. Further analysis found that constitutively released (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (z3HAC) attracted S. litura females, while the herbivore-induced volatile DMNT with z3HAC repelled them. P. americana had alcohol acyltransferase genes (AATs) for z3HAC biosynthesis, but low gene expression levels of target AATs, low enzyme catalytic ability of AATs, and low level of the endogenous precursor of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol led to undetectable levels of z3HAC. Highly enriched metabolites of organic acids and flavonoids from phenylalanine metabolism in P. americana deterred the growth of S. litura. These results suggested that invasive P. americana avoided synthesizing costly z3HAC and accumulated organic acids and flavonoids to defend against generalists, unlike its noninvasive congener, providing new insights into invasion success and pest management.

AB  - Background Plants after infestation emit specific volatiles, which can influence foraging behavior of insect predators of herbivores. This work aimed to evaluate the responses of the predatory species, Coccinella undecimpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), adults to volatiles emitted from its cowpea aphid prey, Aphis craccivora (Koch.), and from Vicia faba plant to improve the efficiency of searching for its prey. An olfactometer bioassay was used for this investigation. Results The results revealed that both male and female of C. undecimpunctata significantly used olfactory cues from infested plant + aphids, but the mated females exhibited a complete response (47.50%). The mated male was attracted to aphids (30.0%) more than other tested predatory types, indicating the capacity to exploit volatiles induced by aphids. Conclusions The results supported that C. undecimpunctata adult uses plant volatiles induced by A. craccivora infestation, which might act as reliable indicators to find its prey.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Si-Wei-Qiang-Wei Powder (SWQ) is a formulated traditional Tibetan medicine preparation that has been used clinically to treat liver and gallbladder diseases for centuries. Previous work has confirmed its clinical effectiveness, however, the specific mechanism of SWQ is still unknown. Aim of the study: This study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory effect of SWQ on cholecystitis and its possible mechanism.Materials and methods: The main chemical components of SWQ were analyzed by HPLC. The network pharma-cology database was used to screen and construct the network of the main components and molecular targets of SWQ, and to predict the molecular pathways of its core targets. Cholecystitis guinea pig model and LPS stim-ulated cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells (HGBEC) were used, as in vivo and in vitro methods respec-tively, to study the anti-cholecystitis activity of SWQ. Specifically, gallbladder wall thickness, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and liver function indexes were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of SWQ in cholecystitis; qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect the changes of the production of inflammatory cytokines; Western blot analysis was used to analyze the effects of SWQ on phosphorylation of P38, ERK1/2, JNK and AKT.Results: SWQ decreased the indexes of ALT, AST, TBA, CHOL, DBIL in serum and TBIL, TC and Ca2+ in bile, and alleviated the wall thickness of gallbladder and hepatobiliary fibrosis in LCA-induced guinea pigs. In addition, SWQ attenuated the expression and production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, COX-2 both in liver and gallbladder. Moreover, SWQ reversed the up-regulation of p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK in animals with cholecystitis and LPS-induced HGBEC. Furthermore, mechanistic studies indicated that SWQ inhibited the activation of ERK1/2, thereby decreasing the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta and phosphorylation P38 and JNK.Conclusion: In summary, our research showed that SWQ relieves gallbladder inflammation by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.

AB  - The phytohormone jasmonates (JAs) regulate plant growth and defense responses. The reproductive organs of flowers are devastated by insect herbivores. However, the molecular mechanisms of floral defense remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the Arabidopsis JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and its substrates JA ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressors, and the mediator subunit MEDIATOR25-based MED25-MYC-MYB (MMM) complexes, including MYC2/3/4/5 and MYB28/29/76, mediated floral defense against the insects Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera exigua, and Spodoptera frugiperda. The flower-specific IIIa bHLH factors ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) and DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1 (DYT1) were JAZ-interaction proteins. They interacted with members of the MMM complexes, inhibited the transcriptional activity of MYC2 and MYB28, and repressed floral defense against insects. AMS and DYT1 recruited the flower-specific MYB21/24, and these MYBs interacted with members of MMM complexes, inhibited the MYC2-MYB28 function, and suppressed floral defense against insects. Our study revealed that the JA-COI1-JAZ-MMM pathway mediated flower defense, and the AMS/DYT1-MYB21/24 module antagonized the MMM complexes to repress floral defense against insects.

AB  - Porcine extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is a pathogenic bacterium that causes huge economic losses to the pig farming industry and considerably threatens human health. The quorum sensing (QS) system plays a crucial role in the survival and pathogenesis of pathogenic bacteria. Hence, it is a viable approach to prevent ExPEC infection by compromising the QS system, particularly the LuxS/AI-2 system. In this study, we investigated the effects of baicalin on the LuxS/AI-2 system of ExPEC. Baicalin at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mu g/mL significantly diminished the survival ability of ExPEC in hostile environments and could inhibit the biofilm formation and autoagglutination ability in ExPEC. Moreover, baicalin dose-dependently decreased the production of AI-2 and down-regulated the expression level of luxS in PCN033. These results suggest that baicalin can weaken the virulence of PCN033 by inhibiting the LuxS/AI-2 system. After the gene luxS was deleted, AI-2 production in PCN033 was almost completely eliminated, similar to the effect of baicalin on the production of AI-2 in PCN033. This indicates that baicalin reduced the production of AI-2 by inhibiting the expression level of luxS in ExPEC. In addition, the animal experiment further showed the potential of baicalin as a LuxS/AI-2 system inhibitor to prevent ExPEC infection. This study highlights the potential of baicalin as a natural quorum-sensing inhibitor for therapeutic applications in preventing ExPEC infection by targeting the LuxS/AI-2 system.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs emerging from GRIN genes) are tetrameric receptors that form diverse channel compositions in neurons, typically consisting of two GluN1 subunits combined with two GluN2(A-D) subunits. During prenatal stages, the predominant channels are di-heteromers with two GluN1 and two GluN2B subunits due to the high abundance of GluN2B subunits. Postnatally, the expression of GluN2A subunits increases, giving rise to additional subtypes, including GluN2A-containing di-heteromers and tri-heteromers with GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B subunits. The latter emerge as the major receptor subtype at mature synapses in the hippocampus. Despite extensive research on purely di-heteromeric receptors containing two identical GRIN variants, the impact of a single variant on the function of other channel forms, notably tri-heteromers, is lagging. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of two de novo GRIN2B variants (G689C and G689S) in pure, mixed di- and tri-heteromers. Our findings reveal that incorporating a single variant in mixed di-heteromers or tri-heteromers exerts a dominant negative effect on glutamate potency, although 'mixed' channels show improved potency compared to pure variant-containing di-heteromers. We show that a single variant within a receptor complex does not impair the response of all receptor subtypes to the positive allosteric modulator pregnenolone-sulfate (PS), whereas spermine completely fails to potentiate tri-heteromers containing GluN2A and -2B-subunits. We examined PS on primary cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with the variants, and observed a positive impact over current amplitudes and synaptic activity. Together, our study supports previous observations showing that mixed di-heteromers exhibit improved glutamate potency and extend these findings towards the exploration of the effect of Loss-of-Function variants over tri-heteromers. Notably, we provide an initial and crucial demonstration of the beneficial effects of GRIN2B-relevant potentiators on tri-heteromers. Our results underscore the significance of studying how different variants affect distinct receptor subtypes, as these effects cannot be inferred solely from observations made on pure di-heteromers. Overall, this study contributes to ongoing efforts to understand the pathophysiology of GRINopathies and provides insights into potential treatment strategies.

AB  - Cortisol is a potent human steroid hormone that plays key roles in the central nervous system, influencing processes such as brain neuronal synaptic plasticity and regulating the expression of emotional and behavioral responses. The relevance of cortisol stands out in the disease, as its dysregulation is associated with debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Among other brain regions, cortisol importantly influences the function of the hippocampus, a structure central for memory and emotional information processing. The mechanisms fine-tuning the different synaptic responses of the hippocampus to steroid hormone signaling remain, however, poorly understood. Using ex vivo electrophysiology and wild type (WT) and miR-132/miR-212 microRNAs knockout (miRNA-132/212(-/-)) mice, we examined the effects of corticosterone (the rodent's equivalent to cortisol in humans) on the synaptic properties of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. In WT mice, corticosterone predominantly inhibited metaplasticity in the dorsal WT hippocampi, whereas it significantly dysregulated both synaptic transmission and metaplasticity at dorsal and ventral regions of miR-132/212(-/-) hippocampi. Western blotting further revealed significantly augmented levels of endogenous CREB and a significant CREB reduction in response to corticosterone only in miR-132/212(-/-) hippocampi. Sirt1 levels were also endogenously enhanced in the miR-132/212(-/-) hippocampi but unaltered by corticosterone, whereas the levels of phospo-MSK1 were only reduced by corticosterone in WT, not in miR-132/212(-/-) hippocampi. In behavioral studies using the elevated plus maze, miRNA-132/212(-/-) mice further showed reduced anxiety-like behavior. These observations propose miRNA-132/212 as potential region-selective regulators of the effects of steroid hormones on hippocampal functions, thus likely fine-tuning hippocampus-dependent memory and emotional processing.

AB  - Tea plants are perennial evergreen woody crops that originated in low latitudes but have spread to high latitudes. Bud dormancy is an important adaptation mechanism to low temperatures, and its timing is economically significant for tea production. However, the core molecular networks regulating dormancy and bud break in tea plants remain unclear. In the present study, a MADS-box transcription factor CsMADS27 was identified in tea plants. Gene and phenotype characterizations following ectopic overexpression and endogenous silencing experiments are consistent with a role for CsMADS27 in dormancy and sprouting in different tea cultivars. Furthermore, CsDJC23 was found to be a downstream target of CsMADS27 and implicated in bud sprouting. Based on yeast one-hybrid screening and comprehensive verification, CsCBF1 and CsZHD9 were identified as upstream transcriptional inhibitors and activators of CsMADS27, respectively, with the two proteins showing direct interactions and competitive binding effects. Histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) in the first exon and intron regions of CsMADS27 was associated with a positive role in CsMADS27 expression. These results revealed that CsMADS27 is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of dormancy and bud break. Furthermore, the CsCBF1/CsZHD9-CsMADS27 module plays a critical role in sensing environmental factors and accurately regulating the growth and development of overwintering buds in tea plants.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) is a highly malignant cancer with great metastatic potential. Here we aimed to investigate the role of Piezo1, a gene related to the mechanical environment of the tumor, in promoting the metastasis of OC. We performed Piezo1 knockdown in A-1847 cells using small hairpin RNAs, and the cells were inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice. Piezo1 knockdown decreased the tumor growth rate of OC tumor xenografts in mice and reduced cell migration in vitro. Metastasis in the lung was also attenuated after Piezo1 knockdown as revealed by HE staining of the lung tissues, which was concomitant with downregulation of E-Cadherin and vimentin and upregulation of N-Cadherin analyzed using western blot analysis, suggesting suppressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Migration of Piezo1-knockdown cells was also analyzed for their migratory capabilities using the scratch assay. We also analyzed the key proteins in the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway using western blot after treating A-1847 and 3AO cells with a Piezo1 inducer, Yoda1. Piezo1 inducer Yoda1 activated Hippo/YAP signal in OC cells. In conclusion, Piezo1 is overexpressed in OC tissues and contributes to OC tumor growth and metastasis. Suppression of Piezo1 is a potential therapeutic strategy for OC.

AB  - Mechanisms that allow plants to survive and reproduce after herbivory are considered to play a key role in plant evolution. In this study, we evaluated how tolerance varies in species with different historic exposure to herbivores considering ontogeny. We exposed the range-restricted species Medicago citrina and its closely related and widespread species M. arborea to one and two herbivory simulations (80 % aerial biomass loss). Physiological and growth parameters related to tolerance capacity were assessed to evaluate constitutive values (without herbivory) and induced tolerance after damage. Constitutive traits were not always related to greater tolerance, and each species compensated for herbivory through different traits. Herbivory damage only led to mortality in M. citrina; adults exhibited root biomass loss and increased oxidative stress after damage, but also compensated aerial biomass. Despite seedlings showed a lower death percentage than adults after herbivory in M. citrina, they showed less capacity to recover control values than adults. Moderate tolerance to M. arborea herbivory and low tolerance to M. citrina is found. Thus, although the constitutive characteristics are maintained in the lineage, the tolerance of plants decreases in M. citrina. That represents how plants respond to the lack of pressure from herbivores in their habitat.

AB  - Key message Calmodulin-like-proteins (CML) belong to a family of calcium-sensing proteins that are unique for plants and involved in many different developmental and stress-related reactions. In defense against herbivory, some pathogens and drought, CML37 acts as a positive and CML42 as a negative regulator, respectively. We provide evidence that both CMLs act antagonistically in the regulation of induced defense responses. A double knock-out line, cml37 x cml42, thus shows wild-type phenotypes upon all kind of stresses we used. A transient increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration is one of the first reactions that can be measured in plant cells upon abiotic as well as biotic stress treatments. These calcium signals are sensed by calcium binding proteins such as calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), which transduce the sensed information into appropriate stress responses by interacting with downstream target proteins. In previous studies, CML37 has been shown to positively regulate the plants' defense against both the insect herbivore Spodoptera littoralis and the response to drought stress. In contrast, CML42 is known to negatively regulate those two stress responses. Here, we provide evidence that these two CMLs act antagonistically in the regulation of induced responses directed against drought and herbivory stress as well as in the defense against the necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria brassicicola. Both CMLs shape the plant reactions by altering the phytohormone signaling. Consequently, the phytohormone-regulated production of defensive compounds like glucosinolates is also antagonistically mediated by both CMLs. The finding that CML37 and CML42 have antagonistic roles in diverse stress-related responses suggests that these calcium sensor proteins represent important tools for the plant to balance and fine-tune the signaling and downstream reactions upon environmental stress.

AB  - The greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurode vaporariorum, is among the key pests of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in sub-Saharan Africa with Tuta absoluta, spider mite, thrips, and fruitworms. To understand the interaction between the pest and the plant's herbivory-induced plant volatile (HIPVs), we investigated the repellency of four tomato cultivars (Kilele F1, Assila F1, Red Beauty F1, and Nemonneta F1) upon infestation by Trialeurode vaporariorum. We analyzed the behavioral response of T. vaporariorum to infested and uninfested tomato plants of these cultivars using olfactory bioassays followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of emitted volatiles. Trialeurode vaporariorum was attracted to uninfested plants of all four tomato cultivars. However, two cultivars Kilele F1 and Red Beauty F1 were no longer attractive to the whitefly when they were already infested by the pest. GC-MS analyses identified 25 compounds, 18 monoterpenes, 3 sesquiterpenes, 2 xylenes, 1 aldehyde, and 1 carboxylic compound in the 4 uninfested and infested cultivars. Based on the insects' behavioral response, 1,8-cineole, p-cymene, and limonene did not attract T. vaporariorum at varying concentrations when combined with Red Beauty F1, the most attractive tomato cultivar. This repellence behavioral response can be used as a basis for improvement of other vegetable crops for the management of arthropod pests as for odor masking technique.

AB  - Plants not only respond to herbivorous damage but adjust their defense system after egg deposition by pest insects. Thereby, parasitoids use oviposition-induced plant volatiles to locate their hosts. We investigated the olfactory behavioral responses of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley, 1879 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) to volatile blends emitted by maize (Zea mays L.) with singular and stacked events after oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda Smith, 1797 (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) moths. Additionally, we examined possible variations in gene expression and on oviposition-induced volatiles. We used a Y-tube olfactometer to test for the wasp responses to volatiles released by maize plants oviposited by S. frugiperda and not-oviposited plants. Using the real-time PCR technique (qRT-PCR), we analyzed the expression of lipoxygenase and three terpene synthases genes, which are enzymes involved in the synthesis of volatile compounds that attract parasitoids of S. frugiperda. Olfactometer tests showed that T. pretiosum is strongly attracted by volatiles from transgenic maize emitted by S. frugiperda oviposition (VTPRO 3, more than 75% individuals were attracted). The relative expression of genes TPS10, LOX e STC was higher in transgenic hybrids than in the conventional (isogenic line) hybrids. The GC-MS analysis revealed that some volatile compounds are released exclusively by transgenic maize. This study provides evidence that transgenic hybrids enhanced chemical cues under oviposition-induction and helped to increase T. pretiosum efficiency in S. frugiperda control. This finding shows that among the evaluated hybrids, genetically modified hybrids can improve the biological control programs, since they potentialize the egg parasitoid foraging, integrating pest management.

AB  - Simple Summary African swine fever (ASF) causes acute hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs. This disease causes huge economic losses worldwide, and there are no safe and effective vaccines. The ASF virus (ASFV) has at least 68 structural proteins. One of these is CD2v, an outer envelope protein usually used as a target for ASF vaccine development. However, the effective immunological regions of this protein have not been fully characterized. Herein, we used monoclonal antibodies to identify a novel B cell epitope located in the intracellular region of CD2v. Importantly, the epitope can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses in a mouse model. This study provides new insights into ASF epitope vaccine development. The African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes high mortality in domestic pigs. ASFV encodes an important protein target for subunit vaccine development, CD2v, but its most effective immunological regions are not known. Herein, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) named IF3 by immunizing mice against the intracellular region of the CD2v protein (CD2v-IR). 1F3 specifically recognized CD2v, which is expressed transiently in transfected Sf9 cells and also in inactivated ASFV-infected porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) cells. The epitope recognized by 1F3 is (EPSPREP270)-E-264, which is highly conserved in ASFV genotypes. Immunization of mice with this epitope elicited an increased IgG response, including IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and also increased CD8(+) T cells and cytokine expression. Overall, these results indicate that this epitope induces both humoral and cellular immune responses that may be used for ASFV-related subunit vaccine design and development.

AB  - The hippocampus has become a significant target of stress research in recent years because of its role in cognitive functioning, neuropathology, and regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Despite the pervasive impact of stress on psychiatric and neurological disease, many of the circuit- and cell-dependent mechanisms giving rise to the limbic regulation of the stress response remain unknown. Hippocampal excitatory neurons generally express high levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and are therefore positioned to respond directly to serum glucocorticoids. These neurons are, in turn, regulated by neighboring interneurons, subtypes of which have been shown to respond to stress exposure. However, GR expression among hippocampal interneurons is not well characterized. To determine whether key interneuron populations are direct targets for glucocorticoid action, we used two transgenic mouse lines to label parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. GR immunostaining of labeled interneurons was characterized within the dorsal and ventral dentate hilus, dentate cell body layer, and CA1 and CA3 stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale. While nearly all hippocampal SST+ interneurons expressed GR across all regions, GR labeling of PV+ interneurons showed considerable subregion variability. The percentage of PV+, GR+ cells was highest in the CA3 stratum pyramidale and lowest in the CA1 stratum oriens, with other regions showing intermediate levels of expression. Together, these findings indicate that, under baseline conditions, hippocampal SST+ interneurons are a ubiquitous glucocorticoid target, while only distinct populations of PV+ interneurons are direct targets. This anatomical diversity suggests functional differences in the regulation of stress-dependent hippocampal responses.

AB  - Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is one of the most important parasitic natural enemies of Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in peach and pear orchards. The arti-ficial rearing T. dendrolimi have been widely used in biological control programs in recent years. However, its actual parasitic effect on the pest in the field is less, so it is important to develop attractants to increase the parasitic efficiency of the parasitoids. T. dendrolimi can be easily attracted by semiochemicals derived from flowers, intact plants, herbivore-attacked plants, and insects in its orchard habitats. In this paper, 73 semi-ochemicals were evaluated as potential attractants at three concentrations (0.1 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 10 mg/ mL) to T. dendrolimi by Y-tube olfactometer bioassays and Electroantennogram (EAG) technology, and then the mixtures of active individual compounds were further tested and evaluated in the field. As a result, 17 individual compounds showed attractive bioactivity to T. dendrolimi. Interestingly, when methyl salicylate and benzalde-hyde mixed with linalool oxide or cis-3-hexenyl caproate in a volume ratio of 10:3:3 respectively showed excellent attractant bioactivity for T. dendrolimi in the orchard field. Thus, introducing such parasitoid attractants in orchard habitat may improve the biological control effect to pests.

AB  - The parasitic isopod suborder Epicaridea contains similar to 800 species, all of which infest crustaceans. Until now only one species, Eremitione tuberculata (Richardson, 1904), occurring near the southern tip of South America, has been known from king crab hosts (Lithodidae). During two cruises of the Federal Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO) in 2020 and 2021, commercial king crab stocks in the western part of the Bering Sea were surveyed, including 37 juvenile specimens of the golden king crab, Lithodes aequispinus Benedict, 1895, sampled at depths of 236-450 m. Two thirds of them were infested with a species of Eremitione, new to science. Eremitione rybakovi sp. nov. morphologically closely resembles E. tuberculata, but differs in having a relatively shorter pleon in females (0.3-0.4 of total body length), a slightly distorted body (0-20 degrees), and more developed subrectangular dorsal extensions on the pereopodal bases; males of the new species have a more slender antennule with six articles (five articles in E. tuberculata). Half of the brooding females of E. rybakovi sp. nov. were infested with the cabiropid hyperparasite Bourdonia cf. tridentata Rybakov, 1990, previously known from Bopyroides hippolytes (Kroyer, 1838). Aspects of the biology of L. aequispinus, that may be responsible for the high rates of parasite infestation, and relations within the "host-parasite-hyperparasite" system are discussed. DNA sequences are obtained from E. rybakovi sp. nov. and B. cf. tridentata for the COI and 18S rRNA genes, and the resulting phylogenetic placement of the new bopyrid species is shown.

AB  - Depression in pregnant women raises concerns about the safety of antidepressants use, particularly its impact on offspring's neurocognition. This study investigates the effects of maternal exposure to vortioxetine (VOX) on the neurocognitive development of rat offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered clinically pertinent doses of VOX, 1 mg/kg/day or 2 mg/kg/day from gestational day 6-21. The dams delivered their offspring naturally and reared until postnatal day (PND) 70. Offspring of both sexes were assessed for postnatal growth by measuring body weight from PND 1-70 weekly and cognitive function using Morris water maze (MWM) test and passive avoidance learning test from PND 49-70. After behavioral assessments, adult rat offspring were sacrificed, and their brains were dissected out for assessment of brain morphology as well as biochemical analysis. The results demonstrated that VOX exposure potentially impaired cognitive performance, evidenced by increased latency in MWM and passive avoidance learning tests. Additionally, it led to decreased body weight, altered brain morphology, and disrupted neurobiochemical profiles. Specifically, VOX 2 mg/kg exposure significantly reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, increased pro-apoptotic BAX expression, decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression, and elevated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. Lower dose of VOX (1 mg/kg) did not show significant adverse effects on neurocognition, suggesting a dose-dependent impact. No sex specific neurocognitive deficits were observed in current study. These findings indicate that while VOX may offer a safer profile compared to SSRIs, high doses during pregnancy can still result in neurocognitive impairments in offspring.

AB  - The presence of a conspecific can be calming to some species of animal during stress, a phenomenon known as social buffering. For rodents, social buffering can reduce the perception of and reaction to aversive experiences. With a companion, animals may be less frightened in conditioned fear paradigms, experience faster wound healing, show reduced corticosterone responses to novelty, and become more resilient to everyday stressors like cage-cleaning. Social buffering works in diverse ways across species and life stages. For example, social buffering may rely on specific bonds and interactions between individuals, whereas in other cases, the mere presence of conspecific cues may reduce isolation stress. Social buffering has diverse practical applications for enhancing rodent wellbeing (some of which can be immediately applied, while others need further development via welfare-oriented research). Appropriate social housing will generally increase rodents' abilities to cope with challenges, with affiliative cage mates being the most effective buffers. Thus, when rodents are scheduled to experience distressing research procedures, ensuring that their home lives supply high degrees of affiliative, low stress social contact can be an effective refinement. Furthermore, social buffering research illustrates the stress of acute isolation: stressors experienced outside the cage may thus be less impactful if a companion is present. If a companion cannot be provided for subjects exposed to out-of-cage stressors, odors from unstressed animals can help ameliorate stress, as can proxies such as pieces of synthetic fur. Finally, in cases involving conditioned fear (the learned expectation of harm), newly providing social contact during exposure to negative conditioned stimuli (CS) can modify the CS such that for research rodents repeatedly exposed to aversive stimuli, adding conspecific contact can reduce their conditioned fear. Ultimately, these benefits of social buffering should inspire the use of creative techniques to reduce the impact of stressful procedures on laboratory rodents, so enhancing their welfare.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study delves into the intricate defense mechanisms of cotton plants against the primary pest Adelphocoris suturalis Jakovlev, which has become a major concern in Bt-cotton fields. Through advanced analytical techniques, this study identified specific changes in the cotton plant's metabolism and protein expression triggered by A. suturalis feeding. These findings revealed a notable increase in the expression of certain alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathway-related proteases and a simultaneous decrease in fructose and mannose biosynthesis-related proteases. These molecular responses shed light on the complex interplay between cotton plants and A. suturalis. Therefore, this study not only deepens our understanding of plant-insect interactions but also provides valuable insights for developing innovative strategies to control this cotton pest, thereby offering potential solutions for sustainable cotton cultivation. The recent dominance of Adelphocoris suturalis Jakovlev as the primary cotton field pest in Bt-cotton-cultivated areas has generated significant interest in cotton pest control research. This study addresses the limited understanding of cotton defense mechanisms triggered by A. suturalis feeding. Utilizing LC-QTOF-MS, we analyzed cotton metabolomic changes induced by A. suturalis, and identified 496 differential positive ions (374 upregulated, 122 downregulated) across 11 categories, such as terpenoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, isoflavones, etc. Subsequent iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS analysis of the cotton proteome revealed 1569 differential proteins enriched in 35 metabolic pathways. Integrated metabolome and proteome analysis highlighted significant upregulation of 17 (89%) proteases in the alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism pathway, concomitant with a significant increase in 14 (88%) associated metabolites. Conversely, 19 (73%) proteases in the fructose and mannose biosynthesis pathway were downregulated, with 7 (27%) upregulated proteases corresponding to the downregulation of 8 pathway-associated metabolites. Expression analysis of key regulators in the ALA pathway, including allene oxidase synthase (AOS), phospholipase A (PLA), allene oxidative cyclase (AOC), and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (OPR3), demonstrated significant responses to A. suturalis feeding. Finally, this study pioneers the exploration of molecular mechanisms in the plant-insect relationship, thereby offering insights into potential novel control strategies against this cotton pest.

AB  - Foreign body reactions induced by macrophages often cause delay or failure of wound healing in the application of tissue engineering scaffolds. This study explores the application of nanosilver (NAg) to reduce foreign body reactions during scaffold transplantation. An NAg hybrid collagen-chitosan scaffold (NAg-CCS) was prepared using the freeze-drying method. The NAg-CCS was implanted on the back of rats to evaluate the effects on foreign body reactions. Skin tissue samples were collected for histological and immunological evaluation at variable intervals. Miniature pigs were used to assess the effects of NAg on skin wound healing. The wounds were photographed, and tissue samples were collected for molecular biological analysis at different time points post-transplantation. NAg-CCS has a porous structure and the results showed that it could release NAg constantly for two weeks. The NAg-CCS group rarely developed a foreign body reaction, while the blank-CCS group showed granulomas or necrosis in the subcutaneous grafting experiment. Both matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were reduced significantly in the NAg-CCS group. The NAg-CCS group had higher interleukin (IL)-10 and lower IL-6 than the blank CCS group. In the wound healing study, M1 macrophage activation and inflammatory-related proteins (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-6, and interferon-& gamma; (IFN-& gamma;)) were inhibited by NAg. In contrast, M2 macrophage activation and proinflammatory proteins (arginase-1, major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II), and found in inflammatory zone-1 (FIZZ-1)) were promoted, and this was responsible for suppressing the foreign body responses and accelerating wound healing. In conclusion, dermal scaffolds containing NAg suppressed the foreign body reaction by regulating macrophages and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thereby promoting wound healing.

AB  - The development of a viable mass-production technique for the generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), using various artificial diets, is crucial for conducting experiments to study its biology and propose control methods. This study aims to investigate the developmental biology of S. litura fed on three distinct diets: two legume-based diets (chickpea flour, Cicer arietinum L. and common bean flour, Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and a cereal-based diet (corn flour, Zea mays L.). Results on various developmental parameters and total life cycle durations indicated that the chickpea and bean-based diets yielded the superior outcomes, with shorter developmental periods (29.74 and 30.73 days, respectively) compared to the corn flour diet (33.10 days). Growth parameters derived from life tables, such as the net reproductive rate (Ro), intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (lambda), were also higher on chickpea and bean-based diets than the corn flour diet. These results suggest that legumes such as chickpeas and beans, which are rich in vegetable proteins, fibers, carbohydrates and essential minerals, provide a higher-quality nutritional foundation for the growth of S. litura compared to corn-based diet. Furthermore, these diets are suitable for understanding the phenology of S. litura, especially in relation to the nutritional variations of its host plants.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that are beneficial to life activities and are mainly concentrated in buds and leaves in the form of glycosides. Flavonoid glycosides have important effects on the properties and quality of tea plants. Research has shown that the abundance of flavonoid glycosides varies greatly among different cultivars, but research on the regulatory mechanisms that cause their differential accumulation among tea plant cultivars with different leaf colors is lacking. In this study, an integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics was conducted to determine the regulatory networks regulating astringency and color-related flavonoids in tea plant cultivars with diverse leaf colors. A total of five anthocyanidins, four catechins, and nine flavonol glycosides were found to partially contribute to the differences in taste and leaf color among tea plant cultivars with diverse leaf colors. Furthermore, 15 MYB genes and 5 Dof genes were identified as potential regulators controlling the expression of eight key structural genes, resulting in differences in the accumulation of specific compounds, including epicatechin (EC), catechin (C), cyanidin, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-glucoside, in tea plant cultivars with diverse leaf colors. These findings provide insights into the development and utilization of resources from tea plants with diverse leaf colors.

AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are known for their random structural changes throughout their sequence based on the environment. The mechanism underlying these structural changes is difficult to explain. All biological processes are known to follow the direction through which they act. A study of the correlated motion can help to understand the direction of the change. Herein, we introduced the multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) technique to study the correlated motion of the peptide. The correlated motion of the sheep prion peptide was studied with the change in the temperature and solvent. These techniques helped to identify the contributing residual motions that helped to form the different secondary structures of the protein and also the triggering factors that drive these sorts of residual motions. The structural details match the experimentally reported data. It was found that the direction of the change of the secondary structure for this peptide shifted from the C-terminal to the N-terminal with an increase in the temperature. It was found that the involvement of the hydrophobic residues present at the C-terminal and the middle residues (residues 12-17) is responsible for forming a beta-sheet at the normal temperature. Hydration water was found to play an important role in this change. Insights gained from this study can be used to design strategies for desirable structural changes in the IDPs.

AB  - Background Several studies stablished a relationship between metabolic disturbances and Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) where inflammation plays a pivotal role. However, mechanisms involved still remain unclear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate central and peripheral effects of dexibuprofen (DXI) in the progression of AD in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) female mice, a familial AD model, fed with high fat diet (HFD). Animals were fed either with conventional chow or with HFD, from their weaning until their sacrifice, at 6 months. Moreover, mice were divided into subgroups to which were administered drinking water or water supplemented with DXI (20 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) for 3 months. Before sacrifice, body weight, intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance test (IP-ITT) were performed to evaluate peripheral parameters and also behavioral tests to determine cognitive decline. Moreover, molecular studies such as Western blot and RT-PCR were carried out in liver to confirm metabolic effects and in hippocampus to analyze several pathways considered hallmarks in AD. Results Our studies demonstrate that DXI improved metabolic alterations observed in transgenic animals fed with HFD in vivo, data in accordance with those obtained at molecular level. Moreover, an improvement of cognitive decline and neuroinflammation among other alterations associated with AD were observed such as beta-amyloid plaque accumulation and unfolded protein response. Conclusions Collectively, evidence suggest that chronic administration of DXI prevents the progression of AD through the regulation of inflammation which contribute to improve hallmarks of this pathology. Thus, this compound could constitute a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of AD in a combined therapy.

AB  - The growing and widespread use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) has raised an intense public debate about the impact of environmental contamination on animal and human health, including male fertility. The aim of this study was to deepen the impact of glyphosate (Gly) and GBHs on mammalian sperm investigating the effect of in vitro exposure of stallion spermatozoa to Gly and to its commercial formulation Roundup (R) (R).
   Spermatozoa were incubated at 37 degrees C with different Gly or R concentrations (from 0.5 to 720 mg/mL Gly or R at the same Gly-equivalent concentrations). After 1 h of incubation motility, viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity and ROS production were assessed. Gly, at all the concentrations tested, did not induce any detrimental impact on the sperm quality parameters evaluated. Conversely, R starting from 360 mg/mL (Gly-equivalent dose) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased total and progressive motility, viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity and the percentage of live spermatozoa with intact mitochondria not producing ROS.
   Our results indicate that the commercial formulation R is more toxic than its active molecule Gly and that the negative impact on stallion sperm motility might be likely due to a detrimental effect mainly at membrane and mitochondrial level and, at least in part, to redox unbalance. Moreover, based on the data obtained, it can be hypothesized a species-specificity in sperm sensitivity to Gly and GBHs as horse spermatozoa were negatively influenced at higher concentrations of R compared to those reported in literature to be toxic for human and swine male germ cells.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of exogenous melatonin (MT) on the physiological responses of Camellia hainanica seedlings under drought stress, using the drought-tolerant variety "Hai Da 1" and the drought-sensitive variety "Wan Hai 1" as test materials. Seedlings were treated with MT at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mu mol/L through irrigation, followed by drought stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000). The results revealed that MT alleviated growth damage caused by PEG-simulated drought stress, with leaf relative conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content showing an initial decrease followed by an increase as MT concentration rose. In contrast, relative water content, chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity, secondary metabolite levels, and carbohydrate content initially increased and then declined with increasing MT concentration. Treatment with 200 mu mol/L MT notably reduced MDA content by 40-50%, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity by 20-30%, and increased secondary metabolite levels by 11-42% in the drought-sensitive variety. These findings identified 200 mu mol/L MT as the optimal concentration for mitigating drought stress in C. hainanica seedlings, providing a foundation for its practical application in C. hainanica production and further research into the drought resistance mechanisms mediated by MT.

AB  - The evolution of oviposition preference in insects is considered a key evolutionary strategy in the context of host-plant interaction. It is hypothesized that insects maximize the survival and fitness of the subsequent generations by preferring specific host plant(s), known as the "preference-performance hypothesis." In this study, we tested whether adult host preference reflects the immature performance in an oligophagous insect, Phthorimaea absoluta Meyrick, a rapidly emerging invasive pest in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Based on a preliminary survey of the potential host plants of P. absoluta, we selected 6 Solanaceae species, namely, tomato, potato, eggplant, black nightshade, sweet pepper, and tobacco, for the oviposition preference studies. The results indicated that the tomato was the most preferred host in no-, dual- and multiple-choice assays, followed by potato, eggplant, and black nightshade. Subsequently, the insect life-table parameters were found to be superior on tomato compared to other hosts. The order of oviposition preference on the host plants was strongly correlated with the life-table parameters of P. absoluta. Thus, we provide clear evidence for the preference-performance hypothesis in the host selection behavior of P. absoluta. We also emphasize the necessity of conducting oviposition behavior research at various geographic locations to develop tailor-made integrated pest management programs.

AB  - Many neotropical ants form mutualistic associations with myrmecophytes, receiving shelter and/or food in exchange for protection. However, our knowledge about their natural history is still unclear. Here, we investigate the natural history of ant Pseudomyrmex concolor that nests inside the foliar rachis of Tachigali myrmecophila (Fabaceae). We describe the nest architecture, colony structure and rhythm activity of P. concolor in the Brazilian Amazon. We found P. concolor nests exclusively in T. myrmecophila. Its colony is established by claustral foundation with an independent queen, which remains the colony's only egg-laying. The nest of P. concolor is a hollow tubular construction of the swollen leaf petiole that constitutes the domatia of T. myrmecophila. The colony structure of P. concolor (eggs, larvae, pupae and adults) depends on plant traits, such as plant height, number of leaves and internal space of the domatia. Tachigali myrmecophila does not provide food for P. concolor, and the mealybugs are their only food source. Pseudomyrmex concolor has a bimodal cycle of activity, patrolling its host plant for 24 h a day and throughout the year, mainly during the Amazonian rainy season nights. Humidity and temperature are environmental factors that can explain much of the variation in the rhythm of this ant species daily activity, but not the change between the seasons. Our findings improve the knowledge of ant-plant mutualisms and eco-evolutionary studies on tropical forests.

AB  - Simple Summary Plant defensive compounds are the effective measures for host plants to defend against herbivorous insects, whereas in turn insects evolve an array of detoxifying enzymes to overcome the resistance of these compounds. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance of plant toxins to herbivores are still unclear. This study uses an integrative approach to investigate the molecular basis of how brown planthopper uses glutathione S-transferases to detoxify gramine, an important defensive toxin in rice. We show here that gramine can induce the activity and increase the transcripts of glutathione S-transferase in brown planthopper. Knockdown of seven glutathione S-transferase family genes of brown planthopper increases its sensitivity to gramine. The glutathione S-transferase activity is regulated by the expression of three key genes (NlGST1-1, NlGSTD2, and NlGSTE1), as silencing of these genes significantly inhibits this enzyme's activity. The current study identifies a few key glutathione S-transferase genes involved in the detoxification of gramine in brown planthopper. Our findings unravel the molecular mechanisms of the detoxification of plant defensive chemicals by glutathione S-transferases, providing a new potential pest control strategy that uses the method of RNA interference to deplete this gene family to increase the efficiency of host resistance to herbivores. Phytochemical toxins are considered a defense measure for herbivore invasion. To adapt this defensive strategy, herbivores use glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) as an important detoxification enzyme to cope with toxic compounds, but the underlying molecular basis for GST genes in this process remains unclear. Here, we investigated the basis of how GST genes in brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal)) participated in the detoxification of gramine by RNA interference. For BPH, the LC25 and LC50 concentrations of gramine were 7.11 and 14.99 mu g/mL at 72 h after feeding, respectively. The transcriptions of seven of eight GST genes in BPH were induced by a low concentration of gramine, and GST activity was activated. Although interferences of seven genes reduced BPH tolerance to gramine, only the expression of NlGST1-1, NlGSTD2, and NlGSTE1 was positively correlated with GST activities, and silencing of these three genes inhibited GST activities in BPH. Our findings reveal that two new key genes, NlGSTD2 and NlGSTE1, play an essential role in the detoxification of gramine such as NlGST1-1 does in BPH, which not only provides the molecular evidence for the coevolution theory, but also provides new insight into the development of an environmentally friendly strategy for herbivore population management.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Plants have developed many kinds of indirect defense mechanisms against herbivorous insects, through which the natural enemies are attracted by herbivore-induced plant volatiles to prey on these phytophagous species. There have been many reports regarding this mechanism in spermatophytes, but little is known in ferns. In this study, the relationship between the fern species Hypolepis punctata and the predatory insect Sclomina erinacea was studied. Employing field observations, plant volatile analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and behavioral experiments, we found that not only the plant can attract the assassin bug in the field, but compared with the healthy individuals, the fern being damaged by herbivorous insects also emitted several novel volatile organic compounds, which were strongly attractive to the assassin bug. The results indicate that ferns may also have indirect defense mechanisms using volatile organic compounds, and it is the first report of an indirect defense mechanism in fern.<br>Plants have evolved various self-defense mechanisms against insect feeding. There are many reports regarding both direct and indirect defense mechanisms in seed-plant. However, only direct defenses on ferns were considered and the indirect defense mechanism has never been reported. In this study, it was observed that the fern Hypolepis punctata can attract the assassin bug Sclomina erinacea in the field. We collected and analyzed volatiles from H. punctata healthy individuals and the ones wounded by Bertula hadenalis, using dynamic headspace and GC-MS. We recorded the electroantennogram responses of antennae of S. erinacea to different standards of volatile compounds identified from the GC-MS analysis. We also analyzed the behavior of male and female S. erinacea adults in response to volatiles collected from H. punctata using a Y-tube olfactometer. The results showed that a number of volatile compounds were produced when the fern was damaged by B. hadenalis. Electroantennography and Y-tube olfactometer results showed that some herbivore-induced volatiles and volatiles from undamaged leaves could attract S. erinacea. Our research suggests that H. punctata can attract insect predators by releasing herbivory-induced volatile organic compounds, and for the first time we found ferns may also have indirect defense mechanisms using volatile organic compounds.

AB  - Herbivores use plant chemicals for host plant selection to maximize their own and/or offspring performance. Since host plants that are optimal for mother and offspring are often different and spatially/temporally separated, it remains unclear how plant chemicals are associated with trade-offs between adult preference and larval performance. We found that adults of the rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus), one of the most important pests on rice in the world, preferred volatiles from barnyard grass over rice and tended to feed and oviposit on barnyard grass compared with rice. In contrast, larvae performed better on rice roots than on barnyard grass roots. Chemical analyses further showed that rice roots had higher nitrogen and soluble protein but lower lignin and cellulose contents than barnyard grass. Together, these results suggest that volatile emissions, specific non-volatile nutritive and defensive chemicals may have close correlations with trade-offs of the adult preference and larval performance between these two hosts. As developing chemical-based technology is one of the main approaches for the control of pest insects, our findings may also contribute to the future efforts for management of the rice water weevil.

AB  - Enteric greenhouse gas (GHG) emission remains a challenge in modern livestock production as it relates environmental perspectives to animal production. In view of this, constant attempts are made to use ingredients that reduce enteric GHG emission and improve energy efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the effect of lupin seeds as a functional feed additive on in vitro ruminal fermentation, and methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Lupin seed lowered the proportion of CH4 in the total biogas production. Also, lupin seed increased fiber digestibility, total short-chain fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and microbial protein. Lupin seed at 2.0% supplementation increased gas production, enhanced nutrient degradability, and reduced the proportion of methane in every volume of biogas produced. The results suggest that lupin seed can be an ecofriendly ingredient that can be added to ruminant diet. The inevitable enteric gas emission from ruminants is considered a modern-day problem from an environmental perspective. Addressing this problem requires nutritional approaches such as the use of phytogenic additives in ruminant diets. In this regard, lupin seed (LS) can be a useful additive due to its phytochemical constituents. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) seed supplementation as a functional and sustainable feed additive in sheep diet (50:50 concentrate-to-forage ratio) on in vitro gas production (GP; mL/g DM), methane (CH4; mL/g DM) and carbon dioxide (CO2; mL/g DM) emissions, fermentation parameters, and nutrient degradability (g/kg DM incubated). Gas production and CH4 were measured per gram of incubated dry matter (DM), degradable DM (dDM), degradable neutral detergent fiber (dNDF), and degradable acid detergent fiber (dADF). Lupin seeds were included at 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2% of the diet. The seeds contained 3.27% essential oils (DM basis), with eucalyptol as the main phytochemical. The highest GP per gram of DM and dDM was observed (p < 0.01) with 2.0% LS supplementation level. While 1.0% LS had the highest GP per gram of dNDF, 0.5% lupin diet had the highest GP per gram of dADF. Asymptotic GP and CH4 emissions linearly and quadratically increased (p < 0.01) with increasing LS level, while lag time decreased. Despite increased CH4 production, the proportion of CH4 in total biogas was lower (p = 0.008) for LS treatments than the control, with the 0.5% LS showing the lowest CH4 proportion. Production of CO2 increased with lupin seed treatments, with 0.5% LS producing the highest proportion (p = 0.027). Degradability of DM, NDF, and ADF was greater (p < 0.01) for the high LS supplementation level, while 0.5% supplementation level decreased ADF degradability. Total short-chain fatty acids, acetic acid, and propionic acid increased (p < 0.05) with LS supplementation level, leading to a reduced acetate:propionate ratio. Rumen pH decreased (p = 0.036) with LS supplementation, while ammonia-N decreased (p = 0.045) and estimated metabolizable energy increased (p < 0.001) linearly. Calculated microbial protein synthesis (p = 0.005) and gas yield (p = 0.047) increased with LS supplementation level. LS supplementation at 2.0% of diet (DM basis) increased GP and CH4 emission (mL/g DM) and enhanced nutrient degradability, suggesting its potential use as a functional feed additive for ruminants when supplemented at a 2.
   0% level into diet.

AB  - Termite colony foundation precedes the incipient stage, when the first oviposition cycle takes place, followed by months of reproductive inactivity. The royal couple is supposed to cease oviposition during this period, investing energy to care for the first brood. When a suitable number of alloparents differentiate, egg-laying resumes. Here we followed oviposition dynamics, embryo development and queen/king body changes in laboratory colonies of the major pest species Coptotermes gestroi (Rhinotermitidae) and Cryptotermes brevis (Kalotermitidae) during 9 months. We show that they differ in these oviposition dynamics, as C. gestroi queens displayed an uninterrupted oviposition whereas C. brevis laid a cohort of eggs and ceased oviposition during a 3-month period (lag phase). C. gestroi oviposition dynamic was remarkable and suggests that occurrence of progeny was not a limiting factor, thus queens and kings were able to concomitantly invest energy in reproduction and parental care. These findings contrast those reported for rhinotermitids from temperate areas, and we discuss the likely reasons for such a condition, including endogenous rhythms, avoidance of a high mortality rate of the first progeny and adaptation to the weather conditions of the Neotropical region. Oviposition dynamic in C. brevis resembled those of several termite species, in which the royal couple cease reproduction to care for the first brood. Rearing conditions did not influence oviposition dynamics (egg-laying cycle followed by a lag phase), thus our results on the oviposition of C. gestroi and C. brevis correspond to different reproductive strategies post-foundation adopted by these pest species.

AB  - Theanine, a unique non-proteinogenic amino acid, is one of the most abundant secondary metabolites in tea. Its content largely determines green tea quality and price. However, its physiological roles in tea plants remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that salt stress significantly increased the accumulation of glutamate, glutamine, alanine, proline, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, as well as theanine, in the new shoots of tea plants. We further found that salt stress induced the expression of theanine biosynthetic genes, including CsGOGATs, CsAlaDC, and CsTSI, suggested that salt stress induced theanine biosynthesis. Importantly, applying theanine to the new shoots significantly enhanced the salt stress tolerance. Similar effects were also found in a model plant Arabidopsis. Notably, exogenous theanine application increased the antioxidant activity of the shoots under salt stress, suggested by reduced the reactive oxygen species accumulation and lipid peroxidation, as well as by the increased SOD, CAT, and APX activities and expression of the corresponding genes. Finally, genetic evidence supported that catalase-mediated antioxidant scavenging pathway is required for theanine-induced salt stress tolerance. Taken together, this study suggested that salt stress induces theanine biosynthesize in tea plants to enhance the salt stress tolerance through a CAT-dependent redox homeostasis pathway.

AB  - Understanding plant-insect interactions can help control the harm of herbivorous pests. According to transcriptome data, transcripts of Solanum lycopersicum responding to feeding by Tuta absoluta were screened for important endopeptidase inhibitors. These genes were annotated as serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors from the potato inhibitor I family, potato type II proteinase inhibitor family, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) family. Based on the analysis of expression patterns, Solyc09g084480.2, Solyc03g020080.2, Solyc03g098760.1, and Solyc01g009020.1 were identified as key genes in the defense system of S. lycopersicum. The major endopeptidase genes such as Tabs008250, Tabs007396, and Tabs005701 in the larval stages of T. absoluta were also detected as potential targets of the plant endopeptidase inhibitors. The interaction mode between these endopeptidase and endopeptidase inhibitors was predicted based on the protein structure construction. This study aims to reveal the molecular response of S. lycopersicum to feeding by T. absoluta with high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

AB  - Understanding tri-trophic interactions and the relationship among plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies is fundamental to advancing theoretical and practical ecology. Parasitoidism is among those interactions where tri-trophic levels are usually developed, with hyperparasitism and kleptoparasitism as examples. This study explores the interaction between fig wasps of the genera PhysothoraxMayr, 1885 and Sycophila Walker, 1871 (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) and the gall midge Ficiomyia brasiliensis Urso-Guimar & atilde;es, 2024 (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) associated with Ficus citrifolia Mill. in Ribeir & atilde;o Preto, Brazil. Through behavioral observations and larval dissections we document the "drill on drill" strategy where Sycophila females utilize oviposition holes drilled by Physothorax females on the fig surface to access the host gall midge immatures. This behavior suggests a sophisticated adaptation for reducing oviposition time and conserving energy. Additionally, Sycophila behavior aligns with kleptoparasitic and hyperparasitic strategies, indicating a complex evolutionary history and ecological interaction. Our findings provide insight into the intricate relationships among non-pollinating fig wasps and their hosts, contributing to the broader understanding of tri-trophic interactions in fig microcosm.

AB  - Insect herbivores adapt and develop strategies to counteract plant chemical defenses. The aphid Uroleucon formosanum is a serious sap-sucking pest that infests lettuces containing toxic sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). Herein, we employed a combination of genome sequencing and RNA-seq transcriptome profiling to understand the mechanisms underlying phytotoxin tolerance in U. formosanum. We generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly for U. formosanum, with a total size of 453.26 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 33.22 Mb. Comparative genomic analyses revealed an enrichment of signals for positive selection and gene family expansion in immune-related pathways. Specifically, the expanded set of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) genes showed upregulation after treatment with lactucin, suggesting that they may play a role in the immune response against STLs. The expression of takeout-like genes and cuticle-associated genes was also significantly increased in the lactucin-treated samples. Additionally, 53 cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, 30 carboxylesterase, 19 glutathione S-transferase, 32 uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase and 63 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes were identified in the U. formosanum genome. CYP4C1, CYP6A13 and 7 ABC genes were strongly upregulated in response to lactucin treatment, indicating the involvement of detoxifying enzymes in the tolerance of U. formosanum to STLs. Our findings suggest that the cuticle barrier, immune response and enzyme-mediated metabolic detoxification jointly enhance the tolerance of U. formosanum to phytotoxins and promote its adaptation to host plants. This study presents a valuable genomic resource and provides insights into insect adaptation to plant chemical challenges and future technological developments for pest management.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a key role in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals of herbivorous insects. Here, we investigated the role of cytochrome P450 enzyme genes in the metabolism of glucosinolates in the pea aphids. The results showed that compared with the control untreated group, the transcription levels of two cytochrome P450 enzyme genes, ApCYP4C6 and ApCYP4C7, were significantly increased at 24 h and 48 h after glucosinolates treatment. Furthermore, after the aphids were treated with dsCYP4C6 (double stranded CYP4C6) for 48 h, the expression level of ApCYP4C6 in the aphids was significantly decreased, and its mortality was significantly increased by glucosinolates comparing with that of the dsGFP group. The present study demon-strated that ApCYP4C6 was involved in the metabolism of glucosinolates by the pea aphids and contributed to further understanding the role of P450 genes in the tolerance of the pea aphids to plant secondary metabolites.

AB  - The aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch sucks cell sap from flowers and leaves of Lathyrus sativus L. Females were attracted towards volatiles from undamaged (UD) and insect-damaged (ID) flowers of two L. sativus cultivars [BIO L 212 Ratan (BIO) and Nirmal B-1 (NIR)] against solvent controls (CH2Cl2) in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. ID flower volatiles were not less attractive than UD flower volatiles. Females were repelled from volatiles of jasmonic-acid (JA) treated flowers. Synthetic blends resembling UD or ID flower volatiles were attractive than solvent controls. Females could not differentiate between natural flower volatiles and synthetic blends resembling UD or ID flower volatiles. A synthetic blend of 1-nonanol and 1-hexadecene resembling amounts released by ID NIR flower volatiles could be used as lures in developing bait for traps to control this insect pest in integrated pest management programs. Females were repelled from synthetic blends comprised of farnesene, beta-caryophyllene and methyl jasmonate resembling amounts released by JA treated flower volatiles. Both these blends could be applied in L. sativus crop fields during flowering to repel A. craccivora.

AB  - A deficiency in the shortest dystrophin-gene product, Dp71, is a pivotal aggravating factor for intellectual disabilities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Recent advances in preclinical research have achieved some success in compensating both muscle and brain dysfunctions associated with DMD, notably using exon skipping strategies. However, this has not been studied for distal mutations in the DMD gene leading to Dp71 loss. In this study, we aimed to restore brain Dp71 expression in the Dp71-null transgenic mouse using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) administrated either by intracardiac injections at P4 (ICP4) or by bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in adults. ICP4 delivery of the AAV9-Dp71 vector enabled the expression of 2 to 14% of brain Dp71, while ICV delivery enabled the overexpression of Dp71 in the hippocampus and cortex of adult mice, with anecdotal expression in the cerebellum. The restoration of Dp71 was mostly located in the glial endfeet that surround capillaries, and it was associated with partial localization of Dp71-associated proteins, alpha 1-syntrophin and AQP4 water channels, suggesting proper restoration of a scaffold of proteins involved in blood-brain barrier function and water homeostasis. However, this did not result in significant improvements in behavioral disturbances displayed by Dp71-null mice. The potential and limitations of this AAV-mediated strategy are discussed. This proof-of-concept study identifies key molecular markers to estimate the efficiencies of Dp71 rescue strategies and opens new avenues for enhancing gene therapy targeting cognitive disorders associated with a subgroup of severely affected DMD patients.

AB  - Protected areas such as national parks constitute an increasing land mass globally, but these areas are under increasing threat from climate change events such as drought, flooding, and bushfires. The recent Yosemite National Park fires in California provide an example of this issue. After any such disaster, authorities will need to restore those protected areas to their former state at significant costs within any public funding cycle. To corroborate that request, clear economic assessments of total costs and benefits will be required. However, in previous studies of these issues a complete set of government cost and/or benefit data may not be provided, skewing assessment results accordingly. Using South Australia's Kangaroo Island protected areas-which were significantly destroyed by bushfire in 2019-20-as a case study with a unique set of State government cost data we calculate a set of analyses via economic methods. Despite significant restoration costs the study found the discounted net present value of returning tourists to the Island is 3.15 over ten years for park tourism and regional economic impacts, providing an internal rate of return of 22%. The rebuild work is also expected to support around 430 full time equivalent (FTE) jobs during construction, with a return to full tourism supporting another 744 FTEs across relevant sectors (e.g. accommodation, retail) of the Kangaroo Island economy. This robust assessment makes it far easier for protected area managers to argue their funding case.

AB  - Exploitation of naturally occurring genetic mutations could empower the discovery of novel aspects of established cancer genes. We report here that TRPS1, a gene linked to the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) and recently identified as a potential breast cancer driver, promotes breast carcinogenesis through regulating replication. Epigenomic decomposition of TRPS1 landscape reveals nearly half of H3K9me3marked heterochromatic origins are occupied by TRPS1, where it encourages the chromatin loading of APC/C, resulting in uncontrolled origin refiring. TRPS1 binds to the genome through its atypical H3K9me3 reading via GATA and IKAROS domains, while TRPS-related mutations affect its chromatin binding, replication boosting, and tumorigenicity. Concordantly, overexpression of wild-type but not TRPS-associated mutants of TRPS1 is sufficient to drive cancer genome amplifications, which experience an extrachromosomal route and dynamically evolve to confer therapeutic resistance. Together, these results uncover a critical function of TRPS1 in driving heterochromatin origin firing and breast cancer genome evolution.

AB  - At the onset of lactation, dairy animals are exposed to novel stimuli within the mechanical milking environment, which can induce stress. This is particularly pronounced in camels due to their sensitive and potentially maternal aggressive nature. To propose strategies to reduce these stress, this study aimed to assess the behavioural and milking responses of dairy camels during their first milking sessions with a focus on the influence of dams' experience. Eleven dairy camels were included in this study, with 5 undergoing their inaugural milking season (designated as the N_Exp group) and 6 camels having prior exposure to machine milking during previous lac-tations (designated as the Exp group). Camels were milked with an individual portable milking machine set to 48 kPa Vacuum and 60 pulsations/min. Throughout this trial, behavioural data, rumination occurrence, need of oxytocin injection to induce milk ejection, milk yield, time to milk ejection and milking duration were recorded during the 3 weeks training period of camels. A training index (T.I.) was calculated to quantify milking adap-tation from behavioural responses. Stress-related behaviours were classified into fear-related behaviours such as jumping, decubitus, trembling, vocalization and escape attempts) as well as defensive behaviours including kicking, stepping, spitting, and biting. Results showed that N Exp camels expressed fear-related behaviours more frequently (P < 0.05) while displaying a lower training index (P < 0.0001) compared to Exp camels. All stress behaviours decreased significantly throughout the training period for both groups. The need for exogenous oxytocin decreased from 100% at the first day of machine milking to 35% for N_Exp group and from 27.8% to 8.3% for Exp group. The camel's experience had no effect (p = 0.4200) on the rumination frequency. However, rumination occurred more and more frequently (P < 0.0001) during the camels' training period. Time to milk ejection, total and effective milking durations were significantly shorter for experienced camels and reduced throughout the camels' training period (P< 0.0001). Milk production increased gradually for both groups by 71.75% and 61.83% for Exp and N_Exp respectively during camels' training period. In conclusion, acclimation of camels to machine milking was accompanied by a reduction of acute stress behaviours occurrences, an increase in milk production and a shortening and normalisation of milking sessions. Experienced camels were easier to train to machine milking. These results underscore the importance of improving procedures of milking habitu-ation to mitigate stress of the first milking session and improve the welfare of dairy camels.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationships within the order Chiroptera (bats) have long been debated. The suborder classification of Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, based on morphology and molecular phylogenetic studies, remains controversial. The topologies of the superfamilies Noctilionoidea, Emballonuridea, and Vespertilionidea, as well as the subfamilies within Vespertiliondae and Phyllostomatidae and tribes within Vespertilionae, are unstable. Moreover, the classification of the species group within Rhinolophus remains to be clarified. To address these issues, we compiled a dataset of 219 complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) for 187 bat species, including 54 newly sequenced mitogenomes. This extensive dataset covers 13 bat families and 32% of all extant bat genera, enabling the construction of a comprehensive bat phylogeny. Furthermore, we constructed a phylogenetic tree containing 50 bat species based on 200 orthologous nuclear genes to compare with the mitogenome-based phylogeny. Our results supported the suborder classification of Yinptero- and Yangochiroptera. Bayesian dating suggests that bats originated approximately 59 Mya, with two suborders diverging at the beginning of the Eocene epoch. Our findings highly supported the superfamily Emballonuridea as the sister to Noctilionoidea and Vespertilionidea. We found that conflicts in suborder and superfamily topologies were mainly caused by incomplete lineage sorting. Furthermore, we refined the topology of subfamilies within Vespertiliondae and Phyllomatidae, and six tribes within Vespertilioninae. Our study also revealed Myotinae as a subfamily rather than a family. Additionally, we observed a decrease in C/T ratios in the family Vespertilionidae, likely related to their higher mass-specific metabolic rates. We identified a significant negative correlation between selection pressure on COX3 and migratory distance, indicating its importance in flight adaptability. This study offers novel insights into bat phylogeny and flight adaptation.

AB  - Plants can acquire an enhanced resistance against pathogen by application of natural or artificial compounds. Application of these compounds results in earlier, faster and/or stronger responses of plant to the subsequent pathogen attacks, a process called chemical priming. Beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) is recognized for its inducing and priming ability to enhance plant resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, BABA potential to induce and prime pepper plant (Capsicum annuum) resistance against the invasively polyphagous MEAM1 whitefly remains understudied. In the present study, we sprayed pepper plants with 20 mM BABA to assess its defense responses, as well as the host preference and performance of MEAM1. We found that MEAM1 showed a substantial preference for settling and laying eggs and a significantly higher performance on untreated plants in comparison with those treated with BABA. Compared with the control plants, BABA-treated pepper plants significantly increased the contents of total phenols and flavonoids, which coincided with the increased expression of the genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. These results suggest that induced resistance of pepper by BABA application reduced MEAM1 host preference and performance. Furthermore, MEAM1 infestation on BABA-treated pepper plants significantly increased the contents of total phenols and flavonoids, and their expression of the genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, our findings suggest that BABA is a potent chemical inducer and priming agent, capable of bolstering pepper resistance against MEAM1. The resistance mechanism is partly due to the activation of the salicylic acid (SA) signaling and the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways.

AB  - The present research investigates host preferences and larval development of the melon ladybird Chnootriba elaterii (Rossi) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), considering seven Cucurbitaceae plant species (Citrullus lanatus, Cucumis melo, Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita moschata, Lagenaria siceraria and Luffa aegyptiaca), to determine whether mother host preference is related with larval performance. The damaged area on plant leaves due to insect feeding in dual-choice experiments was used to evaluate food preferences. Behavioural experiments in a Y-tube olfactometer tested the role of olfaction in host-plant selection. Parameters such as development duration and morphometric characters of emerged adults were evaluated to estimate larval performance. Adult females selected watermelon and melon as their favourite food while firmly refusing loofah and calabash. Insects preferred melon over watermelon, but the larval development on melon was slower; moreover, watermelon allowed larvae to develop faster than other tested plants, while loofah did not allow larval development. Larvae fed and developed on melon, pumpkin, zucchini, cucumber and calabash, without strong differences. These results only partially supported the preference-performance hypothesis suggesting that it could be context dependent. Contrary to expectation, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) belonging to the host, only partially could guide adult females in the olfactometer. This result suggests that long-distance olfactory stimuli alone cannot provide sufficient information for host-plant selection in melon ladybirds. Considering the economic relevance of C. elaterii, the results of the present paper answer some basic questions about host-plant selection for this pest insect, potentially useful to improve control strategies in crops.

AB  - Simple Summary Lines of White Leghorn chickens divergently selected for high or low antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) have undergone selection for 50 generations. These lines have allowed for insights into understanding the phenotypic and genotypic changes occurring under phenotypic selection for this single trait. When collecting organ samples from 18-day embryos of generation 48, a difference was seen in the size of the spleen. This observation led to the question of whether the growth of organs associated with immunity had changed after almost 50 generations of selection. Body weights and weights of immune organs representing both primary and secondary immune systems were taken at nine time points. The results showed that divergent selection for the response to SRBC and relaxation of selection resulted in differences in spleen and bursa weights during the later stages of embryonic development and early post-hatch.Abstract Long-term divergent selection from a common founder population for a single trait-antibody response to sheep erythrocytes 5 days post-injection-has resulted in two distinct lines of White Leghorn chickens with a well-documented difference in antibody titers: high (HAS)- and low (LAS)-antibody selected lines. Subpopulations-high (HAR)- and low (LAR)-antibody relaxed-were developed from generation 24 of the selected lines to relax selection. The objective of the current experiment was to determine if this long-term selection and relaxation of selection impacted the growth of two organs important to chicken immunity: the spleen and the bursa of Fabricius. Spleens and bursae were obtained from ten chickens per line at nine timepoints (E18, D0, D6, D13, D20, D35, D49, D63, and D91) throughout their rapid growth phase and presented as a percent of body weight. Significance was set at p <= 0.05. For the spleen, all lines consistently increased in size relative to body weight to D49, followed by a consistent decline. All lines had a similar growth pattern, but HAS spleens grew faster than LAS spleens. For the bursa, LAS was smaller than the other three lines as an embryo and also smaller than HAS through D63. In the selected lines, bursa weight peaked at D35, whereas the relaxed lines peaked at D49. By D91, there was no difference between lines. Artificial and natural selection, represented by the long-term selected and relaxed antibody lines, resulted in differences in the growth patterns and relative weights of the spleen and bursa of Fabricius.

AB  - Brown planthoppers (BPHs, Nilaparvata lugens St & aring;l) are a major threat to rice cultivation in Asia, necessitating the development of pest-resistant varieties for effective management. However, the adaptability of BPHs has resulted in the development of virulent populations, such as biotype Y BPHs, which exhibit significant virulence against the rice variety YHY15 that harbors the resistance gene Bph15. The various response mechanisms of BPH populations to resistant rice varieties are critical yet underexplored. Via RNA sequencing, the present study identified distinct transcriptional profiles in avirulent (biotype 1) and virulent (biotype Y) BPH nymphs both before and after feeding on YHY15 rice. Our findings revealed differential expression patterns of gene clusters involved in protein synthesis, hydrolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, metabolism, cuticle composition, and translocation. Further analysis elucidated changes in the expression of genes associated with longevity and structural components of cuticles, highlighting specific disruptions in both biotype 1 and biotype Y BPHs. Moreover, the two biotypes showed differences in the expression level of genes involved in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. A functional assessment of ABC transporter genes revealed a role of NlABCG14 in the honeydew production of biotype Y BPHs to YHY15 rice, without impacting their survival and developmental dynamics. These insights deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of virulent BPHs response to resistant rice varieties and highlight potential targets for improving pest management strategies.

AB  - Predators and parasitoids locate herbivore-infested plants via detection of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are released in response to pest damage. Synthetic HIPVs have been proposed as tools to enhance the biological control of crop pests. The sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a key herbivore pest of sugarcane, Saccharum spp. (Poaceae), in the Americas. To manage D. saccharalis in Brazil, more than 3 million ha of sugarcane have been treated with the larval parasitoid Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). In this study, the role of sugarcane HIPVs as cues in the host-finding process of C. flavipes was investigated using a combination of dynamic headspace collection, chemical analysis, and laboratory behavior experiments. Comparison of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) collected from D. saccharalis-damaged and healthy sugarcane revealed very similar profiles, apart from significantly higher levels of the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene released from damaged plants. Naive female C. flavipes spent significantly more time in the olfactometer arm containing VOCs from D. saccharalis-damaged plants but showed no preference for VOCs from healthy plants. When (E)-caryophyllene was added to VOCs from healthy plants, parasitoids spent more time in the arm containing the combined treatment. Furthermore, in a dose-response experiment with synthetic (E)-caryophyllene, naive parasitoids preferred the compound across a dose range of 3-300 ng, and experienced parasitoids - preexposed to (E)-caryophyllene - responded to doses of (E)-caryophyllene as low as 0.03 ng. These results suggest that C. flavipes can use (E)-caryophyllene as a cue to locate D. saccharalis-infested sugarcane plants. Moreover, experienced females appear to respond to lower doses than naive females. These results potentially pave the way for increasing the efficiency of C. flavipes in biological control of D. saccharalis, the most important pest of sugarcane and maize crops in the Western Hemisphere, and also a major pest of rice and sorghum crops.

AB  - Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner (variegated thistle, milk thistle) is one of the worst weeds of hill country pasture in the east coast regions of New Zealand. A recent field survey in New Zealand found low levels of attack from generalist herbivores and minimal attack by the specialist weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus (Frolich). In the native range of Europe there are at least 41 insects and 12 fungi sufficiently specialised to be considered for biocontrol. The literature search revealed some potential biocontrol agents not known during the historical biocontrol surveys for S. marianum. These include the specialised biotypes of the tephritid fly, Terellia fuscicornis Loew, and the seedhead weevil, Larinus latus Herbst. The literature search also revealed the discovery of the stem-galling cynpid wasps, Aulacidea freesei Nieves-Aldrey and Phanacis zwoelferi Nieves-Aldrey, that are likely specific to S. marianum. The discovery of the smut fungus, Microbotryum silybum Vanky & Berner, host specific to Silybum species, is another promising biocontrol candidate. A shortlist of nine priority agents (eight insects and one fungal pathogen) were selected based on reported affinity for S. marianum, evidence for impact on the weed, and niches attacked. In the case of S. marianum, there are sufficiently specialised agents that attack several niches, including seeds, stems, and the root or root collar. Testing for complementary agents that attack different niches is likely to improve the chance of successful biocontrol. It is recommended that S. marianum be considered a priority target for classical biocontrol in New Zealand.

AB  - Simple Summary Sitobion avenae Fabricius is an important wheat aphid species in China, causing significant losses to wheat production. Improving host-plant resistance is an effective and environmentally friendly method of aphid control. Sitobion avenae resistance and the total phenolic and flavonoid content accumulation of six wheat cultivars to S. avenae infestation were investigated to elucidate responses of six wheat varieties against S. avenae. Among the six tested wheat cultivars, Yongliang No.15 and Ganchun No.18 demonstrated high resistance to S. avenae. The correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between total phenol and flavonoid content accumulation and developmental duration (DD), and a negative relationship between accumulation and weight gain (WG) and mean relative growth rate (MRGR). The correlation between flavonoid and biological parameters was statistically stronger than total phenol. Our findings could serve as a theoretical basis for further research into the resistance mechanism of wheat varieties to S. avenae. Resistant variety screening is widely recommended for the management of Sitobion avenae. The purpose of this study was to assess responses of six wheat varieties (lines) to S. avenae. The aphid quantity ratio (AQR) was used to assess S. avenae resistance. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to perform a correlation analysis between AQR, biological parameters, and the accumulation of total phenolic and flavonoid content. When compared to the other cultivars, the results showed that two cultivars, Yongliang No.15 and Ganchun No.18, had high resistance against S. avenae. The correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between total phenol and flavonoid content accumulation and developmental duration (DD), and a negative relationship between accumulation and weight gain (WG) and mean relative growth rate (MRGR). The correlation between flavonoid and biological parameters was statistically stronger than the correlation between total phenol and biological parameters. This research provides critical cues for screening and improving aphid-resistant wheat varieties in the field and will aid in our understanding of the resistance mechanism of wheat varieties against S. avenae.

AB  - This paper offers the first cladistic analysis of the genus Argentocricus Verhoeff, 1941 based on the most comprehensive morphological data matrix focusing on Rhinocricidae to date. We evaluated 50 morphological characters for 40 species as terminal taxa, representing all the nine species of Argentocricus and 31 outgroups. We performed a parsimony analysis under Implied Weighting (IW), obtaining one most parsimonious tree (K = 8.274, fit = 4.680). We obtained a monophyletic Argentocricus including two species of Rhinocricus supported by the following synapomorphies: sternite of anterior gonopod with median portion and very evident coxite; telopodite of anterior gonopod in posterior view with a membranous bulge; and external branch of the posterior gonopod digitiform. Expanded coxae of the male leg pairs 3, a character traditionally used to diagnose the genus, was not recovered as a synapomorphy. Based on the resulting topology, we propose transferring Rhinocricus boggianii Silvestri, 1898 and R. venefica Chamberlin, 1947 to Argentocricus resulting in a new combination of Argentocricus boggianii (Silvestri, 1898) comb. nov. and Argentocricus venefica comb. nov. In addition, a new diagnosis for the genus and a distribution map for all species are provided. We propose new characters potentially useful for future phylogenetic studies.

AB  - Background: Ginseng is deemed to be an effective anti-aging therapy. Evidence for differences in representative active ingredients and anti-aging effects between garden ginseng (GG) and ginseng under forest (FG) is insufficient.
   Purpose: The study was designed to systematically analyze the differences in the mechanistic protective effects of GG and FG on aging mice based on their compositional differences.
   Methods: The chemical ingredients in GG and FG were first determined. In vivo, D-galactose-induced aging mice were orally administered GG or FG (400 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Behavioral parameters of mice were measured by the radial 8-arm maze, and the changes in body weight and organ indices were recorded. Blood, brain tissue, and feces were collected for biochemical analysis, histopathological staining, Western blotting, and 16S rDNA intestinal flora sequencing, respectively.
   Results: The absolute contents of total ginsenosides, polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, starch, and protein in GG were 0.71, 0.68, 1.15, 2.27, and 1.08 folds higher than those in FG, respectively; while FG exhibited a higher relative abundance of representative active ingredients (total ginsenosides, polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, and protein) but lower relative content of starch than GG. GG and FG improved hippocampal lesions and poor weight gain, organ indices, and behavioral indices, and prevented excessive oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity in aging mice. What's more, GG and FG treatment ameliorated excessive apoptosis and inflammatory reaction in the aging brain by modulating apoptosis-related proteins, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and SIRT1/NF-kappa B pathway. GG and FG also restored the diversity and structure of gut microbiota, up-regulated the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus), and tended to exert key anti-aging effects via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Notably, in vivo experiments confirmed that FG had a stronger anti-aging activity than GG.
   Conclusion: FG exerts a more powerful anti-aging effect than GG by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and the microbe-gut-brain axis, possibly relying on the higher relative abundance of representative active ingredients (total ginsenosides, polyphenols, crude polysaccharides, and protein) in FG.

AB  - Pig skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (SK-MSCs) were transplanted onto the common peroneal nerve with a collagen tube as a preclinical large animal experiment designed to address long nerve gaps. In terms of therapeutic usefulness, a human family case was simulated by adjusting the major histocompatibility complex to 50% and 100% correspondences. Swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class I haplotypes were analyzed and clarified, as well as cell transplantation. Skeletal muscle-derived CD34+/45- (Sk-34) cells were injected into bridged tubes in two groups (50% and 100%) and with non-cell groups. Therapeutic effects were evaluated using sedentary/general behavior-based functional recovery score, muscle atrophy ratio, and immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that a two-Sk-34-cell-transplantation group showed clearly and significantly favorable functional recovery compared to a non-cell bridging-only group. Supporting functional recovery, the morphological reconstitution of the axons, endoneurium, and perineurium was predominantly evident in the transplanted groups. Thus, Sk-34 cell transplantation is effective for the regeneration of peripheral nerve gap injury. Additionally, 50% and 100% SLA correspondences were therapeutically similar and not problematic, and no adverse reaction was found in the 50% group. Therefore, the immunological response to Sk-MSCs is considered relatively low. The possibility of the Sk-MSC transplantation therapy may extend to the family members beyond the autologous transplantation.

AB  - Mortality of fish discarded from commercial fisheries is often estimated by using viability keys to parse fish into different categories with unique estimated survival outcomes. In this study we examined the relationships of environmental and physiological parameters and viability classifications of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) released from commercial longline gear using three distinct hook-release methods. Our results indicate that the hook release method used strongly influenced viability, with careful shake and gangion cut resulting in minimal injuries leading to discarded fish characterized as having excellent viability. In contrast hook stripping resulted in most released fish having moderate or poor viability. Physiological parameters (lactate, hematocrit) were strong indicators of Pacific halibut assigned to the dead viability category. In addition to being captured at greater depth and lower sea bottom temperature, dead categorized fish were associated with high plasma lactate levels and lower hematocrit, attributed to sand flea intrusion. Reducing the use of hook strippers and limiting soak times in areas of known sand flea activity are likely to improve viability outcomes of Pacific halibut released from commercial longline gear. Discard survival and understanding of the factors affecting it remain critical to successful long-term management of Pacific halibut, as sustainable fishing levels are adjusted yearly for estimated mortality consistent with recent fishing discards.

AB  - Vitrification of porcine immature oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage reduces subsequent embryo yield and changes at the molecular level may occur during embryonic development. Therefore, the present study used porcine parthenogenetic embryos as a model to investigate the effect of GV oocyte vitrification on the transcriptional profiles of the resultant embryos at the 4-cell and blastocyst stages using the Smart-seq2 RNA-seq technique. We identified 743 (420 up-regulated and 323 down-regulated) and 994 (554 up-regulated and 440 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 4-cell embryos and blastocysts derived from vitrified GV oocytes, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs in 4-cell embryos showed that vitrification of GV oocytes influenced regulatory mechanisms related to transcription regulation, apoptotic process, metabolism and key pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, DEGs in blastocysts produced from vitrified GV oocytes were enriched in critical biological functions including cell adhesion, cell migration, AMPK signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway and so on. In addition, the transcriptomic analysis and quantitative real-time PCR results were consistent. In summary, the present study revealed that the vitrification of porcine GV oocytes could alter gene expression patterns during subsequent embryonic developmental stages, potentially affecting their developmental competence.

AB  - The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is economically one of the most threatening pests in tomato cultivation, which not only causes direct damage but also transmits many viruses. Breeding whitefly-resistant tomato varieties is a promising and environmentally friendly method to control whitefly populations in the field. Accumulating evidence from tomato and other model systems demonstrates that flavonoids contribute to plant resistance to herbivorous insects. Previously, we found that high flavonoid-producing tomato line deterred whitefly oviposition and settling behaviours, and was more resistant to whiteflies compared to the near-isogenic low flavonoid-producing tomato line. The objective of the current work is to describe in detail different aspects of the interaction between the whitefly and two tomato lines, including biochemical processes involved. Electrical penetration graph recordings showed that high flavonoid-producing tomato reduced whitefly probing and phloem-feeding efficiency. We also studied constitutive and induced plant defence responses and found that whitefly induced stronger reactive oxygen species accumulation through NADPH oxidase in high flavonoid-producing tomato than in low flavonoid-producing tomato. Moreover, whitefly feeding induced the expression of callose synthase genes and resulted in callose deposition in the sieve elements in high flavonoid-producing tomato but not in low flavonoid-producing tomato. As a consequence, whitefly feeding on high flavonoid-producing tomato significantly decreased uptake of phloem and reduced its performance when compared to low flavonoid-producing tomato. These results indicate that high flavonoid-producing tomato provides phloem-based resistance against whitefly infestation and that the breeding of such resistance in new varieties could enhance whitefly management.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbiota of processed ready-to-eat (fried or boiled) edible insects sold by street vendors at local green markets in Thailand (Bangkok and Koh Samui). To this end, samples of 4 insect species (rhino beetle adults, silkworm pupae, giant waterbugs adults, and black scorpions) were collected and analyzed through viable counting and metataxonomic analysis. Enterobacteriaceae showed counts below 1 log cfu g-1 in all samples, except for black scorpions, which showed elevated counts reaching up to 4 log cfu g-1. Total mesophilic aerobes counts were up to 8 log cfu g-1 in all the analyzed samples. Counts below 1 log cfu g-1 were observed for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, sulfite-reducing clostridia viable cells and spores, and Bacillus cereus. All the samples showed the absence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. According to metataxonomic analysis, 14 taxa were consistently present across all insect samples, including Dellaglioa algida, Latilactobacillus curvatus, Latilactobacillus sakei, Acetobacteraceae, Apilactobacillus kunkeei, Bombilactobacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Gilliamella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Lactobacillus apis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Weissella spp. Minority taxa included Alcaligenes spp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, Psychrobacter spp., Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Lactobacillus melliventris, Pediococcus spp., Levilactobacillus brevis, and Snodgrassella alvi.

AB  - The chemical ecology and host plant preferences of the different Conistra species (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae, Xylenini) are mostly unknown, even though they are essential components of the herbivorous assemblages of temperate zone forests. During field studies, (Z)-7-tetradecenyl acetate (Z7-14Ac) was identified as a sex attractant of Conistra vaccinii. Phenylacetaldehyde-based synthetic and iso-amyl alcohol-based semi-synthetic lures also attracted C. vaccinii, C. rubiginea, and C. rubiginosa, and in the case of C. vaccinii, they performed better than the newly identified sex attractant. The different efficiencies of the two bisexual lures probably reflected the different feeding source preferences of the species caught. The tested lures attracted both sexes and, thus, we can estimate the actual sex ratio. These traps can be used especially in applications where female samples are needed, i.e., surveys on the reproduction biology of moths (e.g., polyandry), or in surveys of population dynamics.

AB  - N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent modification in cellular RNA which orchestrates diverse physiological and pathological processes during stress response. However, the differential m(6)A modifications that cope with herbivore stress in resistant and susceptible crop varieties remain unclear. Here, we found that rice stem borer (RSB) larvae grew better on indica rice (e.g., MH63, IR64, Nanjing 11) than on japonica rice varieties (e.g., Nipponbare, Zhonghua 11, Xiushui 11). Then, transcriptome-wide m(6)A profiling of representative resistant (Nipponbare) and susceptible (MH63) rice varieties were performed using a nanopore direct RNA sequencing approach, to reveal variety-specific m(6)A modifications against RSB. Upon RSB infestation, m(6)A methylation occurred in actively expressed genes in Nipponbare and MH63, but the number of methylation sites decreased across rice chromosomes. Integrative analysis showed that m(6)A methylation levels were closely associated with transcriptional regulation. Genes involved in herbivorous resistance related to mitogen-activated protein kinase, jasmonic acid (JA), and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways, as well as JA-mediated trypsin protease inhibitors, were heavily methylated by m(6)A, and their expression was more pronounced in RSB-infested Nipponbare than in RSB-infested MH63, which may have contributed to RSB resistance in Nipponbare. Therefore, dynamics of m(6)A modifications act as the main regulatory strategy for expression of genes involved in plant-insect interactions, which is attributed to differential responses of resistant and susceptible rice varieties to RSB infestation. These findings could contribute to developing molecular breeding strategies for controlling herbivorous pests.

AB  - When the favored host of an herbivorous insect pest is absent, the availability of alternative host plants can maintain insect pest populations. Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a major invasive, polyphagous insect pest in China. To investigate the suitability of Chinese cabbage as an alternative host for S. frugiperda, oviposition preferences and life history traits were determined for S. frugiperda on Chinese cabbage, corn, and winter wheat over three generations. Results showed that S. frugiperda females preferred to lay their eggs on corn compared to winter wheat and Chinese cabbage. The survival rate of S. frugiperda decreased after switching from corn to Chinese cabbage, only 6% of individuals successfully pupated in the third generation. In addition, S. frugiperda reared on Chinese cabbage had lower pupal weight and fecundity. Winter wheat was a good host for S. frugiperda; although the survival rate decreased when S. frugiperda switched from corn to winter wheat in the parental generation, the survival rate increased over the next two generations to be as high as those reared on corn. Chinese cabbage is not a good long-term host for S. frugiperda, but it could maintain the pest population for at least two generations when more suitable host plants are unavailable. These results will inform management strategies for S. frugiperda.

AB  - To counter the insect infestation, plants respond with wide-ranging and highly dynamic biochemical reactions. Of these, the anti-oxidative activity is poorly understood. The red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Oliver), one of the most widespread pests in Pakistan, prefers to infest date palm Phoenix dactylifera. Our present study investigated the feeding preference of RPW to 11 different date palm cultivars and the results suggested that the Hillawi cultivar was most preferred. Greater infestation rate, fecundity and hatching rate were also recorded from Hillawi and Mozawati than other cultivars. No significant decreases were observed in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophylls and carotenoids of RPW-infested Hillawi cultivar over un-infested control. In contrast, the contents of enzymatic antioxidants including phenols, proline, hydrogen peroxide, anthocyanin, malondialdehyde, ascorbic acid and glycine betaine showed a drastic increase after RPW infestation, and there was enhanced superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase activities. Furthermore, we recorded the increase of total protein and sugar contents in RPW-infested date palms. These findings offer valuable insight into the antioxidative molecular mechanism of date palms under RPW attack and may contribute to the breeding of insect-resistant crops.

AB  - Cestrum (Solanaceae) species have become invasive in conservation and agricultural areas in South Africa, resulting in the initiation of a biological control (biocontrol) programme against these species in 2007. Of the four Cestrum species recorded in South Africa, Cestrum laevigatum Schltdl. and C. parqui L'Herit., which are both commonly referred to as inkberries, have become invasive while C. aurantiacum Lindl. and C. elegans (Brongn.) Schltdl. are still isolated at a few sites in the country. The biocontrol programme against Cestrum species (commonly called cestrum) was initially focussed on pathogens associated with these plants. Although the fungus Uromyces cestri Bertero ex Mont. (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae) was found to be a promising agent for cestrum, the pathogen project was shelved due to lack of capacity. Field surveys conducted in Argentina from 2012 to 2020 revealed a total of eight phytophagous insects that could be candidate agents. Among these is a leaf-feeding flea beetle Epitrix sp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) that has been tested for host specificity. Out of 47 plant species tested to date, Epitrix sp. has only fed and developed on three Cestrum species, suggesting that it is suitable for release against cestrum in South Africa. Permission to release Epitrix sp. will be sought once it has been identified to the species level or it has been described as a new species. Two chrysomelid beetle species, a root-feeding flea beetle (Diphaulaca sp.) and an unidentified leaf-feeding flea beetle, were also collected on C. parqui, but attempts to rear the former were unsuccessful. Three other leaf-miners collected from C. parqui include: Acrocercops leucographa Clark (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), an unidentified moth (Lepidoptera: Argyresthiidae) and Liriomyza sp. nr. schlingerii (Diptera: Agromyzidae). A glass-winged butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was the only herbivore that may be of biocontrol value on C. laevigatum. Whilst it is essential to extend the surveys to other regions of the native range, it is also important to prioritize the most promising potential biocontrol agents for further testing in South Africa. Given the suite of potential biocontrol agents in the native range, there are good prospects for the biocontrol of cestrum species in South Africa.

AB  - Pedestrian safety has become a critical consideration in developing society especially road traffic, an intelligent transportation need of the hour is the solution left. India tops the world with 11% of global road accidents. With this data, we have moved in the direction of computer vision applications for efficient and accurate pedestrian detection for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The important application of this research is robot development, traffic management and control, unmanned vehicle driving (UVD), intelligent monitoring and surveillance system, and automatic pedestrian detection system. Much research has focused on pedestrian detection, but sustainable solution-driven research must still be required to overcome road accidents. We have proposed a wireless sensor network-based pedestrian detection system that classifies the real-time set of pedestrian activity and samples the reciprocally received signal strength (RSS) from the sensor node. We applied a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptor algorithm K-nearest neighbor, decision tree and linear support vector machine to measure the performance and prediction of the target. Also, these algorithms have performed a comparative analysis under different aspects. The linear support vector machine algorithm was trained with 481 samples. The performance achieves the accuracy of 98.90%and has accomplished superior results with a maximum precision of 0.99, recall of 0.98, and F-score of 0.95 with 2% error rate. The model's prediction indicates that it can be used in the intelligent transportation system. Finally, the limitation and the challenges discussed to provide an outlook for future research direction to perform effective pedestrian detection.

AB  - The Sakeji horseshoe bat Rhinolophus sakejiensis is an endemic to south-central Africa. Until recently, it remained known only from the type series of three specimens collected in Nchila Wildlife Reserve, north-western Zambia. The phylogenetic position of R. sakejiensis was evaluated based on morphologic traits and it was suggested that it represents a part of the 'clivosus-complex' within the Rhinolophus ferrumequinum clade of the genus. In this study, we provide an insight into the phylogenetic position of R. sakejiensis employing molecular data, using a newly discovered specimen that originates from the identical area as the type series. We assessed the genetic relationships of R. sakejiensis using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. This analysis revealed this species to be phylogenetically distinct from morphologically similar congeners of the capensis, fumigatus, and ferrumequinum species groups. In fact, it does not belong to any recognised species group but rather represents a distinct evolutionary lineage - along with another African relic bat, Rhinolophus horaceki. The divergence time of R. sakejiensis from R. horaceki, its closest relative, was estimated to have occurred in the Middle Miocene, roughly at 15.3 Ma, a period of dynamic environmental changes that may have led to widely separated occurrences of various relic bat lineages.

AB  - Red mud is one kind of by-products rejected from industrial production of alumina plant and characterized by high content of alkaline and containing many valuable metals such as iron, aluminum, titanium, etc. It is urgent to effectively utilize red mud for the sustainable development of aluminum metallurgy industry. In this paper, a new route was proposed to fully recover Fe, Al2O3 and TiO2 from the red mud, which includes three procedures, i.e. pre-reducing-smelting, alkaline leaching and acid leaching. The pre-reducing-smelting step was employed to recover iron from the mud, producing pig iron at an iron recovery of some 98.15% and slag containing 43.17% Al2O3 and 15.71%TiO2, respectively. Then, based on the thermal dynamic calculations, a modification of the slag-alkaline leaching and hydrochloric acid leaching process were conducted to obtain the stepwise recovery of Al2O3 and TiO2, respectively, from the smelting slag. Aluminum and titanium were recovered in the form of sodium aluminum solution and perovskite at a recovery of 85.85% and 95.53%, respectively. The innovative route is probably a potential way to achieve comprehensive and clean utilization of red mud.

AB  - Transdermal patch for local drug delivery has attained huge attention as an attractive alternative to existing drug delivery techniques as it is painless and user-friendly. However, most adhesive hydrogels either do not have adequate adhesion with the skin or cause discomfort while being removed from the skin surface due to excessive adhesion. To address this challenge, we developed an adhesive hydrogel based on laponite-confined dopamine polymerization as a transdermal patch. Laponite RDS nanoclay was used to control the hydrogel's viscous behavior and dopamine polymerization. The laponite polymerized polydopamine (l-PDA) was incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to make the PVA-l-PDA hydrogel. The laponite-confined polymerization improved the hydrogels' water contact angle and adhesion strength. The adhesion strength of the PVA-l-PDA hydrogel was adequate to adhere to the evaluated goat skin, glass, and polypropylene surfaces. Notably, the PVA-l-PDA hydrogel was easy to peel off from the skin. Further, we evaluated the drug release profile in goat skin using lidocaine as a model drug. We observed the controlled release of lidocaine from the PVA-l-PDA hydrogel compared to the PVA-PDA hydrogel. In addition, the nanoclay-confined adhesive hydrogel did not show any cytotoxic effect in fibroblasts. Altogether, PVA-l-PDA hydrogels offer appropriate adhesive strength, toughness, and biocompatibility. Thus, the PVA-l-PDA hydrogel has the potential to be an efficient transdermal patch.

AB  - This study aims to characterize for the first time the insect assemblage associated with sown, introduced guayule (Parthenium argentatum A. Gray, Asteraceae) in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, and identify potential relationships with the crop. Insect sampling was conducted using nets and pan traps during spring and early summer, coinciding with the flowering period of the plant. A total of 352 insect species/morphospecies across 12 orders were identified. Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera were the most species-rich and abundant orders. Within these orders, Muscidae, Syrphidae, Tenebrionidae, Dermestidae, Miridae, Halictidae, and Apidae were the most numerous families. Guayule flowering intensity increased gradually until mid-June, aligning with the peak activity of pollinating Diptera. The majority of the identified insects (74.4%) were potential pollinators, while nearly 50% were detritivores and approximately 30% were herbivorous. The similarity in insect families and functional roles observed in this study to previous studies in the USA and Mexico suggest that guayule may serve as a similar trophic resource for insects in Spain, despite being a non-native species.

AB  - Plants produce various phytochemicals against herbivory, but phytophagous insects have encountered phytochemicals in the co-evolutionary history between plants and insects. Selection pressure exerted by phytochemicals triggers a preadaptation to insecticide resistance in insect pests that is due to detoxification systems that are common to phytochemicals and insecticides in the insect's body. We investigated the interaction between the host plant resistance of rice cultivars and the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). Forty brown planthopper resistance gene loci (BPHs) that are related to phytochemicals in various cultivars of rice inhibit feeding by N. lugens, but this planthopper has developed virulence to resistant rice cultivars possessing some genes. Nilaparvata lugens has also developed resistance to some insecticides as a rapid adaptation to human-driven selection. We tested the hypothesis that the evolution of insects' resistance to an insecticide is promoted by their encounters with phytochemicals. We compared the virulence of imidacloprid-resistant and control N. lugens strains toward seven rice cultivars that possess different genes, and we observed that the imidacloprid-resistant N. lugens had reduced virulence to three rice cultivars, Rathu Heenati (BPH3, BPH17), Babawee (BPH4), and Balamawee (BPH27, three quantitative trait loci), meaning that the development of imidacloprid resistance has a negative impact on the virulence of N. lugens to three cultivars. Our results indicate trade-offs rather than a co-relationship between the evolution of insecticide resistance and encounters with host plant defense.

AB  - Pine sawflies (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae) are eruptive herbivores found throughout eastern North America. The Diprionidae family, which contains at least 140 species, constitutes the most persistent threat to conifers as population outbreaks can cause widespread defoliation. Because some species are more prone to large, destructive outbreaks than others, species identification is critical to effective management. Although existing taxonomic keys are primarily based on internal adult morphology, substantial variation among species in larval color traits, geographic location, overwintering strategy, host plant, and egg patterns can be diagnostic at the species level. Here, we focus on the Pinaceae-feeding subfamily Diprioninae, of which there are 25 species in eastern North America. We describe the general biology, life cycle, and host-use ecology of Diprioninae, with an emphasis on the variation among these traits within this subfamily. In addition, we provide tools for species identification, including a taxonomic key that utilizes external diagnostic characteristics. Finally, we discuss available management strategies.

AB  - Eukaryotes have varying numbers and structures of characteristic chromosomes across lineages or species. The evolutionary trajectory of species may have been affected by spontaneous genome rearrangements. Chromosome fusion drastically alters karyotypes. However, the mechanisms and consequences of chromosome fusions, particularly in muntjac species, are poorly understood. Recent research-based advancements in three-dimensional (3D) genomics, particularly high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing, have allowed for the identification of chromosome fusions and provided mechanistic insights into three muntjac species: Muntiacus muntjak, M. reevesi, and M. crinifrons. This study aimed to uncover potential genome rearrangement patterns in the threatened species Fea's muntjac (Muntiacus feae), which have not been previously examined for such characteristics. Deep Hi-C sequencing (31.42 x coverage) was performed to reveal the 3D chromatin architecture of the Fea's muntjac genome. Patterns of repeated chromosome fusions that were potentially mediated by high-abundance transposable elements were identified. Comparative Hi-C maps demonstrated linkage homology between the sex chromosomes in Fea's muntjac and autosomes in M. reevesi, indicating that fusions may have played a crucial role in the evolution of the sex chromosomes of the lineage. The species-level dynamics of topologically associated domains (TADs) suggest that TAD organization could be altered by differential chromosome interactions owing to repeated chromosome fusions. However, research on the effect of TADs on muntjac genome evolution is insufficient. This study generated Hi-C data for the Fea's muntjac, providing a genomic resource for future investigations of the evolutionary patterns of chromatin conformation at the chromosomal level.

AB  - The thoracic paravertebral sympathetic chain postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) represent the predominant sympathetic control of vascular function in the trunk and upper extremities. tSPNs cluster to form ganglia linked by an interganglionic nerve and receive multisegmental convergent and divergent synaptic input from cholinergic sympathetic preganglionic neurons of the spinal cord (Blackman and Purves, 1969; Lichtman et al., 1980). Studies in the past have focused on cervical and lumbar chain ganglia in multiple species, but few have examined the thoracic chain ganglia, whose location and diminutive size make them less conducive to experimentation. Seminal studies on the integrative properties of preganglionic axonal projections onto tSPNs were performed in guinea pig (Blackman and Purves, 1969; Lichtman et al., 1980), but as mice have become the accepted mammalian genetic model organism, there is need to reproduce and expand on these studies in this smaller model. We describe an ex vivo approach that enables electrophysiological, calcium imaging, and optogenetic assessment of convergence, divergence, and studies on pre-to postganglionic synaptic transmission, as well as whole-cell recordings from individual tSPNs. Preganglionic axonal connections from intact ventral roots and interganglionic nerves across multiple segments can be stimulated to evoke compound action potential responses in individual thoracic ganglia as recorded with suction electrodes. Chemical block of synaptic transmission differentiates spiking of preganglionic axons from synaptically-recruited tSPNs. Further dissection, including removal of the sympathetic chain, enables whole-cell patch clamp recordings from individual tSPNs for characterization of cellular and synaptic properties.

AB  - Cu2+ stress impairs the growth and metabolism of tea plants, further reducing the quality of tea leaves. As a gas signaling molecule, H2S participates in various physiological processes and improves the stress resistance of plants. Here, the role of H2S in the response of tea plants to Cu2+ stress was investigated by analyzing the effects of Cu2+ stress on phenotypes, photosynthetic parameters, physiological indicators, and quality component contents with H2S or PAG (H2S synthase inhibitor) pretreatment. It was indicated that exogenous H2S reduced Cu accumulation and alleviated the inhibition of growth physiology mediated by Cu2+ stress in tea plants, mitigated the leaf cell ultrastructure damage, and increased the biomass, root activity, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic capacity of tea plants under Cu2+ stress. Additionally, exogenous H2S activated the antioxidant system by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidant contents and enhanced the production of endogenous H2S by promoting LCD activity, thereby improving the antioxidant capacity of tea plants under Cu2+ stress. Meanwhile, the application of H2S effectively alleviated the reduction in the quality components of tea leaves under Cu2+ stress. Above all, exogenous H2S can enhanced tea plants' tolerance to Cu2+ stress, providing a technical reference for the management of tea plants.

AB  - Since molecular data identified hippopotamids as the closest living relatives of cetaceans, a common aquatic/semiaquatic ancestor hypothesis for these modern taxa has naturally been proposed. However, recent molecular studies concluded that most molecular adaptations in extant cetaceans occurred after their split from hippopotamids. If the question of aquatic affinities of the first cetaceans has been investigated at large, it has not been the case for the forebears of hippopotamids. Sensory organs are drastically affected by underwater perception. In this work, we question the aquatic affinities of fossil hippopotamoids through an investigation of the morphology and morphometrics of the petrosal bone and cochlea of 12 extinct hippopotamoid taxa. Petrosal and bony labyrinth morphological characters constitute a source of structured phylogenetic signal, both supporting major hippopotamoid clades and bringing original relationships. The morphometric study of functional measurements of the cochlear canal shows that anthracotheres bridge the morphological gap between terrestrial artiodactyls and modern hippopotamids. The integrated functional signal of the ear region further supports convergent acquisitions of semiaquatic behaviour in hippopotamids and cetaceans and indicates that terrestrial hearing was an ancestral trait among Hippopotamoidea. We highlight multiple convergent acquisitions of semiaquatic traits in the ear region of hippopotamoids and new robust phylogenetic characters.

AB  - Queuosine (Q) is a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of specific tRNAs. In mammals, queuosinylation is facilitated by queuine uptake from the gut microbiota and is introduced into tRNA by the QTRT1-QTRT2 enzyme complex. By establishing a Qtrt1 knockout mouse model, we discovered that the loss of Q-tRNA leads to learning and memory deficits. Ribo-Seq analysis in the hippocampus of Qtrt1-deficient mice revealed not only stalling of ribosomes on Q-decoded codons, but also a global imbalance in translation elongation speed between codons that engage in weak and strong interactions with their cognate anticodons. While Q-dependent molecular and behavioral phenotypes were identified in both sexes, female mice were affected more severely than males. Proteomics analysis confirmed deregulation of synaptogenesis and neuronal morphology. Together, our findings provide a link between tRNA modification and brain functions and reveal an unexpected role of protein synthesis in sex-dependent cognitive performance.

AB  - Classical biological control utilizes natural enemies of invasive non-native plants imported from their native range to manage problematic populations. However, a potential biological control agent must undergo strict host specificity tests to ensure that it does not feed on species native to the invaded range. Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. (Nymphaeaceae) is an invasive waterlily in South Africa that is native to the southern USA and parts of Mexico and is a target for biological control in South Africa. The planthopper, Megamelus toddi Beamer (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is a potential biological control agent that was imported from Florida, USA for host specificity tests under quarantine conditions. Survival and multigeneration trials were carried out to determine the ability of M. toddi to survive and reproduce on its original host, N. mexicana, as well as Nymphaea nouchali Bur. fil., a waterlily native to South Africa, and Nymphaea marliacea var. chromatella Lat.-Marl., a hybrid of N. mexicana. M. toddi was unable to survive for more than two generations on the hybrid but completed three generations on N. nouchali and N. mexicana, indicating that M. toddi is unsafe for use as a biological control agent in South Africa. Nevertheless, the results from this study contribute information about a species that has not been thoroughly studied and emphasizes the importance of conducting thorough host specificity tests before releasing potential biological control agents.

AB  - Simple Summary We evaluated the survival and development of a native butterfly (Poanes viator) and introduced moth (Rhizedra lutosa) fed native or introduced lineages of common reed (Phragmites australis). The native butterfly feeds more generally on monocots, so some larvae were also fed wild rice (Zizania aquatica). Using R. lutosa, we also tested an artificial diet supplemented with common reed rhizome powder as a potential food for rearing stalk and rhizome boring Lepidoptera. Generally, both insect species had low larval survival on all plants used, but high pupation success once insects reached that stage. Only P. viator larvae reared on leaves from native plants pupated and completed development. Rhizedra lutosa completed all developmental stages on native and introduced P. australis rhizomes. The artificial diet resulted in a doubling of survival and successful development to adults for R. lutosa. Several specialist Lepidopteran species are being considered for approval as biological control agents for the non-native, invasive common reed in North America, and the convenience and increased larval performance make this artificial diet a good alternative for rearing organisms. This study examined the performance of Poanes viator (Edwards) (Hesperiidae), a native North American skipper, and Rhizedra lutosa (Hubner) (Noctuidae), an introduced moth, reared on native and non-native, invasive lineages of Phragmites australis. Poanes viator is a generalist on monocots and larvae were also fed leaves of Zizania aquatica, a native macrophyte that the skipper commonly uses as a host plant. Larval survival and duration, pupal weight, and pupation time were compared for P. viator feeding on leaf tissue and R. lutosa feeding on rhizomes of either native or introduced plants. We also tested an artificial diet supplemented with P. australis rhizome powder as a potential food for rearing other stalk and rhizome boring Lepidoptera. In experiments using excised plant tissues, some individuals of both species fed and developed to the pupal stage on native and introduced plants, but overall, larval survival rates were low. Plant species/haplotype identity did not cause strong differences in larval survival for either species. However, P. viator larvae only pupated when feeding on native plants (Zizania aquatica and native P. australis haplotypes), whereas R. lutosa successfully pupated on both native and introduced P. australis. Although larval survival was low, 100% of P. viator and 95% of R. lutosa that reached the pupal stage emerged as adults. Rhizedra lutosa larvae fed an artificial diet supplemented with P. australis rhizome powder had significantly greater survival and pupal weights, and shorter pupation times than larvae fed rhizomes only. Several specialist Lepidopteran species are being considered for approval as biological control agents for the non-native P. australis haplotype, and the convenience and increased larval performance make this artificial diet a good alternative for rearing organisms.

AB  - The South American leaf miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a serious pest of tomato causing substantial annual economic losses at a global scale. Our study comprised choice and no-choice bioassays, aimed at understanding the preference of this oligophagous pest for a few selected solanaceous hosts (tomato, potato, eggplant, ashwagandha, black nightshade, wild tomato, tobacco, and datura), and the identification of the volatile cues that influence its host selection process. In choice assays, T. absoluta females preferred tomato for oviposition over all the other plants, whereas ashwagandha, tobacco, and datura were the least preferred; on datura zero eggs were laid. A similar trend was observed in the subsequent number of larval mines formed. The moth's preference for host plants of the genus Solanum was quite evident in both the choice and no-choice assays. Tomato plant volatiles were found to be more attractive to the female moths in single- and dual-choice olfactometer assays. In electroantennographic bioassays, the mean depolarization was significant for tomato, potato, ashwagandha, and eggplant compared to empty air and honey. In total 76 volatile compounds were identified in the GC-MS analysis across the eight previously selected host-plant headspace samples. Principal component analysis revealed that 1-fluorododecane and p-quinone mainly contributed to the observed variation among the host plant volatiles. Of all the host plants, tomato, wild tomato, and tobacco were found to share similarities with respect to volatile cues, whereas ashwagandha, eggplant, and datura were found to be closely related. The other two hosts, potato and black nightshade, had fewer volatiles in common. Volatile cues, namely p-quinone, 2-carene, delta-curcumene, and 1,2-diethylbenzene, in tomato could serve as oviposition stimulants to T. absoluta, whereas the presence of 1-fluorododecane in host plants such as datura, eggplant, ashwagandha, and black nightshade, might have deterred T. absoluta from ovipositing. 1-Fluorododecane was found to be completely absent in tomato.

AB  - The African palm weevil Rhynchophorus phoenicis (Fabricius) is an alternative to conventional protein sources from livestock and poultry due to their rich nutritional content and ability to be reared on agricultural by-products. When establishing a production protocol for mass production of R. phoenicis larvae, it is imperative to understand the interaction between substrate and temperature on the development and reproductive success of the weevils. To determine the optimum temperatures for continuous production of R. phoenicis, the larvae were subjected to four temperatures (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) at a relative humidity of 70% on different substrates (elephant ear corm, peeled sugarcane, and palm yolk) in an incubator. The developmental duration of R. phoenicis larvae decreased with a temperature above 30 degrees C whilst percentage larval survival was high at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The temperature with the fastest larval development and highest mortality was 35 degrees C. The optimal temperature from egg to the adult stage was observed at 25 degrees C. The oviposition and hatchability of eggs was high on elephant ear corm (EC), and palm yolk (PY) at 25 degrees C whilst the number of cocoons was high at 20 degrees C on decorticated coconut coir (DC). Thus, it is feasible to utilise the easily accessible substrates that interact well with temperature to produce optimum condition for the production of R. phoenicis larvae.

AB  - Herbivore diet breadth has been hypothesised to be driven by plant quality (physiological efficiency hypothesis) or natural enemies (enemy-free space hypothesis). These hypotheses on their own are now known to be insufficient explanations for the range of herbivore diet breadths and more integrative approaches consider how trade-offs and ecological contingencies shape host plant use by herbivores. I carried out laboratory experiments to test whether physiological efficiency and defence against natural enemies trade off when larvae of the ornate bella moth, Utetheisa ornatrix (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), a genus-specialist pod-boring herbivore, feeds on leaves and pods of four Crotalaria species (Fabaceae). Different components of U. ornatrix physiological efficiency traded off amongst each other and with defence against adult predation by the spider Lycosa erythrognatha Lucas (Araneae: Lycosidae). Crotalaria micans Link provided the highest survival and fast development but low pupal weight and defence. Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don provided poor survival, slow development, and low defence, but high pupal weight. Crotalaria pallida Aiton provided slow development and intermediate survival and pupal weight, but the best defence. Crotalaria vitellina Ker Gawl. provided high survival, fast development, and efficient defence, but low pupal weight. Compared to leaves, feeding on green seeds provided greater defence against predation, and developmental benefits, independent of host plant species, but there was a large cost in boring into the pod to reach the seeds. I therefore provide evidence that the trade-offs among physiological efficiency components and between physiological efficiency and defence could maintain multiple host plant use in specialist herbivores. I also show that feeding on green seeds incurs a cost through pod-boring but gives the moth benefits in adult defence. Therefore, the evolution of host plant use and pod-boring in insect herbivores could be driven by defence as much as by physiological efficiency.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid, appeared to satisfy several criteria for a safe approach to preventing drug-taking behavior, including opioids. However, most successful preclinical and clinical results come from studies in adult males. We examined whether systemic injections of CBD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) during extinction of oxycodone (OXY, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) induced conditioned place preference (CPP) could attenuate the reinstatement of CPP brought about by OXY (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) priming in adolescent rats of both sexes, and whether this effect is sex dependent. Accordingly, a priming dose of OXY produced reinstatement of the previously extinguished CPP in males and females. In both sexes, this effect was linked to locomotor sensitization that was blunted by CBD pretreatments. However, CBD was able to prevent the reinstatement of OXY-induced CPP only in adolescent males and this outcome was associated with an increased cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) and a decreased mu opioid receptor (MOR) expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The reinstatement of CCP in females was associated with a decreased MOR expression, but no changes were detected in CB1R in the hippocampus (HIP). Moreover, CBD administration during extinction significantly potentialized the reduced MOR expression in the PFC of males and showed a tendency to potentiate the reduced MOR in the HIP of females. Additionally, CBD reversed OXY-induced deficits of recognition memory only in males. These results suggest that CBD could reduce reinstatement to OXY seeking after a period of abstinence in adolescent male but not female rats. However, more investigation is required.

AB  - Adrenomedullin (ADM) as a highly conserved peptide hormone has been reported to increase significantly in the uterine lumen during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy in pigs, but its functional roles in growth and development of porcine conceptus (embryonic/fetus and its extra-embryonic membranes) as well as underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted in vitro experiments using our established porcine trophectoderm cell line (pTr2) isolated from Day-12 porcine conceptuses to test the hypothesis that porcine ADM stimulates cell proliferation, migration and adhesion via activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) cell signaling pathway in pTr2 cells. Porcine ADM at 10(-7) M stimulated (P < 0.05) pTr2 cell proliferation, migration and adhesion by 1.4-, 1.5- and 1.2-folds, respectively. These ADM-induced effects were abrogated (P < 0.05) by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADM (siADM) and its shared receptor component calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CALCRL; siCALCRL), as well as by rapamycin, the inhibitor of MTOR. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of CALCRL coupled with Western blot analyses, ADM signaling transduction was determined in which ADM binds to CALCRL to increase phosphorylation of MTOR, its downstream effectors (4EBP1, P70S6K, and S6), and upstream regulators (AKT and TSC2). Collectively, these results suggest that porcine ADM in histotroph acts on its receptor component CALCRL to activate AKT-TSC2-MTOR, particularly MTORC1 signaling cascade, leading to elongation, migration and attachment of conceptuses.

AB  - Introduction Azithromycin improves symptomology in various chronic airway diseases exacerbated by viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the apparent antiviral effects of azithromycin remain unclear.Methods Airway epithelial cells from healthy children were cultured, expanded and differentiated into air-liquid interface cultures. Submerged and differentiated primary cultures were treated with 10 mu M of AZM for 24 h and subsequently infected with human rhinovirus (HRV)-1b for 24 h. Virus receptor expression, replication, progeny release and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, -6, -8 and IP-10) were then measured. Barrier integrity was determined via qPCR, in-cell western (ICW), immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, confocal microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) measurement and an apparent permeability (P app ) assay.Results Treatment with AZM for 24 h at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mu M did not have any significant impact on either cellular viability or cytotoxicity in un-infected cells. No significant effect on viral receptor, cytokine expression was observed in non-infected cells treated with 10 mu M AZM. Similarly, there was no significant change in both occludin and ZO-1 expression in non-infected cells. However, claudin-1 gene expression was significantly reduced but corresponding protein expression was significantly increased following 10 mu M AZM. Although RT was significantly lower, this was not corroborated by any significant change in epithelial permeability after 10 mu M AZM treatment. Subsequent to HRV-1b infection, 10 mu M AZM treatment significantly reduced cytotoxicity induced by infection. Viral receptor expression were not affected with AZM pre-treatment but a significant decrease in viral replication was observed. Except for IP-10, expression of IL-1 beta, -6, and -8 was significantly reduced. Gene and protein expression of key epithelial junctions were significantly higher in treated, infected cells, which were concomitant with epithelial barrier function.Discussions This study identified that AZM can protect against HRV-1b-induced epithelial damage. Our data, demonstrating the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and barrier-protective effects in vitro are strongly indicative of pleiotropic mechanisms of AZM for mitigating viral infection and its consequences. These effects are likely to contribute to the benefits observed in clinical trials of AZM in a number of chronic respiratory diseases.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment against severe depressive episodes, which has been shown to induce volume changes in the hippocampus. The power spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) follows a characteristic power-law relation, but its utility as a metric of ECT-induced seizures has not been explored. Objective: This pilot study aims to evaluate a novel metric based on the power spectrum of the EEG recordings from ECT-induced seizures-its association to volume changes in the hippocampus after ECT and improvement in depression rating scores. Methods: Depressed patients treated with ECT underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment and the EEG from each seizure was recorded (N = 29). Hippocampal volume changes and EEG parameters were recorded in addition to clinician-rated and self-reported measures of depressive symptoms. The slope of the power law in the power spectral density of the EEG was calculated. Multivariate linear models relating seizure parameters to volume change or clinical outcome were systematically and successively simplified. The best models were selected according to Akaike information criterion. Results: The slope of the power law was steeper in the right than the left hemisphere (P < 0.001). Electroencephalogram measures were included in the best models of volume change for both hippocampi as well as in the models explaining clinical outcome (P = 0.014, P = 0.004). Conclusions: In this pilot study, novel EEG measures were explored and contributed in models explaining the variation in volume change in the hippocampus and in clinical outcome after ECT.

AB  - Orthohantaviruses present a global public health threat; there are 58 distinct viruses currently recognized and case fatality of pathogenic orthohantaviruses ranges from <0.1% to 50%. An Old World versus New World dichotomy is frequently applied to distinguish human diseases caused by orthohantaviruses. However, this geographic grouping masks the importance of phylogeny and virus-host ecology in shaping orthohantavirus traits, especially since related arvicoline rodents and their orthohantaviruses are found in both regions. We argue that orthohantaviruses can be separated into three phylogenetically based rodent host groups with differences in key functional traits, including human disease, transmission route, and virus-host fidelity. This framework can help understand and predict traits of under-studied and newly discovered orthohantaviruses and guide public health and biosafety policy.

AB  - Simple Summary: Bruchophagus huonchili is a serious threat to the yield and quality of the Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus seeds. Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are essential signaling substances for herbivorous insects when searching for host plants and mating partners. In this study, we collected and identified the VOCs emitted from A. membranaceus pods and evaluated the attraction of individual and combined compounds to B. huonchili. Our results showed that specific concentrations of five VOCs (cis-beta-ocimene, hexyl acetate, hexanal, decanal, and beta-caryophyllene) attract B. huonchili wasps. Moreover, our findings revealed that three formulations exhibited strong attraction to B. huonchili in Y-tube olfactometer assays and in the field. This study suggests that a blend with specific VOCs and ratios emitted from A. membranaceus could be used as attractants in traps for B. huonchili monitoring in the field. Bruchophagus huonchili is a pest that poses a serious threat to the yield and quality of Astragalus membranaceus seeds. In this study, we employed solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in A. membranaceus pods during the pod-filled period. Additionally, we utilized a Y-tube olfactometer to measure the behavioral response of B. huonchili to different individual VOCs and specific VOC-based formulations. The most effective formulations were further evaluated for their effectiveness in attracting wasps in the field. Our findings revealed that A. membranaceus pods emit 25 VOCs, including green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and terpenoid and aromatic compounds. Among these compounds, five were found to be most attractive to B. huonchili at the following concentrations: 10 mu g/mu L cis-beta-ocimene, 500 mu g/mu L hexyl acetate, 100 mu g/mu L hexanal, 1 mu g/mu L decanal, and 10 mu g/mu L beta-caryophyllene, with respective response rates of 67.65%, 67.74%, 65.12%, 67.57%, and 66.67%. In addition, we evaluated 26 mixed VOC formulations, and three of them were effective at attracting B. huonchili. Furthermore, field experiments showed that one of the formulations was significantly more effective than the others, which could be used for monitoring B. huonchili populations.

AB  - The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)/choroid complex regulates myopia development, but the precise pathogenesis of myopia remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the changes in RPE/choroid complex metabolism in a form deprivation myopia model after dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) modulation. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into normal (NC), form deprivation myopia (FDM), and FDM treated with dopamine D2R antagonist groups. Differential metabolites were screened using SIMCA-P software and MetaboAnalyst metabolomics analysis tool. Functions of differential metabolites were analyzed using KEGG enrichment pathways. Relative to the NC group, 38 differential metabolites were identified, comprising 29 increased metabolites (including nicotinic acid, cytosine, and glutamate) and 9 decreased metabolites, of which proline exhibited the largest decrease. Pathway analysis revealed regulation of arginine/proline and aspartate/glutamate metabolism. Intravitreal D2R antagonist injection increased proline concentrations and activated arginine/proline and purine metabolism pathways. In sum, D2R antagonists alleviated the myopia trend of refractive biological parameters in form deprivation myopic guinea pigs, suggesting the involvement of dopamine D2R signaling in myopia pathogenesis. The RPE/choroid may provide glutamate to the retina by activating proline metabolism via metabolic coupling with the retina. Dopamine D2R antagonism may modulate proline/arginine metabolic pathways in the RPE/choroid and regulate metabolism, information presentation, and myopia.

AB  - The disconnection of neuronal circuitry through synaptic loss is presumed to be a major driver of age-related cognitive decline. Age-related cognitive decline is heterogeneous, yet whether genetic mechanisms differentiate successful from unsuccessful cognitive decline through maintenance or vulnerability of synaptic connections remains unknown. Previous work using rodent and primate models leveraged various techniques to imply that age-related synaptic loss is widespread on pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits but absent on those in area CA1 of the hippocampus. Here, we examined the effect of aging on synapses on projection neurons forming a hippocampal-cortico-thalamic circuit important for spatial working memory tasks from two genetically distinct mouse strains that exhibit susceptibility (C57BL/6J) or resistance (PWK/PhJ) to cognitive decline during aging. Across both strains, synapse density on CA1-to-PFC projection neurons appeared completely intact with age. In contrast, we found synapse loss on PFC-to-nucleus reuniens (RE) projection neurons from aged C57BL/6J but not PWK/PhJ mice. Moreover, synapses from aged PWK/PhJ mice but not from C57BL/6J exhibited altered morphologies that suggest increased efficiency to drive depolarization in the parent dendrite. Our findings suggest resistance to age-related cognitive decline results in part by age-related synaptic adaptations, and identification of these mechanisms in PWK/PhJ mice could uncover new therapeutic targets for promoting successful cognitive aging and extending human health span.
   Projection neurons from distinct excitatory circuits were labeled in young, middle-aged and aged mice from two genetically distinct strains exhibiting diverging susceptibility to cognitive aging. Analyses of dendritic spines show C57BL/6J mice that are susceptible to cognitive aging lose excitatory prefrontal cortex (PFC) spines while maintaining CA1 spines. Conversely, PFC and CA1 spine densities remain intact in wild-derived PWK/PhJ mice that are resistant to cognitive aging. Spines from PWK/PhJ mice show morphological changes with age indicative of increased synaptic plasticity.image

AB  - Dominant mutations in the human gene GRIN2A, encoding NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2A, make a significant and growing contribution to the catalogue of published single-gene epilepsies. Understanding the disease mechanism in these epilepsy patients is complicated by the surprising diversity of effects that the mutations have on NMDARs. Here we have examined the cell-autonomous effect of five GluN2A mutations, 3 loss-of-function and 2 gain-of-function, on evoked NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents (NMDA-EPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured hippocampal slices. Despite the mutants differing in their functional incorporation at synapses, prolonged NMDA-EPSC current decays (with only marginal changes in charge transfer) were a common effect for both gain- and loss-of-function mutants. Modelling NMDA-EPSCs with mutant properties in a CA1 neuron revealed that the effect of GRIN2A mutations can lead to abnormal temporal integration and spine calcium dynamics during trains of concerted synaptic activity. Investigations beyond establishing the molecular defects of GluN2A mutants are much needed to understand their impact on synaptic transmission.
   The cell-autonomous effect of five severe loss- or gain-of-function GluN2A (NMDA receptor) mutations is assessed on evoked NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured mouse hippocampal slices. Data and modelling suggest that mutant-like NMDA-EPSCs can lead to abnormal temporal summation and spine calcium dynamics.

AB  - Herbivorous insects frequently exhibit sexual dimorphism in body size and a variety of other traits. Such differences often lead to distinct behaviors, which may present themselves in insect responses to conspecifics, plant defenses, and feeding. Based on a previous study of a congeneric species, we hypothesized that sexual dimorphism may yield differences in how the host-specific red milkweed beetle Tetraopes tetrophthalmus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) deactivates milkweed defenses, a behavior in which beetles cut latex-delivering veins prior to feeding. We also predicted that beetles would display differences in their subsequent feeding patterns and attraction of conspecifics. Although beetles were size dimorphic (females were larger than males), we did not find consistent differences in the rates of vein cutting or initiation of feeding between males and females. Females did, however, cut more milkweed veins per leaf, and attracted more conspecifics than males. Sex differences in size and other traits were thus associated with differential attraction, but not strongly associated with the overall deactivation of plant defense.

AB  - Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is one of the main insect pests of maize (Zea mays L.). Strategies to manage S. frugiperda include using semiochemicals to monitor males by traps baited with female sex pheromone. However, lacking are studies on plant-insect interaction to manage larvae with semiochemicals, specifically focused on evaluating attraction of S. frugiperda larvae to hybrid maize compared to native maize stressed by herbivory. Responses of S. frugiperda larvae to extracts of 'Asgrow A 7573' hybrid maize and criollo cuarenteno maize stressed by herbivory were compared. Hexane extracts of both kinds of maize were used to evaluate attraction of S. frugiperda larvae in a "Y" olfactometer. Third-instar larvae were more attracted to nondamaged cuarenteno maize extracts compared to herbivore-damaged cuarenteno maize extracts. Larvae also were more attracted to extracts of Asgrow 7573 hybrid maize damaged by herbivores compared to cuarenteno criollo maize. This report discusses the possibility that domesticated maize plants progressively lose phytochemical defenses.

AB  - The parasitism of Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) by the parasitoid Horismenus abnormicaulis (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is described for the first time. We harvested 90 Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) fruit pods, in June 2019 on the campus of the Federal University of Lavras in the municipality of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We found 21 individuals of H. abnormicaulis and 334 of A. macrophthalmus. The presence of cephalic capsule of beetle's pupa and evidence of predation into seed pods from which the wasps emerged suggested H. abnormicaulis is a parasitoid of A. macrophthalmus. Horismenus abnormicaulis has been added to the list of A. macrophthalmus parasitoids, and its occurrence has been expanded to the state of Minas Gerais. This discovery expands our knowledge of H. abnormicaulis biology and distribution in Brazil, as well as the tri-trophic interaction, plant-herbivore-parasitoid in invasive plant systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND : Increased exposure to ambient air pollution, especially fine particulate matter <= 2.5 lm (PM2.5) is associated with poorer brain health and increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The locus coeruleus (LC), located in the brainstem, is one of the earliest regions affected by tau pathology seen in AD. Its diffuse projections throughout the brain include afferents to olfactory areas that are hypothesized conduits of cerebral particle deposition. Additionally, extensive contact of the LC with the cerebrovascular system may present an additional route of exposure to environmental toxicants. OBJECTIVE : Our aim was to investigate if exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with LC integrity in a nationwide sample of men in early old age, potentially representing one pathway through which air pollution can contribute to increased risk for AD dementia. METHODS : We examined the relationship between PM 2.5 and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) estimates of LC structural integrity indexed by contrast to noise ratio (LCCNR) in 381 men [mean age = 67.3; standard deviation (SD) = 2.6] from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). Exposure to PM 2.5 was taken as a 3-year average over the most recent period for which data were available (average of 5.6 years prior to the MRI scan). We focused on LC CNR in the rostral-middle portion of LC due to its stronger associations with aging and AD than the caudal LC. Associations between PM 2.5 exposures and LC integrity were tested using linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, scanner, education, household income, and interval between exposure and MRI. A co-twin control analysis was also performed to investigate whether associations remained after controlling for genetic confounding and rearing environment. RESULTS : Multiple linear regressions revealed a significant association between PM 2.5 and rostral-middle LC CNR (b = -0.16; p = 0.02), whereby higher exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with lower LCCNR. A co-twin control analysis found that, within monozygotic pairs, individuals with higher PM 2.5 exposure showed lower LC CNR (b = - 0.11; p = 0.02), indicating associations were not driven by genetic or shared environmental confounds. There were no associations between PM 2.5 and caudal LC CNR or hippocampal volume, suggesting a degree of specificity to the rostralmiddle portion of the LC. DISCUSSION : Given previous findings that loss of LC integrity is associated with increased accumulation of AD-related amyloid and tau pathology, impacts on LC integrity may represent a potential pathway through which exposure to air pollution increases AD risk. https://doi.org/10.1289/ EHP14344

AB  - Homozygosity mapping is an effective tool for detecting genomic regions responsible for a given trait when the phenotype is controlled by a limited number of dominant or co-dominant loci. Freezing tolerance is a major attribute in agricultural crops such as camelina. Previous studies indicated that freezing tolerance differences between a tolerant (Joelle) and susceptible (CO46) variety of camelina were controlled by a small number of dominant or co-dominant genes. We performed whole genome homozygosity mapping to identify markers and candidate genes responsible for freezing tolerance difference between these two genotypes. A total of 28 F3 RILs were sequenced to similar to 30x coverage, and parental lines were sequenced to >30-40x coverage with Pacific Biosciences high fidelity technology and 60x coverage using Illumina whole genome sequencing. Overall, about 126k homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism markers were identified that differentiate both parents. Moreover, 617 markers were also homozygous in F3 families fixed for freezing tolerance/susceptibility. All these markers mapped to two contigs forming a contiguous stretch of chromosome 11. The homozygosity mapping detected 9 homozygous blocks among the selected markers and 22 candidate genes with strong similarity to regions in or near the homozygous blocks. Two such genes were differentially expressed during cold acclimation in camelina. The largest block contained a cold-regulated plant thionin and a putative rotamase cyclophilin 2 gene previously associated with freezing resistance in arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The second largest block contains several cysteine-rich RLK genes and a cold-regulated receptor serine/threonine kinase gene. We hypothesize that one or more of these genes may be primarily responsible for freezing tolerance differences in camelina varieties.

AB  - Bidirectional communication between the developing conceptus and endometrium is essential for preg-nancy recognition and establishment in ruminants. We dissect the transcriptomic dynamics of sheep conceptus and corresponding endometrium at pre-and peri-implantation stages using single-cell RNA sequencing. Spherical blastocysts contain five cell types, with 68.62% trophectoderm cells. Strikingly, elongated conceptuses differentiate into 17 cell types, indicating dramatic cell fate specifications. Cell -type-specific gene expression delineates the features of distinctive trophectoderm lineages and indicates that the transition from polar trophectoderm to trophoblast increases interferon-tau expression and likely drives elongation initiation. We identify 13 endometrium-derived cell types and elucidate their molecular responses to conceptus development. Integrated analyses uncover multiple paired transcripts mediating the dialogues between extraembryonic membrane and endometrium, including IGF2-IGF1R, FGF19- FGFR1, NPY-NPY1R, PROS1-AXL, and ADGRE5-CD55. These data provide insight into the molecular regu-lation of conceptus elongation and represent a valuable resource for functional investigations of pre-and peri-implantation ruminant development.

AB  - Postnatally, glucagon acutely lowers plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations by stimulating hepatic AA catabolism, but its fetal actions remain unclear. This study tested whether a 2 h fetal glucagon infusion would stimulate hepatic AA catabolism and inhibit placental AA transfer. Late-gestation pregnant sheep (0.9 gestation) underwent surgical, vascular catheterization and received fetal glucagon (n = 8) or vehicle infusions (n = 8) in a crossover design with a 48 h washout period. Nutrient uptake and utilization were assessed during each infusion, and fetal liver and placental tissue were collected post-infusion under hyperglucagonemic (n = 4) or vehicle (n = 4) conditions. Glucagon receptor was identified in fetal hepatocyte and trophoblast cells. Glucagon reduced fetal plasma AA concentrations by 20% (p = 0.0103) and increased plasma glucose by 47% (p = 0.0152), leading to a three-fold rise in fetal plasma insulin (p = 0.0459). Hepatic gene expression associated with AA catabolism and gluconeogenesis increased (p < 0.0500) following glucagon infusion, and hepatic metabolomic analysis showed enrichment in AA metabolism pathways. However, placental AA transfer was unaffected by 2 h fetal glucagon infusions. In conclusion, a 2 h glucagon infusion stimulates hepatic glucose production and enhances AA catabolism in the fetal liver, lowering plasma AA concentrations. The primary acute effects of fetal glucagon are hepatic, as placental AA transfer is unchanged.

AB  - The Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) are low molecular weight compounds and mostly belong to terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, Green Leaf Volatiles (GLVs) and amino acid derivatives. Volatile phytochemicals function as airborne indirect defense communication signals that specifically attract natural enemies. This case study discusses in detail metrics of publication on Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles and pest management in the last two decades as listed on the Web of Science collection. Out of a total of 207 research publications, India and other countries contributed eight and 199 publications respectively, with a publication percentage of 3.86 and 96.13. Globally, the impact factor (JIF) ranged from 0.22 (Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society) to 10.151 (New Phytologist). Similarly for Indian publications, the range was from 0.208 to 4.223. Web of Science citation of all papers published on this topic totaled 4,302 excluding self-citation. The average h-index was 35 and the average citation per year was 245.16. If the research progress through these years is monitored, it was explicit that the research picked up during the last decade and around 87 percent of total publications made were from 2010 to 2021. The researchers should focus more on HIPV synthetic production and application which enhances its uses in IPM.

AB  - Micromelalopha troglodyta (Graeser) is an important pest of poplar in China, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) is an important detoxifying enzyme in M. troglodyta. In this paper, three full-length GST genes from M. troglodyta were cloned and identified. These GST genes all belonged to the epsilon class (MtGSTe1, MtGSTe2, and MtGSTe3). Furthermore, the expression of these three MtGSTe genes in different tissues, including midguts and fat bodies, and the MtGSTe expression in association with different concentrations of tannic acid, including 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg ml(-1), were analysed in detail. The results showed that the expression levels of MtGSTe1, MtGSTe2, and MtGSTe3 were all the highest in the fourth instar larvae; the expression levels of MtGSTe1 and MtGSTe3 were the highest in fat bodies, while the expression level of MtGSTe2 was the highest in midguts. Furthermore, the expression of MtGSTe mRNA was induced by tannic acid in M. troglodyta. These studies were helpful to clarify the interaction between plant secondary substances and herbivorous insects at a deep level and provided a theoretical foundation for controlling M. troglodyta.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a significant invasive pest identified as a serious threat to global agricultural production and food security. However, its ovipositional preference, larval feeding selectivity, and nutritional indices are less studied. Here, we investigated these traits of FAW when fed on maize, wheat, soybean, tomato, cotton, and Chinese cabbage, and analyzed the correlation between its nutritional indices and the nutritional contents of crops. The results showed that the highest number of eggs were laid on maize and the lowest number were laid on tomato. The highest feeding choice rate of third instar larvae was on maize, and the lowest was on Chinese cabbage. The fifth instar larvae showed the highest feeding choice rate on maize, but no significant differences were found among other crop species. The food consumption (FC), the relative growth rate (RGR), and the approximate digestibility (AD) were significantly higher on maize and wheat, while the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were significantly higher when fed on cotton and Chinese cabbage. The FC, the relative consumption rate (RCR), RGR, and AD were significantly and positively correlated with soluble sugar and protein contents of host plants, while the ECI and ECD were significantly and negatively correlated with the soluble sugar content. The present study indicates that FAW may cause potential economic losses to these crops besides maize, and these findings are valuable in managing and controlling this pest.

AB  - We evaluated the induction of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in maize after the attack of two piercing-sucking maize hoppers: the specialist Dalbulus maidis and the oligophagous Peregrinus maidis. We analyzed VOCs in plants after feeding and oviposition by females of both species. We also contrasted VOCs induced by D. maidis males with those induced by females' infestation that comprised oviposition, to evaluate which VOC could be responsible for attracting an egg parasitoid. We quantified the damage performed by both hoppers and tested the behavioral response of the egg parasitoid Anagrus virlai to VOCs emitted by infested and healthy plants. Plants infested by D. maidis females released significantly more VOCs than the other treatments: healthy plants, plants infested by P. maidis females and plants infested by D. maidis males. beta-Caryophyllene, alpha-bergamotene, beta-farnesene and cis-3-hexenyl acetate dominated the volatile blend (46%) in plants infested by D. maidis females, while in those plants infested by P. maidis these compounds represented only 17%. Females of both hoppers inflicted a comparable amount of damage, in terms of feeding injuries and number of eggs laid. beta-Caryophyllene and cis-3-hexenyl acetate were not induced in plants infested by D. maidis males, that had no oviposited eggs. Finally, females of the egg parasitoid oriented toward VOCs from plants infested by females of the specialist D. maidis, rather than those infested by the oligophagous P. maidis or those infested by D. maidis males.

AB  - Simple Summary Female Rhynchites foveipennis damages fruit stems when laying eggs in pears; the consequence of this interesting behaviour is poorly studied. The present study tested the hypothesis that the oviposition behaviour disarms the host plants' defence by a series of comparative experiments. Our findings showed that when fruit stems were intact, the survival rates of eggs and larvae were only 21.3-32.6%, respectively, and the larvae weighed only 3.2-4.1 mg 30 days after oviposition. In contrast, when the fruit stems were damaged, the survival rates of eggs and larvae increased to 86.1-94.0%, respectively, and the larvae weighed 73.0-74.9 mg 30 days after oviposition. The contents of tannin and flavonoids in the pears did not change significantly, but eggs were crushed and killed by the callus in the pears. Once the stunted larvae were transferred to picked-off pears, the growth and development could recover rapidly. The authors propose that the oviposition behaviour can increase the survival and growth of the offspring, and thus is a strategy to disarm the plant defence. Female weevils of the family Attelabidae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) possess a unique behaviour of partially cutting the branches connecting egg-bearing organs of their host plants during oviposition. However, the consequence of such behaviour remains unclear. Using Rhynchites foveipennis and its host pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), the present study tested the hypothesis that the oviposition behaviour could disarm the host plants' defence. We compared the survival rates, growth rates, and performance of eggs and larvae under two conditions: (1) the fruit stems were naturally damaged by the females before and after oviposition, and (2) the fruit stems were artificially protected from the females. When fruit stems were protected from female damage, the survival rates of eggs and larvae were only 21.3-32.6%, respectively; and the larval weight was 3.2-4.1 mg 30 days after laying eggs. When the fruit stems were damaged, the survival rates of eggs and larvae reached 86.1-94.0%, respectively; and the larval weight reached 73.0-74.9 mg 30 days after laying eggs. The contents of tannin and flavonoids in the pears did not change significantly along with the oviposition and larval feeding, but weevil eggs were crushed and killed by the callus in the pears. Once the stunted larvae in branch-growing pears were moved into the picked-off ones, the growth and development recovered. The findings indicate that the oviposition behaviour can significantly increase the survival of the offspring. Our study suggested that the oviposition behaviour of attelabid weevils is a strategy to overcome plant defence.

AB  - Plants release volatiles in response to caterpillar feeding.These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) attract natural enemies of the herbivores and repel or attract conspecific adult herbivores in a tri-trophic interaction which has been considered to be an indirect plant defense against herbivores. Recently, we demonstrated the attraction of male and female European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to a blend of phenylacetonitrile and acetic acid, two compounds identified as HIPVs in heterospecific apple-leafroller interactions. The ecological basis of our findings is not clearly understood.Thus, this work was undertaken to investigate HIPVs in the grapevine-leafroller interaction and study the response of heterospecific adults L. botrana, to these volatiles. We collected headspace volatiles emitted from uninfested grapevines and grapevines infested with larvae of a generalist herbivore, the grapevine leafroller moth, Sparganothis pilleriana (Denis & Schiffermuller), and analyzed them using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Infested grape leaves released three compounds (phenylacetonitrile, indole, and 2-phenylethanol) not found from uninfested leaves. Nine different blends, comprising a full factorial set of the three oompou nds with each blend containing acetic acid, were tested in a field-cage trial. Only lures containing phenylacetonitrile caused a significant increase in trap catches compared to the other lures and blank traps. Electroantennographic tests show that L botrana can detect the compounds. The results confirm our hypothesis that phenylacetonitrile is released during grapevines infestation with herbivores, and attracts adult L. botrana.

AB  - Selenium is an essential trace element that is delivered to the brain by the selenium transport protein selenoprotein P (SEPP1), primarily by binding to its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8), also known as apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), at the blood-brain barrier. Selenium transport is required for several important brain functions, with transgenic deletion of either Sepp1 or Lrp8 resulting in severe neurological dysfunction and death in mice fed a selenium-deficient diet. Previous studies have reported that although feeding a standard chow diet can prevent these severe deficits, some motor coordination and cognitive dysfunction remain. Importantly, no single study has directly compared the motor and cognitive performance of the Sepp1 and Lrp8 knockout (KO) lines. Here, we report the results of a comprehensive parallel analysis of the motor and spatial learning and memory function of Sepp1 and Lrp8 knockout mice fed a standard mouse chow diet. Our results revealed that Sepp1 knockout mice raised on a selenium-replete diet displayed motor and cognitive function that was indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. In contrast, we found that although Lrp8-knockout mice fed a selenium-replete diet had normal motor function, their spatial learning and memory showed subtle deficits. We also found that the deficit in baseline adult hippocampal neurogenesis exhibited by Lrp8-deficit mice could not be rescued by dietary selenium supplementation. Taken together, these findings further highlight the importance of selenium transport in maintaining healthy brain function.

AB  - Aims: The present study examined the role of ventral tegmental area (VTA) serotonergic 5HT1A receptors in dextromethorphan/morphine-induced anti-allodynia and the possible changes of corticolimbic cFos, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) following the treatments. Materials and methods: The VTA cannulation and the chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve were performed in male Wistar rats. Flexion withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimulation in the hind-limb were determined using von Frey hairs. The expressions of cFos, BDNF, and GFAP were evaluated using the Western blotting technique. Key findings: BDNF (in the hippocampus), and GFAP (in the targeted sites) levels were increased following neuropathic pain. Morphine administration induced an anti-allodynic effect with a decrease in the amygdala BDNF level. Dextromethorphan/morphine-induced anti-allodynia was accompanied by the decrease of hippocampus/amygdala/PFC GFAP and amygdala cFos expressions. The PFC BDNF expression level was increased in dextromethorphan/morphine-treated rats. Intra-VTA microinjection of (S)-WAY100135 (1 mu g/rat), a selective 5HT1A receptor antagonist, inhibited the anti-allodynic effect of dextromethorphan/morphine. This treatment increased the cFos level in the hippocampus and the amygdala while decreased the PFC level of cFos. The hippocampal BDNF expression was significantly increased, while the amygdala and the PFC expressions of BDNF were decreased under treatment. (S)-WAY100135 plus dextromethorphan/morphine increased the hippocampal/amygdala and PFC levels of GFAP. Significance: These findings indicate that dextromethorphan could potentiate the analgesic effect of morphine via the implication of the VTA serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. It seems that the changes in the corticolimbic cFos/ BDNF/GFAP signaling pathway may be involved in the observed anti-allodynic effect.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is highly toxic and not easily degradable. It damages plant growth and results in large-scale economic losses. The present study explored the feasibility of using melatonin to alleviate Cd toxicity, and to reduce Cd accumulation in tea seedlings cultivated in Cd-contaminated soil. Exogenous melatonin, especially at 150 mu M, promoted tea seedling growth under Cd stress, and increased the photosynthetic pigment by 16% and soluble protein content by 5%. Furthermore, melatonin effectively increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) by 21 and 31%, respectively, contributed to a decrease of the malondialdehyde (MDA) by 2% and the Cd content in leaves by 52%. Furthermore, soil enzyme activities were enhanced, including acid phosphatase (ACP), urease (UE), soil sucrase (SC), and soil catalase (CAT), by 11, 70, 1, and 18%, respectively, along with a pH reduction and available Cd content increase, after melatonin application. Taken together, our results provide evidence that melatonin lessens the adverse Cd effects on tea seedlings' physiology, mainly through enhancing the antioxidant capacity of the plants and soils to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon Cd exposure. Therefore, melatonin may be used as a modulator to alleviate Cd-induced toxicity in tea seedlings, thereby resulting in healthier tea plant growth.

AB  - We investigated ectoparasite diversity, interspecific infestation rates and host preference in roosting fruit bats, Eidolon helvum, from Bowen University, Southwest Nigeria. Fur of captured E. helvum were sampled monthly for ectoparasites from January 2021 to June 2022. We examined a total of 231 E. helvum and observed a significant female to male adult sex ratio (0.22:1); with 53.9% ectoparasitic infestation rate. We identified and enumerated the ectoparasite; and subjected its Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene to phylogenetic analysis with other nycteribiids. COI gene sequences obtained formed a distinct clade with other C. greeffi sequences. We recovered a total of 319 (149 female and 170 male) ectoparasites and observed a balanced C. greeffi female to male adult sex ratio of 0.88:1. Ectoparasitic sex distribution had no association with host sex and season. Prevalence was significantly higher during the wet season, but not between sexes of E. helvum. The intensity of infestation, 3.7 & PLUSMN; 0.4 individuals per fruit bat, was significantly higher during the wet season with a bimodal seasonal distribution. The strongly male-biased host adult sex ratio had no significant influence on C. greeffi metapopulation adult sex ratio.

AB  - Hu and Wugu x Hu rams underwent scrotal insulation to simulate mild heat stress, resulting in a 3.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C increase in scrotal surface temperature. Semen samples were collected every five days from day 11 to 56, and testis samples immediately after insulation. Both breeds experienced similar semen quality reductions and recovery trends, including reduced motility, concentration and the percentage of morphologically normal, but on days 41 and 46, Wugu-Hu rams exhibited significantly lower sperm motility than Hu rams (p < 0.05). Wugu-Hu rams demonstrate more transcriptomic changes. Further GO analysis revealed enrichment in spermatogenesis-related processes, while KEGG analysis identified Oocyte meiosis and cell cycle pathways, with a downregulation of key genes (CDK1, CDK2, CDC20, and PLK1) indicating impaired meiosis in Wugu-Hu rams. In contrast, Hu rams showed minimal transcriptional changes, contrary to the transcriptomic results. The significantly increased apoptosis rate of Wugu-Hu sheep testicular cells (p < 0.05) suggests compensatory or post-transcriptional mechanisms mitigating functional impacts caused by transcriptomic changes. The conclusion is that mild scrotal heat stress affects sperm quality and testicular gene expression. Wugu-Hu rams demonstrate greater transcriptomic sensitivity, but this does not show significant differences in semen quality recovery due to the compensatory mechanism of cell apoptosis.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The size of primate 'harems' varies considerably, both inter- and intra-specifically. Previous studies have shown that females prefer high-quality males and that high-quality males are superior in inter-male competition, leading to them having a larger harem size. Based on eleven years of observations of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti), we documented longitudinal stability in the distribution of harem sizes between 2010 and 2020. These demographic properties are the outcome of male and female social investment decisions that affect their reproductive performance and success. Male reproductive success was positively related to harem size, while constraints on individual social benefits and social investments limited harem size. Our findings advance our understanding of the socioecological determinants of harem size variation in polygynous primates.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   We used long-term data on the variation in harem size in Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys to research the effects of harem size on reproductive success and the ratio of grooming received to given (RGRG). The results suggest that harem holders derive reproductive benefits commensurate with harem size, whereas the females' reproductive success is unaffected by harem size. Males of larger harems groomed less and had higher RGRG than males of smaller harems. In the case of females, grooming given increased, and RGRG decreased with an increase in harem size. The males' reproductive success seems to be a driver of harem size maximization. From the females' perspective, dwindling social benefits appear to set the upper limit for harem enlargement. We also showed that males of monogamous units ('single-female harems') invested more into grooming their female, presumably to prevent unit disintegration and loss of mating privileges.</p>

AB  - PM10 emission from livestock houses is a major contributor to the ambient PM10 mass concentrations in many industrialized countries. Measurement methods developed for stationary source PM10 emissions (e.g., EN 13284) are often unsuitable for application in livestock houses whereas methods for ambient air based on impaction pre- separators (e.g., EN 12341) are vulnerable to particle bouncing and overloading. In the past, a gravimetric reference method of EN 12341 (IPS) has been modified by incorporating a cyclone as pre-separator (CPS). The aim of this study was to investigate the equivalence of the modified version of the reference method used in livestock houses. Previous studies comparing the CPS and IPS reported a high variation in the relationship between these two samplers. This study examines the effect of different livestock categories on this relationship, as differences in particle size distributions associated with different livestock categories, are expected to influence the relationship between these two methods. Both CPS and IPS were applied in this study across multiple livestock houses of 3 livestock categories (fattening pigs, laying hens, broilers). Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted, incorporating data from previous studies on gravimetric measurements of PM10, to establish a calibration function for measurements obtained using the CPS. This study concludes that the observed performance of the CPS is higher than the IPS in terms of between sampler uncertainty. Furthermore, the relationship between PM10 measurements with the IPS and CPS has been shown to be different for different livestock categories. The accuracy of CPS measurements relative to IPS measurements improves significantly when livestock category-specific calibration functions are applied, rather than using generic calibration functions. The necessity for livestock category-specific calibration of the CPS in relation to the IPS is also supported by the results of the meta-analysis.

AB  - BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a predominant stromal cell type in the tumor microenvironment, significantly affect the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).ResultsThe specific mechanisms through which CAFs influence the cancer stem cell phenotype in OSCC are not fully understood. This study explored the effects of lactic acid produced by CAFs on the cancer stem cells (CSCs) phenotype of OSCC cells. Our results demonstrated that CAFs exhibit increased glycolysis and lactic acid production. Lactic acid treatment enhances CSCs-related markers expression, sphere formation, and clonogenic ability of OSCC cells. RNA sequencing revealed that lactic acid treatment elevates Discs Large Homolog 5 (DLG5) expression and markedly affects the Hippo pathway. Further investigation revealed that DLG5 mediates the effects of lactic acid on the CSCs phenotype. DLG5 knockdown results in elevated expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin 3, which can promote the ubiquitination and degradation of MST1, but the expression of phosphorylated MST1 remains unchanged. This leads to enhanced binding of phosphorylated MST1 to YAP1, increasing YAP1 phosphorylation and activating the Hippo pathway.ConclusionCollectively, our findings suggest that lactic acid from CAFs promotes the CSCs phenotype in OSCC through the DLG5/CUL3/MST1 axis. Therefore, targeting lactic acid exchange between CAFs and tumor cells may provide a novel therapeutic approach to suppress the CSCs phenotype in OSCC.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in pigs. A key determinant of viral tropism and entry, the PEDV spike protein is a key target for the host antibody response and a good candidate for a protein-based vaccine immunogen. We used electron microscopy to evaluate the PEDV spike structure, as well as pig polyclonal antibody responses to viral infection. The structure of the PEDV spike reveals a configuration similar to that of HuCoV-NL63. Several PEDV proteinprotein interfaces are mediated by non-protein components, including a glycan at Asn264 and two bound palmitoleic acid molecules. The polyclonal antibody response to PEDV infection shows a dominance of epitopes in the S1 region. This structural and immune characterization provides insights into coronavirus spike stability determinants and explores the immune landscape of viral spike proteins.

AB  - Retinal angiogenesis was delayed in VSMC-specific Akt1-deficient mice (Akt1( increment SMC)) but not in Akt2( increment SMC) mice. The proliferation of ECs, recruitment of pericytes, and coverage of VSMCs to the endothelium were defective in Akt1( increment SMC). The silencing of Akt1 in VSMCs led to the downregulation of angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) and the upregulation of Ang2. The activation of Notch3 in VSMCs was significantly reduced in the retinas of Akt1( increment SMC) mice. Silencing Akt1 suppressed the activation of Notch3. Moreover, the silencing of Notch3 downregulated Ang1, whereas the overexpression of Notch3 intracellular domain (NICD3) enhanced Ang1 expression. The nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of yes-associated protein (YAP) were affected by the expression level of Akt1. Silencing YAP downregulated Ang2 expression, whereas overexpression of YAP showed the opposite results. Ang1 antibody and Ang2 suppressed endothelial sprouting of wild-type aortic tissues, whereas the Ang2 antibody and Ang1 facilitated the endothelial sprouting of aortic tissues from Akt1( increment SMC) mice. Finally, severe hemorrhage was observed in Akt1( increment SMC) mice, which was further facilitated under streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic conditions. Therefore, the Akt1-Notch3/YAP-Ang1/2 signaling cascade in VSMCs might play an essential role in the paracrine regulation of endothelial function.
   Blood vessel formation: Nearly identical proteins but different effects Proteins Akt1 and Akt2 are nearly identical, but they play different roles in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is crucial in wound healing and development, and also in tumor formation. Although Akt1's role in angiogenesis is well studied, the role of other Akt isoforms-highly similar, related proteins-was unknown. Sun Sik Bae at Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, South Korea, and coworkers investigated how Akt1 and Akt2 influence angiogenesis in the retinas of mice. They found that despite having very similar sequences, Akt2 had almost no effect but Akt1 was crucial for vascular stability. Akt1 boosted levels of the blood vessel stabilization protein Ang1 and suppressed Ang2. Mice lacking Akt1 eventually showed blood vessel leakage. These results illuminate the mechanisms underlying blood vessel formation.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of the activator factor of the WNT pathway, chir98014, leading to the in vitro sheep oocyte maturation medium, on the cumulus cell development, different nuclear maturation stages and the following process of embryonic development. Experiments included (a) addition of different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 mu m) of chir98014 to the maturation medium and evaluation of the cumulus cell expansion, (b) addition of different concentrations of chir98014 to the maturation medium and investigation of different nuclear maturation stages, (c) addition of different concentrations of chir98014 to the maturation medium and examination of the subsequent embryonic maturation process and (d) addition of different concentrations of chir98014 to the embryonic development culture medium (the first 48 hr) and investigation of the subsequent embryonic development process. The extracted data were analysed using the SPSS software, considering the significance level of p < .05 and making the mean comparisons. The results showed that the addition of the 0.1 mu M concentration of chir98014 to the maturation medium had no significant effects on the oocyte maturation and embryo development post-fertilization but it enhanced the Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) expansion. In the fourth experiment, the low concentration of chir98014 in the embryo culture media improved the embryo development process, whereas the high one had a detrimental effect on it, as compared to the control group. Thus, the presence of the lower concentrations of this compound in the embryonic culture medium had favourable effects on the development of embryos.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the fermentative characteristics, chemical composition, and in vitro digestibility of a total mixed ration silage containing two babassu by-products, starchy flour and babassu cake. The treatments were distributed in a completely randomised design containing four treatments and five replications. The treatments consisted of corn silage, corn silage based on the standard corn and soybean diet, corn silage with babassu flour, and corn silage with babassu cake. No significant difference was observed in the pH values (p = 0.256) for the studied silages. Higher values for dry matter recovery were observed for the silages of the total diets. The corn silage presented lower lactic acid production (55.15 g/kg DM) and acetic acid (11.54 g/kg DM) in relation to the total ration silages. The inclusion of babassu by-products increased the dry matter (p < 0.001), crude protein (p < 0.001), and total digestible nutrient content (p < 0.001) in the total ration silages. Silage in the form of the total ration containing regional babassu by-products improved the fermentative profile of the silages and the nutritional value of the diets, endowing them with potential for use as a feed alternative for dairy cattle.

AB  - The tea plant cultivar 'Zhonghuang 2' (ZH2) possesses albino-induced yellow leaves that contain low levels of catechins but high contents of amino acids. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the yellow leaf phenotype of ZH2 has not been elucidated clearly. In the current research, the yellow shoots (ZH2-Y) and naturally converted green shoots (ZH2-G) of ZH2 were studied using metabolic and proteomic profiling for a better understanding of the mechanism underlying phenotype formation. In total, 107 differentially changed metabolites (DCMs) were identified from the GC-MS-based metabolomics, and 189 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) were identified from the tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Subsequently, integrated analysis revealed that 'porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism', 'carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms', and 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis' pathways were commonly enriched for DAPs and DCMs. We further found that the inhibition of chlorophyll biosynthesis, the deficiency of photosynthetic proteins and the imbalance of the ROS-scavenging system were the crucial reasons responsible for the chlorosis, chloroplast abnormality and photooxidative damage of ZH2 leaves. Altogether, our research combines metabolomics and proteomics approaches to uncover the molecular mechanism leading to the yellow leaf phenotype of tea plants.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The therapeutic properties of Hippophae rhamnoides L. were already known in ancient Greece as well as in Tibetan and Mongolian medicine. Modern studies have indicated that Hippophae rhamnoides L. fermentation liquid protected against alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). However, the underlying mechanism of Hippophae rhamnoides L. flavonoids extract (HLF) treating AFLD remains elusive. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of HLF in mice with AFLD and the interaction between AFLD and gut microbiota. Materials and methods: Chemical constituents of HLF were analyzed by Liquid Chromatography-Ion Trap-ESIMass Spectrometry. The Hepatoprotective effect of HLF was evaluated in mice with AFLD induced by alcohol (six groups, n = 10) daily at doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g/kg for 30 consecutive days. At the end of experiment, mice were sacrificed and the liver, serum and feces were harvested for analysis. The liver histological changes were observed by H&E staining and oil red O staining. Moreover, the alterations of fecal microflora were detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The inflammatory related genes were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting respectively. Results: The results showed that the oral administration of HLF remarkably alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation by decreasing the levels of ALT, AST, TG and TC. The levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IL-6 were also reduced after treatment with HLF. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA expression of NF-kB p65, MAPK p38 and TAK-1 in the liver of mice with AFLD were all reduced by HLF compared with model group. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis demonstrated that HLF treatment can help restore the imbalance of intestinal microbial ecosystem and reverse the changes in Fimicutes/Bacterodietes, Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, S24-7, and Prevotella in mice with AFLD. Conclusion: HLF can effectively ameliorate liver injury in mice with AFLD, and regulate the composition of gut microbiota. Its regulatory mechanism may be related to TAK1/p38MAPK/p65NF-kappa B pathway. This study may provide novel insights into the mechanism of HLF on AFLD and a basis for promising clinical usage.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Panax notoginseng saponin (PNS) has a variety of biological activities, such as improvement of myocardial ischemia, improvement of learning and memory, hypolipidemia, and immunomodulation. However, its protective mechanism on the central nervous system (CNS) is not clear. Aim of the study: The present study initially evaluated the possible mechanism of PNS to improve cognitive dysfunction due to chronic sleep deprivation (CSD). Materials and methods: In the present study, we used a modified multi-platform aquatic environment sleep deprivation method to induce a cognitively impaired rat model, and explored the mechanism of action of PNS by integrating serum metabolomics and network pharmacology, which was further verified by molecular docking and experiments. Results: The results showed that PNS significantly shortened the escape latency, increased the target quadrant time and the number of traversing platforms, and attenuated the inflammatory damage in the hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region in CSD rats. The non-targeted metabolomics results indicated that 35 biomarkers significantly altered following PNS therapy intervention, with metabolic pathways enriched for the effects of One carbon pool by folate, Riboflavin metabolism, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, Sphingolipid metabolism, Glycerolipid metabolism, Arachidonic acid metabolism, and Tryptophan metabolism. In addition, network pharmacology identified 234 potential targets for PNS intervention in CSD with cognitive impairment. Metabolite-response-enzyme-gene network was constructed by MetaScape and matched with the network pharmacology results to identify a total of five shared targets (LPL, GPAM, HSD11B1, HSD11B2, and SULT2A1) and two metabolic pathways (Sphingolipid metabolism and Steroid hormone biosynthesis). The results of molecular docking revealed that the five active ingredients had good binding ability with the five core targets. qPCR analysis confirmed the ability of PNS to modulate the above five targets. Conclusions: The combination of metabolomics and network analysis provides a scientific basis for promoting the clinical application of PNS in cognitive impairment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, representing the seventh cause of death worldwide and the first cause of dementia. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been connected to this pathology, including protein aggregation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroin- flammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cell death. The etiology of AD is multifactorial, suggesting that, in addition to a genetic component, the environment may strongly influence its onset and progression. Exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic (As), is known to be associated with AD, with As showing one of the strongest correlations, in relation to the epigenetic changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) set a very low limit for its concentration to 10 mu g/l in drinking water. The possibility that As may induce epigenetic effects is a recent hypothesis. Evidence, so far, suggests that As may induce DNA hypomethylation in the brain, by mechanisms not yet completely disclosed. This minireview aims to provide evidence to support the role of As exposure in AD, maintaining a focus on oxidative stress and ferroptosis, with a perspective on DNA methylation.

AB  - YTHDF2, a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) recognition protein, is involved in the occurrence and progression of various malignancies. The impact of YTHDF2 on the radiosensitivity of rectal cancer cells remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of YTHDF2 on radiotherapy sensitivity in rectal cancer. Acquired radioresistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (HCT-116-R and CX-1-R) were established through accumulative X-ray exposure. YTHDF2 was exogenously overexpressed or endogenously knocked down using lentivirus systems, and the radiosensitivity of the cells was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing identified MYC as a downstream target of YTHDF2. RNA stability assays revealed that YTHDF2 facilitated the decay of MYC messenger (mRNA) through an m6A-dependent mechanism. Western blot analyses demonstrated that YTHDF2 modulated MYC expression and the Hippo signaling pathway, enhancing p-MST1/2, p-LATS1 and p-YAP levels while reducing nuclear YAP. Functional assays showed that YTHDF2 overexpression improved radiosensitivity by promoting radiation-induced apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest. MYC overexpression reversed these effects, suggesting a competitive regulatory relationship between YTHDF2 and MYC. These findings indicate that YTHDF2 modulates radiosensitivity through MYC and the Hippo signaling pathway. YTHDF2 enhances the radiosensitivity of rectal cancer cells by facilitating the degradation of MYC mRNA and activating the Hippo signaling pathway. Targeting YTHDF2 may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming radioresistance in rectal carcinoma.

AB  - Wild fruits are distributed worldwide, but are consumed mainly in developing countries, where they are an important part of the diet. Still, in many other countries, they are consumed only locally. Blackthorn (Prunus spinosa L.) is an underutilized species rich in fibres and phenolic compounds, making it suitable as a potential functional food for supporting human health. Cold (Cw) and hot (Hw) water-extracted (poly)phenolic polysaccharide-protein complexes, differing in carbohydrate, phenolic and protein contents, were isolated from blackthorn fruits and characterized. The complexes exhibited molecular weights of 235,200 g/mol (Cw) and 218,400 g/mol (Hw), and were rich in pectic polymers containing galacturonic acid, arabinose, galactose and rhamnose, indicating a dominance of homogalacturonan (HG) [-> 4)-alpha-D-GalA(1 -> 4)-alpha-D-GalA(1 ->]n and a low content of RGI [-> 2)-alpha-L-Rha(1 -> 4)-alpha-D-GalA(1 -> 2)-alpha-L-Rha(1 ->]n sequences associated with arabinan or arabinogalactan. Minor content of glucan, probably starch-derived, was also solubilized. Pectic polysaccharides were highly esterified and partly acetylated. Pharmacological testing was performed in male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs, a model with human-like airway reflexes. Both complexes affected airway defense mechanisms. Particularly, Hw significantly suppressed citric acid-induced cough, similar to codeine, and reduced bronchoconstriction comparably to salbutamol in a dose-dependent manner. These findings support further exploration of Hw as a natural antitussive and bronchodilatory agent.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) affects the development of porcine gametes and embryos negatively, induces the decrease of reproductive ability significantly, threatens global pig production. Ginsenoside Re (GRe), is a main bioactive component of ginseng, shows very specific anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. To investigate the alleviating effect of GRe on the in vitro maturation of porcine oocyte under the HS, the polar body extrusion rate, intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were assessed. For the current study, porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) randomly divided into four groups: the control, GRe, HS and HS + GRe group. The results showed that HS inhibited the cumulus cell expansion and polar body extrusion rate, the levels of GSH and MMP, the ATP content, the gene expression of Nrf2 of porcine oocytes and the parthenogenetic activation (PA) embryo development competence, but GRe treatment could partly neutralize these adverse effects. Furthermore, HS increased the ROS formation and percentage of apoptosis, the gene expression of HSP90, CASP3 and CytoC of porcine oocytes, but GRe could weaken the effect on Cyto C and BAX expression induced by HS. Taken together, these results showed that the presence of GRe during in vitro maturation protects porcine oocytes from HS. These findings lay a foundation for GRe may be used as a potential protective drug to protect porcine oocytes against HS damage.

AB  - A zoo-based, 11-year-old, uniparous southern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis minor) failed to conceive after weaning a calf. Behavioral observation and fecal progestagen monitoring confirmed irregular estrous cycles. Serial transrectal reproductive ultrasound examination revealed the cause to be recurrent anovulatory hemorrhagic follicles (AHFs). After four consecutive abnormal cycles dominated by AHFs, rational hormone therapy was implemented. Injectable prostaglandins, progesterone, estradiol, and a GnRH analog were given strategically to disrupt AHFs, boost normal estrus behavior, and promote ovulation. Oxytocin was added to the treatment regimen when transient accumulations of intraluminal uterine fluid consistent with endometritis were observed ultrasonographically. Oral diazepam was given judiciously for anxiolysis after the animal developed an aversion to injection. Treatment, which proceeded over eight cycles, was eventually associated with the restoration of normal behavioral estrus and ovulation. The rhinoceros conceived after natural mating and induced ovulation, delivering a healthy calf 490 days later, the longest reported gestation for the species.

AB  - Epileptogenesis is a process that includes molecular and cellular events that foster the establishment of hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the brain. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling model in rodents has added new information to the knowledge about the pathogenesis of epilepsy and potential targets of novel antiepileptic agents. Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that oxidative and inflammatory events may play important roles in the initiation and maintaining seizure activities. Vitamin B12 has beneficial effects on the nervous system and presents pleiotropic effects with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory aspects. In the present study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that vitamin B12 and their combination with lamotrigine prevents behavioral deficits, hippocampal damage, oxidation, and proinflammatory state during epileptogenesis. Male rats were subjected to PTZ-induced epileptogenesis and pretreated with vitamin B12 (50 mu g/kg) or Lamotrigine (LTG) (25 mg/kg) or B12 (50 mu g/kg) + LTG (25 mg/kg). Vitamin B12 and its combination with LTG suppressed epileptogenesis and improved the performance of rats in the passive avoidance test. In addition, Vitamin B12 and its combination with LTG decreased levels of total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and increased total antioxidant status (TAS) levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, it reduced hippocampal neuronal damage. Current findings support the beneficial actions of vitamin B12 due to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties during the course of disease. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fungal infections present a significant health risk, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, though its antifungal potential and underlying mechanisms against both yeast-like and filamentous fungi are not fully understood. This study investigates the antifungal efficacy of berberine against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes in vitro, as well as its therapeutic potential in a murine model of cryptococcal infection. Berberine showed strong antifungal activity, with MIC values ranging from 64 to 128 mu g/mL. SEM and TEM analyses revealed that berberine induced notable disruptions to the cell wall and membrane in C. neoformans. No signs of cell necrosis or apoptosis were observed in fungal cells treated with 2 x MIC berberine, and it did not increase intracellular ROS levels or affect mitochondrial membrane potential. Molecular docking and binding affinity assays demonstrated a strong interaction between berberine and the fungal enzyme CYP51, with a dissociation constant (KD) of less than 1 x 10-12 M, suggesting potent inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis. In vivo studies further showed that berberine promoted healing in guinea pigs infected with T. mentagrophytes, and in a murine cryptococcal infection model, it prolonged survival and reduced lung inflammation, showing comparable efficacy to fluconazole. These findings indicate that berberine exerts broad-spectrum antifungal effects through membrane disruption and CYP51 inhibition, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic option for fungal infections.

AB  - FoxO is a downstream target gene of cellular nutrient and growth factors, oxidative stress responses, and insulin signaling pathways. It play a crucial role in insect growth, development, and reproduction. Locusta migratoria is a significant agricultural pest; therefore, the identification of novel control targets for its management is of significant importance. After injecting dsRNA to interfere with FoxO expression, we observed changes in the reproduction-related gene expression and ovary development through RT-qPCR and morphological observation. Simultaneously, the trehalose and glycogen contents were measured following RNAi. The results demonstrate that interference with FoxO significantly downregulates key genes in the Hippo pathway and Notch gene expression. In terms of carbohydrate metabolism, the trehalose content decreases significantly while the glycogen content increases markedly after FoxO silencing. Additionally, FoxO silencing considerably inhibits reproductive-related gene expression, resulting in delayed ovarian development. These findings indicate that FoxO regulates L. migratoria reproduction through the Hippo signaling pathway: when impaired, the reproductive capacity function declines. In addition, FoxO-mediated energy mobilization is involved in the regulation of egg production. These results indicate that the RNAi of FoxO may be a useful control strategy against L. migratoria.

AB  - Non-native lady beetle species have often been introduced, with variable success, into North America for biological control of aphids, scales, whiteflies, and other agricultural pests. Two predatory lady beetle species, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata and Hippodamia variegata , both originating from Eurasia, were first discovered near Montreal, Quebec, in North America in 1968 and 1984, respectively, and have since expanded into northeastern North America and the midwestern United States. In this study, we estimate the range -wide population structure, establishment and range -expansion, and recent evolutionary history of these lady beetle species using reduced -representation genotyping-by-sequencing via ddRADseq. In addition, we quantified the responses to a key abiotic factor, photoperiod, that regulates adult reproductive diapause in these two species and may influence their geographical range in North America. Our analyses detect: (1) non -significant genetic differentiation and divergence among North American populations that likely originated from a single accidental introduction, (2) evidence of reduced contemporary gene flow within the continental US, and (3) minor phenotypic differences in diapause induction between populations of the two species from the same location.

AB  - How the two pathognomonic proteins of Alzheimer's disease (AD); amyloid ss (A ss) and tau, cause synaptic failure remains enigmatic. Certain synthetic and recombinant forms of these proteins are known to act concurrently to acutely inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we examined the effect of early amyloidosis on the acute disruptive action of synaptotoxic tau prepared from recombinant protein and tau in patient-derived aqueous brain extracts. We also explored the persistence of the inhibition of LTP by different synaptotoxic tau preparations. A single intracerebral injection of aggregates of recombinant human tau that had been prepared by either sonication of fibrils (S tau As) or disulfide bond formation (oTau) rapidly and persistently inhibited LTP in rat hippocampus. The threshold for the acute inhibitory effect of oTau was lowered in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic rats. A single injection of synaptotoxic tau-containing AD or Pick's disease brain extracts also inhibited LTP, for over two weeks. Remarkably, the persistent disruption of synaptic plasticity by patient-derived brain tau was rapidly reversed by a single intracerebral injection of different anti-tau monoclonal antibodies, including one directed to a specific human tau amino acid sequence. We conclude that patient-derived LTP-disrupting tau species persist in the brain for weeks, maintaining their neuroactivity often in concert with A ss.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Long-term potentiation: 50 years on'.

AB  - Alcohol-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) is highly prevalent among patients with alcohol abuse and dependence. The pathophysiology of ARCI, pivotal for refined therapeutic approaches, is not fully elucidated, posing a risk of progression to severe neurological sequelae such as Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) and AlcoholRelated Dementia (ARD). This study ventures into the underlying mechanisms of chronic alcohol-induced neurotoxicity, notably glutamate excitotoxicity and cytoskeletal disruption, and explores the therapeutic potential of Memantine, a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor known for its neuroprotective effect against excitotoxicity. Our investigation centers on the efficacy of Memantine in mitigating chronic alcohol-induced cognitive and hippocampal damages in vivo. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 30 % (v/v, 6.0 g/kg) ethanol via intragastric administration alongside Memantine co-treatment (10 mg/kg/ day, intraperitoneally) for six weeks. The assessment involved Y maze, Morris water maze, and novel object recognition tests to evaluate spatial and recognition memory deficits. Histopathological evaluations of the hippocampus were conducted to examine the extent of alcohol-induced morphological changes and the potential protective effect of Memantine. The findings reveal that Memantine significantly improves chronic alcoholcompromised cognitive functions and mitigates hippocampal pathological changes, implicating a moderating effect on the disassembly of actin cytoskeleton and microtubules in the hippocampus, induced by chronic alcohol exposure. Our results underscore Memantine's capability to attenuate chronic alcohol-induced cognitive and hippocampal morphological harm may partly through regulating cytoskeleton dynamics, offering valuable insights into innovative therapeutic strategies for ARCI.

AB  - Empirical evidence indicates that high interdependent self-construal (InterSC) is correlated with exaggerated acute stress responses; however, the underlying neural correlates remain unclear. Considering the regulatory effect of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system on the acute stress response, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus (HIP) in the relationship between InterSC and acute stress responses. Forty-eight healthy college students underwent a modified version of the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), while brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants' saliva samples and subjective stress feelings were collected before, during, and after the MIST. Additionally, participants' self-construal was measured using questionnaires. Results revealed that InterSC was positively correlated with the activation of OFC, which, in turn, was associated with higher subjective stress feelings. A higher InterSC was also significantly associated with an enhanced salivary cortisol response in those with lower HIP activity. Furthermore, the HIP moderated the indirect effect of InterSC on subjective stress feelings by moderating the effect of InterSC on neural activity in the OFC. This indicated the mediation of the OFC was stronger in those with higher neural activity in the HIP than in those with lower activity in the HIP. In summary, the current study proposed an important role of the OFC-HIP regions in the relationship between InterSC and acute stress responses, making contribution to broadening the field of personality and stress and deepening our understanding of individual differences in acute stress responses.

AB  - The study discusses changes in lead contents in soil and crops after application of compost and fly ash. A three-year experiment was conducted on narrow-leaved lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.), camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.), which were grown on medium soil fertilised with compost or fly ash (FA). The lead amounts in various combinations were evaluated using sequential (BCR analysis) and single (DTPA solution) methods. The total contents of lead and amounts of selected macronutrients were assessed in the biomass of plants. The Pb contents in the soil and plants were used to calculate the risk assessment code (RAC), individual contamination factor (ICF), bioconcentration factor (BCF) and contamination coefficient level (CCL). Lower amounts of bioavailable Pb in the soil were observed as a result of compost and FA application. Fly ash immobilised Pb more effectively, as evidenced by the BCF and CCL values. The increase in the Pb contents in the sequentially separated fractions and in plant biomass were caused by applied compost or FA. The Pb contents in exchangeable forms decreased, whereas its contents in residual forms increased.

AB  - Strong passivation tendency and excellent corrosion resistance of amorphous coatings on mild steel prepared from a newly developed novel composition(Fe66.59C11.70P7.58Mn0.37Si2.86Cr1.72Mo0.92B8.26, (atom percent) are reported. The composition is a derivative of high P containing Pig iron, and atmospheric plasma spray technique was used for coating. Current-transient response at passivating potential for each coating and MS was recorded to predict the passive tendency of the coatings. The corrosion monitoring of a coating was executed for about 3 months in a 3.5 (weight /volume%) NaCl solution at free corrosion potential to understand its corrosion im-munity. Extensive impedance measurements were carried out to understand the passivation and the nature of passive film on coated samples. The monitoring experiment indicates requirement of prolong duration to achieve the passivation for lean chemistry glass coating. The Fe substituted chromate, borate, and phosphate phases on all the coatings are attributed to the excellent passivation of coatings.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Depression is a prevalent stress disorder, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms linking stress to appetite and weight loss remain elusive. While most antidepressants are associated with excessive weight and appetite gain, sertraline (SER) exhibits a lower risk of these side effects. Metacinnabar ((3-HgS), the primary component of Tibetan medicine Zuotai, has been shown to enhance mice's resilience against external stress without causing excessive increases in weight or appetite. However, the precise physiological pathway through which (3-HgS restores appetite and weight in stressed mice remains unclear. Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of (3-HgS in ameliorating weight loss and appetite suppression induced by pressure stimulation in mice, as well as elucidate its potential mechanisms of action. Methods: The present study employed chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) as experimental models to simulate environmental stress encountered in daily life. Subsequently, a series of experiments were conducted, including behavior tests, HE staining of rectal and hippocampal pathological sections, detection of depression-related biological indicators, analysis of intestinal flora diversity, as well as metabolomics analysis of hippocampal and intestinal contents. Result: Dysregulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism may represent the principal pathway underlying reduced appetite, body weight, neurotransmitter and appetite hormone levels, heightened inflammatory response, hippocampal and rectal tissue damage, as well as altered composition of intestinal microbiota in stressed mice. Following intervention with SER and (3-HgS in stressed mice, the deleterious effects induced by stress can be ameliorated, in which the medium-dose (3-HgS exhibited superior performance. Conclusion: The aforementioned research findings suggest that the stress-induced decrease in appetite and body weight in mice may be associated with dysregulation in glycerophospholipid metabolism connecting the gutbrain axis. (3-HgS exhibits potential in ameliorating depressive-like symptoms in mice subjected to stress, while concurrently restoring their body weight and appetite without inducing excessive augmentation. Its therapeutic effect may also be attributed to its ability to modulate glycerophospholipid metabolism status and exert influence on the gut-brain axis.

AB  - In this presentation, we explored the molecular mechanisms of N. nucifera leaf water extracts (NLWEs) and polyphenol extract (NLPE) on scopolamine-induced cell apoptosis and cognition defects. The administration of NLWE and NLPE did not alter the body weight and serum biomarker rs and significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced cognition impairment according to Y-maze test analysis. In mice, treatment with scopolamine disrupted normal histoarchitecture in the hippocampus, whereas the administration of NLWE and NLPE reversed the phenomenon. Western blot analysis revealed that scopolamine mitigated the expression of doublecortin (DCX), nestin, and NeuN, and cotreatment with NLWE or NLPE significantly recovered the expression of these proteins. NLWE and NLPE upregulated DCX and NeuN expression in the hippocampus region, as evidenced by immunohistochemical staining analysis of scopolamine-treated mice. NLWE and NLPE obviously elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhanced its downstream proteins activity. NLWE and NLPE attenuated scopolamine-induced apoptosis by reducing Bax and increased Bcl-2 expression. In addition, scopolamine also triggered apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells whereas co-treatment with NLWE or quercetin-3-glucuronide (Q3G) reversed the phenomenon. NLWE or Q3G enhanced Bcl-2 and reduced Bax expression in the presence of scopolamine in SH-SY5Y cells. NLWE or Q3G recovered the inhibitory effects of scopolamine on neurogenesis and BDNF signals in SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, our results revealed that N. nucifera leaf extracts and Q3G promoted adult hippocampus neurogenesis and prevented apoptosis to mitigate scopolamine-induced cognition dysfunction through the regulation of BDNF signaling pathway.

AB  - Veterinary drugs are of concern in terms of potential environmental pollution and their negative impacts on avian scavengers. These pharmaceuticals reach vultures through the consumption of carcasses of previously treated livestock. Here, we analysed samples from livestock carcasses (n = 159), avian scavenger tissues (n = 116) and plasma (n = 312) for 49 compounds commonly used in veterinary medicine in Aragon (NE Spain) and nearby regions. Samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spec-trometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). We detected pharmaceuticals in 54.1% of livestock carcasses analysed (50.3% with antibiotics, 10.8% with NSAIDs). For veterinary pharmaceuticals in tissues and plasma from avian scavengers, we detected pharmaceuticals in 51.7% and 28.5% of samples, respectively. Antibiotics were detected in 50.9% and 25.3% while NSAIDs were determined in 6.0% and 5.5% of tissues and plasma from avian scavengers, respectively. Moreover, caffeine was detected in plasma in 73.7% of vultures sampled at landfill sites, indicating its usefulness as a biomarker of urban garbage ingestion. We found an association between livestock carcasses, especially pigs and chickens, and the presence of veterinary pharmaceuticals in avian scavengers. We highlight that carcass disposal for feeding avian scavengers must address the potential risks posed by veterinary phar-maceutical residues.

AB  - Hyperpolarized (HP) xenon-129 (Xe-129), when dissolved in blood, has two NMR resonances: one in red blood cells (RBC) and one in plasma. The impact of numerous blood components on these resonances, however, has not yet been investigated. This study evaluates the effects of elevated glucose levels on the chemical shift (CS) and T-2(*) relaxation times of (HPXe)-Xe-129 dissolved in sterile citrated sheep blood for the first time. (HPXe)-Xe-129 was mixed with sheep blood samples premixed with a stock glucose solution using a liquid-gas exchange module. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on a 3T clinical MRI scanner using a custom-built quadrature dual-tuned Xe-129/H-1 coil. We observed an additional resonance for the RBCs (Xe-129-RBC1) for the increased glucose levels. The CS of Xe-129-RBC1 and Xe-129-plasma peaks did not change with glucose levels, while the CS of Xe-129-RBC2 (original RBC resonance) increased linearly at a rate of 0.015 +/- 0.002 ppm/mM with glucose level. Xe-129-RBC1 T-2(*) values increased nonlinearly from 1.58 +/- 0.24 ms to 2.67 +/- 0.40 ms. As a result of the increased glucose levels in blood samples, the novel additional HP Xe-129 dissolved phase resonance was observed in blood and attributed to the Xe-129 bound to glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)).

AB  - Purpose Understanding the accumulation rule of nutrients is crucial to promote the production of Camellia oleifera. The stoichiometry of soil macro and microelements is more critical than their content in affecting the growth and yield of plants. However, research on C. oleifera in these aspects is limited. Materials and methods In this study, we examined microelement content in soil and various parts of the C. oleifera plant and analyzed the relationship between the bioaccumulation, distribution, and production of plant macro and microelements with the stoichiometry of soil macro and microelements. Results and discussion Our findings indicated that high-yield plants transported more Ca, Mg, and B to the shoot, while low-yield plants stored higher Fe, Zn, and Al in the root. The significantly lower bioaccumulation factor and translocation factor of B and Mg in the high-yield plants highlighted the importance of nutrient storage in promoting C. oleifera yield. Multiple regression analysis and the Mantel test demonstrated that plant yield and bioaccumulation and transportation of macro and microelements were more closely correlated with the stoichiometry of macro and microelements than their content. The significantly different stoichiometry of macro and microelements in soil of different yields revealed that the stoichiometry of macro and microelements was more sensitive and reliable in reflecting the balance in soil nutrients of C. oleifera and regulating its growth. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the balance in soil macro and microelements and their relationship with the growth of C. oleifera and highlights the critical role of the stoichiometry of soil macro and microelements in promoting high and stable production of C. oleifera.

AB  - Although the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is well known for its vasodilatory effects, H2S also exhibits vasoconstricting properties. Herein, it is demonstrated that administration of H2S as intravenous sodium sulfide (Na2S) increased blood pressure in sheep and rats, and this effect persisted after H2S has disappeared from the blood. Inhibition of the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) diminished the hypertensive effects. Incubation of Na2S with whole blood, red blood cells, methemoglobin, or oxyhemoglobin produced a hypertensive product of H2S, which is not hydrogen thioperoxide, metHb-SH- complexes, per-/poly- sulfides, or thiolsulfate, but rather a labile intermediate. One-electron oxidation of H2S by oxyhemoglobin generated its redox cousin, sulfhydryl radical (HS<bold>(center dot))</bold>. Consistent with the role of HS<bold>(center dot)</bold> as the hypertensive intermediate, scavenging HS<bold>(center dot)</bold> inhibited Na2S-induced vasoconstriction and activation of LTCCs. In conclusion, H2S causes vasoconstriction that is dependent on the activation of LTCCs and generation of HS<bold>(center dot)</bold> by oxyhemoglobin.

AB  - Asia has the fastest growing population and economy, but it is also the most disaster-prone region in the world. Resilience to disaster impacts from natural hazards will be key to the long-term sustainability of this rapidly growing region. The first step to building resilience is to identify the key threats that this region faces. We describe these key threats as Black Elephants: a cross between a "black swan" and the proverbial "elephant in the room" - they are extreme events that are known but difficult to address and often ignored. We examine the primary drivers of these looming risks and find that the drivers include underestimated or intensifying hazards, growing exposure, high vulnerability, and unaccounted complexities from multi-hazard events. In mitigating these key risks, we discuss psychological barriers to action and highlight the importance of information, language, and hope. The known but complex impacts from natural hazards in Asia must be further acknowledged and managed in order to build a more sustainable, resilient future in an increasingly globally connected world.
   Plain Language Summary Asia has the fastest growing population and economy in the world, but it is also the most disaster prone region and is home to many Black Elephant disaster risks. Black Elephant risks are a cross between extreme events that are known, but difficult to address, and are especially relevant to Asia's development. In this paper, we characterize drivers of these risks, including underestimated or changing hazards, growing number of people, places, and things that are potentially affected by hazards, high vulnerability of built and social systems when exposed to hazards, and growing impacts from multi-hazard events. Analysis of the drivers of Black Elephant events offer insights for improved resilience to Black Elephant events. In addressing Black Elephant disaster risks, we recommend leveraging the power of language, hope, and existing information for improved resilience in this region.
