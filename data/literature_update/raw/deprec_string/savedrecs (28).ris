AB  - Background: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) transmits its signal via two major G alpha-proteins, primarily G alpha q and G alpha i. However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of G alpha s signal in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. We have previously identified that GV1001, a fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the G alpha s/cAMP pathway. Here, we tried to reveal the potential mechanisms of which GV1001-stimulated G alpha s-cAMP signaling pathway reduces the migration and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) cells.
   Methods: The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by western-blotting and spheroid formation on ultra-low attachment plate was detected after GV1001 treatment. In vivo Spleen-liver metastasis mouse model was used to explore the inhibitory effect of GV1001 on metastatic ability of PCa and the transwell migration assay was performed to identify whether GV1001 had a suppressive effect on cell migration in vitro. In order to demonstrate the interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and YAP1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed in LNCaP cells with and without GV1001 treatment.
   Results: GV1001 inhibited expression of EMT-related genes and spheroid formation. GV1001 also suppressed in vivo spleen-liver metastasis of LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in vitro. GV1001 enhanced the phosphorylation of AR and transcription activity of androgen response element reporter gene through cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, GV1001 increased Ser-127 phosphorylation of YAP1 and its ubiquitination, and subsequently decreased the levels of AR-YAP1 binding in the promoter region of the CTGF gene. In contrast, both protein and mRNA levels of NKX3.1 known for tumor suppressor gene and AR-coregulator were upregulated by GV1001 in LNCaP cells. YAP1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly suppressed the migration ability of LNCaP cells, and GV1001 did not affect the cell migration of YAP1-deficient LNCaP cells. On the contrary, cell migration was more potentiated in LNCaP cells overexpressing YAP5SA, a constitutively active form of YAP1, which was not changed by GV1001 treatment.
   Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals an essential role of AR-YAP1 in the regulation of PCa cell migration, and provides evidence that GV1001 could be a novel GnRHR ligand to inhibit metastasis of PCa via the G alpha s/cAMP pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary Tail docking is a procedure practiced on millions of lambs all over the world. The objective is to prevent fecal soiling on the lower part of the tail, reduce soiling of the breech, and thereby lessen the risk of blowfly strike. Docking can be done with a knife or a clamp, but applying a latex ring round the tail, cutting off the blood supply so that the tail drops off a few weeks later, is the most popular method. All methods cause acute pain which diminishes substantially after the first hour. The present trial determined whether local anesthetic delivered by a prototype Numnuts(R) device, a novel, dual-function applicator, would reduce this pain in two to four-week-old lambs. Comparison of lambs that were sham handled, lambs that underwent ring tail docking and a third group of lambs that underwent ring tail docking and that were injected with lignocaine using the dual function device was conducted. All lambs were returned to their pen with their mothers and videoed for three hours for behavioral signs of pain. Every five minutes for the first hour and then every ten minutes, each lamb's posture, movement and feeding behavior was classified and quantified, and the data subjected to statistical analysis. It was concluded that applying lignocaine using the novel device greatly reduced the degree of pain observed. Docking the tail of lambs is a standard husbandry procedure and is achieved through several techniques including clamps, hot or cold knives and latex rings, the last of which is the most popular. All tail docking methods cause acute pain which can be reduced by application of local anesthetic, however precise anatomical injection for optimal efficacy requires considerable skill. This pen trial evaluated the ability of local anesthetic (LA) delivered with a dual function ring applicator/injector to alleviate acute tail docking pain. Thirty ewe lambs were assigned to one of three treatment groups (n = 10 per group): ring plus local anesthetic (Ring LA), ring only (Ring) and sham handled control (Sham). Lambs were videoed and their behavior categorized every five minutes for the first hour and every 10 min for the subsequent two hours after treatment. There was a significant effect (p < 0.001) of treatment on total active pain related behaviors in the first hour, with Ring lambs showing higher counts compared to Ring LA or Sham. Ring lambs also displayed a significantly higher count of combined abnormal postures (p < 0.001) than Ring LA or Sham lambs. Delivery of 1.5 mL of 2% lignocaine via the dual action device abolished abnormal behaviors and signs of pain in Ring LA lambs. However, lambs in the Ring LA group spent less time attempting to suckle compared to Ring and Sham lambs, suggesting that some residual discomfort remained.

AB  - Background: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. Modulating microglial metabolic reprogramming presents a promising therapeutic avenue for AD. Previous studies have shown that Zexie Tang (ZXT) possesses neuroprotective properties and can ameliorate cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of ZXT in improving cognitive function in AD mice using a multi-omics approach and to explore its potential role in modulating microglial metabolic reprogramming. Methods: Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate the effects of ZXT on cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. H&E, Nissl, and Thioflavin S staining were performed to assess the impact of ZXT on brain pathology. A multi-omics approach, including transcriptomics, gut microbiota analysis, and metabolomics, was employed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ZXT. RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence were used to validate the effects of ZXT on glycolipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and the AMPK-mTOR-HIF1 alpha pathway. Results: ZXT effectively protected against cognitive deficits, reduced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and decreased A(3 plaque deposition. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that ZXT was involved in immune system processes and metabolic processes and had a specific cellular response with microglia. Additionally, ZXT regulated the composition and functions of brain metabolites and gut microbiota. Our study demonstrated that ZXT positively influenced glucolipid metabolism and attenuated neuroinflammation, which were linked to the AMPKmTOR-HIF1 alpha pathway in the brain. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that ZXT may mitigate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by modulating gut microbiota and enhancing brain energy metabolism. ZXT regulated glucolipid metabolism and neuroinflammation by modulating microglial metabolic reprogramming involving the AMPK-mTOR-HIF1 alpha pathway.

AB  - A 10-week growth trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) containing olive by-products and green tea extracts supplemented to a reduced fishmeal/high soybean meal diet on the growth performance, hepatic antioxidant capacity, lipid metabolism, and liver health of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Three experimental diets were tested: (1) a control high fishmeal (40%) and low soybean meal (15.57%) diet (named HFM), (2) a reduced fishmeal (30%) and high soybean meal (30.97%) diet (named HSB), and (3) a HSB diet supplemented with the PFA at 500 mg/kg (named HSB+P). Each diet was assigned to four replicate tanks, each containing 30 largemouth bass (initial body weight, IBW = 48.33 +/- 0.01 g). The results showed that increasing the soybean meal content in the diet did not negatively affect growth performance, whereas supplementation with PFA significantly increased weight gain and specific growth rate of largemouth bass compared to both HFM and HSB groups. Reducing fishmeal and increasing soybean meal in the diet caused oxidative stress with a higher content of ROS in the liver. However, the hepatic antioxidant capacity was enhanced, with reduced ROS and increased GSH-Px levels in the HSB+P group. Moreover, the decrease of plasma TG, LDL-C, and LDL-C/TC, and downregulation of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis gene expression in liver, indicated that supplementation with the PFA improved fish lipid metabolism. Protein retention efficiency was also significantly increased in largemouth bass fed the diet with PFA supplementation, which regulated (enhanced) AKT-mTOR phosphorylation. These results clearly indicated that a PFA containing olive by-product and green tea extracts can positively improve growth performance, protein retention efficiency, antioxidant capacity, and lipid metabolism of largemouth bass fed a reduced fishmeal/high soybean meal diet.

AB  - Alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ), composed of isoquercitrin and glycosylated quercetin, has multiple biological effects. Here, we further examined the influence of AGIQ on brain function and provided its potential mechanism. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with 0, 0.005, and 0.05% AGIQ in drinking water for 4 weeks prior to behavioral testing. Behavior tests showed that 0.05% AGIQ treatment significantly improved learning and memory function without affecting emotion. In the hippocampus, the gene expression of antioxidative defense enzymes was upregulated after 0.05% AGIQ treatment. In contrast, AGIQ caused significant alterations in the microbial abundance of genera Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Alistipes associated with memory function. Metabolomics analysis identified that taurine concentration was significantly increased in serum and hippocampus from AGIQ-treated mice. The correlation analysis suggested that elevated serum taurine levels were closely related to the abundance of Akkermansia, indicating the underlying crosstalk of gut microbiota and serum metabolites. In vitro fecal culture further demonstrated that AGIQ could increase the level of Akkermansia. Taurine could exert antioxidant activity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro. Finally, vancomycin-induced alterations of gut microbiota attenuated the taurine increases in the serum and the antioxidant gene level in the hippocampus by AGIQ. Taken together, it is likely that AGIQ could increase genus Akkermansia abundance and ultimately increase taurine levels in serum and hippocampus to improve learning and memory function, relying on the gut microbiota-blood-brain axis. Our results supply a new view for understanding effects of AGIQ on brain function.

AB  - Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important hormone that functions in plant defense. cam1 and wrky53 mutants were more resistant to Spodoptera littoralis than in the wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis group. In addition, JA concentration in cam1 and wrky53 mutants was higher compared with the WT group. To explore how these two proteins affect the resistance of Arabidopsis plants, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay, firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay and in vitro pull-down assay confirming that calmodulin 1 (CAM1) interacted with WRKY53. However, these two proteins separate when calcium concentration increases in Arabidopsis leaf cells. Then, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase activation assay were used to verify that WRKY53 could bind to lipoxygenases 3 (LOX3) and lipoxygenases 4 (LOX4) gene promoters and negatively regulate gene expression. This study reveals that CAM1 and WRKY53 negatively regulate plant resistance to herbivory by regulating the JA biosynthesis pathway via the dissociation of CAM1-WRKY53, then the released WRKY53 binds to the LOXs promoters to negatively regulate LOXs gene expression. This study reveals WRKY53 ' s mechanism in insect resistance, a new light on the function of WRKY53.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric disorder in women after childbirth. Per data from epidemiologic studies, PPD affects about 5%-26.32% of postpartum mothers worldwide. Biological factors underlying this condition are multiple and complex and have received extensive inquiries for the roles they play in PPD. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), which is widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy for neurological disorders, possesses multi-component, multi-target, multi-access, and low side effect therapeutic characteristics. CHM has already shown efficacy in the treatment of PPD, and a lot more research exploring the mechanisms of its potential therapeutic effects is being conducted. Aim of the review: This review provides an in-depth and comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of PPD, as well as samples the progress made in researching the potential role of CHM in treating the disorder. Materials and methods: Literature was searched comprehensively in scholarly electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CNKI and WanFang DATA, using the search terms "postpartum depression", "genetic", "hormone", "immune", "neuroinflammation", "inflammation", "neurotransmitter", "neurogenesis", "brain-gut axis", "traditional Chinese medicine", "Chinese herbal medicine", "herb", and an assorted combination of these terms. Results: PPD is closely associated with genetics, as well as with the hormones, immune inflammatory, and neurotransmitter systems, neurogenesis, and gut microbes, and these biological factors often interact and work together to cause PPD. For example, inflammatory factors could suppress the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin by inducing the regulation of tryptophan-kynurenine in the direction of neurotoxicity. Many CHM constituents improve anxiety- and depression-like behaviors by interfering with the above-mentioned mechanisms and have shown decent efficacy clinically against PPD. For example, Shen-Qi-Jie-Yu-Fang invigorates the neuroendocrine system by boosting the hormone levels of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axes, regulating the imbalance of Treg/T-helper cells (Th) 17 and Th1/Th2, and modulating neurotransmitter system to play antidepressant roles. The Shenguiren Mixture interferes with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway to enhance the number, morphology and apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus of PPD rats. Other herbal extracts and active ingredients of CHM, such as Paeoniflorin, hypericin, timosaponin B-III and more, also manage depression by remedying the neuroendocrine system and reducing neuroinflammation. Conclusions: The pathogenesis of PPD is complex and diverse, with the main pathogenesis not clear. Still, CHM constituents, like Shen-Qi-Jie-Yu-Fang, the Shenguiren Mixture, Paeoniflorin, hypericin and other Chinese Medicinal Formulae, active monomers and Crude extracts, treats PPD through multifaceted interventions. Therefore, developing more CHM components for the treatment of PPD is an essential step forward.

AB  - Dementia, a prevalent condition in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and their families, underscores the importance of healthy cognitive ageing, which involves maintaining cognitive function and mental wellness as individuals grow older, promoting overall well-being and quality of life. Our original research study investigates the correlation between lifestyle factors and brain atrophy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as healthy older adults. Conducted over six months in West Texas, the research involved 20 participants aged 62-87. Findings reveal that sleep deprivation in MCI subjects and AD patients correlate with posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal atrophy and total brain volume, while both groups exhibit age-related hippocampal volume reduction. Notably, fruit/vegetable intake negatively correlates with certain brain regions' volume, emphasizing the importance of diet. Lack of exercise is associated with reduced brain volume and hippocampal atrophy, underlining the cognitive benefits of physical activity. The study underscores lifestyle's significant impact on cognitive health, advocating interventions to promote brain health and disease prevention, particularly in MCI/AD cases. While blood profile data showed no significant results regarding cognitive decline, the study underscores the importance of lifestyle modifications in preserving cognitive function.

AB  - Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles are important in regulating nanoparticle toxicity; however, the contribution of nanoparticle charge remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the pulmonary effects of inhalation of charged soot nanoparticles. We established a stably charged nanoparticle generation system for whole-body exposure in BALB/c mice, which produced positively charged, negatively charged, and neutral soot nanoparticles in a wide range of concentrations. After a 7-day exposure, pulmonary toxicity was assessed, together with proteomics analysis. The charged soot nanoparticles on average carried 1.17-1.35 electric charges, and the sizes for nanoparticles under different charging conditions were all fixed at 69 similar to 72 nm. We observed that charged soot nanoparticles induced cytotoxic LDH and increased lung permeability, with the release of 8-isoprostane and caspase-3 and systemic IL-6 in mice, especially for positively charged soot nanoparticles. Next, we observed that positive-charged soot nanoparticles upregulated Eif2, Eif4, sirtuin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), and HIPPO-related signaling pathways in the lungs compared with negatively charged soot nanoparticles. HIF1 alpha, sirt1, E-cadherin, and Yap were increased in mice's lungs by positively charged soot nanoparticle exposure. In conclusion, carbonaceous nanoparticles carrying electric ions, especially positive-charged, are particularly toxic when inhaled and should be of concern in terms of pulmonary health protection.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus, causing fatal acute diarrhea in suckling pigs, with mortality rates as high as 100 % in 7-day-old piglets. Due to the challenge of quickly establishing effective active immunity, the main strategy for protecting piglets from PEDV infection relies on antibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies, to provide passive immune protection. In this study, a recombinant Lactobacillus strain for secreting the Fab fragment of neutralizing antibody against PEDV was constructed (pPG-Fab/J31). The results showed that the Fab antibody was stably expressed by pPG-Fab/J31, and exhibit specific neutralizing effect against PEDV. Then, pPG-Fab/J31 was used for the oral administration of newborn piglets to test the protective effect against PEDV challenge. The findings demonstrated that piglets in the antibody administration group exhibited an alleviation of clinical symptoms, a smaller decrease in weight, significant reduction in viral shedding, and attenuation of intestinal lesions. Additionally, the survival rate of piglets orally administered pPG-Fab/J31 was 100 %. Thus, PEDV neutralizing antibody expressed by recombinant Lactobacillus hold promise as a passive protective candidate, providing a new idea for the prevention and treatment of viral infections.

AB  - This is a review of studies on the neurological effects of static/extremely-low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields (EMF). The review is mainly on research carried out in the last two decades. There are studies that showed effects on various neurotransmitters, including NMDA, serotonin, dopamine, endogenous opioids, etc. Each of these transmitters plays different critical roles on behavior and brain functions. Studies on behavioral effects of static/ELF EMF bear out these connections. Static/ELF EMF-induced behavorial and pathological effects, such as locomotor activity, memory and learning deficits, and neurological diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, Huntinton's diseases and atropical lateral scleroses, etc.) are discussed. Static/ELF EMF exposure has also been shown to have beneficial effects on functional deficits and progression of some neurological diseases. These fields provide a non-invasive treatment or treatment-adjuvant for these detrimental neurological conditions. Results suggest that free radicals, both reactive oxygen species and reactive nitric species could be involved. Depending on the conditions of exposure, either harmful or beneficial effects could result. It is important to carry out further investigation to identify these conditions. However, Caution should be taken to extrapolate the experimental data to human exposure, since higher field intensites than environmental levels were used in most laboratory research.

AB  - Astrocytes are thought to play a crucial role in brain iron homeostasis. How they accomplish this regulation in vivo is unclear. In a recent transcriptomic analysis, we showed that polysomal Ftl1 and Fth1 mRNAs, encoding the ferritin light (Ftl) and heavy (Fth) chains that assemble into ferritin, a critical complex for iron storage and reduction, are enriched in perisynaptic astrocytic processes as compared to astrocytic soma. These data suggested that ferritin translation plays a specific role at the perisynaptic astrocytic interface and is tighly regulated by local translation. Here, we used our recently described AstroDot 3D in situ methodology to study the density and localization of ferritin mRNAs in astrocytes in the hippocampus in three different contexts in which local or systemic iron overload has been documented: aging, the hepcidin knock-out mouse model of hemochromatosis and the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our results showed that in wild type mice, Fth1 mRNA density was higher than Ftl1 and that both mRNAs were mostly distributed in astrocyte fine processes. Aging and absence of hepcidin caused an increased Fth1/Ftl1 ratio in astrocytes and in the case of aging, led to a redistribution of Fth1 mRNAs in astrocytic fine processes. In contrast, in AD mice, we observed a lower Fth1/Ftl1 ratio. Fth1 mRNAs became more somatic and Ftl1 mRNAs redistributed in large processes of astrocytes proximal to Amyloid beta (Ass) deposits. Hence, we propose that regulation of ferritin mRNA density and distribution in astrocytes contribute to iron homeostasis in physiology and pathophysiology.

AB  - Background: Sleep Deprivation (SD) seriously impacts the brain's learning and memory functioning, and the treatment methods and their efficacy are limited. PYNS ointment (Peiyuan Ningshen-ointment) is an herbal ointment consisting of eleven Chinese herbs, which have been proven to have positive therapeutic effects on learning and memory impairment. However, its mechanism of action is still unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to explore the efficacy and the underlying mechanism of PYNS ointment in learning and memory impairment caused by SD. Methods: PYNS ointment chemical composition was analyzed using UHPLC-Q Exactive HRMS. The SD model was established by intraperitoneal injection of DL-4-chlorophenylalanine. The effects of PYNS ointment were verified by behavioral experiments and histological observation. Furthermore, the potential underlying mechanisms of action of PYNS ointment were explored using immunological techniques, RNA-Seq, and molecular biology experiments. Result: PYNS ointment protected against SD-induced learning and memory impairment by reducing hippocampal neuronal damage, regulating synaptic plasticity, and inhibiting the inflammatory response. Mechanismly, PYNS ointment alleviated astrocyte reactive hyperplasia and morphological damage. Furthermore, PYNS ointment promoted the expression and polarization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) through activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. While enhancing AR clearance, it also acted on the downstream of CREB/BDNF to regulate PSD95 and increase synaptic plasticity. Conclusion: PYNS ointment significantly improved hippocampal damage and enhanced learning and memory function in SD rats by inhibiting inflammation, reducing astrocyte reactivity, and enhancing synaptic plasticity through upregulation of the cAMP/PKA/AQP4/BDNF pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying learning and memory decline caused by sleep deprivation.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) extend the global health burden. Consumption of alcohol as well as maternal exposure to ethanol can damage several neuronal functions and cause cognition and behavioral abnormalities. Ethanol induces oxidative stress that is linked to the development of NDs. Treatment options for NDs are yet scarce, and natural product-based treatments could facilitate ND management since plants possess plenty of bioactive metabolites, including flavonoids, which typically demonstrate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Hypericum oblongifolium is an important traditional medicinal plant used for hepatitis, gastric ulcer, external wounds, and other gastrointestinal disorders. However, it also possesses multiple bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties, but the evaluation of isolated pure compounds for neuroprotective efficacy has not been done yet. Therefore, in the current study, we aim to isolate and characterize the bioactive flavonoid folecitin and evaluate its neuroprotective activity against ethanol-induced oxidative-stress-mediated neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of postnatal day 7 (PND-7) rat pups. A single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally administered after the birth of rat pups on PND-7. This caused oxidative stress accompanied by the activation of phosphorylated-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cysteine-aspartic acid protease-1 (caspase-1) proteins to form a complex called the NLRP3-inflammasome, which converts pro-interleukin 1 beta (IL-1B) to activate IL-1B and induce widespread neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In contrast, co-administration of folecitin (30 mg/kg body weight) reduced ethanol-induced oxidative stress, inhibited p-JNK, and deactivated the NLRP3-inflammasome complex. Furthermore, folecitin administration reduced neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative protein markers, including decreased caspase-3, BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in the immature rat brain. These findings conclude that folecitin is a flavone compound, and it might be a novel, natural and safe agent to curb oxidative stress and its downstream harmful effects, including inflammasome activation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Further evaluation in a dose-dependent manner would be worth it in order to find a suitable dose regimen for NDs.

AB  - Anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) resistance has been defined as "a major loss of efficacy due to the presence of a strain of rodent with a heritable and commensurately reduced sensitivity to the anticoagulant". The mechanism that supports this resistance has been identified as based on mutations in the Vkorc1 gene leading to severe resistance in rats and mice. This study evaluates the validity of this definition in the fossorial water vole and explores the possibility of a non-genetic diet-based resistance in a strict herbivorous rodent species. Genetic support was explored by sequencing the Vkorc1 gene and the diet-based resistance was explored by the dosing of vitamins K in liver of voles according to seasons. From a sample of 300 voles, only 2 coding mutations, G71R and S149I, were detected in the Vkorc1 gene in the heterozygous state with low allele frequencies (0.5-1%). These mutations did not modify the sensitivity to AR, suggesting an absence of genetic Vkorc1-based resistance in the water vole. On the contrary, vitamin K1 was shown to be 5 times more abundant in the liver of the water vole compared to rats. This liver concentration was shown to seasonally vary, with a trough in late winter and a peak in late spring/early summer related to the growth profile of grass. This increase in concentration might be responsible for the increased resistance of water voles to AR. This study highlights a non-genetic, diet-related resistance mechanism in rodents to AR. This diet-based resistance might explain the different evolution of the Vkorc1 gene in the fossorial water vole compared to rats and mice.

AB  - Corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) is a congenital disorder that incorporates either partial or complete absence of the largest cerebral commissure. Remodelling of the interhemispheric fissure (IHF) provides a substrate for callosal axons to cross between hemispheres, and its failure is the main cause of complete CCD. However, it is unclear whether defects in this process could give rise to the heterogeneity of expressivity and phenotypes seen in human cases of CCD. We identify incomplete IHF remodelling as the key structural correlate for the range of callosal abnormalities in inbred and outcrossed BTBR mouse strains, as well as in humans with partial CCD. We identify an eight base-pair deletion in Draxin and misregulated astroglial and leptomeningeal proliferation as genetic and cellular factors for variable IHF remodelling and CCD in BTBR strains. These findings support a model where genetic events determine corpus callosum structure by influencing leptomeningeal-astroglial interactions at the IHF.

AB  - As noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a leading cause of occupational diseases, there is an urgent need for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. To avoid user-compliance-based problems occurring with conventional protection devices, the pharmacological prevention is currently in the focus of hearing research. Noise exposure leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. This way antioxidant agents are a promising option for pharmacological interventions. Previous animal studies reported preventive as well as therapeutic effects of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the context of NIHL. Unfortunately, in patients the time point of the noise trauma cannot always be predicted, and additive effects may occur. Therefore, continuous prevention seems to be beneficial. The present study aimed to investigate the preventive potential of continuous administration of low concentrations of IGF-1 to the inner ear in an animal model of NIHL. Guinea pigs were unilaterally implanted with an osmotic minipump. One week after surgery they received noise trauma, inducing a temporary threshold shift. Continuous IGF-1 delivery lasted for seven more days. It did not lead to significantly improved hearing thresholds compared to control animals. Quite the contrary, there is a hint for a higher noise susceptibility. Nevertheless, changes in the perilymph proteome indicate a reduced damage and better repair mechanisms through the IGF-1 treatment. Thus, future studies should investigate delivery methods enabling continuous prevention but reducing the risk of an overdosage.

AB  - Human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been reported to produce a comparable superovulatory response to that of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Furthermore, hMG has a long half-life as compared with FSH. The present study was designed to compare hMG administered once daily and FSH administered twice daily over a 4 - day period on superovulatory response of Suffolk ewes. During the mid-luteal phase, twenty-four Suffolk donor ewes received intravaginal sponges at day 0 for 12 days. The superovulatory regimens in the Control group (n = 12) and the Treatment group (n = 12) consisted of eight injections of FSH given at twice daily and four injections of hMG given at once daily, respectively. At day 13, the donor ewes were subjected to laparoscopic insemination. Embryos were recovered, classified, and transferred to recipient ewes at day 19. Pregnancy status was determined by ultrasound examination 40 days after transfer. Lambing rate was calculated after all the ewes had delivered. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the structures recovered, transferable embryos, degenerated embryos, unfertilized oocytes, pregnancy rate and lambing rate. The results showed that once daily injection of hMG can produce a comparable superovulatory response and embryo transfer outcomes to those obtained by twice daily injection of FSH over a 4 - day period. It is feasible that hMG is used to replace FSH and reduce the number of injection treatments in ovine superovulatory regimens.

AB  - In vitro maturation (IVM) system is an alternative method to superovulation protocols to obtain mature oocytes. Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) have been widely used in IVM medium in different species. Although the guinea pig is a valuable animal model for reproductive studies, IVM is rarely used. We aimed to establish a suitable in vitro production system using EGF and/or IGF-I during IVM to improve oocyte competence. Firstly, immunolocalization of EGF and IGF-I receptors in the ovary was assessed. An IVM dose-response experiment was performed with cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) supplemented with: 1) EGF [0, 10, 50, 100 ng/mL or 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)]; 2) IGF-I [0, 50, 100, 200 ng/mL or 10% FCS]; or 3) the concentrations of EGF and IGF-I which showed the best IVM index in the previous experiments, with or without Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Cortical granule and mitochondria distribution patterns were determined in in vivo and in vitro-matured oocytes for the first time in this species. Apoptotic rate after IVM and oocyte competence by in vitro embryo development were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry results showed positive immunostaining of EGF and IGF receptors in corpus luteum, oocytes, granulosa and theca cells in follicles in all stages of development. Supplementation of IVM medium with 50 ng/mL EGF or 100 ng/mL IGF-I or their combination with FCS successfully led to oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation and reduced the apoptotic rate. Both growth factors improved oocyte competence during IVM in this species since early embryos were in vitro developed, showing better results when FCS was used in the IVM medium.

AB  - BackgroundPostpartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent mental disorder that negatively impacts mothers and infants. The mechanisms of vulnerability to affective illness in the postpartum period remain largely unknown. Drastic fluctuations in reproductive hormones during the perinatal period generally account for triggering PPD. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the PPD-like behaviors induced by the fluctuations in hormones has rarely been reported.MethodsWe utilized hormones-simulated pseudopregnancy (HSP) and hormones-simulated postpartum period (HSPP) rat models to determine how drastic fluctuations in hormone levels affect adult neurotransmission and contribute to depressive-like behaviors. The electrophysiological response of CA1 pyramidal neurons was evaluated by whole-cell patch clamping to identify the hormone-induced modulations of neurotransmission. The statistical significance of differences was assessed with One-way ANOVA and t-test (p < 0.05 was considered significant).ResultsReproductive hormones withdrawal induced depressive-like behaviors and disturbed the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Molecular analyses revealed that the blunted Wnt signaling might be responsible for the deficits of synaptic transmission and behaviors. Activation of Wnt signaling increased excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Reactivation of Wnt signaling alleviated the anhedonic behaviors and abnormal synaptic transmission.ConclusionsRestoring Wnt signaling in the hormones-simulated postpartum period rat models remediated depression-related anhedonia symptoms and rebalanced the excitation/inhibition ratio by collectively enhancing the plasticity of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. The investigations carried out in this research might provide an alternative and prospective treatment strategy for PPD.

AB  - Cadmium is an environmental pollutant that has extensive deleterious effects. However, the mechanisms un-derlying the hepatotoxicity induced by long-term exposure to cadmium remained undefined. In the present study, we explored the role of m6A methylation in the development of cadmium-induced liver disease. We showed a dynamic change of RNA methylation in liver tissue from mice administrated with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) for 3, 6 and 9 months, respectively. Particularly, the METTL3 expression was declined in a time-dependent manner, associated with the degree of liver injury, indicating the involvement of METTL3 in hepa-totoxicity induced by CdCl2. Moreover, we established a mouse model with liver-specific over-expression of Mettl3 and administrated these mice with CdCl2 for 6 months. Notably, METTL3 highly expressed in hepatocytes attenuated CdCl2-induced steatosis and liver fibrosis in mice. In vitro assay also showed METTL3 overexpression ameliorated the CdCl2-induced cytotoxicity and activation of primary hepatic stellate cells. Furthermore, tran-scriptome analysis identified 268 differentially expressed genes both in mice liver tissue treated with CdCl2 for 3 months and 9 months. Among them, 115 genes were predicted to be regulated by METTL3 determined by m6A2Target database. Further analysis revealed the perturbation of metabolic pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism, ErbB signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, and choline metabolism in cancer, and circadian rhythm, led to hepatotoxicity induced by CdCl2. Collectively, our findings reveal new insight into the crucial role of epigenetic modifications in hepatic diseases caused by long-term exposure to cadmium.

AB  - Gonocytes in the neonatal testis have male germline stem cell properties and as such have important potential applications in fertility preservation and regenerative medicine. Such applications require further studies aimed at increasing gonocyte numbers and evaluating their pluripotency in vitro. The objective of the present study was to test the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on in vitro propagation, colony formation, and expression of pluripotency markers of neonatal porcine gonocytes. Testis cells from 1-week-old piglets were cultured in basic media (DMEM + 15% FBS), supplemented with various concentrations of bFGF, GDNF, and LIF, either individually or in combinations, in a stepwise experimental design. Gonocytes and/or their colonies were evaluated every 7 days and the gonocyte- (DBA) and pluripotency-specific markers (POU5F1, SSEA-1, E-cadherin, and NANOG) assessed on day 28. Greatest gonocyte numbers and largest colonies were found in media supplemented with 10 ng/mL bFGF and 10 ng/mL bFGF + 100 ng/mL GDNF + 1500 U/mL LIF, respectively. The resultant gonocytes and colonies expressed both germ cell- and pluripotency-specific markers. These results shed light on the growth hormone requirements of porcine gonocytes for in vitro proliferation and colony formation.

AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a new type of persistentorganicpollutant in the environment of water, has drawn significant attentionin recent years due to its widespread prevalence and high toxicity.Neurotoxicity is regarded as one of the major toxic effects of PFOS,while research studies on PFOS-induced depression and the underlyingmechanisms remain scarce. In this study, behavioral tests revealedthe depressive-like behaviors in PFOS-exposed male mice. Neuron damagesincluding pyknosis and staining deepening were identified throughhematoxylin and eosin staining. Then, we noticed the elevation ofglutamate and proline levels as well as the decline of glutamine andtryptophan levels. Proteomics analysis identified 105 differentiallyexpressed proteins that change in a dose-dependent manner and revealedthat PFOS exposure activated the glutamatergic synapse signaling pathway,which were further confirmed by Western blot, and the data were consistentwith the findings of the proteomics analysis. Additionally, the downstreamsignaling cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derivedneurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptic plasticity-related postsynapticdensity protein 95, synaptophysin, were downregulated. Our resultshighlight that PFOS exposure may inhibit the synaptic plasticity ofthe hippocampus via glutamatergic synapse and the CREB/BDNF signalingpathway to cause depressive-like behaviors in male mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes neurodegeneration, leading to cognitive impairment and memory loss. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the induction of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34 (GADD34) by quercetin can affect eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation-activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling. However, the relationship between GADD34 expression and cognitive function has not been clarified. In this study, we determined the direct effect of GADD34 on memory. To achieve this, truncated GADD34 (GADD34.5) was injected into the mouse brain to suppress eIF2a phosphorylation and evaluate memory. The injection of GADD34.5 into the hippocampus in AD-model mice did not improve novel object recognition but improved novel object location. The injection of GADD34.5 into the amygdala also resulted in the maintenance of contextual fear memory based on the fear condition test. These results suggest that GADD34 is effective in improving memory for spatial cognition and contextual fear conditioning in AD by inhibiting eIF2a phosphorylation. In summary, GADD34 suppresses eIF2a phosphorylation in the brain and prevents memory loss. As quercetin feeding increases GADD34 expression, it might be used in preventative applications for AD.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is the only member of the ASIC family where Ca2+ osmosis has been reported, and it is highly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system. This study aimed to investigate whether ASIC1a is trafficked to the plasma membrane and regulated by the Rho/ROCK and PI3K signaling pathways in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In addition, further research is required to determine whether selective ASIC1a blockade is a viable therapeutic strategy for TLE.Methods The localization and expression levels of ASIC1 and mRNA levels of ASIC1a were detected when the Rho/ROCK and PI3K signaling pathways were activated and inhibited in glutamate (Glu)-induced cell. Meanwhile, we analyzed the location and expression of ASIC1 using Western blotting and immunofluorescence in brain tissue samples from TLE patients, kainic acid (KA)-treated rats, and Glu-induced primary hippocampal neurons. Currently, no specific ASIC1a antibody is available, so the ASIC1 antibody was used in this study, as in previous studies. Furthermore, we evaluated the HT22 cell survival rate, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and autophagy to examine whether selective blocking ASIC1a (PcTx1) could play a neuroprotective role.Results First, the Rho/ROCK and PI3K signaling pathways affect the regulation of the expression and localization of ASIC1, especially the mRNA levels of ASIC1a in the Glu-induced HT22 cell injury model. Second, the high expression of ASIC1 in epilepsy patients was verified in all three sample types, and the phenomenon of its transport from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane/mitochondria was confirmed. Finally, although ASIC1 has a limited epileptogenic effect in the acute phase of epilepsy in vivo, selective blockade of ASIC1a using PcTx1 provided significant hippocampal neuroprotection and reduced mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and cellular autophagy in vitro.Interpretation This study is a systematic report concerning ASIC1a in temporal lobe epilepsy, including in vivo and in vitro experiments addressing both the acute and chronic phases. It provides foundational research for proposing ASIC1a as a new target for epilepsy treatment.

AB  - Adolescent binge drinking leads to long-lasting disorders of the adult central nervous system, particularly aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis. In this study, we applied in vivo fluorescent tracing using NestinCreERT2::Rosa26-tdTomato mice and analyzed the endogenous neurogenesis lineage progression of neural stem cells (NSCs) and dendritic spine formation of newborn neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. We found abnormal orientation of tamoxifen-induced tdTomato+ (tdTom+) NSCs in adult mice 2 months after treatment with EtOH (5.0 g/kg, i.p.) for 7 consecutive days. EtOH markedly inhibited tdTom+ NSCs activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in mouse dentate gyrus from adolescence to adulthood. EtOH (100 mM) also significantly inhibited the proliferation to 39.2% and differentiation of primary NSCs in vitro. Adult mice exposed to EtOH also exhibited marked inhibitions in dendritic spine growth and newborn neuron maturation in the dentate gyrus, which was partially reversed by voluntary running or inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin-enhancer of zeste homolog 2 pathway. In vivo tracing revealed that EtOH induced abnormal orientation of tdTom+ NSCs and spatial misposition defects of newborn neurons, thus causing the disturbance of hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic spine remodeling in mice.

AB  - Oligodendrocyte dysfunction, myelin degeneration, and white matter changes are critical events in the cognitive decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta), a hallmark of AD, disrupts oligodendrocyte and myelin homeostasis, through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptomic profiling of A beta-exposed oligodendrocytes revealed widespread gene expression changes, particularly in RNA-related processes. Among these, hnRNP A2, a key regulator of RNA transport and myelin protein regulation, was aberrantly upregulated in hippocampal oligodendrocytess from AD patients with high A beta levels, from AD mouse models, and in A beta-treated oligodendrocytes. RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing of the hnRNP A2 interactome revealed A beta-induced changes in mRNA interactions, particularly enriched binding to Mbp and Mobp, indicating impaired RNA metabolism of myelin components. Furthermore, A beta, through hnRNP A2 disruption, increased the number, cargo and dynamics of Mbp- and Mobp-containing granules, enhanced MBP and MOBP synthesis, and decreased oligodendroglial voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in an MBP-dependent manner. These findings suggest that A beta-induced dysregulation of hnRNP A2 impairs RNA metabolism and myelin protein synthesis, altering the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis critical for oligodendrocyte function.

AB  - Studies have found that PM2.5 can damage the brain, accelerate cognitive impairment, and increase the risk of developing a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the potential molecular mechanisms by which PM2.5 causes learning and memory problems are yet to be explored. In this study, we evaluated the neurotoxic effects in mice after 12 weeks of PM2.5 exposure, and found that this exposure resulted in learning and memory disorders, pathological brain damage, and M1 phenotype polarization on microglia, especially in the hippocampus. The severity of this damage increased with increasing PM2.5 concentration. Proteomic analysis, as well as validation results, suggested that PM2.5 exposure led to abnormal glucose metabolism in the mouse brain, which is mainly characterized by significant expression of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. We therefore administered the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to the mice exposed to PM2.5, and showed that inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG significantly alleviated PM2.5-induced hippocampal microglia M1 phenotype polarization, and reduced the release of inflammatory factors, improved synaptic structure and related protein expression, which alleviated the cognitive impairment induced by PM2.5 exposure. In summary, our study found that abnormal glucose metabolism-mediated inflammatory polarization of microglia played a role in learning and memory disorders in mice exposed to PM2.5.

AB  - Our previous work has shown that d-ribose (RIB)-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice. However, the relationship between variations in RIB levels and depression as well as potential RIB participation in depressive disorder is yet unknown. Here, a reanalysis of metabonomics data from depressed patients and depression model rats is performed to clarify whether the increased RIB level is positively correlated with the severity of depression. Moreover, we characterize intestinal epithelial barrier damage, gut microbial composition and function, and microbiota-gut-brain metabolic signatures in RIB-fed mice using colonic histomorphology, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics analysis. The results show that RIB caused intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and microbiota-gut-brain axis dysbiosis. These microbial and metabolic modules are consistently enriched in peripheral (fecal, colon wall, and serum) and central (hippocampus) glycerophospholipid metabolism. In addition, three differential genera (Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, Turicibacter, and Akkermansia) and two types of glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) have greater contributions to the overall correlations between differential genera and glycerophospholipids. These findings suggest that the disturbances of gut microbiota by RIB may contribute to the onset of depressive-like behaviors via regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism, and providing new insight for understanding the function of microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression.

AB  - Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have limited capacity for axonal regeneration after trauma and neurological disorders due to an endogenous nonpermissive environment for axon regrowth in the CNS. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) contributes to axonal tract formation in the developing brain and axonal regeneration in the adult brain as an endogenous Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1) antagonist. However, how LOTUS expression is regulated remains unclarified. This study examined molecular mechanism of regulation in LOTUS expression and found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased LOTUS expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. Exogenous application of BDNF increased LOTUS expression at both mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that pharmacological inhibition with K252a and gene knockdown by siRNA of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), BDNF receptor suppressed BDNF-induced increase in LOTUS expression. Further pharmacological analysis of the TrkB signaling pathway revealed that BDNF increased LOTUS expression through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascades, but not phospholipase C-gamma (PLC gamma) cascade. Additionally, treatment with c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) inhibitor partially suppressed BDNF-induced LOTUS expression. Finally, neurite outgrowth assay in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that BDNF treatment-induced antagonism for NgR1 by up-regulating LOTUS expression. These findings suggest that BDNF may acts as a positive regulator of LOTUS expression through the TrkB signaling, thereby inducing an antagonistic action for NgR1 function by up-regulating LOTUS expression. Also, BDNF may synergistically affect axon regrowth through the upregulation of LOTUS expression.

AB  - The role of mosquito vectors in spreading disastrous diseases to living organisms, especially to humans is inevitable and undeniable. The impacts of the available chemical and synthetic insecticides on non-specific organisms as well as on nature are being the reason behind the search for target-specific, biocompatible and eco-friendly alternatives. The Madhuca longifolia seed extract and cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis-based nanocomposites (Cp-Ml-ZnO NCs) were produced to conquer the above-mentioned issues. The Cp-Ml-ZnO NCs (100 mu g/mL) expressed better scavenging potentiality on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radicals than Ml seed extract and Ml-ZnO NPs. The susceptibility of tested vector larvae to the Cp-Ml-ZnO NCs was Ae. aegypti >An. stephensi > Cx. quinquefasciatus along with LC50-27.73, 34.81, and 42.54 mu g/mL concentration. The target specificity and biocompatibility of Cp-Ml-ZnO NCs were authenticated by the results obtained by evalu-ating the efficacy on D. similis, A. salina, P. reticulata, G. affinis, and RBCs of goat blood. Thus the Cp-Ml-ZnO NCs could be adopted for the control of vector larvae.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex endocrine disorder that is also an important cause of infertility. Adverse psychological stress can aggravate the occurrence and development of PCOS. Bushen Jieyu Tiaochong Formula (BJTF), a prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used in the treatment of PCOS and shown to be effective in reducing negative emotion. However, the therapeutic mechanism has yet to be clearly elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the potential mechanism of action of BJTF.
   Aim of the study: To investigate the role of PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling in the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of BJTF in a rat model of PCOS, with chronic stress induced by letrozole and a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm.
   Materials and methods: In addition to the normal control group, the PCOS combined with CUMS model rats were randomly assigned to a model group, a Diane-35 (ethinylestradiol 35 mu g/cyproterone acetate 2 mg)-treated positive control group, or one of three BJTF-treated groups receiving a low, medium, or high dose. Behavioral testing, including the sucrose preference test and open field test, was conducted, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe changes in the pathological morphology of ovarian tissue. Free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in serum were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The hippocampal levels of norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Apoptotic granulosa cells were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CHOP in the ovarian tissues. The expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, PERK, and ATF4 in ovarian tissues were also measured by western blotting.
   Results: Treatment with either BJTF or Diane-35 ameliorated the abnormal cystic dilatation of follicles in the model rats and reduced the serum levels of FT and LH, and the LH/FSH ratio. BJTF treatment also attenuated chronic psychological stress-like behavior and regulated the expression and metabolism of cerebral monoamine neurotransmitters. The efficacy of BJTF was greater than that of Diane-35, with the optimal effects observed at the medium dose. BJTF also lowered the apoptotic index of ovarian granulosa cells and downregulated the expression of GRP78, CHOP, and ATF4. Although the expression level of PERK was not significantly altered by BJTF, the mean PERK expression level was the lowest in the medium-dose BJTF group.
   Conclusions: Administration of BJTF has the therapeutic potential to promote the homeostasis of the reproductive endocrine environment and to restore follicular development and ovulation, possibly through the inhibition of the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of GRP78 expression to further delay ovarian granule cell apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Moreover, BJTF could improve behavioral performance by regulating cerebral monoamine neurotransmitters in this rat model. These findings provide a new perspective for treating PCOS related to psychological stress using TCM.

AB  - CRH system integrates responses to stress challenges, whereas antipsychotics may impinge on this process. Effect of haloperidol (HAL) and aripiprazole (ARI) on chronic mild stress (CMS) induced neurobehavioral and CRH/ CRHR1 system changes was studied in functionally interconnected rat brain areas including prefrontal cortex (PFC), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), hippocampus (HIP), and amygdala (AMY). Animals were exposed to CMS for 3-weeks and since the 7th day of CMS injected with vehicle (VEH), HAL (1 mg/kg) or ARI (10 mg/kg) for 4-weeks. Expression levels of CRH, CRHR1, and c-fos genes and anxiety-like and anhedonia behavioural patterns were evaluated. CMS in VEH animals suppressed CRH gene expression in the PFC and BNST, c-fos expression in all areas, except HIP, and increased CRHR1 gene expression in the HIP. Antipsychotics decreased CRH gene expression in all areas, except HIP and by CMS elevated CRHR1 expression in the HIP (ARI also in AMY). CMS and antipsychotics decreased the sucrose preference. Aripiprazole prevented CRH expression decrease in the BNST and sucrose preference induced by CMS. Haloperidol increased time spent in the EPM open arms. These data indicate that HAL and ARI selectively influenced behavioural parameters and CRH/CRHR1 gene expression levels in CMS animals.

AB  - Simple Summary In this paper, we developed and assessed a method for measuring the energy expenditure of ruminants using data collected from wearable inertial sensors that monitor accelerations. The measured values were compared with reference ones for animal expended energy, as reported in the literature, to evaluate the quality of the measurement. A results comparison allowed us to verify that the obtained values were within the reported reference ranges, which is very promising as it is a specific method with a low impact on animals' daily lives. Albeit not offering precision comparable to direct measurements, the measurement produced can be integrated with other complementary sources of information, (e.g., the evolution of the animal's weight, ingestion time) and can thus provide extremely useful information for the animals' feed management process.Abstract Indirect methods of measuring the energy expenditure of grazing animals using heartbeat variation or accelerometers are very convenient due to their low cost and low intrusiveness, allowing animals to maintain their usual routine. In the case of accelerometers, it is possible to use them to measure activity, as well as to classify animal behavior, allowing their usage in other scenarios. Despite the obvious convenience of use, it is important to evaluate the measurement error and understand the validity of the measurement through a simplistic method. In this paper, data from accelerometers were used to classify behavior and measure animal activity, and an algorithm was developed to calculate the energy expended by sheep. The results of the energy expenditure calculations were subsequently compared with the values reported in the literature, and it was verified that the values obtained were within the reference ranges. Although it cannot be used as a real metering of energy expended, the method is promising, as it can be integrated with other complementary sources of information, such as the evolution of the animal's weight and ingestion time, thus providing assistance in animals' dietary management.

AB  - The pars tuberalis (PT) plays an important role in the photoperiodic regulation of the secretory activity of the pituitary gland. Additionally, PT secretory activity may be influenced by the animal's immune status. The melatonin signal processing in PT cells occurs through the presence of melatonin receptors and the expression of molecular clock genes. This study aimed to define the effects of acute inflammation induced by intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the expression of clock genes in the PT of ewes under different photoperiodic conditions. Two analogous experiments were conducted in different photoperiods: short-day and long-day. Both experiments included 24 sheep divided into two groups: day (n = 12) and night (n = 12), further subdivided into a control group (n = 6) and a group treated with LPS (n = 6) at a dose of 400 ng/kg. Under short-day conditions, the expression of clock circadian regulator, basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1, cryptochrome circadian regulator (CRY) 1, 2, and casein kinase 1 epsilon genes was lower during inflammation. LPS injection increased expression of the period circadian regulator 1 gene during the night. Under long-day conditions, CRY1 mRNA level was lower during the night, while diurnal CRY2 mRNA expression was decreased after LPS injection. Our results showed that inflammation disturbed the expression of molecular clock genes in the PT; however, this influence was partly dependent on photoperiod conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary Emotions or affective states recognition in farm animals is an underexplored research domain. Despite significant advances in animal welfare research, animal affective state computing through the development and application of devices and platforms that can not only recognize but interpret and process the emotions, are in a nascent stage. The analysis and measurement of unique behavioural, physical, and biological characteristics offered by biometric sensor technologies and the affiliated complex and large data sets, opens the pathway for novel and realistic identification of individual animals amongst a herd or a flock. By capitalizing on the immense potential of biometric sensors, artificial intelligence enabled big data methods offer substantial advancement of animal welfare standards and meet the urgent needs of caretakers to respond effectively to maintain the wellbeing of their animals. Farm animals, numbering over 70 billion worldwide, are increasingly managed in large-scale, intensive farms. With both public awareness and scientific evidence growing that farm animals experience suffering, as well as affective states such as fear, frustration and distress, there is an urgent need to develop efficient and accurate methods for monitoring their welfare. At present, there are not scientifically validated 'benchmarks' for quantifying transient emotional (affective) states in farm animals, and no established measures of good welfare, only indicators of poor welfare, such as injury, pain and fear. Conventional approaches to monitoring livestock welfare are time-consuming, interrupt farming processes and involve subjective judgments. Biometric sensor data enabled by artificial intelligence is an emerging smart solution to unobtrusively monitoring livestock, but its potential for quantifying affective states and ground-breaking solutions in their application are yet to be realized. This review provides innovative methods for collecting big data on farm animal emotions, which can be used to train artificial intelligence models to classify, quantify and predict affective states in individual pigs and cows. Extending this to the group level, social network analysis can be applied to model emotional dynamics and contagion among animals. Finally, 'digital twins' of animals capable of simulating and predicting their affective states and behaviour in real time are a near-term possibility.

AB  - Wnt signaling plays a role in synaptic plasticity, but the specific cellular events and molecular components involved in Wnt signaling-mediated synaptic plasticity are not well defined. Here, we report a change in the threshold required to induce synaptic plasticity that facilitates the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and inhibits the induction of long-term depression (LTD) during brief exposure to the noncanonical ligand Wnt-5a. Both effects are related to the metaplastic switch of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission, a complex mechanism underlying the regulation of the threshold required to induce synaptic plasticity and of synaptic efficacy. We observed an early increase in the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) that persisted over time, including after washout. The first phase involves an increase in the fEPSP amplitude that is required to trigger a spontaneous second phase that depends on Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity. These changes are prevented by treatment with secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP-2), an endogenous antagonist of Wnt ligands. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of Wnt-5a signaling to a process associated with metaplasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses that favors LTP over LTD.

AB  - The current level of knowledge on transcriptome responses triggered by Caesalpinia sappan (CS) extract in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is limited. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to detect significant genes and pathways involved in CS extract supplementation responsiveness of PBMCs after PRRSV infection. RNA sequencing was conducted on PBMCs, which were isolated from six weaned piglets. The resultant transcriptional responses were examined by mRNA sequencing. Differential expression analysis identified 263 and 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PRRSV and CTRL groups, and the PRRSV+CS and CTRL groups, respectively. Among these, ZNF646 and KAT5 emerged as the most promising candidate genes, potentially influencing the interaction between PRRSV-infected PBMCs and CS extract supplementation through the regulation of gene networks and cellular homeostasis during stress. Two pathways were detected to be associated with CS extract supplementation responsiveness: the cellular response to stress pathway and the NF-kB signaling pathway. Consequently, our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying cellular stress response and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway in PRRSV-infected PBMCs, and identifies a potential application of CS extract for activating the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In conclusion, by supplementing CS extract in PBMC cells infected with PRRSV, we found that CS extract modulates PRRSV infection by inducing cellular stress, which is regulated by the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. This induced stress creates an adverse environment for PRRSV survival. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic targets and pathogenesis of PRRSV infection. Importantly, our results demonstrate that CS extract has the potential to be a candidate for modulating PRRSV infection.

AB  - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), a common plastic additive, is employed extensively to enhance the flexibility of various polymeric materials despite its known toxicity to multiple organ systems. Our previous study found that maternal DBP exposure caused early puberty in male offspring, but the effect on male brain aging was unclear. In this study, pregnant mice were orally administered corn oil (control) or varying doses of DBP via gavage from gestational day 12. The results demonstrated that prenatal DBP exposure induced premature aging in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of male offspring during adolescence and led to a cognitive decline in adulthood. In vitro analyses further showed that monobutyl phthalate (MBP), the principal DBP metabolite, promotes senescence in both HT22 hippocampal and GT1-7 GnRH neuronal cells by activating NF-kappa B signaling. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappa B using BAY 11-7082 significantly mitigated this senescence. This study provides the first evidence linking maternal DBP exposure to accelerated brain aging and precocious puberty in offspring, establishing a foundation for investigating DBP's role in aging-related toxicity.

AB  - Impairment of neuronal plasticity is involved in a spectrum of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, it is reported that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC2 serves as a pivotal regulator of both neuronal plasticity and epileptogenesis through its repression of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A). Knockdown of DEC2 in hippocampal neurons elevates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, exacerbating seizure susceptibility and severity. Conversely, overexpression of DEC2 in hippocampus reduces intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, ultimately decreasing seizure susceptibility. Mechanistically, DEC2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Scn2a by directly binding class B E-boxes (CACGTG) in its promoter. Additionally, DEC2 forms complexes with myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) and occupies the CAGCTG E-boxes within the Scn2a promoter; however, this interaction does not affect Scn2a transcription in vivo. These findings also reveal that cannabidiol (CBD) can modulate the DEC2-SCN2A axis. Notably, CBD predominantly enhances DEC2's direct transcriptional repression of SCN2A. In summary, this study identifies DEC2 as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy progression, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for epilepsy treatment.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) is a widely applied herbicide in Asia and South America with slow natural degradation and documented deleterious effects on human and animal health, including hippocampal toxicity. However, rela-tively little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for ATR-induced hippocampal damage. Screening for differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), and construction of potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks can reveal such mechanisms, so we analyzed the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of rat hippocampus-derived H19-7 cells in response to ATR (500 mu M) and conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment (KEGG) analyses. Integration of miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) and mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) results identified 114 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs, 40 upregulated and 74 downregulated), and 510 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs, 177 upregulated and 333 downregulated) targeted by these DEMIs. The top 10 hub mRNAs (Fos, Prkcb, Ncf1, Vcam1, Atf3, Pak3, Pak1, Cacna1s, Junb, and Ccl2) and 19 related miRNAs (rno-miR-194-5p, rno-miR-24-3p, rno-miR-3074, rno-miR-1949, rno-miR-218a-1-3p, rno-miR-1843a-5p, rno-miR-1843b-5p, rno-miR-296-3p, rno-miR-320-3p, rno-miR-219a-1-3p, rno-miR-122-5p, rno-miR-1839-5p, rno-miR-1843a-3p, rno-miR-215, rno-miR-3583-3p, rno-miR-194-3p, rno-miR-128-1-5p, rno-miR-1956-5p, and rno-miR-466b-2-3p) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. GO analysis indicated that these DEMs were enriched in genes associated with synaptic plasticity and antioxidant capacity, while KEGG analysis suggested that enriched DEMs were involved in calcium signaling, axon guidance, MAPK signaling, and glial carcinogenesis. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network identified here may provide potential biomarkers and novel strategies for the treatment of hippocampal neurotoxicity induced by ATR.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most drug-resistant type with the highest incidence among the other focal epilepsies. Metabolic manipulations are of great interest among others, glycolysis inhibitors like 2-deoxy d-glucose (2-DG) being the most promising intervention. Here, we sought to investigate the effects of 2-DG treatment on cellular and circuit level electrophysiological properties using patch-clamp and local field potentials recordings and behavioral alterations such as depression and anxiety behaviors, and changes in nitric oxide signaling in the intrahippocampal kainic acid model. We found that epileptic animals were less anxious, more depressed, with more locomotion activity. Interestingly, by masking the effect of increased locomotor activity on the parameters of the zero-maze test, no altered anxiety behavior was noted in epileptic animals. However, 2-DG could partially reverse the behavioral changes induced by kainic acid. The findings also showed that 2-DG treatment partially suppresses cellular level alterations while failing to reverse circuit-level changes resulting from kainic acid injection. Analysis of NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus revealed that the number of positive neurons was significantly reduced in dorsal CA1 of the epileptic animals and 2-DG treatment did not affect the diminishing effect of kainic acid on NADPH-d(+) neurons in the CA1 area. In the control group receiving 2-DG, however, an augmented NADPH-d(+) cell number was noted. These data suggest that 2-DG cannot suppress epileptiform activity at the circuit-level in this model of epilepsy and therefore, may fail to control the seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy cases.

AB  - Contrary to traditional theories of declarative memory, it has recently been shown that novel, arbitrary associations can rapidly and directly be integrated into cortical memory networks by means of a learning procedure called fast mapping (FM), possibly bypassing time-consuming hippocampal-neocortical consolidation processes. In the typical FM paradigm, a picture of a previously unknown item is presented next to a picture of a previously known item and participants answer a question referring to an unfamiliar label, thereby incidentally creating associations between the unknown item and the label. However, contradictory findings have been reported and factors moderating rapid cortical integration through FM yet need to be identified. Previous behavioral results showed that rapid semantic integration through FM was boosted if the unknown and the known item shared many features. In light of this, we propose that the perirhinal cortex might be especially qualified to support the rapid incorporation of these associations into cortical memory networks within the FM paradigm, due to its computational mechanisms during the processing of complex and particularly highly similar objects. We therefore expected that a high degree of feature overlap between the unknown and the known item would trigger strong engagement of the perirhinal cortex at encoding, which in turn might enhance rapid cortical integration of the novel picture-label associations. Within an fMRI experiment, we observed greater subsequent memory effects (i.e., stronger activation for subsequent hits than misses) during encoding in the perirhinal cortex and an associated anterior temporal network if the items shared many features than if they shared few features. This indicates that the perirhinal cortex indeed contributes to the acquisition of novel associations by means of FM if feature overlap is high. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Color vision is widely used by herbivorous insects to make host location. We have previously demonstrated that the long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin gene Rhodopsin 6 (Rh6) confers green preference in Bactrocera minax (a specialist) but yellow in B. dorsalis (a generalist). However, the transcriptional regulation underlying Rh6 expression and its association with color preference between these two sister species remains unclear. Here, we cloned the core promoter regions of BmRh6 and BdRh6, and identified the transcription factors (TFs) BmHmx in B. minax and BdPtx1 in B. dorsalis through bioinformatics and transcriptomic analysis. The functional impact of the two TFs on Rh6 transcription was validated using the dual luciferase reporter assays and yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of the TFs resulted in significant downregulation of Rh6 expression. Furthermore, silencing of BmHmx eliminated the preference for green in B. minax, while knockdown of BdPtx1 in B. dorsalis led to the loss of yellow preference. Our results elucidate the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of Rh6 towards color preferences in tephritids, which also provide new insights into the links between host location and visual ecology in insects.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate if the supplementation of folic acid and taurine can relieve the adverse effects of different levels of heat stress (HS) on growth performance, physiological indices, antioxidative capacity, immunity, rumen fermentation and microbiota. A total of 24 Dorper x Hu crossbred lambs (27.51 +/- 0.96 kg) were divided into four groups: control group (C, 25 degrees C), moderate HS group (MHS, 35 degrees C), severe HS group (SHS, 40 degrees C), and the treatment group, under severe HS (RHS, 40 degrees C, 4 and 40 mg/kg BW/d coated folic acid and taurine, respectively). Results showed that, compared with Group C, HS significantly decreased the ADG of lambs (p < 0.05), and the ADG in the RHS group was markedly higher than in the MHS and SHS group (p < 0.05). HS had significant detrimental effects on physiological indices, antioxidative indices and immune status on the 4th day (p < 0.05). The physiological indices, such as RR and ST, increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the HS level and were significantly decreased in the RHS group, compared to the SHS group (p < 0.05). HS induced the significant increase of MDA, TNF-alpha, and IL-beta, and the decrease of T-AOC, SOD, GPx, IL-10, IL-13, IgA, IgG, and IgM (p < 0.05). However, there was a significant improvement in these indices after the supplementation of folic acid and taurine under HS. Moreover, there were a significant increase in Quinella and Succinivibrio, and an evident decrease of the genera Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Asteroleplasma under HS (p < 0.05). The LEfSe analysis showed that the genera Butyrivibrio, Eubacterium_ventriosum_group, and f_Bifidobacteriaceae were enriched in the MHS, SHS and RHS groups, respectively. Correlated analysis indicated that the genus Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group was positively associated with MDA, while it was negatively involved in IL-10, IgA, IgM, and SOD (p < 0.05); The genus Anaeroplasma was positively associated with the propionate and valerate, while the genus Succinivibrio was negatively involved in TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). In conclusion, folic acid and taurine may alleviate the adverse effects of HS on antioxidant capacity, immunomodulation, and rumen fermentation of lambs by inducing changes in the microbiome that improve animal growth performance.

AB  - Background Schema, a concept from cognitive psychology used to explain how new information is integrated with previous experience, is a framework of acquired knowledge within associative network structures as biological correlate, which allows new relevant information to be quickly assimilated by parallel cortical encoding in the hippocampus (HPC) and cortex. Previous work demonstrated that myelin generation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a critical role for dynamic paired association (PA) learning and consolidation, while astrocytes in ACC play a vital role in cognitive decision-making. However, circuit components and mechanism involving HPC-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during schema formation remain uncertain. Moreover, the correlation between HPC-ACC circuit and HPC astrocytic activity is unclear. Results Utilizing a paired association (PA) behavioral paradigm, we dynamically recorded calcium signals of CA1-ACC projection neurons and ACC neurons during schema formation. Depending on the characteristics of the calcium signals, three distinct stages of schema establishment process were identified. The recruitment of CA1-ACC network was investigated in each stage under CA1 astrocytes Gi pathway chemogenetic activation. Results showed that CA1-ACC projecting neurons excitation gradually decreased along with schema development, while ACC neurons revealed an excitation peak in the middle stage. CA1 astrocytic Gi pathway activation will disrupt memory schema development by reducing CA1-ACC projection neuron recruitment in the initial stage and prevent both CA1-ACC projection neurons and ACC neuron excitation in the middle stage. CA1 astrocytes Gi markedly suppress new PA assimilation into the established memory schema. Conclusions These results not only reveal the dynamic feature of CA1-ACC network during schema establishment, but also suggest CA1 astrocyte contribution in different stages of schema establishment.

AB  - Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic stimulation (ELF-EMS) was demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in rodent models of permanent stroke. The mechanism involved enhanced cerebrovascular perfusion and endothelial cell nitric oxide production. However, the possible effect on the neuroinflammatory response and its efficacy in reperfusion stroke models remains unclear. To evaluate ELF-EMS effectiveness and possible immunomodulatory response, we studied neurological outcome, behavior, neuronal survival, and glial reactivity in a rodent model of global transient stroke treated with 13.5 mT/60 Hz. Next, we studied microglial cells migration and, in organotypic hippocampal brain slices, we assessed neuronal survival and microglia reactivity. ELF-EMS improved the neurological score and behavior in the ischemia-reperfusion model. It also improved neuronal survival and decreased glia reactivity in the hippocampus, with microglia showing the first signs of treatment effect. In vitro ELF-EMS decreased (Lipopolysaccharide) LPS and ATP-induced microglia migration in both scratch and transwell assay. Additionally, in hippocampal brain slices, reduced microglial reactivity, improved neuronal survival, and modulation of inflammation-related markers was observed. Our study is the first to show that an EMF treatment has a direct impact on microglial migration. Furthermore, ELF-EMS has beneficial effects in an ischemia/reperfusion model, which indicates that this treatment has clinical potential as a new treatment against ischemic stroke.

AB  - Although animal studies have evaluated lead (Pb) toxicity, they are limited to soluble forms, such as Pb-acetate, which do not reflect the range found in the exposome. Recent studies on Pb speciation of residential soils in urban areas revealed that the initial Pb sources are not persistent and are extensively repartitioned into adsorbed forms of Pb rather than insoluble phosphates. We investigated the inhalation and neurological toxicity of dusts generated from a surficial soil sample collected from a residential site with an exposomic mixture of various Pb species, both adsorbed phases (Fe and Mn oxide, humate bound Pb) and mineral phases (Pb hydroxycarbonate, pyromorphite, galena). Mice inhaled East Chicago dust (ECD) generated from a composite soil sample for 4 h/ day, 7 days/week, for 4 weeks. Mice were necropsied immediately, 1, 14 and 30 days post exposure to evaluate both toxicity and recovery. Exposure to ECD caused changes in memory and spatial learning in the Morris Water Maze test. RNAseq analysis of the hippocampus region revealed multiple differentially expressed genes and impacts on pathways involved in ion channel complexes, and neuron-to-neuron synapse. Metabolomics analysis of plasma highlighted significant alterations in metabolic processes immediately after exposure that resolved after 14 days of rest.

AB  - "Welcome to the Machine" is the second song on Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here". Today, 49 years later, machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that has been gaining prominence, especially in order to solve multifactorial problems such as animal adaptation, which involves thermoregulatory, morpho-logical, hematological and immunological responses. For the first time, we seek to trace the adaptive profile, identify biomarkers of animal adaptation to thermal stress and investigate the potential effects underlying the complex relationships of animal adaptation with climatic variables, morphological, thermoregulatory, hemato-logical, immunological and productive responses in the animal model using an intelligent predictive modeling as an auxiliary method. The database contains 7608 pieces of information. All variables were measured simulta-neously on the animal. Machine learning techniques and path analyses were used. Our main results were: (i) we identified patterns that hematological variables represent important biomarkers to study animal adaptation; (ii) there are three adaptive profiles with thermoregulatory, hematological and immunological mechanisms varying according to the thickness of the coat; (iii) age, body condition score and lactation order are factors that influence adaptive responses; and (iv) environmental variables and thermal comfort indices influence thermoregulatory responses (primary mechanism), but do not influence hematological and immunological responses, while ther-moregulatory variables influence hematological and immunological responses (secondary mechanism). Most of the variables under study and other indicators such as behavioral, biochemical, metabolic and physical related to the adaptive physiology in production animals are already measured by sensors. These variables can be used in a machine intelligence approach for assertive decision-making by farmers, as technology based on sensors in production animals is an innovative approach to maximize animal welfare and provide better alternatives to evaluate the animal response.

AB  - Recent discovery of approximately 270 common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia has enabled polygenic risk scores (PRS) to be measured in the population. We hypothesized that normal variation in PRS would be associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes of brain morphometry and tissue composition. We used the largest extant genome-wide association dataset (N = 69,369 cases and N = 236,642 healthy controls) to measure PRS for schizophrenia in a large sample of adults from the UK Biobank (N-max = 29,878) who had multiple micro- and macrostructural MRI metrics measured at each of 180 cortical areas, seven subcortical structures, and 15 major white matter tracts. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate associations between PRS and brain structure at global and regional scales, controlled for multiple comparisons. Polygenic risk was significantly associated with reduced neurite density index (NDI) at global brain scale, at 149 cortical regions, five subcortical structures, and 14 white matter tracts. Other microstructural parameters, e.g., fractional anisotropy, that were correlated with NDI were also significantly associated with PRS. Genetic effects on multiple MRI phenotypes were co-located in temporal, cingulate, and prefrontal cortical areas, insula, and hippocampus. Post-hoc bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses provided preliminary evidence in support of a causal relationship between (reduced) thalamic NDI and (increased) risk of schizophrenia. Risk-related reduction in NDI is plausibly indicative of reduced density of myelinated axons and dendritic arborization in large-scale cortico-subcortical networks. Cortical, subcortical, and white matter microstructure may be linked to the genetic mechanisms of schizophrenia.

AB  - The current study has aims to investigate the soil quality and phytoextraction of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) from saline soils using Alhagi maurorum (camelthorn), Tamarix aphylla (saltcedar), Salvadora persica (mustard bush), and Suaeda nigra (bush seep weed). The saline bulk soil, rhizospheric soil, and different parts of selected plants were oxidized using the acid mixture and determined Cd, Cr, and Pb by atomic absorption spectrometry. The bio-concentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (T-F) of also examined. The quality parameters of soil like pH (< 8.5), and electrical conductivity (EC; > 4.00 dS m(-1)) indicated the soil is saline. The salinity of soil was lower the organic matters, and total nitrogen contents in studied saline bulk soil due to deterioration condition of soils. However, the rhizospheric soil showed the improved quality of saline soil reflected the good phytoextraction of salts from saline soil. The high contents of Cd in roots and shoots (1.02 and 0.65 mu g g(-1)) of Alhagi maurorum, Cr in the roots and shoots (6.20, and 6.75 mu g g(-1)) of Tamarix aphylla and Pb in the roots and shoots (5.63, and 5.75 mu g g(-1)) of Suaeda nigra. The BCF and T-F showed the Tamarix aphylla and Alhagi maurorum for Pb, Alhagi maurorum, and Salvadora persica for Cr considered as hyperaccumulator plants. Based on BCF and T-F values of Alhagi maurorum, Tamarix aphylla for Cd, and Salvadora persica for Cr and Pb have the efficiency to uptake toxic metals from saline soil. Thus, it can be concluded that selected plant species may have ability for the phytoextraction the Cd, Cr and Pb from saline soil.

AB  - The neurofunctional basis of the noradrenergic (NA) system and its associated disorders is still very incomplete because in vivo imaging tools in humans have been missing up to now. Here, for the first time, we use [C-11]yohimbine in a large sample of subjects (46 healthy volunteers, 23 females, 23 males; aged 20-50) to perform direct quantification of regional alpha 2 adrenergic receptors' (a(2)-ARs) availability in the living human brain. The global map shows the highest [C-11]yohimbine binding in the hippocampus, the occipital lobe, the cingulate gyrus, and the frontal lobe. Moderate binding was found in the parietal lobe, thalamus, parahippocampus, insula, and temporal lobe. Low levels of binding were found in the basal ganglia, the amygdala, the cerebellum, and the raphe nucleus. Parcellation of the brain into anatomical subregions revealed important variations in [C-11]yohimbine binding within most structures. Strong heterogeneity was found in the occipital lobe, the frontal lobe, and the basal ganglia, with substantial gender effects. Mapping the distribution of a(2)-ARs in the living human brain may prove useful not only for understanding the role of the NA system in many brain functions, but also for understanding neurodegenerative diseases in which altered NA transmission with specific loss of a(2)-ARs is suspected.

AB  - In Africa, camel herding is often viewed as a subsistence or ancient activity restricted to marginal drylands and arid or desert zones. However, camel products are increasingly sold in many cities, and camels are more and more used for tourist purposes. We can also see various public or private interventions in the arid zones aiming to develop processing units for milk or meat based on a business model. This present research aimed to evaluate the multiple economic and non-economic contributions of camel activities in North African drylands through analysis at the household and territorial levels using a multifunctional approach. Based on a study in five provinces of East and South Morocco, this article proposes a framework based on rural livelihoods and ecosystemic services for assessing the contribution of camel rearing to the rural economy and territorial development. It highlighted the multiple economic and non-economic functions of this activity, including domestic, trade, and services, as well as cultural attachment and local knowledge. We conclude by discussing current changes in camel herding, between supporting specialization for value chain participation and maintaining the overall sustainability of the camel systems in dryland areas.

AB  - Green tea is a popular drink used for therapeutic purposes to mitigate the consequences of diabetes. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the potential of green tea infusion to ameliorate structural and enzymatic damages caused by hyperglycemia in the testis and epididymis of Wistar rats. For that, nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (negative control and diabetes control, respectively) received 0.6 mL of water by gavage. Another set of diabetic animals received 100 mg/kg of green tea infusion diluted in 0.6 mL of water/gavage (diabetes + green tea) daily. After 42 days of treatment, the testes and epididymides were removed and processed for histopathological analysis, micromineral determination, and enzymatic assays. The results showed that treatment with green tea infusion preserved the testicular and epididymal histoarchitecture, improving the seminiferous epithelium and the sperm production previously affected by diabetes. Treatment with green tea reduced tissue damages caused by this metabolic condition. Given the severity of hyperglycemia, there was no efficacy of the green tea infusion in maintaining the testosterone levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, and microminerals content. Thus, our findings indicate a protective effect of this infusion on histological parameters, with possible use as a complementary therapy for diabetes.

AB  - Oxytocin contributes to the regulation of cytoskeletal and synaptic proteins and could, therefore, affect the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Both the Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome exhibit autistic symptoms involving the MAGEL2 gene. Magel2-deficient mice show a deficit in social behavior that is rescued following the postnatal administration of oxytocin. Here, in Magel2-deficient mice, we showed that the neurite outgrowth of primary cultures of immature hippocampal neurons is reduced. Treatment with oxytocin reversed this abnormality. In the hippocampus of Magel2-deficient pups, we further demonstrated that several transcripts of neurite outgrowth-associated proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, and cell-adhesion molecules are decreased. In the juvenile stage, when neurons are mature, normalization or even overexpression of most of these markers was observed, suggesting a delay in the neuronal maturation of Magel2-deficient pups. Moreover, we found reduced transcripts of the excitatory postsynaptic marker, Psd95 in the hippocampus and we observed a decrease of PSD95/VGLUT2 colocalization in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions in Magel2-deficient mice, indicating a defect in glutamatergic synapses. Postnatal administration of oxytocin upregulated postsynaptic transcripts in pups; however, it did not restore the level of markers of glutamatergic synapses in Magel2-deficient mice. Overall, Magel2 deficiency leads to abnormal neurite outgrowth and reduced glutamatergic synapses during development, suggesting abnormal neuronal maturation. Oxytocin stimulates the expression of numerous genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation in early development stages. Postnatal oxytocin administration has a strong effect on development that should be considered for certain neuropsychiatric conditions in infancy.

AB  - In long-lived organisms, experience can accumulate with age, such that older individuals may act as repositories of ecological and social knowledge. Such knowledge is often beneficial and can spread via social transmission, leading to the expectation that ageing individuals will remain socially well-integrated. However, social ageing involves multiple processes that modulate the relationship between age and social connectivity in complex ways. We developed a generative model to explore how social ageing may drive changes in social network position and shape older individuals' capacity to transmit knowledge to others. We further employ novel hypernetwork analyses that capture higher-order interactions (i.e. involving >= 3 participants) to reveal potential relationships between age and sociality that conventional dyadic networks may overlook. We find that older individuals in our simulations effectively facilitate transmission across a range of scenarios, especially when transmission resembles a complex contagion or when social selectivity (i.e. prioritization of key relationships) rapidly emerges with age. These patterns result from the formation of tight-knit sets of older associates that co-occur in multiple groups, thereby reinforcing one another's capacity to transmit knowledge. Our findings suggest key avenues for future empirical work and illustrate the use of hypernetworks in advancing the study of social behaviour.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Understanding age and society using natural populations'.

AB  - The family of WWC proteins is known to regulate cell proliferation and organ growth control via the Hippo signaling pathway. As WWC proteins share a similar domain structure and a common set of interacting proteins, they are supposed to fulfill compensatory functions in cells and tissues. While all three WWC family members WWC1, WWC2, and WWC3 are found co-expressed in most human organs including lung, brain, kidney, and liver, in the testis only WWC2 displays a relatively high expression. In this study, we investigated the testicular WWC2 expression in spermatogenesis and male fertility. We show that the Wwc2 mRNA expression level in mouse testes is increased during development in parallel with germ cell proliferation and differentiation. The cellular expression of each individual WWC family member was evaluated in published single-cell mRNA datasets of murine and human testes demonstrating a high WWC2 expression predominantly in early spermatocytes. In line with this, immunohistochemistry revealed cytosolic WWC2 protein expression in primary spermatocytes from human testes displaying full spermatogenesis. In accordance with these findings, markedly lower WWC2 expression levels were detected in testicular tissues from mice and men lacking germ cells. Finally, analysis of whole-exome sequencing data of male patients affected by infertility and unexplained severe spermatogenic failure revealed several heterozygous, rare WWC2 gene variants with a proposed damaging function and putative impact on WWC2 protein structure. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the testicular expression of WWC2 and show its cell-specific expression in spermatocytes. As rare WWC2 variants were identified in the background of disturbed spermatogenesis, WWC2 may be a novel candidate gene for male infertility.

AB  - Simple Summary The annual shortage of donkey hides is significant in China. Therefore, to meet the market demand, it is important to improve donkey hide production through molecular breeding. In this study, one SNP was identified in intron 1 of the LCORL gene, and polymorphism information content (PIC) was moderate in the population. The association analysis of g.112558859 A > G with body height, body length, chest circumference and hide weight was conducted and found to be significantly associated with these traits. The hide weight of donkeys with the GG genotype was 1.07 Kg heavier than those with AA genotype. This provides the foundation for breeding large donkey breeds with high hide production. Several studies have shown the association between the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor compression-like protein (LCORL) gene and body size in horses, pigs and donkeys. Based on previous studies, the LCORL gene was hypothesized to be associated with growth traits and hide weight in Dezhou donkeys. In this study, we aimed to reveal the variation of the LCORL gene in the Dezhou donkey and explore whether the gene is associated with hide weight and body size. In this study, genetic polymorphisms in the LCORL gene of the Dezhou donkey were studied using targeted sequencing technology, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the LCORL gene were analyzed for association with hide weight and body size in Dezhou donkeys. The results showed that there was an SNP locus situated in intron 1 of the LCORL gene. Association analysis revealed that individuals with the GG genotype had significantly higher body height, body length, chest circumference and hide weight than those with the AA genotype (p < 0.05). Therefore, the g.112558859 A > G locus can be used as a potential candidate marker affecting body size and hide weight. This study provides the foundation for breeding high-quality donkeys with high hide yield.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: LiuweiDihuang (LW) pills was mainly used to treatment of children's fontanelle incomplete closure, enuresis and nervous system development delays and other diseases.Following the deepening of pharmacological research, LW has a good effect on neurological diseases include senile dementia. However, the neuroprotection mechanism of LW on Alzheimer's disease (AD) through regulation of inflammation remains unclear. Aim of the study: Here, we aimed to explore the effects and mechanism of LW on learning and memory deficits in SAMP8 mice. Materials and methods: Mice aged 6 months were treated with LW for 2 months and BV2, C6 and HT22 cells were treated with LW pharmaceutic serum and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) continuously. Then, cognitive tests were performed, including the Morris water maze and Y maze tests. The mRNA level of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) were examined in cells and the cortex and hippocampus by quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of postsynaptic density protein 95, synaptophysin and various inflammatory factors were detected in the cortex and hippocampus by Western blot. Furthermore, Ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein and A beta were examined in the brain of AD mice by immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry. And synaptic loss and neuronal ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscope. Results: We found that LW suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 expression in vitro. Importantly, LW dramatically improved spatial learning and memory in SAMP8 mice through inhibiting A beta accumulation and restoring structural synaptic integrity. Furthermore, LW inhibited the glial activation and neuroinflammation (COX-2, IL1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in the cortex and hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. Conclusion: Taken together, the present data not only indicated that LW is an effective agent on improving the learning and memory deficits through mitigating neuroinflammation but highlighted the LW can be a potential therapeutic drug for AD therapy.

AB  - FMRI studies of autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval typically ask subjects to retrieve memories silently to avoid speech-related motion artifacts. Recently, some fMRI studies have started to use overt (spoken) retrieval to probe moment-to-moment retrieved content. However, the extent to which the overt retrieval method alters fMRI activations during retrieval is unknown. Here we examined this question by eliciting unrehearsed AMs during fMRI scanning either overtly or silently, in the same subjects, in different runs. Differences between retrieval modality (silent vs. narrated) included greater activation for silent retrieval in the anterior hippocampus, left angular gyrus, PCC, and superior PFC, and greater activation for narrated retrieval in speech production regions, posterior hippocampus, and the DLPFC. To probe temporal dynamics, we divided each retrieval period into an initial search phase and a later elaboration phase. The activations during the search and elaboration phases were broadly similar regardless of modality, and these activations were in line with previous fMRI studies of AM temporal dynamics employing silent retrieval. For both retrieval modalities, search activated the hippocampus, mPFC, ACC, and PCC, and elaboration activated the left DLPFC and middle temporal gyri. To examine contentspecific reactivation during retrieval, the timecourse of narrated memory content was transcribed and modeled. We observed dynamic activation associated with object content in the lateral occipital complex, and activation associated with scene content in the retrosplenial cortex. The current findings show that both silent and narrated AMs activate a broadly similar memory network, with some key differences, and add to current knowledge regarding the content-specific dynamics of AM retrieval. However, these observed differences between retrieval modality suggest that studies using overt retrieval should carefully consider this method's possible effects on cognitive and neural processing.

AB  - Due to an incomplete understanding of the biomechanics of microneedle skin insertion for therapeutic delivery, translating microneedle device performance to clinical use remains challenging. For drug-coated microneedles, it is hypothesized that the mode of skin insertion plays a significant role in how efficiently the drug is released and diffuses. By modeling application pressure magnitude and duration, both computationally and experimentally, the influence of both factors on drug delivery is evaluated. Building on the previously described computational modeling approaches, the development of a Franz Diffusion Cell assay customized with 3D-printed components for use with microneedle patches with adjustable boundary conditions that capture strain-dependent drug diffusion in porcine skin is described. Findings demonstrate that the modified Franz Diffusion Cells accurately simulate microneedle-skin interactions under load, correlating with computational trends. Specifically, leaving microneedle patches in situ for 10 h reduced drug diffusion by approximate to 14%, compared to removal after 6 h. Prolonged application pressure may negatively impact on diffusion of the drug from the coated patch due to localized strain on surrounding skin tissue. These findings enhance understanding of how microneedle application mode influences drug delivery and the reliability of ex vivo transdermal testing, enabling more effective predictive pre-clinical assessment of microneedle performance.

AB  - Chronic methamphetamine (Meth) abuse may induce psychosis similar to that observed in schizophrenia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the development of psychosis. We have previously shown long-term protein expression changes in mice treated chronically with Meth depending on BDNF Val66Met genotype. The aim of this study was to investigate if these protein expression changes were associated with differential changes in a range of behavioural paradigms for cognition, anxiety, social and other behaviours. Male and female Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met mice were treated with an escalating Meth dose protocol from 6 to 9 weeks of age, with controls receiving saline injections. Several overlapping cohorts were tested in the Y-maze for short-term spatial memory, novel-object recognition test, context and cued fear conditioning, sociability and social preference, elevated plus maze for anxiety-like behaviour and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. Finally, the animals were assessed for spontaneous exploratory locomotor activity and acute Meth-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Acute Meth caused significantly greater locomotor hyperactivity in mice previously treated with the drug than in saline-pretreated controls. Meth-pretreated female mice showed a mild increase in spontaneous locomotor activity. There were no Meth-induced deficits in any of the other behavioural tests. Val/Met mice showed higher overall social investigation time and lower PPI compared with the Val/Val genotype independent of pretreatment. These results show limited long-term effects of chronic Meth on a range of cognitive, affective and social behaviours despite marked drug-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. There was no interaction with BDNF Val66Met genotype.

AB  - Central insulin resistance is considered as one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), similar to formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Activation of alpha 7nAChR by GTS-21 has been indicated to reverse peripheral insulin resistance and exert neuroprotection. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of alpha 7nAChR agonist (GTS-21) on intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ)-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, central insulin resistance and cognitive deficits. GTS-21 (1, 4 and 8 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered for 21 days following bilateral ICV-STZ administration (3 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. Neurobehavioral assessments were performed using Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR). Inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta) were determined using ELISA. Oxido-nitrosative stress (GSH, MDA and nitrite) and cholinergic activity (acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyltransferase) were estimated in the cortex and hippocampus through biochemical methods. Gene expression of insulin receptor (IR), IRS1, IRS2, BACE1, APP, PI3-K, AKT and GSK3 beta were determined by q-RT-PCR. ICV-STZ administration induced memory impairment, increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and caused cholinergic dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that activation of alpha 7nAChR by GTS-21 treatment improved memory in MWM and NOR test. Moreover, GTS-21 treatment significantly decreased oxido-nitrosative stress, inflammatory markers and cholinergic dysfunction in cortex and hippocampus. Finally, GTS-21 treatment restored ICV-STZ induced downregulation of IR, IRS1, IRS2, PI3-k, Akt and attenuated GSK3 beta, APP and BACE-1 indicating improved insulin signalling. Therefore, activation of alpha 7nAChR through GTS-21 might be the potential target for the amelioration of central insulin resistance induced AD.

AB  - Few studies have examined how multisensory emotional experiences are processed and encoded into memory. Here, we aimed to determine whether, at encoding, activity within functionally-defined visual-and auditory-processing brain regions discriminated the emotional category (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) of the multisensory (audio-visual) events. Participants incidentally encoded positive, negative, and neutral multisensory stimuli during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following a 3h post-encoding delay, their memory for studied stimuli was tested, allowing us to identify emotion-category-specific subsequent-memory effects focusing on medial temporal lobe regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus) and visual-and auditory-processing regions. We used a combination of univariate and multivoxel pattern fMRI analyses (MVPA) to examine emotion-category-specificity in mean activity levels and neural patterning, respectively. Univariate analyses revealed many more visual regions that showed negative-category specificity relative to positive-category-specificity, and auditory regions only showed negative-category-specificity. These results suggest that negative emotion is more closely tied to information contained within sensory regions, a conclusion that was supported by the MVPA analyses. Functional connectivity analyses further revealed that the visual amplification of category-selective processing is driven, in part, by mean signal from the amygdala. Interestingly, while stronger representations in visuo-auditory regions were related to subsequent-memory for neutral multisensory stimuli, they were related to subsequent-forgetting of positive and negative stimuli. Neural patterning in the hippo campus and amygdala were related to memory for negative multisensory stimuli. These results provide new evidence that negative emotional stimuli are processed with increased engagement of visuosensory regions, but that this sensory engagementdthat generalizes across the entire emotion categorydis not the type of sensory encoding that is most beneficial for later retrieval.

AB  - Hippocampal neurons maintain the ability of proliferation throughout life to support neurogenesis. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that exhibits brain toxicity, yet whether and how DON affects hippocampal neurogenesis remains unknown. Here, we use mouse hippocampal neuron cells (HT-22) as a model to illustrate the effects of DON on neuron proliferation and to explore underlying mechanisms. DON exposure significantly inhibits the proliferation of HT-22 cells, which is associated with an up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitor p21 at both mRNA and protein levels. Global and site-specific m(6)A methylation levels on the 3'UTR of p21 mRNA are significantly increased in response to DON treatment, whereas inhibition of m(6)A hypermethylation significantly alleviates DON-induced cell cycle arrest. Further mechanistic studies indicate that the m(6)A readers YTHDF1 and IGF2BP1 are responsible for m(6)A-mediated increase in p21 mRNA stability. Meanwhile, 3'UTR of E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 mRNA is also m(6)A hypermethylated, and another m(6)A reader YTHDF2 binds to the m(6)A sites, leading to decreased TRIM21 mRNA stability. Consequently, TRIM21 suppression impairs ubiquitin-mediated p21 protein degradation. Taken together, m(6)A-mediated upregulation of p21, at both post-transcriptional and post-translational levels, contributes to DON-induced inhibition of hippocampal neuron proliferation. These results may provide new insights for epigenetic therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Tyrosinemia type 1 (TT1) is caused by fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase activity deficiency, resulting in tissue accumulation of upstream metabolites, including succinylacetone (SA), the pathognomonic compound of this disease. Since the pathogenesis of liver and kidney damage observed in the TT1-affected patients is practically unknown, this study assessed the effects of SA on important biomarkers of redox homeostasis in the liver and kidney of adolescent rats, as well as in hepatic (HepG2) and renal (HEK-293) cultured cells. SA significantly increased nitrate and nitrite levels and decreased the concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the liver and kidney, indicating induction of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation and disruption of antioxidant defenses. Additionally, SA decreased the GSH levels and the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase in hepatic and renal cells. Noteworthy, melatonin prevented the SA-induced increase of nitrate and nitrite levels in the liver. Therefore, SA-induced increase of RNS generation and impairment of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses may contribute to hepatopathy and renal disease in TT1.

AB  - Neospora caninum represents an obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite of the family Sarcocystidae causing severe reproductive disorders in cattle, small ruminants, wild animals and canids worldwide. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were recently described as effective host defense mechanism of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) derived from cattle, dogs, goats and dolphins against N. caninum tachyzoites. Nonetheless, nothing is known so far on canine colostral PMN immune reactions against N. caninum although breeding bitches represent a susceptible dog cohort and infected bitches may spread tachyzoites through transplacental trans-mission to their offspring. Thus, isolated colostrum PMN from bitches were assessed for PMN phagocytic ac-tivities as well as NETs release against viable N. caninum tachyzoites. In vitro interactions of canine colostrum -derived PMN with tachyzoites were analyzed at different ratios and time spans. Extracellular chromatin stain-ing was applied in order to unveil classical molecules of NETs, such as neutrophil elastase (NE), global histones (H1, H2A/H2B, H3, H4) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), via antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. N. caninum tachyzoites induced canine NETs in colostral PMN and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed NETs formation by colostral PMN thereby ensnaring tachyzoites after exposure. In summary, NETs released from canine colostral PMN might represent an early and effective maternal defense mechanism of the definitive host helping neonates to reduce initial intracellular replication of not only parasites but of other invasive pathogens after colostrum consumption.

AB  - The preparation of high-quality inorganic fibers by centrifugation from modified melting-separated red mud, which is the product of the efficient recovery of pig iron from red mud, is a new approach to achieve large-scale production of high value-added materials from red mud. This method has a wide range of application prospects and could contribute substantially to the comprehensive utilization of bulk industrial solid waste and the development of a circular economy. In this study, melting-separated red mud was modified with water-quenched blast furnace slag, quartz sand, and quicklime. The effect of the CaO/Na2O mass ratio on the viscosity, fluidity, and crystallization performance of the melting-separated red mud was investigated; slag wool was prepared by centrifugation under laboratory conditions; and the effect of the CaO/Na2O mass ratio on the morphology and properties of the slag wool was investigated. The viscosity of modified melting-separated red mud with different CaO/Na2O mass ratios shows a decreasing trend with increasing temperature, and the fluidity increases with increasing temperature, indicating that the melt fluidity is improved. The suitable fiber-forming temperature of the melting-separated red mud shows a trend of increasing-decreasing-increasing with an increasing CaO/Na2O mass ratio, and at a CaO/Na2O ratio of 3.0, the maximum suitable fiber-forming temperature is 81 degrees C. Considering the feasibility of slag wool preparation from modified melting-separated red mud, the CaO/Na2O of the modified raw material system should not be higher than 3.0. The crystallization temperature of modified melting-separated red mud with different CaO/Na2O mass ratios first increases and then decreases, with a peak of 1450 degrees C at a CaO/Na2O ratio of 4.0. Slag wool prepared from modified melting-separated red mud with different CaO/Na2O mass ratios exhibits good properties, with a diameter of 5.47-6.67 mu m and a slag ball content of 2.7-8.4%.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in individual differences in autobiographical memory. The ability to recall details from personal past events correlates with the volume of specific hippocampal subfields in healthy adults. Although the posterior hippocampus is believed to process detailed memory representations independently of the memory's age, little is known about individual differences in the ability to recall newly encoded events in detail, and how these differences relate to hippocampal subregions. In this preregistered study, we scored the story recalls from 89 healthy middle-aged participants with a newly designed method that allows to distinguish information recalled in detail from gist recall (i.e., when only the general idea is recalled). After a 20-min delay, detailed information was transformed into gists, which is in line with recent evidence that gists can emerge rapidly after a new experience. In addition, we segmented the anterior and posterior hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus, and subiculum from highresolution structural MRI. As predicted, the volume of the posterior hippocampus was positively correlated with the detail score but not with the gist score, yet this effect was significant in the right hemisphere only. We also observed trends towards associations between the detail score and specific subfields of the right posterior hippocampus, but none survived statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Finally, we found no evidence for the expected age-related increase in the use of gists over details. Taken together, these results suggest that the posterior hippocampus supports detail memory in the recall of both remote and newly acquired memories. (c) 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transcription factor TEAD, together with its coactivator YAP/TAZ, is a key transcriptional modulator of the Hippo pathway. Activation of TEAD transcription by YAP has been implicated in a number of malignancies, and this complex represents a promising target for drug discovery. However, both YAP and its extensive binding interfaces to TEAD have been difficult to address using small molecules, mainly due to a lack of druggable pockets. TEAD is post-translationally modified by palmitoylation that targets a conserved cysteine at a central pocket, which provides an opportunity to develop cysteine-directed covalent small molecules for TEAD inhibition. Here, we employed covalent fragment screening approach followed by structure-based design to develop an irreversible TEAD inhibitor MYF-03-69. Using a range of in vitro and cell-based assays we demonstrated that through a covalent binding with TEAD palmitate pocket, MYF-03-69 disrupts YAP-TEAD association, suppresses TEAD transcriptional activity and inhibits cell growth of Hippo signaling defective malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Further, a cell viability screening with a panel of 903 cancer cell lines indicated a high correlation between TEAD-YAP dependency and the sensitivity to MYF-03-69. Transcription profiling identified the upregulation of proapoptotic BMF gene in cancer cells that are sensitive to TEAD inhibition. Further optimization of MYF-03-69 led to an in vivo compatible compound MYF-03-176, which shows strong antitumor efficacy in MPM mouse xenograft model via oral administration. Taken together, we disclosed a story of the development of covalent TEAD inhibitors and its high therapeutic potential for clinic treatment for the cancers that are driven by TEAD-YAP alteration.

AB  - In Parkinson's disease (PD), brain oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to neuronal loss as well as motor and cognitive deficits. The transcription factor NRF2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in PD because it sits at the intersection of antioxidant and mitochondrial pathways. Here, we investigate the effects of modulating NRF2 activity in neurons isolated from a A53T alpha-synuclein (A53TSyn) mouse model of synucleinopathy. Embryonic hippocampal neurons were isolated from A53TSyn mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. Neurons were treated with either the NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) or the NRF2 inhibitor ML385. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density were quantified. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were also profiled in these neurons. A53TSyn neurons had increased ROS and reduced basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration relative to WT neurons. A53TSyn neurons also displayed decreased dendritic arborization and reduced spine density. Treatment with DMF reduced ROS levels and improved both mitochondrial function and arborization, while inhibition of NRF2 with ML385 exacerbated these endpoints. Modulation of NRF2 activity had a significant effect on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity in A53TSyn neurons. These data suggest that NRF2 may be a viable target for therapeutic interventions in PD.

AB  - Jaw morphology is closely linked to both diet and biomechanical performance, and jaws are one of the most common Mesozoic mammal fossil elements. Knowledge of the dietary and functional diversity of early mammals informs on the ecological structure of palaeocommunities throughout the longest era of mammalian evolution: the Mesozoic. Here, we analyse how jaw shape and mechanical advantage of the masseter (MAM) and temporalis (MAT) muscles relate to diet in 70 extant and 45 extinct mammals spanning the Late Triassic-Late Cretaceous. In extant mammals, jaw shape discriminates well between dietary groups: insectivores have long jaws, carnivores intermediate to short jaws, and herbivores have short jaws. Insectivores have low MAM and MAT, carnivores have low MAM and high MAT, and herbivores have high MAM and MAT. These traits are also informative of diet among Mesozoic mammals (based on previous independent determinations of diet) and set the basis for future ecomorphological studies. Nuria Melisa Morales-Garcia et al. analyze jaw shape and mechanical advantage of 70 small modern mammals and 45 Mesozoic mammals and find that these metrics can be used to distinguish dietary groups for most extant mammals, and to infer diet in Mesozoic taxa.

AB  - Lipid-derived jasmonates (JAs) play a crucial role in a variety of plant development and defense mechanisms. In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding the JA signaling pathway. In this review, we discuss JA biosynthesis, as well as its core signaling pathway, termination mechanisms, and the evolutionary origin of JA signaling. JA regulates not only plant regeneration, reproductive growth, and vegetative growth but also the responses of plants to stresses, including pathogen as well as virus infection, herbivore attack, and abiotic stresses. We also focus on the JA signaling pathway, considering its crosstalk with the gibberellin (GA), auxin, and phytochrome signaling pathways for mediation of the trade-offs between growth and defense. In summary, JA signals regulate multiple outputs of plant defense and growth and act to balance growth and defense in order to adapt to complex environments.

AB  - As acoustic markers of emotional state, nonlinear phenomena (NLP) are commonly found in the calls that young mammals produce to solicit attention from their parents. However, data are lacking to assess the ontogeny of these NLP during early development, including the extent to which these acoustic cues vary with the age and sex of the emitter. In the present study, we evaluated the occurrence of NLP in the contact calls that northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) pups emit to solicit maternal care during the three-week period of maternal dependence. We found that five types of NLP are present at an early age. The relative occurrence of these NLP types varies with pup age, with more biphonation, chaos and subharmonics as pups get older, and fewer vibrato-like frequency-modulated components varying with both age and sex. Our results suggest that developmental changes-including body growth-facilitate increased flexibility in the vocal apparatus, which subsequently impacts the production of certain types of NLP. The production of nonlinear components within the calls of rapidly growing elephant seal pups is likely linked to their arousal state, which in turn is related to their high demand for maternal care. This can fluctuate throughout the lactation period and vary between male and female pups.This article is part of the theme issue 'Nonlinear phenomena in vertebrate vocalizations: mechanisms and communicative functions'.

TI  - The interplay between oxytocin receptor and YAP in regulating gastric cancer progression
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
KW  - HIPPO PATHWAY
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) remains a lethal malignancy with limited therapeutic targets, while recent studies revealed YAP could be a promising target for GC treatment. In our study, we identify oxytocin receptor (OXTR) as an important regulator of Hippo/YAP axis. Through bioinformatics analysis, RNA sequencing analysis, functional research, and molecular mechanism research, we found that OXTR could facilitate Hippo/YAP axis, while YAP were shown to bind the OXTR promoter, enhancing its expression and establishing an interesting positive feedback loop. These findings propose the significance of OXTR in GC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target for YAP-driven cancer.Schematic representation of the interaction between OXTR and the Hippo-YAP pathway: The activation of OXTR leads to the formation of a complex with ARRB2, thereby outcompeting LATS1 and inhibiting its phosphorylation of YAP. This interaction increases YAP signaling activity, which in turn promotes the progression of gastric cancer. Furthermore, YAP can bind to the promoter region of OXTR, facilitating its expression and establishing a positive feedback loop. The use of the OXTR antagonist Atosiban to inhibit OXTR activity promotes the phosphorylation of LATS1 by ARRB2, which subsequently suppresses YAP phosphorylation. This results in the sequestration of YAP in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the progression of gastric cancer.

AB  - In facing unknown and complex environments, the ability of robots to make efficient and good behavioral decisions is an important prerequisite for them to accomplish various tasks. When robots perform tasks in changing environments or in a new environment, they generally have poor decision-making skills and difficulty acquiring stable and continuous learning capabilities. Therefore, investigating how to make robots have human-like decision-making and learning ability and be able to make better decisions facing unknown complex tasks is currently an important challenge for robots. The authors have attempted to achieve flexible behavioral decision-making in dynamic environments of mobile robots by integrating the cerebellar supervised learning function and the reinforcement learning function of the basal ganglia, but the proposed algorithms have limited ability to adapt to dynamic environments. Based on previous work, this article redesigns the cerebellum module and adopts the motivated developmental network 2 to simulate the working mechanism of the cerebellum. Motivated developmental network 2 realizes the precise characterization of intrinsic features of the complex environment through the lateral connection between hidden neurons, in order to enhance the robot decision-making ability. A memory consolidation module is designed according to the working principle of the hippocampus, which makes the robot not only able to make good behavioral decision making when facing an unknown dynamic environment, but also able to continuously acquire knowledge from the unknown environment. Meanwhile, a state-action prediction method is proposed to realize flexible behavioral decision-making based on cerebellar supervised learning and basal ganglia's reinforcement learning in dynamic environment, which further improves its decision-making ability. Experimental results in dynamic and real environments verify the potential of the model proposed in this paper.

AB  - Analogues of PGF2 alpha have been used in boars with positive results on sexual behaviour, but limited impact on semen quality. The objective of this study was to determine whether the administration of Dinoprost tromethamine or D-Cloprostenol enhances the sexual behaviour and semen quality of sexually inexperienced growing lambs during the onset of the breeding season. The study lasted 10 weeks, beginning during the non-breeding season, with 24 sexually inexperienced Katahdin lambs (5.1 +/- 0.5 months old). Three groups of eight lambs each received: (1) vehicle treatment (group CON); (2) 10 mg of Dinoprost tromethamine (group DIN); or (3) 0.15 mg of Cloprostenol dextrogy (group CLOP). The treatments were all applied im 5 min before the tests of sexual behaviour, or 20 min before the collection of semen. Sexual behaviour was evaluated twice weekly in a pen test with a non-oestrous ewe, and semen was collected once weekly with an artificial vagina. The latency to begin courtship was significantly shorter in both groups that received analogues of PGF2 alpha than in CON lambs. The number of ano-genital sniffs, flehmens and lateral approaches was greater in both treated groups than in CON lambs (p < .05). Lambs from DIN group mounted significantly more than CLOP and CON lambs, which did not differ. However, CLOP lambs showed significantly greater mating efficiency (i.e. ejaculations/total mounts) than CON lambs, which exhibited significantly greater mating efficiency that DIN lambs. Lambs treated with CLOP produced significantly more semen volume with more mass motility than those treated with DIN and CON (without differences between DIN and CON). Overall, we concluded that the administration of cloprostenol or dinoprost before sexual evaluation in young rams enhances their sexual behaviour. Cloprostenol had greater effects than dinoprost. The administration of cloprostenol before semen collection also triggered the ejaculation of a greater volume of semen, with greater mass motility. These results open interesting possibilities to study deeply the use of simple and cost-effective treatments to improve the reproductive results of young growing rams.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Recent breakthroughs in three-dimensional (3D) printing and high-resolution imaging have opened up new possibilities in personalized medicine, surgical planning, and forensic reconstruction. This study breaks new ground by evaluating the integration of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) with multimodal imaging and additive manufacturing to assess a chronic, infected gunshot injury in the knee joint of a red deer. This unique approach serves as a translational model for complex skeletal trauma. Methods: Multimodal imaging-including clinical CT, MRI, and HR-pQCT-was used to characterise the extent of osseous and soft tissue damage. Histopathological and molecular analyses were performed to confirm the infectious agent. HR-pQCT datasets were segmented and processed for 3D printing using PolyJet, stereolithography (SLA), and fused deposition modelling (FDM). Printed models were quantitatively benchmarked through 3D surface deviation analysis. Results: Imaging revealed comminuted fractures, cortical and trabecular degradation, and soft tissue involvement, consistent with chronic osteomyelitis. Sphingomonas sp., a bacterium that forms biofilms, was identified as the pathogen. Among the printing methods, PolyJet and SLA demonstrated the highest anatomical accuracy, whereas FDM exhibited greater geometric deviation. Conclusions: HR-pQCT-guided 3D printing provides a powerful tool for the anatomical visualisation and quantitative assessment of complex bone pathology. This approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also supports applications in surgical rehearsal and forensic analysis. It illustrates the potential of digital imaging and additive manufacturing to advance orthopaedic and trauma care, inspiring future research and applications in the field.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the reproductive outcomes (artificial insemination [AI] pregnancy rates, season pregnancy rates, AI pregnancy losses) and calf traits (birth and weaning weights) after vaccination of suckled beef cows against bovine herpesvirus 1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus using commercially-available modified-live virus (MLV) or killed virus (KV) vaccine at the initiation of a fixedtime AI program. Previously-vaccinated cows (n = 2138) on 14 farms throughout Virginia were enrolled in the study during the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 breeding seasons. Animals received a single vaccination injection at 10 d pre-breeding, corresponding with time of CIDR insertion at initiation of the 7-d COSynch + CIDR synchronization protocol. Cows were inseminated at a fixed time (60-66 h after removal of the CIDR insert) and subsequently turned out with bulls approximately 1 wk after insemination for a natural service. Cows treated with the MLV vaccine had greater AI pregnancy rates than cows treated with the KV vaccine during the fall (P = 0.008; 54% vs. 46%, respectively), but not during the spring breeding season (P = 0.62; 48 vs. 49%). Season pregnancy rates were greater (P = 0.01) in the fall (95 -96%) than in the spring breeding season (89-90%), but were not affected by vaccine treatment (P = 0.49) or treatment by season (P = 0.30) interactions. Percentage of AI pregnancy losses was not affected by season (P = 0.85), vaccine treatment (P = 0.83), or treatment by season interactions (P = 0.68). The number of cycles it took for cows to become pregnant by natural service differed by season (P = 0.006) but not treatment (P = 0.87) or treatment by season interaction (P = 0.997). Cows treated with the MLV vaccine gave birth earlier in the calving season (8.36 +/- 0.6 d) than those treated with the KV vaccine (10.31 +/- 0.6 d; P = 0.02). There was a main effect of season on birth weights (P = 0.008), weaning weights (P < 0.001), and ADG at weaning (P < 0.001), but no effects of treatment (P >= 0.26) or treatment by season interaction (P >= 0.10) on any of these parameters. Overall, this study demonstrated that the administration of an MLV vaccine at 10 d before fixed-time AI did not have any adverse effects on pregnancy or calf outcomes compared with KV vaccine administration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which oxidative stress and neuroinflammation were demonstrated to be associated with neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. However, there are still no specific treatments that can prevent the progression of AD. In this study, a screening of anti-inflammatory hits from 4207 natural compounds of two different molecular libraries indicated 1,6-O,O-diacetylbritannilactone (OABL), a 1,10-seco-eudesmane sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the herb Inula britannica L., exhibited strong antiinflammatory activity in vitro as well as favorable BBB penetration property. OABL reduced LPS-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglial cells as assessed by effects on the levels of inflammatory mediators including NO, PGE2, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and COX-2, as well as the translocation of NF-kappa B. Besides, OABL also exhibited pronounced neuroprotective effects against oxytosis and ferroptosis in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. For in vivo research, OABL (20 mg/kg B.W., i.p.) for 21 d attenuated the impairments in cognitive function observed in 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, as assessed with the Morris water maze test. OABL restored neuronal damage and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression in the hippocampus. OABL also significantly reduced the accumulation of amyloid plaques, the A beta expression, the phosphorylation of Tau protein, and the expression of BACE1 in AD mice brain. In addition, OABL attenuated the overactivation of microglia and astrocytes by suppressing the expressions of inflammatory cytokines, and increased glutathione (GSH) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the 5xFAD mice brain. In conclusion, these results highlight the beneficial effects of the natural product OABL as a novel treatment with potential application for drug discovery in AD due to its pharmacological profile.

AB  - Normal growth of granulosa cells (GCs) is essential for follicular development. miR-200b plays a vital role in litter size, estrous cycle, ovulation, and follicular development in sheep. However, it is unclear that the specific effect and regulatory mechanism of miR-200b on ovine GCs. miR-200b mimic inhibited GCs proliferation and induced cellular senescence through downregulating mitochondrial membrane po-tential (MMP), concentration of ATP and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, and upregulating SA-O-gal positive rate and ROS production. A total of 597 differentially expressed genes were identified by RNA-Seq in GCs transfected with miR-200b mimic and mimic NC, and they were involved in cell cycle and cellular senescence. miR-200b directly targeted and downregulated MYBL2 and CDK1. Over -expression of MYBL2 promoted GCs proliferation and genes expression (CDK1, CDC20, MAD2L1 and FOXM1), which were suppressed by miR-200b mimic. Furthermore, MYBL2 negatively regulated miR-200b-induced GC senescence. In conclusion, miR-200b/MYBL2/CDK1 regulated proliferation and senescence through cell cycle pathway in ovine granulosa cells. Our study provides a novel insight that miR-200b regulates ovine follicular development.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The inherent limitations of hydrogels, including susceptibility to failure due to water loss or freezing, and the limitations of ionogels, including cost and environmental impact, restrict their applications in wearable sensor technologies. Eutectogels prepared using poly deep eutectic solvent (PDES) have emerged as the most promising candidates for wearable sensors due to their economical nature, environmentally friendly nature, and good temperature tolerance characteristics. The necessity for self-adhesion as a sensor property is highlighted by the occurrence of false signals caused by detached sensors under complex maneuvers. Herein, eutectogels were synthesized through the incorporation of gallic acid (GA) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as multifunctional hydrogen bond donors in combination with choline chloride (ChCl) as hydrogen bond acceptors, referred to as the HEMA-ChCl-GA eutectogels. Their adhesive strength was up to 2.6 MPa for a variety of materials, including glass, polyvinyl chloride, wood, and pig skin, which could lift a 20 kg weight without separation. In addition, HEMA-ChCl-GA eutectogels exhibited exceptional mechanical properties, including remarkable stretchability (900%), high strength (4.18 MPa), high toughness (22.41 MJ/m3), and loading 4 kg weight (8000 times its own weight) without fracture. It demonstrated the capacity to recognize a range of human motions, which highlights its potential as a wearable sensor.

AB  - The reliable function in vivo of self-powered implantable bioelectric devices (iBEDs) requires biocompatible, seamless, effective interactions with biological tissues. Herein, an implantable tissue-adhesive piezoelectric soft sensor (TPSS), in which the piezoelectric sensor converts biomechanical signals into electrical signals, and the adhesive hydrogel (AH) strengthens this conversion by seamlessly adhering the sensor on the wet and curvilinear surface, is proposed. The optimized AH exhibits strong adhesion to various organic or inorganic surfaces, including six commonly used engineering materials and three biological tissues. As a pressure sensor, TPSS proves good in vitro electrical performance with a high output of 8.3 V, long-term stability of over 6000 cycles, and high energy power density of 186.9 mu W m(-2). In a large animal experiment, TPSS seamlessly adheres to the right-side internal carotid artery of a Yorkshire pig to monitor blood pressure during a surgical operation. Compared to commercial sensors that work by inserting into tissues, TPSS does not cause any damage and can be peeled off after service. The integration of adhesive hydrogel and self-powered pressure sensors enables biocompatible, seamless, and more efficient interactions between the biological system and iBEDs, which also contributes to next-generation implantable bioelectronics with features of battery-free, intelligent, and accurate.

AB  - Liu, Na, Yanbo Zhang, Pu Zhang, Kerui Gong, Chunyang Zhang, Kai Sun, and Guo Shao. Vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin show different expression patterns in the early and late hypoxia preconditioning phases and may correlate with DNA methylation status in the mouse hippocampus. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2022.Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) have been proven to participate in neuroprotection induced by hypoxia preconditioning (HPC), and they can be regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). It has been reported that DNA methylation can affect VEGF and EPO expression. This study aimed to explore the expression of VEGF and EPO in the early phase and late phase of HPC and whether their expression was affected by DNA methylation.Method: Acute repeated HPC mice were used as the animal model, and detection of molecular changes was performed immediately (early phase) and 1 day (late phase) after HPC treatment. The mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF, EPO, and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the hippocampi were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The activity of DNMTs and global methylation levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNA methylation levels of VEGF and EPO promoters, which were catalyzed by DNMTs, were determined by bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing.Results: The expression of VEGF was increased in the early phase and late phase of HPC (p < 0.05), whereas the expression of EPO was unchanged in the early phase (p > 0.05) of HPC and was increased in the late phase (p < 0.05). VEGF and EPO expression were negatively correlated with the DNA methylation levels of their promoters. DNMT3A and DNMT3B were decreased in the early phase and late phase (p < 0.05), whereas DNMT1 was unchanged in the early phase and late phase (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that DNMTs affect VEGF and EPO expression by regulating the DNA methylation levels of the promoters of VEGF and EPO.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania and is responsible for more than 1 million new cases and 70,000 deaths annually worldwide. Treatment has high costs, toxicity, complex and long administration time, several adverse effects, and drug-resistant strains, therefore new therapies are urgently needed. Synthetic compounds have been highlighted in the medicinal chemistry field as a strong option for drug development against different diseases. Organic salts (OS) have multiple biological activities, including activity against protozoa such as Leishmania spp. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro leishmanicidal activity and death mechanisms of a thiohydantoin salt derived from L-arginine (ThS) against Leishmania amazonensis. . We observed that ThS treatment inhibited promastigote proliferation, increased ROS production, phosphatidylserine exposure and plasma membrane permeabilization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, lipid body accumulation, autophagic vacuole formation, cell cycle alteration, and morphological and ultrastructural changes, showing parasites death. Additionally, ThS presents low cytotoxicity in murine macrophages (J774A.1), human monocytes (THP-1), and sheep erythrocytes. ThS in vitro cell treatment reduced the percentage of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes per macrophage by increasing ROS production and reducing TNF-alpha levels. These results highlight the potential of ThS among thiohydantoins, mainly related to the arginine portion, as a leishmanicidal drug for future drug strategies for leishmaniasis treatment. Notably, in silico investigation of key targets from L. amazonensis, , revealed that a ThS compound from the L- arginine amino acid strongly interacts with arginase (ARG) and TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), suggesting its potential as a Leishmania inhibitor.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common type of brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain during the perinatal period. The incidence of HIE is approximately 2-3 cases per 1000 live births in high-income settings; while in low- and middle-income countries, the incidence is 3-10-fold higher. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the current standard treatment for neonates affected by moderate-severe HIE. However, more than 50% of all infants with suspected HIE have mild encephalopathy, and these infants are not treated with TH because of their lower risk of adverse outcomes. Despite this, several analyses of pooled data provide increasing evidence that infants who initially have mild encephalopathy may present signs of more significant brain injury later in life. The purpose of this study was to expand our knowledge about the effect of mild-moderate hypoxia-ischemia (HI) at the cellular, structural, and functional levels. An established rat model of mild-moderate HI was used, where postnatal day (P) 7 rats were exposed to unilateral permanent occlusion of the left carotid artery and 90 min of 8% hypoxia, followed by TH or normothermia (NT) treatment. The extent of injury was assessed using histology (P14 and P42) and MRI (P11 and P32), as well as with short-term and long-term behavioral tests. Neurogenesis was assessed by BrdU staining. We showed that mild-moderate HI leads to a progressive loss of brain tissue, pathological changes in MRI scans, as well as an impairment of long-term motor function. At P14, the median area loss assessed by histology for HI animals was 20% (p < 0.05), corresponding to mild-moderate brain injury, increasing to 55% (p < 0.05) at P42. The data assessed by MRI corroborated our results. HI led to a decrease in neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus and the lateral ventricle at early time points, with a delayed partial recovery. TH was not neuroprotective at early time points following mild-moderate HI, but prevented the increase in brain damage over time. Additionally, rats treated with TH showed better long-term motor function. Altogether, our results bring more light to the understanding of pathophysiology following mild-moderate HI. We showed that, in the context of mild-moderate HI, TH failed to be significantly neuroprotective. However, animals treated with TH showed a significant improvement in motor, but not cognitive long-term function. These results are in line with what is observed in some cases where neonates with mild HIE are at risk of neurodevelopmental deficits in infancy or childhood. Whether TH should be used as a preventive treatment to reduce adverse outcomes in mild-HIE remains of active interest, and more research has to be carried out in order to address this question.

AB  - Simple Summary: Fish meal (FM) is the major protein source in aquafeed to achieve sustainable aquaculture production. However, the supply of FM is low due to high cost and low availability. There is ongoing conceited research to identify alternative viable protein sources to replace the finite FM. Novel camelina meal (CM) is a plant protein with high amino acids levels and has been tested as an alternative protein source in livestock feeding. However, there is limited information on supplementation of the CM in aquaculture diets. In this study, four diets were formulated to contain 0% plant protein, 205 g/kg soybean meal, and two levels of CM (205 g/kg and 330 g/kg) in diets fed to red seabream. Results indicated that adding CM 205 g/kg in diets-maintained growth performance, digestive enzyme activities, and nutrient digestibility regulated the immunity and stress resistance and modulated the growth-related genes in red seabream. These findings provide the first step in using novel CM and are essential for future practical formulations of feed for red seabream and other marine fish species.A 60-day experiment was designed to assess the effect of different ratios of fish meal (FM): camelina meal plant protein (CM) on growth response and relative gene expression of growth-promoting factors, feed utilization potency, digestive enzymes activities, apparent digestibility (ADC), stress response, non-specific immunity of Pagrus major. Four isonitrogenous (490.7 g/kg of crude protein) and isolipidic (91.5 g/kg total lipid) experimental diets were formulated and designated as camelina meal (CM0), soyabean meal (SBM20.5), CM20.5, and CM33 based on protein contents. At the end of the feed trial, significantly higher (p < 0.05) weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed intake but lower feed conversion ratio were recorded in fish fed CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 than fish fed CM33. The lowest growth, feed utilization, enzyme activity, and digestibility were recorded in fish fed CM33. Significantly higher pepsin, amylase, and protease activities were observed in fish fed CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 diets than fish fed CM33. The highest ADC of protein was recorded in fish fed CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 diets. Hematocrit levels were depressed CM33 while total serum protein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were not significantly changed by the inclusion of CM. Non-specific immune variables (lysozyme activity, peroxidase activity in serum and nitro blue tetrazolium) in fish fed CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 were significantly higher than in fish fed CM33 diet. The superoxide dismutase of fish fed CM20.5 was not significantly different from CM0 and SBM20.5 (p > 0.05). Catalase and low salinity stress test show that CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 were not significantly (p > 0.05) different, while CM33 was significantly lower than the rest of the diets. TBARs show that CM20.5 and CM33 diets were significantly different (p < 0.05), but CM20.5 was not significantly different from SBM20.5. Significantly higher hepatic IGF-1 and IGF-2 mRNA expression was found in fish-fed diet groups CM0, SBM20.5, and CM20.5 than fish fed CM33. The present study indicated that the addition of CM up 205 kg/kg to diet maintains growth, digestive enzymes, nutrient digestibility, immunity, stress resistance, and feed utilization efficiency of red sea bream.

AB  - Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) blocks the inhibitory action of GABA, triggering a Glu-mediated hyperexcitation of the dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons that leads to the generation of epilepti-form seizures. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of PTZ on the electrical activity of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons in male rats. Bipolar electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in the right and left hippocampal CA1 fields of adults, and PTZ (65 mg/kg) was administered i.p. Simultaneous recordings of the field activity and the firing rate (multiunitary activity, MUA) were ana-lyzed at 10, 20, and 30 min post-administration of PTZ. Only rats that presented tonic-clonic seizures dur -ing the first 1-5 min after PTZ treatment were included in the study. The recordings of the field activity were analyzed in 4 frequency bands. In both the right and left hippocampal CA1 fields, the relative power corresponding to the slow waves (4-7 Hz) increased, while in the bands 13-30 Hz and 31-50 Hz, it decreased at 10, 20, and 30 min post-PTZ. MUA recordings were analyzed at four levels. The highest levels corresponded to larger amplitudes of the action potentials in the pyramidal neurons. The firing rates of the PTZ-treated rats did not differ from baseline but presented a significant decrement at 10, 20, and 30 min post-PTZ. The decreased firing rate of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after PTZ treat-ment could be associated with plastic changes of dendritic spines along with some microenvironmental adaptations at synaptic level, after neuronal PTZ-mediated hyperexcitation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fluoride affects neurodevelopment in children. In this study, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to sodium fluoride (NaF) on hippocampal neurogenesis in rats. Dams were given drinking water containing NaF at 0 (untreated controls), 30 or 100 ppm from gestational day 6 to day 21 post-delivery upon weaning, and offspring were reared until postnatal day (PND) 77. On PND 21, NaF at 100 ppm altered the numbers in subpopulations of granule cell lineages, including a decrease in type-3 neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as a compensatory increase in type-1 neural stem cells (NSCs) and type-2a NPCs. NaF exposure tended to increase GluR2+ + mossy cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that NaF exposure induces a compensatory neurogenic response. NaF also caused a dose-dependent increase in ARC+ + granule cells, and it upregulated Ptgs2 in the DG at 100 ppm, suggesting that NaF exposure increases synaptic plasticity in granule cells. NaF at 100 ppm upregulated granule cell lineage marker genes (Nes, Nes , Eomes and Rbfox3) ) and an anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl2), Bcl2 ), suggesting ameliorating responses against the impaired neurogenesis during NaF exposure. Moreover, NaF at 100 ppm downregulated oxidative phosphorylation-related genes ( Atp5f1b and Sdhd) ) and upregulated a glycolysis-related gene (Hk3), Hk3 ), suggesting a metabolic shift in cells undergoing neurogenesis. By PND 77, the changes in granule cell lineages were no longer detected, and GABAergic interneuron marker genes ( Calb2 and Reln) ) were upregulated, suggesting a persistent protective response in granule cell lineages. Together, these findings suggest that developmental NaF exposure causes transient disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis, which in turn induces a metabolic shift as a compensatory response.

AB  - Sperm fertility decreases significantly after freezing. Providing a suitable and useful diluent compound for freezing ram sperm can increase the efficiency of artificial insemination and consequently, the reproductive performance of sheep. Various biological properties such as antibacterial, anti-cancer, immunosuppressive, antioxidant and reproductive properties of royal jelly (RJ) are well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible synergistic effect of royal jelly in combination with glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in sperm cryopreservation extender of Romanov ram. The pooled semen samples from 5 Romanov rams were allocated into 3 experiments. The effect of 6% DMSO, 6% glycerol and a combination of 3% DMSO +3% glycerol co-supplemented with 1, 2 and 3% RJ was evaluated in 3 experiments. Samples were frozen by conventional slow freezing method and post-thaw parameters of total motility, progressive motility, plasma membrane integrity, DNA damage, apoptosis, enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated. The results showed that the percentage of motility, progressive motility, TAC, GPx, SOD and all sperm kinematic parameters except LIN in the group containing 2% RJ + 6% DMSO was higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Some parameters such as progressive motility, sperm membrane integrity, TAC, GPx, VAP, VCL, STR and SRT in the group containing 2% RJ + 6% DMSO were more than (p < 0.05) in the sperm group containing 1% RJ + 6% DMSO. MDA values in sperm groups containing 2% RJ + 6% DMSO were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the sperm containing 1% royal jelly and the control group. In the sperm group containing 2% RJ + 6% glycerol, sperm membrane integrity, TAC, GPx, SOD, progressive motility and all sperm kinematic parameters except VAP were higher and MDA values and sperm abnormalities were lower than the control group (p < 0.05). The sperm group containing 1% RJ and 3% DMSO +3% glycerol had higher motility, progressive motility, membrane integrity, and all sperm kinematic parameters except VSL; and lower sperm abnormalities, DNA damage, apoptosis and MDA than the control group (p < 0.05). As a general conclusion of this study, the addition of 2% RJ + 3% DMSO and 3% glycerol to the freezing extender improved microscopic and biochemical ram sperm parameters after the freeze-thaw process. Hence, moderate concentrations of royal jelly (2%) are sufficient to protect sperm from freezing damage, and high (3%) and low (1%) concentrations do not have a good cryoprotective effect.

Xiaoyao San (XYS) is considered to have the effects of soothing liver-qi stagnation and invigorating the spleen. The spleen has the function to transport and transform nutrients. The liver has also termed the center of energy metabolism in the body. Therefore, exploring the antidepressant effects of XYS from the perspective of energy metabolism may reveal new findings.
   Aim of the study: Glucose catabolism is an important part of energy metabolism. In recent years, several researchers have found that XYS can exert antidepressant effects by modulating abnormalities in glucose catabolism-related metabolites. The previous research of our research group found that the hippocampus glucose catabolism was disordered in depression. However, the antidepressant potential of XYS through modulating the disorders of hippocampal glucose catabolism and the specific metabolic pathways and targets of XYS action were still unknown. The aim of this study was to address the above scientific questions.
   Materials and methods: In this research, the CUMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) model was used as the animal model of depression. The antidepressant effect of XYS was evaluated by behavioral indicators. The specific pathways and targets of XYS modulating the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats were obtained by stable isotope-resolved metabolomics. Further, the isotope tracing results were also verified by molecular biology and electron transmission electron microscopy.
   Results: The results demonstrated that XYS pretreatment could significantly improve the depressive symptoms induced by CUMS. More importantly, it was found that XYS could modulate the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and enzyme activity tests showed that Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were targets of XYS for modulating the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. The Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V (MRCC-V) were targets of XYS to improve abnormal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the hippocampus of CUMS rats. XYS was also found to have the ability to improve the structural damage of mitochondria and nuclei in the hippocampal caused by CUMS.
   Conclusions: This study was to explore the antidepressant effect of XYS from the perspective of glucose catabolism based on a strategy combining stable isotope tracing, molecular biology techniques, and transmission electron microscopy. We not only obtained the specific pathways and targets of XYS to improve the disorders of glucose catabolism in the hippocampus of CUMS rats, but also revealed the specific targets of the pathways of XYS compared with VLF.

AB  - The hippocampus is considered the center for learning and memory in the brain, and its development and function is greatly affected by the thyroid and stress axes. Thyroid hormone (TH) and glucocorticoids (GC) are known to have a synergistic effect on developmental programs across several vertebrate species, and their effects on hi ppocam pa I structure and function are well-documented. However, there are few studies that focus on the processes and genes that are cooperatively regulated by the two hormone axes. Cross-regulation of the thyroid and stress axes in the hippocampus occurs on multiple levels such that TH can regulate the expression of the GC receptor (GR) while GC can modulate tissue sensitivity to TH by controlling the expression of TH receptor (TR) and enzymes involved in TH biosynthesis. Thyroid hormone and GC are also known to synergistically regulate the transcription of genes associated with neuronal function and development. Synergistic gene regulation by TH and GC may occur through the direct, cooperative action of TR and GR on common target genes, or by indirect mechanisms involving gene regulatory cascades activated by TR and GR. In this chapter, we describe the known physiological effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of TH and GC synergistic gene regulation in the hippocampus.

AB  - Introduction:Neurotoxicity resulting from air pollution is of increasing concern. Considering exposure timing effects on neurodevelopmental impairments may be as important as the exposure dose. We used distributed lag regression to determine the sensitive windows of prenatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on children's cognition in a birth cohort in Mexico.Methods:Analysis included 553 full-term (>= 37 weeks gestation) children. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatiotemporal model. McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) were used to assess children's cognitive function at 4-5 years old (lower scores indicate poorer performance). To identify susceptibility windows, we used Bayesian distributed lag interaction models to examine associations between prenatal PM2.5 levels and MSCA. This allowed us to estimate vulnerable windows while testing for effect modification.Results:After adjusting for maternal age, socioeconomic status, child age, and sex, Bayesian distributed lag interaction models showed significant associations between increased PM2.5 levels and decreased general cognitive index scores at 31-35 gestation weeks, decreased quantitative scale scores at 30-36 weeks, decreased motor scale scores at 30-36 weeks, and decreased verbal scale scores at 37-38 weeks. Estimated cumulative effects (CE) of PM2.5 across pregnancy showed significant associations with general cognitive index (CE<^> = -0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.68, -0.01), quantitative scale (CE<^> = -0.27, 95% CI = -0.74, -0.02), motor scale (CE<^> = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.44, -0.05), and verbal scale (CE<^> = -0.2, 95% CI = -0.43, -0.02). No significant sex interactions were observed.Conclusions:Prenatal exposure to PM2.5, particularly late pregnancy, was inversely associated with subscales of MSCA. Using data-driven methods to identify sensitive window may provide insight into the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental impairment due to pollution.

AB  - Releasing large quantities of volatiles is a defense strategy used by plants to resist herbivore attack. Oenanthe javanica, a perennial herb of the Apiaceae family, has a distinctive aroma due to volatile terpenoid accumulation. At present, the complete genome and genetic characteristics of volatile terpenoids in O. javanica remain largely unclear. Here, the telomere-to-telomere genome of O. javanica, with a size of 1012.13 Mb and a contig N50 of 49.55 Mb, was established by combining multiple sequencing technologies. Comparative genome analysis revealed that O. javanica experienced a recent species-specific whole-genome duplication event during the evolutionary process. Numerous gene family expansions were significantly enriched in the terpenoid biosynthesis process, monoterpenoid, and diterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, which resulted in abundant volatile substance accumulation in O. javanica. The volatile terpenoids of O. javanica showed repellent effects on herbivores. Terpenoid biosynthesis was activated by wounding signals under exogenous stimuli. The TPS gene family was significantly expanded in O. javanica compared to those in other species, and the members (OjTPS1, OjTPS3, OjTPS4, OjTPS5, OjTPS7, OjTPS16, OjTPS18, OjTPS30 and OjTPS58) responsible for different terpenoid biosynthesis were functionally characterized. These results reveal the genome evolution and molecular characteristics of volatile terpenoids in the process of plant-herbivore interactions. This study also provides genomic resources for genetic and molecular biology research on O. javanica and other plants.

AB  - Decellularization does not completely remove the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes in porcine acellular dermal matrix (pADM), and the presence of residual alpha-Gal epitopes could elicit adverse immunological reactions and cause potential early failure of xenografts. The present study had evaluated the effectiveness of decellularization and alpha-galactosidase treatment to eliminate the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes in pADM, as well as the effect of tissue form (intact pADM vs. microparticle). Decellularization eliminated similar to 80% of alpha-Gal epitopes in porcine dermis, and pADM retained similar to 20% of the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes. While Aspergillus alpha-galactosidase and Coffea alpha-galactosidase both hydrolyzed the terminal alpha-galactosyl moiety from oligosaccharides, only Coffea alpha-galactosidase was effective in eliminating the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes in intact pADM. Aspergillus alpha-galactosidase did not work for intact pADM, even at an enzyme activity more than an order of magnitude higher than that of Coffea alpha-galactosidase used. The different efficacy between Aspergillus alpha-galactosidase and Coffea alpha-galactosidase was associated to the accessibility to the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes in intact pADM. When intact pADM was micronized into fine microparticles, Aspergillus alpha-galactosidase and Coffea alpha-galactosidase eliminated the matrix-bound alpha-Gal epitopes equally well. Thus, the tissue form had significant influence on the efficacy of enzymic cleavage. The findings of the study offer valuable insight for enzyme selection and process development for efficient alpha-Gal antigen reduction in xenogeneic grafts or tissue scaffolds.
   Impact Statement Decellularization does not eliminate the matrix-bounded xeno-reactive alpha-Gal epitopes, and immunological responses are potential causes for early failure of clinically implanted xenografts. The present study investigated the effectiveness of different alpha-galactosidases and the effect of tissue forms in eliminating the alpha-Gal epitopes in porcine acellular dermal matrix. The finding of the study offers valuable insight for the xenogeneic antigen reduction in processing xenogeneic tissue grafts or scaffolds.

AB  - The present study investigated circadian rhythms and hippocampal-dependent memory in female Fischer brown Norway rats. As in past reports with female Long Evans rats, we hypothesized that six days of exposure to an unentrainable T21 light-dark cycle that occurred during distributed Morris water task training would not impair the retention of the acquired memory. As expected, the rats did not have impaired retention of the place memory acquired in the distributed Morris water task. We next, quantified circadian entrainment two months after exposure to the T21 cycle. As expected, measures of circadian rhythms suggested that the rats exposed to the T21 had since entrained to a 12:12 light-dark cycle. To confirm that the T21 paradigm induces free-running circadian rhythms in female Fischer brown Norway rats, the control animals were subjected to the same T21 paradigm and circadian rhythms were continuously measured. Signs of free-running circadian rhythms were present during T21 exposure such as delayed phase of entrainment, elongated period, and decreased activity during the dark phase of the cycle. To our knowledge, this is one of the first characterization of activity rhythms in Fischer brown Norway rats.

AB  - Understanding the neural mechanisms that regulate the stress response is critical to know how animals adapt to a changing world and is one of the key factors to be considered for improving animal welfare. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is crucial for regulating physiological and endocrine responses, triggering the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) during stress. In mammals, several telencephalic areas, such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, regulate the autonomic system and the HPA responses. These centers include subpopulations of CRF containing neurons that, by way of CRF receptors, play modulatory roles in the emotional and cognitive aspects of stress. CRF binding protein also plays a role, buffering extracellular CRF and regulating its availability. CRF role in activation of the HPA is evolutionary conserved in vertebrates, highlighting the relevance of this system to help animals cope with adversity. However, knowledge on CRF systems in the avian telencephalon is very limited, and no information exists on detailed expression of CRF receptors and binding protein. Knowing that the stress response changes with age, with important variations during the first week posthatching, the aim of this study was to analyze mRNA expression of CRF, CRF receptors 1 and 2, and CRF binding protein in chicken telencephalon throughout embryonic and early posthatching development, using in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrate an early expression of CRF and its receptors in pallial areas regulating sensory processing, sensorimotor integration and cognition, and a late expression in subpallial areas regulating the stress response. However, CRF buffering system develops earlier in the subpallium than in the pallium. These results help to understand the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of noise and light during prehatching stages in chicken, and suggest that stress regulation becomes more sophisticated with age.

AB  - The bones of the archosaur eye socket evolve different shapes dependent on feeding habits and body size.
   The orbit is one of several skull openings in the archosauromorph skull. Intuitively, it could be assumed that orbit shape would closely approximate the shape and size of the eyeball resulting in a predominantly circular morphology. However, a quantification of orbit shape across Archosauromorpha using a geometric morphometric approach demonstrates a large morphological diversity despite the fact that the majority of species retained a circular orbit. This morphological diversity is nearly exclusively driven by large (skull length > 1000 mm) and carnivorous species in all studied archosauromorph groups, but particularly prominently in theropod dinosaurs. While circular orbit shapes are retained in most herbivores and smaller species, as well as in juveniles and early ontogenetic stages, large carnivores adopted elliptical and keyhole-shaped orbits. Biomechanical modelling using finite element analysis reveals that these morphologies are beneficial in mitigating and dissipating feeding-induced stresses without additional reinforcement of the bony structure of the skull.

AB  - Jasmonates are oxylipin phytohormones critical for plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogens and chewing herbivores. An early step in their biosynthesis is catalyzed by non-heme iron lipoxygenases (LOX; EC 1.13.11.12). In Arabidopsis thaliana, phosphorylation of Ser600 of AtLOX2 was previously reported, but whether phosphorylation regulates AtLOX2 activity is unclear. Here, we characterize the kinetic (alpha-LeA, jasmonate precursor), linoleic acid (LA), and arachidonic acid (AA) as substrates. Enzyme velocity with endogenous substrates alpha-LeA and LA increased with pH. For alpha-LeA, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in substrate affinity at alkaline pH; thus, the catalytic efficiency for alpha-LeA was not affected over the pH range tested. Analysis of Ser600 phosphovariants demonstrated that pseudophosphorylation inhibits enzyme activity. AtLOX2 activity was not detected in AA were used as substrates. In contrast, phosphonull mutant Atlox2S600A exhibited strong activity with all three substrates, alpha-LeA, LA, and AA. Structural comparison between the AtLOX2 AlphaFold model and a complex between 8R-LOX and a 20C polyunsaturated fatty acid suggests a close proximity the polyunsaturated fatty acid. This analysis indicates that structure and highlights how Ser600 phosphorylation could affect AtLOX2 catalytic activity. Overall, we propose that for the regulation of AtLOX2 activity and, thus, the jasmonate biosynthesis pathway and plant resistance.

AB  - Epithelia consist of proliferating and differentiating cells that often display patterned arrangements. However, the mechanism regulating these spatial arrangements remains unclear. Here, we show that cell-cell adhesion dictates multicellular patterning in stratified epithelia. When cultured keratinocytes, a type of epithelial cell in the skin, are subjected to starvation, they spontaneously develop a pattern characterized by areas of high and low cell density. Pharmacological and knockout experiments show that adherens junctions are essential for patterning, whereas the mathematical model that only considers local cell-cell adhesion as a source of attractive interactions can form regions with high/low cell density. This phenomenon, called cell-cell adhesion-induced patterning (CAIP), influences cell differentiation and proliferation through Yes-associated protein modulation. Starvation, which induces CAIP, enhances the stratification of the epithelia. These findings highlight the intrinsic self-organizing property of epithelial cells.

AB  - Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PIC) provides a model of developmental neuropathy by inducing maternal im-mune activation. We investigated the effects of an antioxidant, alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ), on PIC-induced developmental neuropathy in rats, focusing on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. On gestational day 15, PIC at 4 mg/kg body weight was administered to dams intravenously. AGIQ either at 0.25% or 0.5% was administered through the diet to dams from gestational day 10 until weaning on day 21 post-delivery and, thereafter, to offspring until postnatal day 77 (adult stage). At weaning, the numbers of TBR2+ cells and PCNA+ cells in the subgranular zone and reelin+ cells in the dentate gyrus hilus in offspring of dams treated with PIC only were decreased compared with untreated controls. In contrast, 0.5% AGIQ ameliorated these changes and increased the transcript levels of genes related to signaling of reelin (Reln and Vldlr), growth factors (Bdnf, Cntf, Igf1, and Igf1r), and Wnt/beta-catenin (Wnt5a, Lrp6, Fzd1, and Fzd3). In adults, AGIQ increased the number of FOS+ granule cells at 0.25% and the transcript levels of NMDA-type glutamate receptor genes, Grin2a and Grin2b, at 0.25% and 0.5%, respectively. These results suggest that mid-gestation PIC treatment decreased the abundance of type-2b neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing NPC proliferation in relation with suppression of reelin signaling at weaning. We suggest that AGIQ ameliorated the PIC-induced suppressed neurogenesis by enhancing reelin, growth factor, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling at weaning to rescue NPC proliferation and increased synaptic plasticity by enhancing glutamatergic signaling via NMDA-type receptors after maturation.

AB  - Featured Application There are 3 applications used in this study. (1) Esri's ArcGIS is used for modeling/visualization geo-spatial data and publishing 3D web mapping application; (2) MathWorks's MATLAB is used for borehole data preprocessing and liquefaction hazard assessment; (3) Robert McNeel & Associates's Rhino/Grasshopper is used for developing improved IDW algorithm. Traditional inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation is a process employed to estimate unknown values based on neighborhoods in 2D space. Proposed in this study is an improved IDW interpolation method that uses 3D search neighborhoods for effective interpolation on vertically connected observation data, such as water level, depth, and altitude. Borehole data are the data collected by subsurface boring activities and exhibit heterogeneous spatial distribution as they are densely populated near civil engineering or construction sites. In addition, they are 3D spatial data that show different subsurface characteristics by depth. The subsurface characteristics observed as such are used as core data in spatial modeling in fields, such as geology modeling, estimation of groundwater table distribution, global warming assessment, and seismic liquefaction assessment, among others. Therefore, this study proposed a seismic liquefaction assessment and mapping workflow using an improved IDW application by combining geographic information system (GIS) (ArcGIS (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA)), NURBS-based 3D CAD system (Rhino/Grasshopper (Robert McNeel & Associates, Seattle, WA, USA)), and numerical analysis system (MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA)). The 3D neighborhood search was conducted by the B-rep-based 3D topology analysis, and the mapping was done under the 2.5D environment by combining the voxel layer, DEM, and aerial images. The experiment was performed by collecting data in Songpa-gu, Seoul, which has the highest population density among the OECD countries. The results of the experiment showed between 7 and 105 areas with liquefaction potentials according to the search distance and the method of the approach. Finally, this study improved users' accessibility to interpolation results by producing a 3D web app that used REST API based on OGC I3S Standards. Such an approach can be applied effectively in spatial modeling that uses 3D observation data, and in the future, it can contribute to the expansion of 3D GIS application.

AB  - Nanoscale graphene-based materials (GBMs) enable targeting subcellular structures of the nervous system, a feature crucial for the successful engineering of alternative nanocarriers to deliver drugs and to treat neurodisorders. Among GBMs, graphene oxide (GO) nanoflakes, showing good dispersibility in water solution and being rich of functionalizable oxygen groups, are ideal core structures for carrying biological active molecules to the brain, such as the neuropeptide Y (NPY). In addition, when unconjugated, these nanomaterials have been reported to modulate neuronal function per se. Although some GBM-based nanocarriers have been tested both in vitro and in vivo, a thorough characterization of covalent binding impact on the biological properties of the carried molecule and/or of the nanomaterial is still missing. Here, a copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne- azide cycloaddition strategy was employed to synthesize the GO-NPY complex. By investigating through electrophysiology the impact of these conjugates on the activity of hippocampal neurons, we show that the covalent modification of the nanomaterial, while making GO an inert platform for the vectorized delivery, enhances the duration of NPY pharmacological activity. These findings support the future use of GO for the development of smart platforms for nervous system drug delivery.

AB  - Neurotransmitter receptors are critical for neuronal communication. They often form large multimeric complexes that differ in their subunit composition, distribution, and signaling properties. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), a class of glutamate-gated ion channels with essential roles in brain development and plasticity, co-exist as multiple subtypes, with GluN2A diheteromers, GluN2B diheteromers, and GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers prevailing in the adult forebrain. Studying individual subtypes in native tissues with subunit stoichiometry resolution remains challenging, and the relative abundance and subcellular distribution of these subtypes remain controversial. Here we develop and use the photochemical tool Opto2B for specific and reversible modulation of GluN2B diheteromers, while leaving other receptor subtypes (in particular GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers) unaffected. Using Opto2B, we characterize the differential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR pools during mouse development. Our results suggest that GluN2A receptors predominate in both pools in adult hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, with no preferential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to extrasynaptic currents, challenging the common view that GluN2A and GluN2B NMDARs segregate in synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, respectively. Our study addresses long-standing questions on extrasynaptic NMDARs and paves the way for interrogating NMDAR signaling diversity with unprecedented molecular and spatio-temporal resolution.

AB  - It is well known that overnutrition, overweight, and obesity in children can modulate brain mechanisms of plasticity, monoaminergic systems, and mitochondrial function. The immediate effect of overnutrition during the developmental period has not been thoroughly examined in rats until the present. This study sought to evaluate the impact on adult rats of early life overfeeding and fluoxetine treatment from post-natal day 1 (PND1) to post-natal day 21 (PND21) relative to mitochondrial function, oxidative balance, and expression of specific mono-aminergic genes in the hippocampus. The following were evaluated: mitochondrial function markers, oxidative stress biomarkers, dopamine-and serotonin-related genes, and BDNF mRNA levels. Overfeeding during the lactation period deregulates cellular metabolism and the monoaminergic systems in the hippocampus. Strikingly, serotonin modulation by fluoxetine treatment protected against some of the effects of early overnutrition. We conclude that overfeeding during brain development induce detrimental effects in mitochondria and in the genes that regulate homeostatic status that can be the molecular mechanisms related to neurological diseases.

AB  - Many studies have shown a close association between Nogo-B and inflammation-related diseases. However, uncertainty does exist, regarding Nogo-B function in the pathological progression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was utilized in C57BL/6L mice to mimic ischemic stroke in vivo. Using oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (ODG/R) model in microglia cells (BV-2) to establish cerebral I/R injury in vitro. Various methods, including Nogo-B siRNA transfection, mNSS and the rotarod test, TTC, HE and Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, TUNEL and qRT-PCR were employed to probe into the effect of Nogo-B downregulation on cerebral I/R injury and the potential mechanisms. A small amount of Nogo-B expression (protein and mRNA) was observed in cortex and hippocampus before ischemia, then Nogo-B expression increased significantly on day 1, reaching the maximum on day 3, remaining stable on day 14 after I/R, and decreasing gradually after 21 days, but it still rose significantly compared with that observed preischemia. Nogo-B down-regulation could markedly reduce the neurological score and infarct volume, improve the histopathological changes and neuronal apoptosis, lower the number of CD86(+)/Iba1(+) cells and the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and raise the density of NeuN fluorescence, the number of CD206(+)/Iba1(+) cells, and the level of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-beta in brain of MCAO/R mice. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 in BV-2 cells could obviously decrease the CD86 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, increase CD206 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-10 after OGD/R injury. In addition, the expression of TLR4, p-I kappa B alpha and p-p65 proteins significantly increased in the brain after MCAO/R and BV-2 cells exposed to OGD/R. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 prominently reduced the expression of TLR4, p-I kappa B alpha and p-p65. Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of Nogo-B exerts protective effect on cerebral I/R injury by modulating the microglia polarization through inhibiting TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Nogo-B may be a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Fucoidan has shown better effects on the improvement of acute ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the specific mechanisms by which fucoidan improves UC-related behavioral disorders in aged mice, especially its effect on the gut-brain axis, remain to be further explored. C57BL/6 male mice aged 8 months were gavaged with 400 or 100 mg/kg bw day fucoidan for five consecutive weeks, with UC being induced by ad libitum to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution in the fifth week. The results showed that fucoidan ameliorated UC and accompanying anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors with downregulated expressions of (NOD)-like receptor family and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-1 (Caspase-1) and interlekin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and elevated mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and postsynaptic-density protein 95 (Psd-95) in cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, fucoidan improved the permeability of intestinal barrier and blood-brain barrier and restored the abnormal structure of the gut microbiota with a significantly decreased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota (F/B) and obviously increased abundance of Akkermansia. As a diet-derived bioactive ingredient, fucoidan might be a better alternative for the prevention of UC and accompanying anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a disabling disorder and a major cause of death and disability in the world. Both single and repetitive traumas affect the brain acutely but can also lead to chronic neurodegenerative changes. Clinical studies have shown some dissimilarities in transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) expression patterns following single versus repetitive TBI. We explored the acute cortical post-traumatic changes of TDP-43 using the lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) model of single moderate TBI in adult male mice and investigated the association of TDP-43 with post-traumatic neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity. In the ipsilateral cortices of animals following LFPI, we found changes in the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of TDP-43 and the decreased expression of postsynaptic protein 95 within the first 3 d post-injury. Subacute pathological changes of TDP-43 in the hippocampi of animals following LFPI and in mice exposed to repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) were studied. Changes in the hippocampal TDP-43 expression patterns at 14 d following different brain trauma procedures showed pathological alterations only after single moderate, but not following rmTBI. Hippocampal LFPI-induced TDP-43 pathology was not accompanied by the microglial reaction, contrary to the findings after rmTBI, suggesting that different types of brain trauma may cause diverse pathophysiological changes in the brain, specifically related to the TDP-43 protein as well as to the microglial reaction. Taken together, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological events following brain trauma.

AB  - The impact of Cajal-Retzius cells on the regulation of hippocampal circuits and related behaviors is unresolved. Here, we directly address this issue by impairing the glutamatergic output of Cajal-Retzius cells with the conditional ablation of vGluT2, which is their main vesicular glutamate transporter. Although two distinct conditional knockout lines do not reveal major alterations in hippocampal-layer organization and dendritic length of principal neurons or GABAergic cells, we find parallel deficits in specific hippocampaldependent behaviors and in their putative underlying microcircuits. First, conditional knockout animals show increased innate anxiety and decreased feedforward GABAergic inhibition on dentate gyrus granule cells. Second, we observe impaired spatial memory processing, which is associated with decreased spine density and reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio of postsynaptic responses at the perforant-and entorhino-hippocampal pathways. We conclude that glutamate synaptically released by Cajal-Retzius cells is critical for the regulation of hippocampal microcircuits and specific types of behaviors.

AB  - Tau cleavage plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a widespread neurodegenerative disease whose incidence is expected to increase in the next years. While genetic and familial forms of AD (fAD) occurring early in life represent less than 1%, the sporadic and late-onset ones (sAD) are the most common, with ageing being an important risk factor. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of streptozotocin (STZ)-a compound used in the systemic induction of diabetes due to its ability to damage the pancreatic beta cells and to induce insulin resistance-mimics in rodents several behavioral, molecular and histopathological hallmarks of sAD, including memory/learning disturbance, amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and brain glucose hypometabolism. We have demonstrated that pathological truncation of tau at its N-terminal domain occurs into hippocampi from two well-established transgenic lines of fAD animal models, such as Tg2576 and 3xTg mice, and that it's in vivo neutralization via intravenous (i.v.) administration of the cleavage-specific anti-tau 12A12 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is strongly neuroprotective. Here, we report the therapeutic efficacy of 12A12mAb in STZ-infused mice after 14 days (short-term immunization, STIR) and 21 days (long-term immunization regimen, LTIR) of i.v. delivery. A virtually complete recovery was detected after three weeks of 12A12mAb immunization in both novel object recognition test (NORT) and object place recognition task (OPRT). Consistently, three weeks of this immunization regimen relieved in hippocampi from ICV-STZ mice the AD-like up-regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation, likely due to modulation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3-beta axis and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities. Cerebral oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, synaptic and histological alterations occurring in STZ-infused mice were also strongly attenuated by 12A12mAb delivery. These results further strengthen the causal role of N-terminal tau cleavage in AD pathogenesis and indicate that its specific neutralization by non-invasive administration of 12A12mAb can be a therapeutic option for both fAD and sAD patients, as well as for those showing type 2 diabetes as a comorbidity.

AB  - Background Social isolation (SI) early in life produces behavioral and cognitive abnormalities. On the contrary, environmental enrichment (EE) offers beneficial effects on brain plasticity and development. This study was designed to examine how EE affects memory functions, anxiety level, and the expression levels of memory/anxiety-related genes such as NR2A, NR2B, BDNF, and cFos in the hippocampus of socially isolated rats. Materials and Methods Wistar albino male rats (n = 40) were separated into the five groups: Standard cage (SC), SI, EE, SI + SC, and SI + EE group. For each group, eight rats were housed, either grouped or isolated, in a standard or 3-week EE, respectively. Morris water maze test (MWMT) was used for measuring the learning and memory function. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) were used for the evaluation of anxiety behavior. Blood corticosterone level was evaluated by the ELISA method. The expression levels of genes were measured by the RT-PCR method. Results Results showed that EE increased memory performance in the SI group (p < 0.05). SI caused anxiety while EE improved anxiety behavior (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in the OF test. Corticosterone levels did not change between groups. BDNF expression level was downregulated in EE and SI + SC compared with the SC group (respectively; p = 0.012; p = 0.011). NR2A, NR2B, and cFos expression levels did not change between groups significantly. Conclusions SI impaired memory performance while EE has beneficial effects on memory in socially isolated rats. EE alone was insufficient to cause alterations in the memory performance. The therapeutic effects of EE became strengthened while applied together with stress protocol. Together with improving the effectiveness of memory function, EE has the potential to decrease anxiety behavior. EE seemed to be the reason for decreasing in BDNF.

AB  - Chronic stress is a core risk factor for developing a myriad of neurological disorders, including major depression. The chronicity of such stress can lead to adaptive responses or, on the contrary, to psychological maladaptation. The hippocampus is one of the most affected brain regions displaying functional changes in chronic stress. Egr1, a transcription factor involved in synaptic plasticity, is a key molecule regulating hippocampal function, but its role in stress-induced sequels has been poorly addressed. Emotional and cognitive symptoms were induced in mice by using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol. We used inducible double-mutant Egr1-CreERT2 x R26RCE mice to map the formation of Egr1-dependent activated cells. Results show that short- (2 days) or long-term (28 days) stress protocols in mice induce activation or deactivation, respectively, of hippocampal CA1 neural ensembles in an Egr1-activity-dependent fashion, together with an associated dendritic spine pathology. In-depth characterization of these neural ensembles revealed a deep-to-superficial switch in terms of Egr1-dependent activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons. To specifically manipulate deep and superficial pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, we then used Chrna7-Cre (to express Cre in deep neurons) and Calb1-Cre mice (to express Cre in superficial neurons). We found that specific manipulation of superficial but not deep pyramidal neurons of the CA1 resulted in the amelioration of depressive-like behaviors and the restoration of cognitive impairments induced by chronic stress. In summary, Egr1 might be a core molecule driving the activation/deactivation of hippocampal neuronal subpopulations underlying stress-induced alterations involving emotional and cognitive sequels.

AB  - Eslicarbazepine (ESL) is a new antiseizure medication used to treat focal epilepsy. It is not entirely clear how ESL affects the magnitude and gating kinetics of membrane ionic currents, although a few reports have demonstrated its ability to suppress voltage-gated Na+ currents (INa). With the aid of patch clamp technology, docking prediction, and simulation modeling, this study was conducted to investigate the potential modifications through which ESL may induce on ionic currents, including INa, M-type K+ current (IK(M)), and erg-mediated K+ current (IK (erg)), in hippocampal neurons. ESL distinctly inhibited transient INa (INa(T)) and late INa (INa(L)), demonstrating greater potency against INa(L). ESL shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of INa(T) leftward without altering its steepness or activation curve. Additionally, ESL attenuated the tefluthrin-induced enhancement of voltage-dependent hysteresis (Hys(V)) of persistent INa (INa(P)). ESL increased IK(M) in a concentration-dependent manner, shifting its steady-state activation curve toward more depolarized potentials and enhancing Hys(V) strength. It also increased the activity and mean open time of IK(M) without affecting single-channel conductance. Minimal changes were observed in the magnitude of IK(erg). Predicted docking analysis revealed that ESL binds to the hNaV1.7 channel via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Simulation modeling using hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated that ESL's inhibition of INa and stimulation of IK(M), along with changes in their Hys(V), modulate neuronal action potential firing. Overall, these findings highlight ESL's dual effects on INa and IK(M), revealing mechanisms that likely contribute to its efficacy in treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Cutaneous wound healing is a biological process that occurs upon skin injury and involves different mechanisms to repair tissue damage. Improper healing or prolonged curation period of wound lesions may induce unpleasant complications. Cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) is an upcoming medical therapeutic option for skin infection and wound treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms of CAMP-mediated canine wound healing are not well characterized. Wound-healing activity was examined to elucidate the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of CAMP. Canine keratinocytes (CPEKs) were treated using CAMP, and their wound-healing activities were evaluated. The molecular mechanisms of that effect were examined, based on RNA-Seq analysis data, and verified using immunoblotting and polymerase chain reaction. It was found that the CAMP-treated cells exhibited a significant increase in cell migration evaluated by scratch assay in human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and canine keratinocytes (CPEK). Additionally, CAMP-treated CPEK cells showed a significant positive effect on cell invasion. The RNA-Seq data revealed that CAMP alters different genes and pathways in CPEK cells. Gene expression involved in the cell cycle, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and wound healing was upregulated in CAMP-treated cells compared with gas-activated media used as a control. The Hippo pathway was also analyzed, and the protein and mRNA levels of YAP were significantly increased in CAMP-treated cells. CAMP-treated CPEK cells indicated the downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, Snail, and Slug at transcription and translation levels, contributing to a favorable effect on cell migration. Our findings suggested that CAMP treatment provided beneficial effects on the curative wound process through the induction of genes involved in wound healing, promotion of EMT, and increase in the molecular targets in the Hippo signaling pathway.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, with about 40% of patients not re-sponding to pharmacological treatment. Increased cellular loss is linked to disease severity and pathological phenotypes such as heightened seizure propensity. While the hippocampus is the target of therapeutic inter-ventions, the impact of the disease at the cellular level remains unclear. Here, we show that hippocampal granule cells change with disease progression as measured in living, resected hippocampal tissue excised from patients with epilepsy. We show that granule cells increase excitability and shorten response latency while also enlarging in cellular volume and spine density. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing combined with simulations ascribes the changes to three conductances: BK, Cav2.2, and Kir2.1. In a network model, we show that these changes related to disease progression bring the circuit into a more excitable state, while reversing them produces a less excitable, "early-disease-like"state.

AB  - N-type calcium channels (Ca(V)2.2) are predominantly localized in presynaptic terminals, and are particularly important for pain transmission in the spinal cord. Furthermore, they have multiple isoforms, conferred by alternatively spliced or cassette exons, which are differentially expressed. Here, we have examined alternatively spliced exon47 variants that encode a long or short C-terminus in human Ca(V)2.2. In the Ensembl database, all short exon47-containing transcripts were associated with the absence of exon18a, therefore, we also examined the effect of inclusion or absence of exon18a, combinatorially with the exon47 splice variants. We found that long exon47, only in the additional presence of exon18a, results in Ca(V)2.2 currents that have a 3.6-fold greater maximum conductance than the other three combinations. In contrast, cell-surface expression of Ca(V)2.2 in both tsA-201 cells and hippocampal neurons is increased similar to 4-fold by long exon47, relative to short exon47, in either the presence or the absence of exon18a. This surprising discrepancy between trafficking and function indicates that cell-surface expression is enhanced by long exon47, independently of exon18a. However, in the presence of long exon47, exon18a mediates an additional permissive effect on Ca(V)2.2 gating. We also investigated the single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon47 that has been linked to schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, which we found is only non-synonymous in the short exon47 C-terminal isoform, resulting in two minor alleles. This study highlights the importance of investigating the combinatorial effects of exon inclusion, rather than each in isolation, in order to increase our understanding of calcium channel function.

AB  - The transcription factor FOXG1 serves pleiotropic functions in brain development ranging from the regulation of precursor proliferation to the control of cortical circuit formation. Loss-of-function mutations and duplications of FOXG1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans illustrating the importance of FOXG1 dosage for brain development. Aberrant FOXG1 dosage has been found to disrupt the balanced activity of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We report that FOXG1 is expressed in the main adult neurogenic niches in mice, i.e. the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subependymal zone/olfactory bulb system, where neurogenesis of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons persists into adulthood. These niches displayed differential vulnerability to increased FOXG1 dosage: high FOXG1 levels severely compromised survival and glutamatergic dentate granule neuron fate acquisition in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, but left neurogenesis of GABAergic neurons in the subependymal zone/olfactory bulb system unaffected. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed a significantly higher expression of the apoptosis-linked nuclear receptor Nr4a1 in FOXG1-overexpressing hippocampal neural precursors. Strikingly, pharmacological interference with NR4A1 function rescued FOXG1-dependent death of hippocampal progenitors. Our results reveal differential vulnerability of neuronal subtypes to increased FOXG1 dosage and suggest that activity of a FOXG1/NR4A1 axis contributes to such subtype-specific response.

AB  - Changes in cholesterol content of neuronal membranes occur during development and brain aging. Little is known about whether synaptic activity regulates cholesterol levels in neuronal membranes and whether these changes affect neuronal development and function. We generated transgenic flies that express the cholesterol-binding D4H domain of perfringolysin O toxin and found increased levels of cholesterol in presynaptic terminals of Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions following increased synaptic activity. Reduced cholesterol impaired synaptic growth and largely prevented activity-dependent synaptic growth. Presynaptic knockdown of adenylyl cyclase phenocopied the impaired synaptic growth caused by reducing cholesterol. Furthermore, the effects of knocking down adenylyl cyclase and reducing cholesterol were not additive, suggesting that they function in the same pathway. Increasing cAMP levels using a dunce mutant with reduced phosphodiesterase activity failed to rescue this impaired synaptic growth, suggesting that cholesterol functions downstream of cAMP. We used a protein kinase A (PKA) sensor to show that reducing cholesterol levels reduced presynaptic PKA activity. Collectively, our results demonstrate that enhanced synaptic activity increased cholesterol levels in presynaptic terminals and that these changes likely activate the cAMP-PKA pathway during activity-dependent growth.

AB  - Simple Summary The authors first present eight animal remains showing pathological changes, found in two Middle Neolithic assemblages in northern and western Hungary. Among the disorders identified in this set of animal remains, linear enamel hypoplasia was recognized for the first time in the Hungarian Neolithic. These Middle Neolithic finds were then reviewed within the context of palaeopathological data from the better-represented Early and Late Neolithic and, subsequent, (Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age) prehistoric periods. Along with the increasing number of cases observed, patterns have begun to emerge in the taxonomic distribution of pathological lesions. The apparent great variability of the materials is, thus, discussed in terms of assemblage size, inter-observer bias and, ultimately, changes in prehistoric animal-keeping practices. Eight newly identified pathological animal remains identified in two Middle Neolithic assemblages (ca 5330-4940 calBC) in northern and western Hungary were placed within the broader context of relevant prehistoric finds. The aim was to understand the underrepresented Middle Neolithic finds in light of the better-known cases from other prehistoric periods. The newly reported cases include arthritic and inflammatory lesions, as well as dental disorders, such as linear enamel hypoplasia, recognized for the first time in the Hungarian Neolithic. Identifications were based on bone macromorphology. When large samples are available, the frequencies of pathological bone specimens reflect the taxonomic composition. Along with the increasing number of cases, longevity related to exploitation for secondary products also became manifest. Therefore, the effects of assemblage size, disease classification and differences between authors (related to training and the time of publication) need to be considered before pathological lesions can be interpreted in terms of diachronic changes in animal husbandry.

AB  - Neurological disorders and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are among the leading causes of death and disability. The pupillary light reflex (PLR) is an emerging diagnostic tool for concussion in humans. We compared PLR obtained with a commercially available pupillometer in the 4 week old piglet model of the adolescent brain subject to rapid nonimpact head rotation (RNR), and in human adolescents with and without sports-related concussion (SRC). The 95% PLR reference ranges (RR, for maximum and minimum pupil diameter, latency, and average and peak constriction velocities) were established in healthy piglets (N = 13), and response reliability was validated in nine additional healthy piglets. PLR assessments were obtained in female piglets allocated to anesthetized sham (N = 10), single (sRNR, N = 13), and repeated (rRNR, N = 14) sagittal low-velocity RNR at pre-injury, as well as days 1, 4, and 7 post injury, and evaluated against RRs. In parallel, we established human PLR RRs in healthy adolescents (both sexes, N = 167) and compared healthy PLR to values obtained <28 days from a SRC (N = 177). In piglets, maximum and minimum diameter deficits were greater in rRNR than sRNR. Alterations peaked on day 1 post sRNR and rRNR, and remained altered at day 4 and 7. In SRC adolescents, the proportion of adolescents within the RR was significantly lower for maximum pupil diameter only (85.8%). We show that PLR deficits may persist in humans and piglets after low-velocity head rotations. Differences in timing of assessment after injury, developmental response to injury, and the number and magnitude of impacts may contribute to the differences observed between species. We conclude that PLR is a feasible, quantifiable involuntary physiological metric of neurological dysfunction in pigs, as well as humans. Healthy PLR porcine and human reference ranges established can be used for neurofunctional assessments after TBI or hypoxic exposures (e.g., stroke, apnea, or cardiac arrest).

AB  - The cable-driven hyper-redundant manipulator (CDHM), distinguished by its high flexibility and adjustable stiffness, is extensively utilized in confined and obstacle-rich environments such as aerospace and nuclear facilities. This paper introduces a novel CDHM inspired by the trunk of elephants, which changes the arm structure from cylindrical to conical. This alteration diminishes the arm's self-weight, reduces the moment arm of gravity, decreases the volume of the end joint, narrows the stroke of the driving cables, and boosts the maximum joint speed of the manipulator. Additionally, this study examines the impact of the manipulator's taper on its overall performance from both dynamic and kinematic perspectives. Finally, three prototype manipulators with varying tapers are confirmed, and tests are conducted on each manipulator's motion performance and cable tension. By comparing experimental data, the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the rationality of the conical structure are confirmed. The results suggest that the proposed new configuration offers certain advantages in terms of cable stroke, joint speed and maximum driving force.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SCZ), a multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder, is treated with inefficient antipsychotics and linked to poor treatment outcomes. This study, therefore, investigated the combined administration of prodigiosin (PDG) and selenium (Na2SeO3) against SCZ induced by amphetamine (AMPH) in rats. Animals were allocated into four groups corresponding to their respective 7-day treatments: control, AMPH (2 mg/kg), PDG (300 mg/kg) + Na2SeO3 (2 mg/kg), and AMPH + PDG + Na2SeO3. The model group exhibited biochemical, molecular, and histopathological changes similar to those of the SCZ group. Contrastingly, co-administration of PDG and Na2SeO3 significantly increased the time for social interaction and decreased AChE and dopamine. It also downregulated the gene expression of NMDAR1 and restored neurotrophin (BDNF and NGF) levels. Further, PDG combined with Na2SeO3 improved the antioxidant defence of the hippocampus by boosting the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, and GR. These findings were accompanied by an increased GSH, alongside decreased MDA and NO levels. Furthermore, schizophrenic rats having received PDG and Na2SeO3 displayed markedly lower IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels compared to the model group. Interestingly, remarkable declines in the Bax (pro-apoptotic) and increases in Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) levels were observed in the SCZ group that received PDG and Na2SeO3. The hippocampal histological examination confirmed these changes. Collectively, these findings show that the co-administration of PDG and Na2SeO3 may have a promising therapeutic effect for SCZ. This is mediated by mechanisms related to the modulation of cholinergic, dopaminergic, and glutaric neurotransmission and neurotrophic factors, alongside the suppression of oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis machinery.

AB  - Context: Dysregulation of energy metabolism is a fundamental contributor to all the hallmarks of brain aging. Melatonin, primarily secreted by the pineal gland, is closely associated with molecules and signaling pathways that sense and affect energy metabolism. However, the impact of melatonin on age-related mRNA expression in the hippocampus of mice at different ages remains poorly understood. Objective: The present study conducted transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus in melatonin-exposed mice at 9, 13, and 25 months of age. Differential gene analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, GSEA analysis, as well as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), were performed on the transcriptome data. Results: Our study demonstrated that melatonin exerts a more pronounced regulatory effect on the transcriptome of 25-month old mice, and significantly enhances the expression level of TTR in the hippocampus of 13-month old mice. WGCNA analysis revealed that melatonin primarily modulates the energy metabolism of mouse hippocampus through the mTOR signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of melatonin's age-dependent regulation of the mice hippocampus.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The cytokine interleukin-12 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (Stat4), and consumption of a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFD-C) and Stat4 activity are associated with inflammation, atherosclerosis, and a diabetic metabolic phenotype. In studies of in vitro hippocampal slices from control Stat4fl/flLdlr-/- mice fed a HFD-C diabetogenic diet, we show that Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses exhibited larger reductions in activity-dependent, long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, compared to mice fed a standard diet. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity shifts produced by HFD-C diet were reduced in Stat4 Delta LysMLdlr-/- mice compared to Stat4fl/flLdlr-/- controls. Stat4 Delta LysMLdlr-/- mice, which lack Stat4 under control of the LysMCre promoter, were resistant to HFD-C induced impairments in LTP. In contrast, Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in Stat4 Delta LysMLdlr-/- mice fed the HFD-C diet showed larger LTP than control Stat4fl/flLdlr-/- mice. Expression of a number of neuroinflammatory and synaptic plasticity genes was reduced by HFD-C diet in control mice, and less affected by HFD-C diet in Stat4 Delta LysMLdlr-/- mice. These data suggest that suppression of Stat4 activation may protect against effects of Western diet on cognition, type 2 diabetes, and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with neuroinflammation.
   Mice with myeloid-specific loss of the transcription factor, Stat4, exhibit stronger long-term synaptic plasticity than control animals when given a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, suggesting that suppressing Stat4 activation may be a useful strategy for protecting against the inflammatory effects of a Western diet.

AB  - The antitumor effects of dichloroacetate (DCA) have been widely explored, however, its roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression are still unclear. In the current work, we found that DCA had little effects on HCC cell viability, but could attenuate the stemness of HCC cells, which is evident by decreasing the tumor sphere-formation ability, ALDH activity and the expression of stemness critical regulators. Mechanistic studies based on RNA-sequencing data showed that DCA activated the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we indicated that DCA promoted the nucleus-cytoplasm translocation of YAP, but not TAZ, another critical executor of Hippo pathway. Moreover, suppressing of Hippo pathway using XMU-MP-1, an inhibitor of Hippo pathway, partially abrogated DCA-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cell stemness. This work suggests that DCA might be a potential inhibitor for HCC progression.

AB  - Hippo signaling, an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade involved in organ size control, plays key roles in various tissue developmental processes, but its role in craniofacial development remains poorly understood. Using the transgenic Wnt1-Cre2 driver, we inactivated the Hippo signaling components Lats1 and Lats2 in the cranial neuroepithelium of mouse embryos and found that the double conditional knockout (DCKO) of Lats1/2 resulted in neural tube and craniofacial defects. Lats1/2 DCKO mutant embryos had microcephaly with delayed and defective neural tube closure. Furthermore, neuroepithelial cell shape and architecture were disrupted within the cranial neural tube in Lats1/2 DCKO mutants. RNA sequencing of embryonic neural tubes revealed increased TGFB signaling in Lats1/2 DCKO mutants. Moreover, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were upregulated in the cranial neural tube. Inactivation of Hippo signaling downstream effectors, Yap and Taz, suppressed neuroepithelial defects, aberrant EMT and TGFB upregulation in Lats1/2 DCKO embryos, indicating that LATS1/2 function via YAP and TAZ. Our findings reveal important roles for Hippo signaling in modulating TGFB signaling during neural crest EMT.

AB  - Background: Prenatal stress (PS) can induce depression in offspring, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Objective: The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism that underlies PS-induced depressive-like behavior in offspring.Methods: A prenatal restraint stress procedure was developed in which pregnant rats at GD14 to GD20 were placed head-first into a well-ventilated bottle three times each day and for 45 min each time. Depressive-like behavior in the male offspring was examined using the sucrose preference test (SPT) and the forced swim test (FST). The level of glutamate and the expression levels of GluN2A, p-CaMKII and myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus of PS-susceptible (PS-S) offspring were also evaluated. To clarify the mechanism by which PS leads to depression in offspring, the effects of excessive corticosterone were also investigated using an in vitro "injured neuronal" model.Results: The glutamate level in the hippocampus of PS-S male offspring was significantly elevated compared to controls. The expression levels of GluN2A and p-CaMKII were also altered. In addition, the optical density of MBP staining and the expression levels of MBP mRNA and MBP protein were decreased, demonstrating impaired myelinization in the hippocampus. Treatment of PS-S offspring with the GluN2A receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 resulted in antidepressant-like effects in the FST, as well as rescue of the MBP and p-CaMKII abnormalities.Conclusions: These findings indicate that GluN2A is a promising target in the development of pharmacotherapies for PS-induced depression.

AB  - Background: Pulsed high-power microwave (HPM) has many applications and is constantly being researched to expand its uses in the future. As the number of applications grows, the biological effects and safety level of pulsed HPM become a serious issue, requiring further research.Objective: The brain is regarded as the most vulnerable organ to radiation, raising concerns about determining an acceptable level of exposure. The effect of nanosecond pulses and the mechanisms underlying HPM on the brain has not been studied. For the first time, we observed the effect of pulsed 3.5 GHz HPM on brain normal astrocytes and cancer U87 MG cells, as well as the likely mechanisms involved.Methods: To generate 3.5 GHz HPM, an axial virtual cathode oscillator was constructed on pulsed power generator "Chundoong ". The cells were directly exposed to HPM (10, 25, 40, and 60) pulses (1 mJ/pulse), with each pulse delivered after 1 min of charging time to evaluate the dose dependent effects.Results: A strong electric field (similar to 23 kV/cm) of HPM irradiation primarily causes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altering cell viability, mitochondrial activity, and cell death rates in U87 and astrocytes at certain dosages. The ROS generation in response to HPM exposure was primarily responsible for DNA damage and p53 activation. The hazardous dosage of 60 pulses is acknowledged as having damaging effects on brain normal cells. Interestingly, the particular 25 pulses exhibited therapeutic effects on U87 cells via p53, Bax, and Caspase-3 activation.Conclusion: HPM pulses induced apoptosis-related events such as ROS burst and increased oxidative DNA damage at higher dosages in normal cells and specific 25 pulses in cancer U87. These findings are useful to understand the physiological mechanisms driving HPM-induced cell death, as well as the safety threshold range for HPM exposure on normal cells and therapeutic effects on cancer U87. As HPM technology advances, we believe this study is timely and will benefit humanity and future research.

AB  - Primates and other animals must detect novel objects. However, the neuronal mechanisms of novelty detection remain unclear. Prominent theories propose that visual object novelty is either derived from the computation of recency (how long ago a stimulus was experienced) or is a form of sensory surprise (stimulus unpredictability). Here, we use high-channel electrophysiology in primates to show that in many primate prefrontal, temporal, and subcortical brain areas, object novelty detection is intertwined with the computations of recency and sensory surprise. Also, distinct circuits could be engaged by expected versus unexpected sensory surprise. Finally, we studied neuronal novelty-to-familiarity transformations during learning across many days. We found a diversity of timescales in neurons' learning rates and between-session forgetting rates, both within and across brain areas, that are well suited to support flexible behavior and learning in response to novelty. Our findings show that novelty sensitivity arises on multiple timescales across single neurons due to diverse but related computations of sensory surprise and recency and shed light on the computational underpinnings of novelty detection in the primate brain.

AB  - Simple Summary A wide variety of coronaviruses are enzootic in bats worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is suspected to have originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae spp.) in Asia, though the spillover event is unknown. SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in wild North American bats at the time of this submission, although it has been detected in other native wildlife, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Further interspecies transmission may establish new viral reservoirs and mutations which may negatively impact wildlife, livestock, and human health. The potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into North American bat populations is of interest to wildlife managers due to recent declines of several species, including little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), which have suffered large population collapse due to white-nose syndrome (WNS). We analyzed saliva samples from 235 individual little brown bats from a total of eight maternity colonies throughout the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States. No bat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, indicating the virus is either not present or that it persists in undetectable levels in little brown bat populations in this region. The potential introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, into North American bat populations is of interest to wildlife managers due to recent disease-mediated declines of several species. Populations of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have collapsed due to white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the introduction and spread of the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Throughout much of the United States and southern Canada, large colonies of the species routinely established diurnal roosts in anthropogenic structures, thereby creating the potential for direct human contact and cross-species disease transmission. Given recent declines and the potential for further disease impacts, we collected oral swabs from eight little brown bat maternity colonies to assess the presence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR analysis. Little brown bat colonies in Maryland (n = 1), New Hampshire (n = 1), New Jersey (n = 2), New York (n = 1), Rhode Island (n = 2), and Virginia (n = 1) were taken during May-August, 2022. From 235 assayed individuals, no bat tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicate that little brown bats may not contract SARS-CoV-2 or that the virus persists at undetectable levels in populations of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast during summer months. Nonetheless, continued monitoring and future work addressing other seasons may still be warranted to conclusively determine infection status.

AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the dysregulated response of the host to an infection, and treatments are limited. Recently, a novel selenium source, selenium-enriched Cardamine violifolia (SEC) has attracted much attention due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but little is known about its role in the treatment of sepsis. Here, we found that SEC alleviated LPS-induced intestinal damage, as indicated by improved intestinal morphology, and increased disaccharidase activity and tight junction protein expression. Moreover, SEC ameliorated the LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as indicated by decreased IL-6 level in the plasma and jejunum. Moreover, SEC improved intestinal antioxidant functions by regulating oxidative stress indicators and selenoproteins. In vitro, TNF-alpha-challenged IPEC-1 cells were examined and showed that selenium-enriched peptides, which are the main functional components extracted from Cardamine violifolia (CSP), increased cell viability, decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and improved cell barrier function. Mechanistically, SEC ameliorated LPS/TNF-alpha-induced perturbations in mitochondrial dynamics in the jejunum and IPEC-1 cells. Moreover, CSP-mediated cell barrier function is primarily dependent on the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 but not MFN1. Taken together, these results indicate that SEC mitigates sepsis-induced intestinal injury, which is associated with modulating mitochondrial fusion.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex pathology causing a plethora of non-motor symptoms besides classical motor impairments, including cognitive disturbances. Recent studies in the PD human brain have reported microgliosis in limbic and neocortical structures, suggesting a role for neuroinflammation in the development of cognitive decline. Yet, the mechanism underlying the cognitive pathology is under investigated, mainly for the lack of a valid preclinical neuropathological model reproducing the disease's motor and non-motor aspects. Here, we show that the bilateral intracerebral infusion of pre-formed human alpha synuclein oligomers (H-alpha SynOs) within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) offers a valid model for studying the cognitive symptoms of PD, which adds to the classical motor aspects previously described in the same model. Indeed, H-alpha SynOs-infused rats displayed memory deficits in the two-trial recognition task in a Y maze and the novel object recognition (NOR) test performed three months after the oligomer infusion. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of H-alpha SynOs-infused rats the in vivo electrophysiological activity was altered and the expression of the neuron-specific immediate early gene (IEG) Npas4 (Neuronal PAS domain protein 4) and the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 were decreased. The histological analysis of the brain of cognitively impaired rats showed a neuroinflammatory response in cognition-related regions such as the ACC and discrete subareas of the hippocampus, in the absence of any evident neuronal loss, supporting a role of neuroinflammation in cognitive decline. We found an increased GFAP reactivity and the acquisition of a proinflammatory phenotype by microglia, as indicated by the increased levels of microglial Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as compared to vehicle-infused rats. Moreover, diffused deposits of phospho-alpha synuclein (p-alpha Syn) and Lewy neurite-like aggregates were found in the SNpc and striatum, suggesting the spreading of toxic protein within anatomically interconnected areas. Altogether, we present a neuropathological rat model of PD that is relevant for the study of cognitive dysfunction featuring the disease. The intranigral infusion of toxic oligomeric species of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) induced spreading and neuroinflammation in distant cognition-relevant regions, which may drive the altered neuronal activity underlying cognitive deficits.

AB  - In this study, we investigated autophagy, glial activation status, and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) signaling in the brains of mice after 5 days of sleep fragmentation (SF). Three different brain regions including the striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex were selected for examination based on roles in sleep regulation and sensitivity to sleep disruption. For autophagy, we monitored the levels of various autophagic induction markers including beclin1, LC3II, and p62 as well as the levels of lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 and 2 (LAMP1/2) and the transcription factor EB (TFEB) which are critical for lysosome function and autophagy maturation stage. For the status of microglia and astrocytes, we determined the levels of Iba1 and GFAP in these brain regions. We also measured the levels of CRF and its cognate receptors 1 and 2 (CRFR1/2). Our results showed that 5 days of SF dysregulated autophagy in the striatum and hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex. Additionally, 5 days of SF activated microglia in the striatum but not in the hippocampus or frontal cortex. In the striatum, CRFR2 but not CRFR1 was significantly increased in SF-experienced mice. CRF did not alter its mRNA levels in any of the three brain regions assessed. Our findings revealed that autophagy processes are sensitive to short-term SF in a region-specific manner and suggest that autophagy dysregulation may be a primary initiator for brain changes and functional impairments in the context of sleep disturbances and disorders.</p>

AB  - Simple Summary: Piglet castration causes pain and stress to the animal. Although desperately needed, there are complexities developing safe and effective methods of pain alleviation applicable for on-farm use. Topical anaesthesia, instilled to the wound during surgery, is a newly evolving on-farm method to mitigate castration pain. In the current study, we investigated the use of Tri-Solfen(R) (Animal Ethics Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia), a topical local anaesthetic and antiseptic formulation, instilled to the wound during the procedure, to alleviate subsequent castration-related pain experienced in piglets. We performed a large, blind, multi-centred trial comparing pain in piglets castrated with or without Tri-Solfen(R). Piglets treated with wound instillation of Tri-Solfen(R), 30 s prior to subsequent castration, showed significantly lower pain-induced motor and vocal responses during the procedure. Acute post-operative pain-related behaviours, evident in piglets in the first 30 min following castration, were also significantly reduced in treated piglets compared with untreated piglets. Using this method, Tri-Solfen(R) provides an effective on-farm method to mitigate acute castration-related pain in young piglets.
   Piglet castration results in acute pain and stress to the animal. There is a critical need for effective on-farm methods of pain mitigation. Local anaesthesia using Tri-Solfen(R) (Animal Ethics Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia), a topical local anaesthetic and antiseptic formulation instilled to the wound during surgery, is a newly evolving on-farm method to mitigate castration pain. To investigate the efficacy of Tri-Solfen(R), instilled to the wound during the procedure, to alleviate subsequent castration-related pain in neonatal piglets, we performed a large, negatively controlled, randomised field trial in two commercial pig farms in Europe. Piglets (173) were enrolled and randomised to undergo castration with or without Tri-Solfen(R), instilled to the wound immediately following skin incision. A 30 s wait period was then observed prior to completing castration. Efficacy was investigated by measuring pain-induced motor and vocal responses during the subsequent procedure and post-operative pain-related behaviour in treated versus untreated piglets. There was a significant reduction in nociceptive motor and vocal response during castration and in the post-operative pain-related behaviour response in Tri-Solfen(R)-treated compared to untreated piglets, in the first 30 min following castration. Although not addressing pain of skin incision, Tri-Solfen(R) is effective to mitigate subsequent acute castration-related pain in piglets under commercial production conditions.

AB  - Background: This study evaluated the effect of spray-dried blood plasma (SDP) as a feed additive for the replacement of antibiotics in swine production. The treatments were used as strategic pulses of either antibiotics or SDP in the feed of swine during the growth and termination phases. The experimental design was conducted by 4 dietary treatments with a total of 1456 swine selected just after leaving the nursery and evaluated for 122 days until slaughter. Results: The feed with the addition of the standard medication protocol (antibiotics) and without the inclusion of SDP had the highest feed intake (289.73 +/- 3.04 kg) and reached a feed conversion of 2.57 +/- 0.02 kg feed consumed per kg weight gained. Weight gain during the period of 0-122 days for the treatment with three pulses of SDP with (114.12 +/- 0.64 kg) and without antibiotics (114.26 +/- 1.01 kg) was higher than the control treatment (111.46 +/- 1.10 kg, without antibiotics and SDP). Furthermore, the antibiotic-based treatment associated with SDP showed a 7.76% increase in weight gain when compared with the control group. Furthermore, there was a nonsignificant difference in the mortality of animals and in the index for pneumonia and ulcer score. Conclusion: The application of SDP as a feed additive in swine at the growth and termination phases, combined with antibiotics, favored feed intake and weight gain and could be a promising alternative to upgrade zootechnical parameters in swine production.

AB  - Background Generalist herbivores such as the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae thrive on a wide variety of plants and can rapidly adapt to novel hosts. What traits enable polyphagous herbivores to cope with the diversity of secondary metabolites in their variable plant diet is unclear. Genome sequencing of T. urticae revealed the presence of 17 genes that code for secreted proteins with strong homology to "intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases (DOGs)" from bacteria and fungi, and phylogenetic analyses show that they have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from fungi. In bacteria and fungi, DOGs have been well characterized and cleave aromatic rings in catecholic compounds between adjacent hydroxyl groups. Such compounds are found in high amounts in solanaceous plants like tomato, where they protect against herbivory. To better understand the role of this gene family in spider mites, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to functionally characterize the various T. urticae DOG genes. Results We confirmed that DOG genes were present in the T. urticae genome and performed a phylogenetic reconstruction using transcriptomic and genomic data to advance our understanding of the evolutionary history of spider mite DOG genes. We found that DOG expression differed between mites from different plant hosts and was induced in response to jasmonic acid defense signaling. In consonance with a presumed role in detoxification, expression was localized in the mite's gut region. Silencing selected DOGs expression by dsRNA injection reduced the mites' survival rate on tomato, further supporting a role in mitigating the plant defense response. Recombinant purified DOGs displayed a broad substrate promiscuity, cleaving a surprisingly wide array of aromatic plant metabolites, greatly exceeding the metabolic capacity of previously characterized microbial DOGs. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the laterally acquired spider mite DOGs function as detoxification enzymes in the gut, disarming plant metabolites before they reach toxic levels. We provide experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that this proliferated gene family in T. urticae is causally linked to its ability to feed on an extremely wide range of host plants.

AB  - Hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)), one of the most detrimental pollutants, has been ubiquitously present in the environment and causes serious toxicity to humans, such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, and cardiotoxicity. However, Cr (VI)-induced neurotoxicity in primary neuron level has not been well explored yet. Herein, potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) was employed to examine the neurotoxicity of Cr (VI) in rat primary hippocampal neurons. MTT test was used to examine the neural viability. Mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed by the JC-1 probe and Mito-Tracker probe. DCFH-DA and Mito-SOX Red were utilized to evaluate the oxidative status. Bcl-2 family and MAPKs expression were investigated using Western blotting. The results demonstrated that Cr (VI) treatment dose- and time-dependently inhibited neural viability. Mechanism investigation found that Cr (VI) treatment causes mitochondrial dysfunction by affecting Bcl-2 family expression. Moreover, Cr (VI) treatment also induces intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, and MAPKs activation in neurons. However, inhibition of ROS by glutathione (GSH) effectually balanced Bcl-2 family expression, attenuated DNA damage and the MAPKs activation, and eventually improved neural viability neurons. Collectively, these above results above suggest that Cr (VI) causes significant neurotoxicity by triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS-mediated oxidative damage and MAKPs activation.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: In the ancient book "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic," Panax ginseng CA Mey was believed to have multiple benefits, including calming nerves, improving cognitive function, and promoting longevity. Ginsenosides are the main active ingredients of ginseng. Ginsenoside RK3 (RK3), a rare ginsenoside extracted from ginseng, displays strong pharmacological potential. However, its effect on neurogenesis remains insufficiently investigated.Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate whether RK3 improves learning and memory by promoting neurogenesis, and to explore the mechanism of RK3 action.Materials and methods: The therapeutic effect of RK3 on learning and memory was determined by the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition test (NORT). The pathogenesis and protective effect of RK3 on primary neurons and animal models were detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Protein expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway was detected by western blotting.Results: Our results showed that RK3 treatment significantly improved cognitive function in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice and C57BL/6 (C57) mice. RK3 promotes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the mouse hip-pocampus. In vitro, RK3 prevents A beta-induced injury in primary cultured neurons and promotes the proliferation of PC12 as well as the expression of synapse-associated proteins. Mechanically, the positve role of RK3 on neurogenesis was combined with the activation of CREB/BDNF pathway. Inhibition of CREB/BDNF pathway attenuated the effect of RK3.Conclusion: In conclusion, this study demonstrated that RK3 promotes learning and cognition in APP/PS1 and C57 mice by promoting neurogenesis and synaptogenesis through the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. Therefore, RK3 is expected to be further developed into a potential drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

AB  - Background: Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. is a medicinal plant that has been widely used for thousands of years in China, and the ethyl acetate extract (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. Extract, COE) from its stem was reported to exert antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects in various preclinical studies. However, the anti-non-small-cell lung cancer activity of COE and its potential mechanism are not yet fully understood.
   Purpose: To investigate the antitumor effects of COE on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and explore its molecular mechanism from the perspective of Hippo signaling, YAP nuclear translocation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
   Methods: The effects of COE on proliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, stemness, and senescence in NSCLC cell lines were determined by CCK-8, clone formation, flow cytometry, and beta-galactosidase staining assays. The ef-fects of COE on Hippo signaling were investigated by Western blotting. The intracellular expression and dis-tribution of YAP were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. DCFH-DA probe combined with flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular total ROS levels in NSCLC cells after COE treatment. Xenograft tumor model was established, and the animal living image system was employed to analyze the effects of COE on the Hippo-YAP signaling in vivo.
   Result: COE significantly inhibited NSCLC activity in vitro and in vivo, mainly by proliferation inhibition, cycle arrest, apoptosis promotion, senescence promotion, and stemness downregulation. COE strongly activated Hippo signaling and inhibited YAP expression and nuclear retention. Activation of Hippo signaling induced by COE was associated with ROS-mediated phosphorylation of MOB1.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that COE inhibited NSCLC through activating Hippo signaling and sup-pressing YAP nuclear translocation, in which ROS may play a role in the phosphorylation of the MOB1 protein.

AB  - Synthetic cannabinoid use raises concerns about its neuroinflammatory effects, including molecular adaptations of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the brain. This study investigates the pharmacological effects of 14-day repeated intraperitoneal administration, as well as 14-day administration followed by a 7-day withdrawal period of two synthetic cannabinoids: WIN55,212-2 and HU-210. The study assessed gene expression and protein markers related to the ECS, gliosis, and inflammation in two brain regions critical for cognitive processes and memory-key components of addiction pathways-the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus of rats. Our findings showed that repeated WIN55,212-2 administration induced adaptations in the ECS and reduced IBA1, a glial protein marker, along with inflammatory responses likely mediated through CB2 activity. Notably, regional differences emerged in the hippocampus, where repeated administration of WIN55,212-2 and HU-210 increased IBA1 and inflammatory markers, effects unrelated to CB2 activity. Withdrawal from WIN55,212-2 in the PFC, as well as from both compounds in the hippocampus, decreased IBA1 levels. This was associated with altered protein expression of cannabinoid-synthesizing and degrading enzymes, favoring acylethanolamide synthesis. These findings highlight region-specific effects of synthetic cannabinoids on cannabinoid signaling, gliosis, and inflammation. Further research is needed to elucidate the long-term neurobiological consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use and withdrawal.

AB  - This study proposes an innovative biorefinery concept, integrating microbial pretreatment (MBP), wet storage (WS), and mushroom cultivation to transform herbaceous biomass into high-value products, including biofuel pellets, Turkey tail mushrooms, and ethanol. This environmentally friendly approach reduces pretreatment times, economically delignifies lignocellulosic structures, and improves the durability and enzymatic digestibility of densified pellets. The biorefinery model includes five pellet-mushroom production facilities (Pellet Plant A) and one ethanol plant (Ethanol Plant A), strategically located approximately 140 km south of Saskatoon (50 degrees 53 ' 16.1 '' N, 106 degrees 42 ' 15.5 '' W) in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, to minimize pellet transport distances. Pellet Plant A, with a capacity of 250 000 t per year, incurs unit production costs (UPC) of US$201-242 per t, primarily driven by the cost of fungal liquid inoculum preparation. These costs exceed those of conventional steam-explosion pellet plants, such as natural gas-fired (US$181 per t) and biomass-fired systems (US$166 per t). Consequently, ethanol produced at Ethanol Plant A, using these pellets, costs US$1.32 per L, compared to US$0.89 per L for centralized MBP straw bales-to-ethanol plants and US$0.57 per L for conventional dilute acid pretreatment plants. The economic viability of this biorefinery concept requires a minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) of US$1.03 per L and at least 50% farmer participation to achieve a positive net present value (NPV) without mushroom credits. However, integrating revenue from Turkey tail mushroom production significantly enhances financial outcomes, increasing Pellet Plant A's NPV by up to US$10 billion. This enables a reduction in pellet selling prices, lowering the MESP to US$0.77 per L with a pellet purchasing cost of US$100 per t. These findings demonstrate the economic feasibility and sustainability of this innovative biorefinery model, emphasizing the potential of combining microbial pretreatment technologies with diversified revenue streams.

AB  - Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a vital enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of six-carbon volatiles in plants. However, little is known about its functions in tea plants. Here, we identified two ADH genes (CsADH1 and CsADH2). An in vitro protein expression assay showed that both CsADH1 and CsADH2 proteins can catalyze the reduction of (Z)-3-hexenal into (Z)-3-hexenol. Subcellular localization revealed that both CsADH1 and CsADH2 proteins were predominantly localized in the nucleus and cytosol. CsADH1 had high transcripts in young stems in autumn, while CsADH2 showed extremely high expression levels in stems and roots. The expression of CsADH2 was mainly downregulated under ABA treatment, while CsADH1 and CsADH2 transcripts were significantly lower under MeJA treatment at 12 and 24 h. Under cold treatment, CsADH1 transcripts first decreased and then increased, while CsADH2 demonstrated an almost opposite expression pattern. Notably, CsADH2 was significantly upregulated under simulated Ectropis obliqua invasion. Gene suppression by antisense oligonucleotides (AsODNs) demonstrated that AsODN_ADH2 treatment significantly reduced CsADH2 transcripts and the abundance of (Z)-3-hexenol products. The results indicate that the two CsADH genes may play an important role in response to (a)biotic stresses and in the process of (Z)-3-hexenol biosynthesis.

AB  - Microcephaly is the more severe brain malformation because of Zika virus infection. Increased vulnerability of neural stem and progenitor cells to Zika infection during prenatal neurodevelopment impairs the complete formation of cortical layers. Normal development of cerebellum is also affected. However, the follow-up of apparently healthy children born to Zika exposed mothers during pregnancy has revealed other neurological sequelae. This suggests Zika infection susceptibility remains in nervous tissue after neurogenesis end, when differentiated neuronal populations predominate. The neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) is an exclusive marker of postmitotic neurons. Changes in NeuN expression are associated with neuronal degeneration. We have evaluated immunohistochemical expression of NeuN protein in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of normal and Zika-infected neonatal Balb/c mice. The highest NeuN immunoreactivity was found mainly in neurons of all cortical layers, pyramidal layer of hippocampus, granular layer of dentate gyrus and in internal granular layer of cerebellum. Viral infection caused marked loss of NeuN immunostaining in all these brain areas. This suggests neurodegenerative effects of Zika virus infection during postmitotic neuron maturation and contribute to interpretation of neuropathogenic mechanisms of Zika.

AB  - Spatial learning and memory flexibility are known to require long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively, on a cellular basis. We previously showed that cyclin Y (CCNY), a synapse-remodeling cyclin, is a novel actin-binding protein and an inhibitory regulator of functional and structural LTP in vitro. In this study, we report that Ccny knockout (KO) mice exhibit enhanced LTP and weak LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. In accordance with enhanced LTP, Ccny KO mice showed improved spatial learning and memory. However, although previous studies reported that normal LTD is necessary for memory flexibility, Ccny KO mice intriguingly showed improved memory flexibility, suggesting that weak LTD could exert memory flexibility when combined with enhanced LTP. At the molecular level, CCNY modulated spatial learning and memory flexibility by distinctively affecting the cofilin-actin signaling pathway in the hippocampus. Specifically, CCNY inhibited cofilin activation by original learning, but reversed such inhibition by reversal learning. Furthermore, viral-mediated overexpression of a phosphomimetic cofilin-S3E in hippocampal CA1 regions enhanced LTP, weakened LTD, and improved spatial learning and memory flexibility, thus mirroring the phenotype of Ccny KO mice. In contrast, the overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable cofilin-S3A in hippocampal CA1 regions of Ccny KO mice reversed the synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, and memory flexibility phenotypes observed in Ccny KO mice. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that LTP and LTD cooperatively regulate memory flexibility. Moreover, CCNY suppresses LTP while facilitating LTD in the hippocampus and negatively regulates spatial learning and memory flexibility through the control of cofilin-actin signaling, proposing CCNY as a learning regulator modulating both memorizing and forgetting processes.

AB  - Calcineurin B homologous protein 3 (CHP3) is an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein involved in regulation of cancerogenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, and neuronal development through interactions with sodium/proton exchangers (NHEs) and signalling proteins. While the importance of Ca2+ binding and myristoylation for CHP3 function has been recognized, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Ca2+ binding and myristoylation independently affect the conformation and functions of human CHP3. Ca2+ binding increased local flexibility and hydrophobicity of CHP3 indicative of an open conformation. The Ca2+-bound CHP3 exhibited a higher affinity for NHE1 and associated stronger with lipid membranes compared to the Mg2+-bound CHP3, which adopted a closed conformation. Myristoylation enhanced the local flexibility of CHP3 and decreased its affinity to NHE1 independently of the bound ion, but did not affect its binding to lipid membranes. The data exclude the proposed Ca2+-myristoyl switch for CHP3. Instead, a Ca2+-independent exposure of the myristoyl moiety is induced by binding of the target peptide to CHP3 enhancing its association to lipid membranes. We name this novel regulatory mechanism 'target-myristoyl switch'. Collectively, the interplay of Ca2+ binding, myristoylation, and target binding allows for a context-specific regulation of CHP3 functions.

AB  - Prolonged maternal care is vital to the well-being of many long-lived mammals.(1) The premature loss of maternal care, i.e., orphaning, can reduce offspring survival even after weaning is complete.(2-5) However, ecologists have not explicitly assessed how orphaning impacts population growth. We examined the impact of orphaning on population growth in a free-ranging African elephant population, using 19 years of individual based demographic monitoring data. We compared orphan and nonorphan survival, performed a sensitivity analysis to understand how population growth responds to the probability of being orphaned and orphan survival, and investigated how sensitivity to these orphan parameters changed with level of poaching. Orphans were found to have lower survival compared to nonorphaned age mates, and population growth rate was negatively correlated with orphaning probability and positively correlated with orphan survival. This demonstrates that, in addition to its direct effects, adult elephant death indirectly decreases population growth through orphaning. Population growth rate's sensitivity to orphan survival increased for the analysis parameterized using only data from years of more poaching, indicating orphan survival is more important for population growth as orphaning increases. We conclude that orphaning substantively decreases population growth for elephants and should not be overlooked when quantifying the impacts of poaching. Moreover, we conclude that population models characterizing systems with extensive parental care benefit from explicitly incorporating orphan stages and encourage research into quantifying effects of orphaning in other social mammals of conservation concern.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicine known for open the orifices and transform phlegm, is used in the treatment of brain disorders. The essential oil of Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma (EOAT) has demonstrated neuroprotective properties clinically. However, research into its effect on Olfactory Dysfunction (OD) remains limited. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of sniffing EOAT on improving olfactory function in a 3-Methylindole (3-MI)-induced OD mouse model. Materials and methods: The research involved intraperitoneal injection of 3-MI to induce OD in mice. The effects of EOAT treatment were assessed on olfactory function, olfactory bulb (OB) pathology, inflammatory factors, olfactory marker protein (OMP), microglial activation, and related pathway proteins and mRNA. Results: Based on the GC-MS analysis results of EOAT and network pharmacology studies, we predicted 18 targets associated with the treatment of OD. SLC6A3, MAOB, DRD1, and PTGS2 were identified as the core targets of EOAT against OD. Molecular docking and KEGG enrichment results indicated that EOAT may exert antiinflammatory effects by acting on the core target PTGS2, with its anti-inflammatory mechanism possibly related to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Subsequent animal experiments confirmed that inhalation of EOAT significantly increased the body weight of OD model mice, shortened the foraging time, enhanced the expression of OMP in OB, reduced damage to the OB cells, and improved olfactory function. Meanwhile, EOAT significantly alleviated the inflammatory response in OB of OD model mice, inhibited the activation of microglial cells, and suppressed the expression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway proteins and mRNA. Conclusion: EOAT inhalation could improve olfactory function in 3-MI-induced OD model. The underlying mechanism may be related to the modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study investigated the antioxidant synergism activity of combining three plant-based antioxidants, olive, bay laurel, and rosemary leaves into a single dietary supplement for laying hens. These plants are rich in phenolic compounds, which help prevent oxidative damage, a process that can harm cells and tissues. The researchers compared the in vitro antioxidant effects of the individual leaves, and in binary (in pairs), and in a ternary combination of all three leaves (termed LPM). Among the individual leaves, olive leaves showed higher antioxidant capability; the ternary LPM displayed synergistic activity. In an in vivo study on hens, the LPM feeding supplement improved oxidative markers, increased vitamin E levels in the blood, supported better liver and immune function, and improved intestinal health by enhancing nutrient absorption structures. The findings suggest that the mixture of olive, rosemary and laurel leaves have a synergistic effect as antioxidant benefits, potentially leading to healthier poultry and possibly enhancing the quality of products for consumers. Phenolic antioxidant intake is encouraged to prevent oxidative damage, and antioxidant synergy is considered an advantage in adding polyphenols from varied plants. This study investigated the antioxidant and synergistic interactions among olive leaf (OL), bay laurel (BL), and rosemary (RL) leaf powder mixture (LPM: OL + BL + RL), using in vitro chemical tests [TPC, ORAC, TEAC-ABTS, FRAP; combination index (CI)], and in vivo validation on blood oxidative status, metabolic profile, and intestinal histomorphology in laying hens. The in vitro study indicated a whole higher antioxidant capacity for the LPM than respective single/double-leave combinations. The LPM CI value (IC50, 0.60) indicated a synergistic effect compared to the binary combinations. Thus, the LPM was validated in vivo through dietary supplementation on sixty Lohmann Brown hens (30 weeks old), reared in an indoor-outdoor rearing system divided. The hens were allocated into two experimental groups (n. 30): basal control diet group; and diet supplemented group with 6 g/kg feed of LPM) containing OL, BL, and RL (respectively, at 65.7%:18.9%:15.4%), for 60 days. The LPM improved (p < 0.05) the oxidative status (TAS, FRAP; ROMs, TBARs) and vitamin E level, metabolic and immunological profiles, and it induced region-specific changes in the morphology and carbohydrate composition of mucins along intestinal tracts of the animals. These findings could provide a valuable strategy for identifying synergistic combinations in functional feed formulations for laying hens.

AB  - Visfatin/NAMPT creates a hormonal link between energy metabolism and female reproduction. A recent study documented visfatin expression in the ovary and its action on follicular cells; however, the expression of visfatin in luteal cells is still unknown. The aim of this study, there-fore, was to investigate the transcript and protein expression of visfatin as well as its immuno-localization in the corpus luteum (CL) and to examine the involvement of extracellular signal -regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in the regulation of visfatin level in response to LH, insulin, pro-gesterone (P4), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). Corpora lutea were harvested from gilts on days 2-3, 10-12 and 14-16 of the estrous cycle and on days 10-11, 12-13, 15-16 and 27-28 of pregnancy. The current study demonstrated that visfatin expression depends on hormonal status related to the phase of the estrous cycle or early pregnancy. Visfatin was immunolocalized to the cytoplasm of small and large luteal cells. Moreover, visfatin protein abundance was increased by P4, and decreased by both prostaglandins, while LH and insulin have modulatory effects, depending on the phase of the cycle. Interestingly, LH, P4 and PGE2 effects were abolished in response to the inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase. Thus, this study demonstrated that expression of visfatin in the porcine CL is determined by the endocrine status related to the estrous cycle and early pregnancy and by the action of LH, insulin, P4 and prostaglandins via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - The age-related decrease in skeletal muscle mass and function, mostly known as sarcopenia, increases the risk of mobility impairments, chronic disease and early mortality. Physical activity and targeted dietary approaches are the most effective intervention to prevent or limit sarcopenia. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could alleviate some aspects of age-related diseases. We investigated the effect of a chronic intake of a diet containing a high content of omega-3 PUFA in old mice exposed to a normocaloric or an obesogenic diet. Female C57BL/6J mice received a low-fat or a high-fat diet containing 5 or 6%, respectively, of camelina oil (comprising 27% omega-3 PUFA) for 18 weeks and were compared to animals receiving the similar diets containing high-oleic sunflower oil instead. Circulating parameters, calorimetry and physical performances were evaluated as well as muscle lipid content and molecular adaptations. Consumption of camelina oil increased omega-3 PUFA content in biological membranes, as well as circulating levels of anti-inflammatory oxylipin mediators. High-fat diets induced changes in body composition but these effects were not affected by the intake of camelina oil. However, camelina oil consumption increased motor coordination in the low-fat condition. Some lipidomic adaptations were observed in relation to oil intake. Variations in plasma levels of glycerol, free fatty acids and muscle gene expression suggested improved lipid homeostasis in groups receiving camelina oil. In conclusion, the consumption of an energy-balanced diet with a high content of omega-3 PUFA provided by camelina oil could provide benefits on muscle health.

AB  - We previously reported that apoptosis is responsible for cognitive impairment in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). Acute administration of an apoptosis inhibitor (Z-vad) effectively reduced brain inflammation in rats with cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the beneficial effects of Z-vad on cognitive function, brain inflammation, mitochondrial function, cell death pathways, and neurogenesis in MI rats have not been investigated. Male rats were divided into sham or MI groups (left anterior descending coronary ligation). A successful MI was determined by a reduction of ejection fraction <50 %. Then, MI rats were allocated to receive vehicle, enalapril (10 mg/kg, a positive control), and Z-vad (1 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Cardiac function, cognitive function, and molecular analysis were investigated. MI rats exhibited cardiac dysfunction, cognitive impairment, blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, dendritic spine loss, which were accompanied by an upregulation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Chronic treatment with Z-vad attenuated cardiac dysfunction following MI to the same extent as enalapril. Z-vad successfully improved cognitive function and restored dendritic spine density in MI rats through a reduction of systemic oxidative stress and brain mitochondrial dysfunction similar to enalapril. Moreover, Z-vad provided greater efficacy than enalapril in enhancing mitophagy, neurogenesis, synaptic proteins and reducing apoptosis in hippocampus of MI rats. Nevertheless, neither Z-vad nor enalapril increased BBB tight junction protein. In conclusion, treatment with an apoptosis inhibitor reduced cognitive impairment in MI rats via reducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and restoring dendritic spine density, together with enhancing mitophagy and neurogenesis.

AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent regulatory cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation. The molecular mechanism of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CAMK2B) affecting cerebral ischemic injury through autophagy-dependent ferroptosis is still unclear. Here, we aimed to study the regulatory effect of CAMK2B on autophagy-dependent ferroptosis and its effect on cerebral ischemic injury. We found that CAMK2B was significantly upregulated in oxygen and glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. CAMK2B knockdown inhibited OGD/R-induced autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. In addition, CAMK2B was co-localized with amphiregulin (AREG) in PC12 cells, and overexpression of AREG reversed the effect of CAMK2B knockdown on OGD/R-induced autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Further molecular mechanism studies showed that AREG enhanced the transcriptional activation of embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 1 (ELAVL1) through Jun Proto-Oncogene (c-Jun), thereby inducing autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, CAMK2B was significantly upregulated in the ipsilateral penumbra neurons of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) mice, and the level of autophagy-dependent ferroptosis was increased in the brain tissue of I/R mice. Knockdown of CAMK2B alleviated neuronal damage by inhibiting autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in the brain tissue of model mice. This study suggests that CAMK2B plays a key role in regulating neuronal autophagy-dependent ferroptosis, and CAMK2B may be a potential target for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditionally, Ocimum basilicum L. leaves (OB) are recommended for various brain disorders.
   Aim of the study: Scientific evidence highlights the cognition improvement capacity of Ocimum basilicum L. leave extract (OBE), however, the compound(s) responsible for this effect and the associated mechanism was not reported. The present study was, thus, designed to isolate and identify the compound responsible for memory improvement effects of OB and to delineate the associated mechanism of action.
   Materials and methods: In-vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory (Ellman method) and antioxidant (DPPH scavenging) assays guided fractionation was employed to isolate the bioactive compounds from OBE. The isolated compounds were characterised using spectroscopic techniques (FTIR, NMR and MS). In-silico and in-vivo [mouse model of scopolamine (SCOP) induced amnesia] investigations were used to substantiate the memory improvement effects of isolated compounds and to understand their mechanism of action.
   Results: AChE and DPPH assays guided fractionation of OBE lead to isolation of two pure compounds namely, 5,7dihydroxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxyflavone (S1) and 3-hydroxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxyflavone (S2). Both S1 and S2 mitigated the cognitive impairment due to SCOP in mice by reducing brain AChE activity, TBARS, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and caspase-3 concentrations and elevating reduced glutathione and IL-10 levels; together with amelioration of brain hippocampus histopathological aberration (H and E staining). Moreover, the molecular docking of S1 and S2 at the active pockets of AChE and caspase-3 has shown good interactions with vital amino acid residues.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that trimethoxy flavones are responsible for the memory improvement effect of OBE due to their anticholinergic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. These maybe developed as valuable alternatives for management of cognitive disorders.

AB  - Five new compounds (1, 2, 7, 12, and 16), along with fifteen known ones, were isolated from Ajuga lupulina Maxim. Their structures were revealed by analysing spectroscopic data (MS, NMR), and experimental and calculated ECD spectra was used to deduce the absolute configuration. Compound 16, with eight carbon atoms, was firstly isolated from the nature. All the isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on RSL3-induced ferroptosis in HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. Among them, the abietane-type diterpenoids (7-11) significantly inhibited ferroptosis with EC50 values of 0.83 mu M, 2.05 mu M, 0.96 mu M, 1.47 mu M, and 1.19 mu M, respectively.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is high in the elderly population and seriously affects the quality of life. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the key neurotrophic proteins, and activation of BDNF-TrkB is considered an effective strategy to improve cognitive dysfunction during aging. In this study, administration of polygonatum sibiricum (PS) for 5 months effectively ameliorates the cognitive function, improving the Nissl body state in cortex and hippocampus in aging rats. In addition, PS can improve the synaptic structure and increase the number of synapses. Furthermore, PS reverses the reduction of synaptic plasticity-related proteins postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin during aging and up-regulates the expression of BDNF-TrkB. In conclusion, PS improves cognitive dysfunction and enhances synaptic plasticity in naturally aged rats by regulating the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. PS has the potential to be developed as a novel and promising functional health food for the elderly. Practical applications Polygonatum sibiricum (PS) is a traditional Chinese medicine, which has been included in the homologous plant of medicine and food. PS has been widely used to treat lung diseases, diabetes and antiaging in clinical. Studies have confirmed that PS can accelerate the repair and regeneration of damaged neurons, reverse the changes in synaptic structure, and improve the ability of learning and memory. Our study confirmed that PS significantly improved the cognitive function in aging rats. PS has great potential to be developed as a functional food for improving neurological function and anti-aging.

AB  - The assessment of morphology and digital image opacity may provide valuable information on the present embryo quality. Time-lapse imaging has been employed in research to establish a means of monitoring the dynamic nature of preimplantation embryo development. The aim of present study was to use time-lapse imaging for assessing various prospective morphometric and phototextural markers of the developmental potential of in vitro-derived ovine embryos. Oocytes were obtained by scarification of ovaries from nine Polish Longwool ewes. After in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) of oocytes with fresh ram semen, the development of embryos to the blastocyst stage was monitored and evaluated using Primo Vision time-lapse imaging technology. Commercially available Image-Pro (R) Plus software was used to measure zona pellucida thickness, embryo diameter, total area of the perivitelline space, cellular grey-scale pixel intensity and cellular pixel heterogeneity. Statistical assessment of all attributes was done at various time points during embryo development (i.e., presumptive zygote stage: t(0); first cleavage detected at t(2) or t(3); and second cleavage detected at t(4) or t(6)). Out of thirty-seven zygotes analyzed in this study, five did not divide, 26 arrested before and six developed to the blastocyst stage. Our present results indicate that most parameters analyzed did not differ among embryos varying in their developmental fate except for the perivitelline space area that was greater (P<0.05) for non-dividing zygotes than future blastocysts at the presumptive zygote stage (4040 +/- 1850 vs. 857 +/- 262 mu m(2), respectively; means +/- SEM). Consequently, the measurement of perivitelline space at t(0) can potentially be used to prognosticate developmental potential of in vitro-produced ovine embryos albeit further confirmational studies are needed.

AB  - There are general inhibitory effects of exo-cannabinoids on dopamine-mediated behaviors. Many studies suggested the interaction between cannabinoid receptors and dopamine receptors in the brain that affect cognition behaviors. In this paper, we investigate the effects of marijuana on 6-OHDA-induced cognitive impairments and the expression of dopamine and cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus of male rats. 42 rats were divided into six groups. 6-hydroxy dopamine (6-OHDA) was administrated into the substantia nigra. Marijuana (60 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered 28 days, one week after the 6-OHDA injection. Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition tests were performed. The hippocampal expression levels of cannabinoid receptors and D1 and D2 dopamine receptors evaluate by real-time PCR. The results showed marijuana improved the spatial learning and memory disorders caused by 6-OHDA in the MVM task and novel object recognition test. Additionally, the level of both D1 and D2 mRNA was decreased in 6-OHDA-treated animals and marijuana consumption only increased the hippocampal level of D1 mRNA. Moreover, the level of hippocampal CB1 mRNA in 6-OHDA- treated rats was higher than in control rats. However, the hippocampal level of CB2 mRNA was decreased in 6-OHDA- treated rats. Marijuana consumption caused a significant decrease in CB1 mRNA level and an increase in CB2 mRNA level in 6-OHDA + marijuana group. Therefore, marijuana may be helpful for learning & memory disorders, D1, and D2 dopamine receptors, and cannabinoid receptor alteration in patients with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Human communication displays a striking contrast between the diversity of languages and the universality of the principles underlying their use in conversation. Despite the importance of this interactional base, it is not obvious that it heavily imprints the structure of languages. However, a deep-time perspective suggests that early hominin communication was gestural, in line with all the other Hominidae. This gestural phase of early language development seems to have left its traces in the way in which spatial concepts, implemented in the hippocampus, provide organizing principles at the heart of grammar.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Face2face: advancing the science of social interaction'.

AB  - The discovery of psychobiotics has improved the therapeutic choices available for clinical mental disorders and shows promise for regulating mental health in people by combining the properties of food and medicine. A Pediococcus acidilactici strain CCFM6432 was previously isolated and its mood-regulating effect was investigated in this study. Viable bacteria were given to chronically stressed mice for five weeks, and then the behavioral, neurobiological, and gut microbial changes were determined. CCFM6432 significantly reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors, mitigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, and reversed the abnormal expression of hippocampal phosphorylated CREB and the c-Fos protein. In particular, CCFM6432 improved the gut microbial composition by inhibiting the over-proliferated pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Escherichia-shigella) and promoting beneficial bacteria growth (e.g., Bifidobacterium). Lactic acid, rather than bacteriocin, was further confirmed as the key compound that determined the antimicrobial activity of CCFM6432. Collectively, these results first proved the psychobiotic potential of the Pediococcus acidilactici strain. Ingestion of CCFM6432, or fermented food containing it, may facilitate mental health management in daily life, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Ochratoxin A (OTA), as a mycotoxin, can contaminate a variety of feeds and foods. Existing studies have shown that the main toxicity of OTA to organisms is nephrotoxicity, but the toxic mechanism to other organs is still worthy of further study. Whether OTA causes intestinal damage through the necroptosis pathway mediated by RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL remains to be elucidated. Astaxanthin (AST), a feed additive with strong antioxidant properties, was used as an antidote to evaluate the alleviation effect on OTA-induced intestinal injury and the underlying mechanism in this research. Chickens are the most sensitive animals to OTA except pigs. Therefore, 70 white-feathered chickens (n = 15) and Chicken Small Intestinal Epithelial Cells (CSIECs) were used as experimental subjects. Experimental models were established by single or combined exposure of OTA (1.0 mg/kg on chickens for 21 d; 2 mu M on CSIEC for 24 h) and AST (100 mg/kg on chickens for 21 d; 40 mu M on CSIEC for 24 h). In this study, AST significantly ameliorated OTA-induced intestinal damage by restoring the expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin-1, Claudin-1, and ZO-1), attenuating severe histopathological alterations, mitigating the inflammatory response (elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced anti-inflammatory mediators), and suppressing necroptosis through downregulation of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL expression. Combined evidence from animal experiments and cell culture experiments demonstrated that AST alleviated the necroptosis and inflammation caused by OTA in CSIECs and the intestine of chickens through the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling pathway, thereby reducing the damage caused by OTA.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health issue that affects at least 10 million people per year. Neuronal cell death and brain injury after TBI, including apoptosis, inflammation, and excitotoxicity, have led to detrimental effects in TBI. 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG), a water-soluble compound extracted from the Chinese herb Polygonum multiflorum, has been shown to exert various biological functions. However, the effects of THSG on TBI is still poorly understood. THSG reduced L-glutamate-induced DNA fragmentation and protected glial and neuronal cell death after L-glutamate stimulation. Our results also showed that TBI caused significant behavioral deficits in the performance of beam walking, mNSS, and Morris water maze tasks in a mouse model. Importantly, daily administration of THSG (60 mg/kg/day) after TBI for 21 days attenuated the injury severity score, promoted motor coordination, and improved cognitive performance post-TBI. Moreover, administration of THSG also dramatically decreased the brain lesion volume. THSG reduced TBI-induced neuronal apoptosis in the brain cortex 24 h after TBI. Furthermore, THSG increased the number of immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that THSG exerts neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and glial and neuronal cell death. The present study also demonstrated that THSG effectively protects against TBI-associated motor and cognitive impairment, at least in part, by inhibiting TBI-induced apoptosis and promoting neurogenesis.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is involved in the development of depression and may induce depression-like behaviors by affecting metabolism through interactions with circadian rhythms. As the hub of metabolism, mitochondria are regulated by various types of metabolism and release signals that regulate cellular functions. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampus of IL-33-overexpressing mice to provide new ideas to explore the pathogenesis of inflammation-mediated depression at the transcriptional level. Male C57BL/6J mice and IL-33-overexpressing mice were subjected to behavioral tests. The hippocampus was extracted during the light or dark period, and differential gene expression analysis was conducted using RNA sequencing. Differential gene enrichment analysis was performed, as well as multilayered analysis of mitochondrial transcriptional rhythms by integrating the regulatory networks and Mito 3.0 database. The results were further verified using RT-qPCR. IL-33-overexpressing mice exhibited depressive behaviors associated with rhythmic disorders and shortened circadian cycles. Differential KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis showed that the top 20 pathways with the lowest p-values included mood-related, immune-related, and circadian rhythm-related pathways. Differential gene GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment analysis showed that 20 of the top 30 pathways with the lowest p-values were related to metabolism. Transcriptome data from IL-33-overexpressing mice showed that the mitochondrial-encoded subunit of the oxidative respiratory complex showed predominantly increased expression during the light period. Metabolic disorders and disrupted mitochondrial transcriptional rhythm were also observed. Weighted gene correlation network analysis showed that the circadian cycle is associated with depression-like behavior disorders. Network analysis showed that circadian-related genes were enriched in mitochondrial pathways related to metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Multilayer analysis of mitochondrial transcriptional rhythms using the mitochondrial database Mito 3.0 revealed that mitochondrial dynamics and surveillance pathways were the most enriched. The depressive behavior in mice caused by long-term IL-33 stimulation may be related to changes in the transcriptional rhythms of metabolism-related genes and the interaction between mitochondria and clock genes. This suggests that mitochondrial transcriptional rhythms are central to the pathogenesis of microinflammation-induced depression, further supporting the potential of mitochondria as a target for the prevention and treatment of depression.

AB  - The CYP2D enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily play an important role in psychopharmacology, since they are engaged in the metabolism of psychotropic drugs and endogenous neuroactive substrates, which mediate brain neurotransmission and the therapeutic action of those drugs. The aim of this work was to study the effect of short- and long-term treatment with the selective antagonist of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, the compound CP-101,606, which possesses antidepressant properties, on CYP2D expression and activity in the liver and brain of male rats. The presented work shows time-, organ- and brain-structure-dependent effects of 5-day and 3-week treatment with CP-101,606 on CYP2D. Five-day treatment with CP-101,606 increased the activity and protein level of CYP2D in the hippocampus. That effect was maintained after the 3-week treatment and was accompanied by enhancement in the CYP2D activity/protein level in the cortex and cerebellum. In contrast, a 3-week treatment with CP-101,606 diminished the CYP2D activity/protein level in the hypothalamus and striatum. In the liver, CP-101,606 decreased CYP2D activity, but not the protein or mRNA level, after 5-day or 3-week treatment. When added in vitro to liver microsomes, CP-101,606 diminished the CYP2D activity during prolonged incubation. While in the brain, the observed decrease in the CYP2D activity after short- and long-term treatment with CP-101,606 seems to be a consequence of the drug effect on enzyme regulation. In the liver, the direct inhibitory effect of reactive metabolites formed from CP-101,606 on the CYP2D activity may be considered. Since CYP2Ds are engaged in the metabolism of endogenous neuroactive substances, it can be assumed that apart from antagonizing the NMDA receptor, CP-101,606 may modify its own pharmacological effect by affecting brain cytochrome P450. On the other hand, an inhibition of the activity of liver CYP2D may slow down the metabolism of co-administered substrates and lead to pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.

AB  - BackgroundIntrauterine adhesion (IUA) is a common cause of clinically refractory infertility, and there exists significant heterogeneity in the treatment outcomes among IUA patients with the similar severity after transcervical resection of adhesion(TCRA). The underlying mechanism of different treatment outcomes occur remains elusive, and the precise contribution of various cell subtypes in this process remains uncertain.ResultsHere, we performed single-cell transcriptome sequencing on 10 human endometrial samples to establish a single-cell atlas differences between patients who responded to estrogen therapy and those who did not. The results showed increased infiltration of immune cells such as monocyte macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells in patients who did not respond to estrogen therapy. Our findings indicate that distinct fibroblast subsets are implicated in the modulation of the Wnt, Hippo, and Hedgehog signaling pathways, as evidenced by functional enrichment analyses. This may have implications for the therapeutic efficacy in patients with IUA. Furthermore, we delineated the markers and transcriptional status of different macrophage subsets and identified two cell clusters, CXCL10high and CCL4L2high macrophage subsets, which are intimately associated with inflammation and fibrosis. The state of fibrosis and inflammatory response in human endometrial tissues with disparate treatment outcomes is revealed, and providing evidence to clarify the underlying determinants of sensitivity to estrogen therapy.ConclusionsWe described the transcriptional status of different cell subtypes in the two groups of patients, providing new ideas for exploring the molecular mechanism of the difference in the effectiveness of estrogen therapy in patients, and providing theoretical basis for providing precise and individualized treatment plans for IUA patients.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Jin-Si-Wei (JSW), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, have cognitive enhancing effect and delay the memory decline in an animal model of AD, which has been reported. However, the therapeutic mechanism of JSW in the treatment of AD remains unclear.Aim of the study: This study aimed to verify the pharmacodynamics of JSW in the treatment of AD, and to explore its potential mechanism based on network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation both in vitro and in vivo.Materials and methods: In this study, the underlying mechanism of JSW against AD was investigated by the integration of network pharmacology. Then, the core pathways and biological process of JSW were verified by experiment, including behavioral test and pathological and biochemical assays with 6-month-old APPswe/PS1 Delta E9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice in vivo and verified with A beta 1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. At last, molecular docking was used to show the binding activity of each active ingredient to the core genes of JSW treatment in AD.Results: A Drug-Ingredient-Target network was established, which included 363 ingredients and 116 targets related to the JSW treatment of AD. The main metabolic pathway of JSW treatment for AD is neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, and biological processes are mainly involved in A beta metabolic process. In vivo experiments, compared with APP/PS1 mice, the cognitive and memory ability of mice was significantly improved after JSW administration. In brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice, JSW could increase the contents of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), enkephalinase (NEP) and Acetyl choline (ACh), and decrease the contents of A beta 1-42, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), decrease the vitality of cholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Besides, JSW could increase alpha-secretase expression and decrease beta/gamma-secretase expression, and improve the number and morphology of synapses in CA1 region of the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro experiments, Drug-Containing Serum (JSW-serum) has a neuroprotective effect by reducing the apoptosis on A beta 1-42-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking results showed that 2-Isopropyl-8-methylphenanthrene-3,4-dione had strong binding activity with PTGS2, which maybe a potential ingredient for the treatment of AD.Conclusions: JSW improves AD in APP/PS1 mice, and this therapeutic effect may be achieved in part by altering the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway.

AB  - Little is currently known about the effect and mechanism of combined paternal environmental cadmium (Cd) and high-fat diet (HFD) on offspring cognitive ability. Here, using in vivo model, we found that combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD caused hippocampal neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits in offspring. MeRIP-seq revealed m6A level of Rhoa, a regulatory gene of cellular senescence, was significantly increased in combined environmental Cd and HFD-treated paternal sperm. Interestingly, combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD markedly enhanced Rhoa mRNA, its m6A and reader protein IGF2BP1 in offspring hippocampus. STM2457, the inhibitor of m6A modification, markedly mitigated paternal exposure-caused the elevation of hippocampal Rhoa m6A, neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits in offspring. In vitro experiments, Rhoa siR significantly reversed mouse hippocampal neuronal senescence. Igf2bp1 siR obviously reduced the level and stability of Rhoa in aging mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. In conclusion, combined paternal environmental Cd and HFD induce offspring hippocampal neuronal senescence and cognitive deficits by promoting IGF2BP1-mediated Rhoa sta-bilization in offspring hippocampus via elevating Rhoa m6A in paternal sperm.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (ASD), commonly known as Dang Gui, is a popular Chinese herb that has long been used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the effects of ASD in chronic cerebral ischemia and its underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to determine the effects of the ASD extract on hippocampal neuronal survival at 28 d after transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and to investigate the precise mechanisms underlying the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related signaling pathway's involvement in hippocampal neurogenesis. Materials and methods: Rats underwent 25 min of four-vessel occlusion. The ASD extract was intragastrically administered at doses of 0.25 g/kg (ASD-0.25 g), 0.5 g/kg (ASD-0.5 g), 1 g/kg (ASD-1 g), 1 g/kg after dimethyl sulfoxide administration (D + ASD-1 g), or 1 g/kg after SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) administration (SB + ASD-1 g) at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, and 24 d after transient GCI. Results: ASD-0.5 g, ASD-1 g, and D + ASD-1 g treatments had the following effects: upregulation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and Ki67 expression, and BrdU/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and Ki67/nestin co-expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG); upregulation of microtubule-associated protein 2/NeuN co-expression, and NeuN and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha/GFAP co-expression in the hippocampal CA1 region; upregulation of phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), phosphocAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in the hippocampus. SB + ASD-1 g treatment abrogated the effects of ASD-1 g on the expression of these proteins. Conclusions: ASD-0.5 g and ASD-1 g treatments promotes neuronal survival by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis. The effects of the ASD extract on astrocyte-associated hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic growth are caused by the activation of p38 MAPK-mediated CREB/BDNF, GDNF, and VEGF-A signaling pathways in the hippocampus at 28 d after transient GCI.

AB  - Detailed metabolic imaging of specific brain regions in early aging may expose pathophysiological mechanisms and indicate effective neuropharmacological targets in the onset of cognitive decline. Comprehensive imaging of brain aging and drug-target effects is restricted using conventional methodology. We simultaneously visualized multiple metabolic alterations induced by normal aging in specific regions of mouse brains by integrating Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry imaging and combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. We examined the interplay between aging and the response to tacrine-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition, a well-characterized therapeutic treatment against dementia. The dipeptide carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) and the vitamin a-tocopherol were significantly elevated by aging in different brain regions. L-Carnitine and acetylcholine metabolism were found to be major pathways affected by aging and tacrine administration in a brain region-specific manner, indicating altered mitochondrial function and neurotransmission. The highly interconnected hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex displayed different age-induced alterations in lipids and acylcarnitines, reflecting diverse region-specific metabolic effects. The subregional differences observed in the hippocampal formation of several lipid metabolites demonstrate the unique potential of the technique compared to standard mass spectrometry approaches. An age-induced increase of endogenous antioxidants, such as alpha-tocopherol, in the hippocampus was detected, suggesting an augmentation of neuroprotective mechanisms in early aging. Our comprehensive imaging approach visualized heterogeneous age-induced metabolic perturbations in mitochondrial function, neurotransmission, and lipid signaling, not always attenuated by acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

AB  - Rumex confertus is a rhizomatous, invasive, and difficult to control plant. Nevertheless, for sustainable agriculture, studies to biologically control R. confertus continue. Towards this, considerable attention has been devoted to investigating the emission of a wide array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from herbivore-damaged plants, which are known to induce protection measures in neighboring, undamaged plants. The goals of this study are to (1) determine if the profile of green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which are organic compounds naturally produced by undamaged plants, is similar to that provoked by the chemical stimulants Z-jasmone (ZJA) and dihydrojasmone (DJA), (2) establish if the Apion miniatum beetle's reproductive choices are influenced by their sex and mating status, and (3) assess if chemically stimulated GLV emissions can be used as signals to attract pests to R. confertus for biological control purposes. Synthetic forms of naturally produced Z-jasmone (ZJA) and dihydrojasmone (DJA), which can act as either an attractant or a repellent of various species of insects, were used to treat R. confertus. In olfactory analysis, the behavioral responses of individual insects to mated and unmated insects and to two GLV blends were evaluated. It was found that unmated male insects were fairly equally divided between going for food (Y-tube olfactometer arm with a GLV blend) and opportunities for reproduction (Y-tube olfactometer arm with unmated females). However, an increase in the GLV blend concentration attracted the insects. Meanwhile, unmated females were definitely indifferent to food and, independent of the GLV blend dose, were more interested in reproduction. Mated males, even with weak feed stimuli, increased their reproduction activity, in opposition to mated females. We provide evidence that synthetic GLV blends can be used to attract predators, making their use an effective means to biologically control R. confertus. The idea of applying synthetic GLVs as a biological control is based on the insects' mutual relationships, which work as follows: (i) mated males fully invade the weed, (ii) reproduction-driven females follow the mated males to R. confertus, and (iii) the unmated males follow the females with the purpose to reproduce. Therefore, all insect groups (mated and unmated males and females) can be induced to invade the weed. Upon feeding, the insects will damage the generative organs of R. confertus. We propose that the use of chemical stimulants to increase GLV emissions can be effectively used for weed (here R. confertus) control by attracting a plant pest (here A. miniatum).

AB  - Aging and metabolic syndrome are associated with neurodegenerative pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and there is growing interest in the prophylactic potential of probiotic bacteria in this area. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective potential of the Lab4P probiotic consortium in both age and metabolically challenged 3xTg-AD mice and in human SH-SY5Y cell culture models of neurodegeneration. In mice, supplementation prevented disease-associated deteriorations in novel object recognition, hippocampal neurone spine density (particularly thin spines) and mRNA expression in hippocampal tissue implying an anti-inflammatory impact of the probiotic, more notably in the metabolically challenged setting. In differentiated human SH-SY5Y neurones challenged with beta-Amyloid, probiotic metabolites elicited a neuroprotective capability. Taken together, the results highlight Lab4P as a potential neuroprotective agent and provide compelling support for additional studies in animal models of other neurodegenerative conditions and human studies.

AB  - Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDPs) and Early Sharp Waves (eSPWs) are the major patterns of neuronal network activity in the developing hippocampus of neonatal rodents in vitro and in vivo, , respectively. Because of certain similarities in their electrographic traits, GDPs and eSPWs were originally considered as homologous patterns. Here, we compared electrographic features and current density profiles of field GDPs (fGDPs) and eSPWs using extracellular multisite silicon probe recordings from neonatal rat CA1 hippocampus. We found that fGDPs in hippocampal slices were much less in amplitude than eSPWs, and were characterized by electronegativity and current sinks in CA1 pyramidal cell layer and stratum radiatum, and positive waves/sources in stratum lacunosum-moleculare. eSPWs in vivo showed a remarkably different depth profile, with positivity and current source in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, and negativity/sinks in stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosummoleculare. Current sinks of CA3-evoked responses corresponded to sinks of fGDPs and eSPWs in the stratum radiatum. However, current sinks of entorhinal inputs- evoked responses in stratum lacunosum-moleculare, which were characteristic of eSPWs, were absent in fGDPs. In addition, fGDPs more strongly modulated neuronal firing in CA1 compared to eSPWs. Thus, we show important differences in the electrographic properties of GDPs and eSPWs that challenge the homology of these two activity patterns.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting in cognitive decline or dementia, the number of patients with AD is continuously increasing. Although a lot of great progress has been made in research and development of AD therapeutics, there is no fundamental cure for this disease yet. This study demonstrated the memory-improving effects of Cuban policosanol (PCO) in 5xFAD mice, which is an animal model of AD. Following 4-months of treatment with PCO in 5xFAD mice, we found that the number of amyloid plaques decreased in the brain compared to the vehicle-treated 5xFAD mice. Long-term PCO treatment in 5xFAD mice resulted in the reduction of gliosis and abnormal inflammatory cytokines level (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in the cortex and hippocampus. Levels of lipid peroxide (4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE]) and superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) levels were also recoverd in the brains of PCO-treated 5xFAD mice. Notably, PCO administration reduced memory deficits in the passive avoidance test, as well as synaptic loss (PSD-95, synaptophysin) in 5xFAD mice. Collectively, we identified the potential effects of PCO as a useful supplement to delay or prevent AD progression by inhibiting the formation of A beta plaques in the brain.

AB  - This study aims to check the compatibility of a selection of waste and recycled biopolymers for rammed earth applications in order to replace the more common cement-based stabilization. Five formulations of stabilized rammed earth were prepared with different biopolymers: lignin sulfonate, tannin, sheep wool fibers, citrus pomace and grape-seed flour. The microstructure of the different formulations was characterized by investigating the interactions between earth and stabilizers through mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), nitrogen soprtion isotherm, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) was also evaluated for all stabilized specimens. Three out of five biopolymers were considered suitable as rammed earth stabilizers. The use of wool increased the UCS by 6%, probably thanks to the combined effect of the length of the fibers and the roughness of their surfaces, which gives a contribution in binding clay particles higher than citrus and grape-seed flour. Lignin sulfonate and tannin increased the UCS by 38% and 13%, respectively, suggesting the additives' ability to fill pores, coat soil grains and form aggregates; this capability is confirmed by the reduction in the specific surface area and the pore volume in the nano- and micropore zones.

AB  - Circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) are still unexplored regarding mechanisms for their emergence. We considered the ATXN2L intron lariat-derived circular RNA (ciRNA-ATXN2L) as an opportunity to conduct a cross-species examination of ciRNA genesis. To this end, we investigated 207 datasets from 4 tissues and from 13 mammalian species. While in eight species, ciRNA-ATXN2L was never detected, in pigs and rabbits, ciRNA-ATXN2L was expressed in all tissues and sometimes at very high levels. Bovine tissues were an intermediate case and in macaques and cats, only ciRNA-ATXN2L traces were detected. The pattern of ciRNA-ATXN2L restricted to only five species is not related to a particular evolution of intronic sequences. To empower our analysis, we considered 221 additional introns including 80 introns where a lariat-derived ciRNA was previously described. The primary driver of micro-ciRNA genesis (< 155 nt as ciRNA-ATXN2L) appears to be the absence of a canonical "A " (i.e. a "tnA " located in the usual branching region) to build the lariat around this adenosine. The balance between available "non canonical-A " (no ciRNA genesis) and "non-A " (ciRNA genesis) for use as a branch point to build the lariat could modify the expression level of ciRNA-ATXN2L. In addition, the rare localization of the 2 & PRIME;-5 & PRIME; bond in an open RNA secondary structure could also negatively affect the lifetime of ciRNAs (macaque ciRNA-ATXN2L). Our analyses suggest that ciRNA-ATXN2L is likely a functionless splice remnant. This study provides a better understanding of the ciRNAs origin, especially drivers for micro ciRNA genesis.

AB  - Mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) regulate calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis via Ca2+ transport-related proteins such as inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R). FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy plays an important role in ER homeostasis. However, it remains unknown whether FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy affects mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and cell death through MAMs. In this study, we demonstrated that colocalization degree of FAM134B with LC3 and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio were elevated in the hippocampal neuronal culture (HNC) model of acquired epilepsy (AE), which indicate an increased level of autophagy. In this model, FAM134B overexpression enhanced ER-phagy, while FAM134B downregulation had the opposite effect. Additionally, FAM134B overexpression significantly reversed the increases in IP3R expression and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and the decrease in the ER Ca2+ concentration in this model. FAM134B overexpression also ameliorated the AE-induced ultrastructural damage in neuronal mitochondria, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (mMP), cytochrome c (CytC) release and caspase-3 activation, while FAM134B downregulation induced the opposite effects. Altogether, our data indicate that FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy can attenuate AE-induced neuronal apoptosis, possibly by modulating the IP3R in MAMs to alter Ca2+ exchange between ER and mitochondria and thus inhibit mitochondrial structural damage, a decrease in mMP, release of CytC and mitochondrial apoptosis.

AB  - Simple Summary Sarin is a potent organophosphate nerve agent that is a representative of a chemical weapon and poses a threat to human health. In this study, the effects of repeated low-level sarin exposure on the cognitive behavior of rats were studied, and the activity of AChE activity and dendritic spine density in the hippocampus were measured. Whole-transcriptome and bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the related molecular mechanisms, and finally, the ceRNA regulatory network was constructed and analyzed. These newly discovery techniques provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism of sarin-induced cognitive impairment and also offer new insights for the research of other organophosphorus toxicants. Sarin is a potent organophosphorus nerve agent that causes cognitive dysfunction, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, a rat model of repeated low-level sarin exposure was established using the subcutaneous injection of 0.4 x LD50 for 21 consecutive days. Sarin-exposed rats showed persistent learning and memory impairment and reduced hippocampal dendritic spine density. A whole-transcriptome analysis was applied to study the mechanism of sarin-induced cognitive impairment, and a total of 1035 differentially expressed mRNA (DEmRNA), including 44 DEmiRNA, 305 DElncRNA, and 412 DEcircRNA, were found in the hippocampus of sarin-treated rats. According to Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis, these DERNAs were mainly involved in neuronal synaptic plasticity and were related to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed, in which Circ_Fmn1, miR-741-3p, miR-764-3p, miR-871-3p, KIF1A, PTPN11, SYN1, and MT-CO3 formed one circuit, and Circ_Cacna1c, miR-10b-5p, miR-18a-5p, CACNA1C, PRKCD, and RASGRP1 constituted another circuit. The balance between the two circuits was crucial for maintaining synaptic plasticity and may be the regulatory mechanism by which sarin causes cognitive impairment. Our study reveals the ceRNA regulation mechanism of sarin exposure for the first time and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of other organophosphorus toxicants.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer, as a malignant tumor with a very poor prognosis, has a high mortality. It is imperative to clarify the mechanism of pancreatic cancer development and find suitable targets for diagnosis and treatment. Serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK3) is one of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway and has the ability to inhibit tumor growth. But the biological function of STK3 in pancreatic cancer remains unknown. Here, we confirmed that STK3 has an impact on the growth, apoptosis, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells and investigated the related molecular mechanisms. In our research, we found that STK3 is reduced in pancreatic cancer by RT-qPCR, IHC and IF, its expression level is correlated with the clinicopathological features. CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of STK3 on the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the Transwell assay was used to detect the ability of cell migration and invasion. The results showed that STK3 promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell migration, invasion and proliferation pancreatic cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and western blotting are used to predict and verify the pathways related to STK3. Subsequently, we found that the effect of STK3 on proliferation and apoptosis closely related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, the assistance of RASSF1 plays a significant role the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by STK3. The nude mouse xenograft experiment demonstrated the tumor suppressive ability of STK3 in vivo. Collectively, this study found that STK3 regulates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis by suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with the assistance of RASSF1.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a dual role in neurotoxicity by releasing the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in response to environmental stress. Suppression of BDNF is implicated in learning and memory impairment induced by exposure to manganese (Mn) or lead (Pb) individually. Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCp2) and its phosphorylation status are related to BDNF suppression. Protein phosphatase2A (PP2A), a member of the serine/threonine phosphatases family, dephosphorylates substrates based on the methylation state of its catalytic C subunit (PP2Ac). However, the specific impairment patterns and molecular mechanisms resulting from co-exposure to Mn and Pb remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of Mn and Pb exposure, alone and in combination, on inducing neurotoxicity in the hippocampus of mice and BV2 cells, and to determine whether simultaneous exposure to both metals exacerbate their toxicity. Our findings reveal that co-exposure to Mn and Pb leads to severe learning and memory impairment in mice, which correlates with the accumulation of metals in the hippocampus and synergistic suppression of BDNF. This suppression is accompanied by up-regulation of the epigenetic repressor MeCp2 and its phosphorylation status, as well as demethylation of PP2Ac. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2Ac demethylation using ABL127, an inhibitor for its protein phosphatase methylesterase1 (PME1), or knockdown of MeCp2 via siRNA transfection in vitro effectively increases BDNF expression and mitigates BV2 cell damage induced by Mn and Pb co-exposure. We also observe abnormal activation of microglia characterized by enhanced release of the NLRP3 inflammasome, Casepase-1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, in the hippocampus of mice and BV2 cells. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that simultaneous exposure to Mn and Pb results in more severe hippocampusdependent learning and memory impairment, which is attributed to epigenetic suppression of BDNF mediated by PP2A regulation.

AB  - Simple Summary The weaning process can be detrimental to piglets and often leads to low feed intake, low weight gain, diarrhea, and eventually increased mortality. Resin acid-enriched composition (RAC) is an innovative natural feed ingredient that contains 90% fatty acids, mostly linoleic and oleic, pinolenic acids, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). It also contains 9% active component resin acid (RA), mostly abietic and dehydroabietic, and pimaric acids. It possesses antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties and has been used in feed to improve performance in pigs. We hypothesized that RAC supplementation to sow and piglet diets might modulate intestinal microbiota, and improve post-weaning growth and reduce post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) and gut inflammation. Sow diets were supplemented with RAC from the last six weeks of gestation until weaning, and piglets were fed RAC trough creep feed and post weaning feed until seven weeks of age. Results indicated that supplementing sow and piglet diets with RAC during late gestation, lactation and at post weaning modulates gut microbiota, reduces inflammatory biomarkers, improves growth performance of post-weaning piglets, and prevents PWD in weaned piglets. Considering these results, RAC supplementation represents a potential strategy to improve piglet growth performance, and is a natural alternative to antibiotics for preventing PWD. The weaning process represents a delicate phase for piglets, and is often characterized by lower feed intake, lower weight gain, diarrhea, and ultimately increased mortality. We aimed to determine the effects of RAC supplementation in diets on improving piglet growth and vitality, reducing post-weaning diarrhea, and enhancing gut health. In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, we selected forty sows and their piglets. Piglets were followed until seven weeks of age. There were no significant differences found between RAC treated and control piglets until weaning (p = 0.26). However, three weeks after weaning, RAC treated piglets had higher body weight and average daily growth (ADG) than the control piglets (p = 0.003). In addition, the piglets that received RAC after weaning, irrespective of mother or prior creep feed treatment, had lower post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) and fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) level than control piglets. Gut microbiota analysis in post-weaning piglets revealed that RAC supplementation significantly increased Lachnospiraceae_unclassified, Blautia, Butyricicoccus, Gemmiger and Holdemanella, and decreased Bacteroidales_unclassified. Overall, RAC supplementation to piglets modulated post-weaning gut microbiota, improved growth performance after weaning, reduced post-weaning diarrhea and reduced fecal myeloperoxidase levels. We therefore consider RAC to be a potential natural feed supplement to prevent enteric infections and improve growth performance in weaning piglets.

AB  - Background: Gastrodia elata (Orchidaceae) is a medicinal plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. The rhizomes contain numerous active components, of which Gastrodin (p-hydroxymethylphenyl-B-D-glucopyranoside) forms the basis of the traditional medicine Gastrodiae Rhizoma. Gastrodin is also found in other medicinal plants and has neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Research indicates that consuming meals and drinks containing Gastrodiaelata can enhance cognitive functioning and memory in elderly patients. The mechanisms relevant to the problem have not been completely understood.
   Purpose: The aim was to examine the in vivo and in vitro anti-neuroinflammatory effects of Gastrodin. Study design: The neuroprotective effects of Gastrodin on the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation in LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice and BV-2 cells were investigated.
   Methods: 1. C57BL/6 mice were assigned to model, gastrodin, donepezil, and control groups (n = 10 per group). The Gastrodin group received 100 mg/kg/d for five days, and the Dopenezil group 1.3 mg/kg/d. A neuroinflammation model was established by administering intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg/kg LPS to all groups, excluding the control. To induce microglial activation in Gastrodin-treated mouse microglial BV-2 cells, 1 mu g/ml LPS was introduced for 24 h Morris water mazes were utilized to evaluate learning and spatial memory. Expression and subcellular localization of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B axis-related proteins and p-Stat3, Iba-1, GFAP, iNOS, and CD206 were assessed by immunofluorescence, western blots, and ELISA. qRT-PCR was performed to determine and measure IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, cell migration, and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 was induced by transfection, and the effect of Gastrodin on IL-1 beta and p-NF-kappa B p65 levels was assessed.
   Results: 1. In mice, gastrodin treatment mitigated LPS-induced deficits in learning and spatial memory, as well as reducing neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF- kappa B pathway proteins, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and phosphorylation of Stat3. 2. Gastrodin pretreatment improved LPS-induced inflammation in vitro, reducing expression of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B-associated proteins and p-Stat3, inducing microglial transformation from M1 to M2, and inhibiting migration and phagocytosis. Overexpression of TRAF6 inhibited the Gastrodin-induced effects.
   Conclusion: Gastrodin suppresses neuroinflammation and microglial activation by modifying the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappa B pathway and Stat3 phosphorylation.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making, and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of 4 months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HLJD), a traditional Chinese medicine prescrip-tion, has been implicated as effective in treating colitis, depression and inflammation-related diseases. Whether HLJD decoction could ameliorate colitis-induced depression was still unknown and the underlying mechanism was needed to be clarified.Aim of the study: Our study aimed to explore the effect and the underlying mechanism of HLJD treatment on colitis-induced depression and the involvement of the inflammatory factors and microglial-activated related genes.Materials and methods: The chronic colitis model was established by treating male mice with 1% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 8 weeks. One week after DSS-treated, HLJD decoction was administered orally with 2 and 4 g/ kg daily for 7 weeks. Behavior tests (Open field/Elevated plus maze/Novel object recognition) and TUNEL staining were then assessed. The expression of inflammatory-related genes and microglial dysregulation were measured by RT-PCR and the expression of Trem2, Danp12 and Iba1 were assessed by immunofluorescence methods.Results: Depressive-like behaviors were observed in mice treated with DSS, which suffered colitis. Compared to normal control (NC-V) mice, the density of TUNEL + cells in the habenula (Hb), hippocampus (HIP), and cortex were significantly higher in colitis (DSS-V) mice, especially in Hb. Compared to NC-V and several brain regions, the expression levels of the Il-1 & beta;, Il-10 and Dap12 mRNA were significantly increased in the lateral habenula (LHb) of colitis mice. Moreover, the expression of Trem2, Dap12 and Iba1 were increased in LHb of DSS-V mice. HLJD treatment could alleviate depressive-like behaviors, reduce the density of TUNEL + cells in Hb and the expression of Il-6, Il-10 and Dap12 mRNA in LHb of DSS-V mice. The overexpression of Trem2, Dap12 and Iba1 in LHb of DSS-V mice were reversed after HLJD treatment.Conclusion: These results reveal LHb is an important brain region during the process of colitis-induced depression. HLJD treatment could alleviates depressive-like behaviors in colitis mice via inhibiting the Trem2/Dap12 pathway in microglia of LHb, which would contribute to the precise treatment. It provides a potential mecha-nistic explanation for the effectiveness of HLJD treatment in colitis patients with depression.

AB  - Ketamine is the prototype for glutamate-based fast-acting antidepressants. The establishment of ketamine-like drugs is still a challenge and ascorbic acid has emerged as a candidate. This study investigated the ascorbic acid's ability to induce a fast antidepressant-like response and to improve hippocampal synaptic markers in mice subjected to chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration. CORT was administered for 21 days, followed by a single administration of ascorbic acid (1 mg /Kg, p.o.), ketamine (1 mg /Kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg /Kg, p.o.) in mice. Depressive-like behavior, hippocampal synaptic proteins immunocontent, dendrite spines density in the dentate gyrus (DG) were analyzed 24 h following treatments. The administration of ascorbic acid or ketamine, but not fluoxetine, counteracted CORT-induced depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test (TST). CORT administration reduced PSD-95, GluA1, and synapsin (synaptic markers) immunocontent, and these alterations were reversed by ascorbic acid or ketamine, but only ketamine reversed the CORT-induced reduction on GluA1 immunocontent. In the ventral and dorsal DG, CORT decreased filopodia-, thin- and stubby-shaped spines, while ascorbic acid and ketamine abolished this alteration only in filopodia spines. Ascorbic acid and ketamine increased mushroom-shaped spines density in ventral and dorsal DG. Therefore, the results show that a single administration of ascorbic acid, in a way similar to ketamine, rapidly elicits an antidepressant-like response and reverses hippocampal synaptic deficits caused by CORT, an effect associated with increased levels of synaptic proteins and dendritic remodeling.

AB  - The beneficial effect of antioxidant supplementation in maturation culture media of sow oocytes was evaluated by the expression quantification of apoptotic genes and the genes that ensure stability of germ cells during fertilization. The oocytes were cultivated for 44 h in conventional medium (C) or in medium supplemented with 105 mu M rosmarinic acid (R) and 0.5 mM ascorbic acid (A) and classified into three quality classes by morphological observation from which the total RNA was isolated. The gene expression of Ptx3 and the apoptotic regulator p53, Bax and BCL-2 were evaluated by quantitative PCR technique. The decreased expression of the Bax gene in the A and R groups, compared to the control, indicates a protective role of antioxidants in the cells. Cell homeostasis was maintained, as reflected in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in class I COCs (cumulus-oocyte complex) regardless of the experimental group, indicating minimum cellular stress. The expression of p53 genes was higher in all class III COC, but in A1 and R1 the expression was lower than in C1, and a similar Ptx-3 gene decreased significantly in groups A1, A2, A3 and R1 compared with control groups. Antioxidant supplementation showed beneficial effects on all morphological classes of pig COCs.

AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Sorafenib (SORA), as a first-line therapeutic drug, has been used to treat HCC, but resistance poses a major limitation on the efficacy of SORA chemotherapy. Pristimerin (PRIS), a natural bioactive component isolated from various plant species in the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families, has been reported to exhibit outstanding antitumor effects in several types of cells in vitro.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRIS can exert synergistic anti-tumor effects with the combination of SORA, and if so, through what mechanism.
   Methods: Conditionally reprogrammed patient derived-primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells (CRHCs) were isolated from human liver cancer tissues and treated with SORA and PRIS. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and tube formation ability were detected by DNA content quantification, flow cytometry, transwell assay and Matrigel-based angiogenesis assay. Gene and protein expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively.
   Results: Initially, we observed that the combination of the two drugs had a much stronger inhibitory effect on CRHCs growth than either drug alone. Moreover, the combination of 2 mu M SORA and 1 mu M PRIS exhibited a significant anti-migrative and anti-invaded effect on CRHCs, and remarkably inhibited capillary structure formation of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the combined treatment with SORA and PRIS synergistically induced intrinsic apoptosis in CRHCs, involving a caspase-4-dependent mechanism paralleled by an increased Bax/Bcl-xL ratio. These activities were mediated through ROS generation and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. GRP78 silencing or ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid administration was revealed to abolish the anticancer effects of PRIS, indicating the critical role of GRP78 in mediating the bioactivity of PRIS. The present study also provides mechanistic evidence that PRIS modulated the Akt/FoxO1/p27(kip1) signaling pathway, which is required for mitochondrial- mediated intrinsic apoptosis, activation of ER stress, and stimulation of caspase-4 induced by PRIS, and, consequently resulting in suppressed cell viability, migration and angiogenesis co-treated with SORA in CRHCs.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest the use of PRIS as sensitizers of chemotherapy paving the way for innovative and promising targeted chemotherapy-based therapeutic strategies in human HCC.Y

AB  - Flexible navigation relies on a cognitive map of space, thought to be implemented by hippocampal place cells: neurons that exhibit location-specific firing. In connected environments, optimal navigation requires keeping track of one's location and of the available connections between subspaces. We examined whether the dorsal CA1 place cells of rats encode environmental connectivity in four geometrically identical boxes arranged in a square. Rats moved between boxes by pushing saloon-type doors that could be locked in one or both directions. Although rats demonstrated knowledge of environmental connectivity, their place cells did not respond to connectivity changes, nor did they represent doorways differently from other locations. Place cells coded location in a global reference frame, with a different map for each box and minimal repetitive fields despite the repetitive geometry. These results suggest that CA1 place cells provide a spatial map that does not explicitly include connectivity.

AB  - Control rats were exposed to saline aerosol, two groups were exposed to paraquat (PQ), 27 (PQ-L) and 54 (PQ-H) mg/m(3) aerosols and six groups were treated with carvacrol, 20 (C-L) and 80 (C-H) mg/kg/day, pioglitazone, 5 (Pio-L) and 10 (Pio-H) mg/kg/day, C-L+Pio-L and dexamethasone, 0.03 mg/kg/day, for 16 days after the end of exposure to PQ-H. Different variables were measured after the end of treatment period. Total and differential white blood cells counts, nitrite, malondialdehyde, interleukin (IL)-10, and interferon-gamma levels were significant increased, but thiol, superoxide dismutase, catalase, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were decreased in the blood due to both doses of PQ (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Most measured parameters were significantly improved in treated groups with both doses of carvacrol, pioglitazone, the combination of C-L+Pio-L and dexamethasone compared to PQ-H group (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Treatment with C-L+Pio-L showed significantly higher effects compared to each one alone (p < 0.05-p < 0.001). Systemic oxidative stress and inflammation due to inhaled PQ were improved by carvacrol and pioglitazone. Higher effects of C-L+Pio-L than each one alone suggests carvacrol modulating PPAR-gamma receptors.

AB  - (1) Background: Mosquito control with essential oils is a growing demand. This work evaluated the novel larvicidal and adulticidal activity of fennel and green tea oils and their Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanohybrid against Culex pipiens (Cx. pipiens) in both laboratory and field conditions and evaluated their effect against non-target organisms; (2) Methods: Two types of nanoclays, MgAl-LDH and NiAl-LDH were synthesized and characterized using PXRD, TEM and SEM, whereas their elemental analysis was accomplished by SEM-EDX; (3) Results: Mg and Ni LDHs were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The adsorption and desorption of active ingredients were conducted using LC MS/MS, with reference to the SEM-EXD analysis. The desorption process of MgAl-LDH intercalated green tea oil was conducted using ethanol, and reveled significant peaks related to polyphenols and flavonoids like Vanillin, Catechin, Daidzein, Ellagic acid, Naringenin, Myricetin and Syringic acid with concentrations of 0.76, 0.73, 0.67, 0.59, 0.52, 0.44 and 0.42 mu g/g, respectively. The larvicidal LC50 values of fennel oil, Mg-LDH-F, and Ni-LDH-F were 843.88, 451.95, 550.12 ppm, respectively, whereas the corresponding values of green tea were 938.93, 530.46, and 769.94 ppm. The larval reduction percentage of fennel oil and Mg-LDH-F reached 90.1 and 96.2%, 24 h PT and their persistence reached five and seven days PT, respectively. The reduction percentage of green tea oil and Mg-LDH-GT reached 88.00 and 92.01%, 24 h PT and their persistence reached five and six days PT, respectively. Against adults, Mg-LDH-GT and Ni-LDH-GT were less effective than green tea oil as their LC95 values were 5.45, 25.90, and 35.39%, respectively.

AB  - The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density. Conversely, at extremely high cell density, the Hippo pathway, which regulates YAP/TAZ, is activated. This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells. However, it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition (contact inhibition) under high-density conditions, thereby allowing continuous proliferation. In this study, we construct a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Herein, a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density, which reflects cell dynamics, into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response. We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics (MD) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell. We assume Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain. We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics. We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. Finally, this mathematical model, which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages.

AB  - One of the primary challenges in developing bone substitutes is to create scaffolds with mechanical properties that closely mimic those of regenerated tissue. Scaffolds that mimic the structure of natural cancellous bone are believed to have better environmental adaptability. In this study, we used the porosity and thickness of pig cancellous bone as biomimetic design parameters, and porosity and structural shape as differential indicators, to design a biomimetic bone beam scaffold. The mechanical properties of the designed bone beam model were tested using the finite element method (FEM). PCL/& beta;-TCP porous scaffolds were prepared using the FDM method, and their mechanical properties were tested. The FEM simulation results were compared and validated, and the effects of porosity and pore shape on the mechanical properties were analyzed. The results of this study indicate that the PCL/& beta;-TCP scaffold, prepared using FDM 3D printing technology for cancellous bone tissue engineering, has excellent integrity and stability. Predicting the structural stability using FEM is effective. The triangle pore structure has the most stability in both simulations and tests, followed by the rectangle and honeycomb shapes, and the diamond structure has the worst stability. Therefore, adjusting the porosity and pore shape can change the mechanical properties of the composite scaffold to meet the mechanical requirements of customized tissue engineering.

AB  - The ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a crucial role in anxiety-related behaviour and vH neurons increase their firing when animals explore anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic area. Male rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were subsequently removed in parts of the track to introduce an anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.

AB  - Difficulty remembering faces and names is a common struggle for many people and gets more difficult as we age. Subtle changes in appearance from day to day, common facial characteristics across individuals, and overlap of names may contribute to the difficulty of learning face-name associations. Computational models suggest the hippocampus plays a key role in reducing interference across experiences with overlapping information by performing pattern separation, which enables us to encode similar experiences as distinct from one another. Thus, given the nature of overlapping features within face-name associative memory, hippocampal pattern separation may be an important underlying mechanism supporting this type of memory. Furthermore, crossspecies approaches find that aging is associated with deficits in hippocampal pattern separation. Mnemonic discrimination tasks have been designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation and provide a more sensitive measure of age-related cognitive decline compared to traditional memory tasks. However, traditional face-name associative memory tasks do not parametrically vary overlapping features of faces and names to tax hippocampal pattern separation and often lack naturalistic facial features (e.g., hair, accessories, similarity of features, emotional expressions). Here, we developed a face-name mnemonic discrimination task where we varied face stimuli by similarity, race, sex, and emotional expression as well as the similarity of name stimuli. We tested a sample of healthy young and older adults on this task and found that both age groups showed worsening performance as face-name interference increased. Overall, older adults struggled to remember faces and face-name pairs more than young adults. However, while young adults remembered emotional faces better than neutral faces, older adults selectively remembered positive faces. Thus, the use of a face-name association memory task designed with varying levels of face-name interference as well as the inclusion of naturalistic face stimuli across race, sex, and emotional expressions provides a more nuanced approach relative to traditional face-name association tasks toward understanding age-related changes in memory.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Gleditsiae sinensis fructus Pills (GF) is a famous classical prescription, that is regularly combined with Jujubae fructus (JF) for the treatment of chronic bronchitis (CB) in the clinic. While the clinical efficacy of this combination prescription is clearly established, the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: To elucidate the mechanisms of action of Gleditsiae sinensis fructus Pills combined with Jujubae fructus (GF&JF) against CB based on network pharmacology and experimental verification.Materials and methods: The potential targets of GF&JF involved in therapeutic activity against CB were predicted based on network pharmacology and an "ingredients-targets" network constructed. The Metascape database was used for Module, GO functional and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analyses of potential targets. Molecular docking was applied to simulate the binding activities of key candidate active ingredients to core targets. For experimental verification, a CB model was established through smoking and nasal cavity drip of lipopolysac-charide. Related inflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-6 and IL-8 in serum, and IL-4 IL-8, IFN-gamma and IL-10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), were detected using ELISA. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson staining were performed to observe pathological changes in lung and tracheal tissue. The expression of related proteins and mRNAs in the lung tissue were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot.Results: In network pharmacology, 36 common targets of GF&JF for CB were screened and the key targets and main signaling pathways identified. The active ingredients quercetin and stigmasterol in GF&JF had more targets for CB, which displayed good binding activity to IL-6, VEGFA, and EGFR, as established from molecular docking results. In vivo, GF&JF effectively inhibit the inflammatory response in CB mice and improved pathological changes in lung and tracheal tissue. In terms of the key proteins of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, GF&JF induced significant down-regulation of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, EGFR, CASPASE-3, AGEs and RAGE proteins in lung tissue as well as mRNA expression of IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, EGFR, AGEs and RAGE. Conclusions: The GF&JF combination exerts a good therapeutic effect in CB model mice, which may be attributed to inhibition of the inflammatory response as well as regulation on the expression of AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. In addition, quercetin and stigmasterol appear to be the main active ingredients of GF&JF in the treatment of CB.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop linear and nonlinear statistical models for predicting enteric methane emissions from beef and dairy cattle (EME, MJ/day). Ration nutrient composition (g/kg), nutrient (kg/day), energy (MJ/day), and energy and organic matter (OM) digestibility (g/kg) were used as predictors of CH4 production. Three databases of beef cattle, dairy cattle, and their combinations were developed using 34 published experiments to model EME predictions. Linear and nonlinear regression models were developed using a mixed-model approach to predict CH4 production (MJ/day) of individual animals based on feed composition. For the beef cattle database, Equation methane (MJ/d) = 1.6063 (+/- 0.757) + 0.4256 (+/- 0.0745) x DMI + 1.2213 (+/- 0.1715) x NDFI + -0.475 (+/- 0.446) x ADFI had the smallest RMSPE (21.99%), with 83.51% of this coming from random error and a regression bias was 16.49%. For the dairy cattle database, the RMSPE was minimized (15.99%) for methane (MJ/d) = 0.3989 (+/- 1.1073) + 0.8685 (+/- 0.1585) x DMI + 0.6675 (+/- 0.4264) x NDFI, of which 85.11% was from random error and the regression deviation was 14.89%. When the beef and dairy cattle databases were combined, the RMSPE was minimized (24.4%) for methane(MJ/d) = -0.3496 (+/- 0.723) + 0.5941 (+/- 0.0851) x DMI + 1.388 (+/- 0.2203) x NDFI + -0.027 (+/- 0.4223) x ADFI, of which 85.62% was from the random error and the regression bias was 14.38%. Among the nonlinear equations for the three databases, the DMI-based exponential model outperformed the other nonlinear models, but the predictability and goodness of fit of the equations did not improve compared to the linear model. The existing equations overestimate CH4 production with low accuracy and precision. Therefore, the equations developed in this study improve the preparation of methane inventories and thus improve the estimation of methane production in beef and dairy cattle.

AB  - Introduction: The hippocampus (HPC) supports integration of information across time, often indexed by associative inference (AI) and statistical learning (SL) tasks. In AI, an indirect association between stimuli that never appeared together is inferred, whereas SL involves learning item relationships by extracting regularities across experiences. A recent model of hippocampal function (Schapiro et al., 2017) proposes that the HPC can support temporal integration in both paradigms through its two distinct pathways. Methods: We tested this models' predictions in four patients with varying degrees of bilateral HPC damage and matched healthy controls, with two patients with complementary damage to either the monosynaptic or trisynaptic pathway. During AI, participants studied overlapping paired associates (AB, BC) and their memory was tested for premise pairs (AB) and for inferred pairs (AC). During SL, participants passively viewed a continuous picture sequence that contained an underlying structure of triplets that later had to be recognized. Results: Binomial distributions were used to calculate above chance performance at the individual level. For AI, patients with focal HPC damage were impaired at inference but could correctly infer pairs above chance once premise pair acquisition was equated to controls; however, the patient with HPC and cortical damage showed severe impairment at recalling premise and inferred pairs, regardless of accounting for premise pair performance. For SL, none of the patients performed above chance, but notably neither did most controls. Conclusions: Associative inference of indirect relationships can be intact with HPC damage to either hippocampal pathways or the HPC more broadly, provided premise pairs can first be formed. Inference may remain intact through residual HPC tissue supporting premise pair acquisition, and/or through extra-hippocampal structures supporting inference at retrieval. Clear conclusions about hippocampal contributions to SL are precluded by low performance in controls, which we caution is not dissimilar to previous amnesic studies using the same task. This complicates interpretations of studies claiming necessity of hippocampal contributions to SL and warrants the use of a common and reliable task before conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - Colon cancer has become a global public health challenge, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) chemoresistance is a major obstacle in its treatment. Chemoresistance can be mediated by therapy-induced cellular senescence. This study intended to investigate mechanisms of INHBA (inhibin A) in 5-FU resistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer. Bioinformatics analysis of INHBA expression in colon cancer tissues, survival analysis, and correlation analysis of cellular senescence markers were performed. The effects of INHBA on the biological characteristics and 5-FU resistance of colon cancer cells were examined through loss/gain-of-function and molecular assays. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was built to validate the mechanism of INHBA in vivo. INHBA was upregulated in colon cancer and was significantly positively correlated with cellular senescence markers uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), dense and erect panicle 1 (DEP1), and p21. Cellular senescence in colon cancer mediated 5-FU resistance. Downregulation of INHBA expression enhanced 5FU sensitivity in colon cancer cells, inhibited cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and it resulted in a lower proportion of senescent cells and lower levels of the cellular senescence markers interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8). Analysis of whether to use the pathway inhibitor Verteporfin proved that INHBA facilitated colon cancer cell senescence and enhanced 5-FU chemoresistance via inactivation of Hippo signaling pathway, and consistent results were obtained in vivo. Collectively, INHBA conferred 5-FU chemoresistance mediated by cellular senescence in colon cancer cells through negative regulation of Hippo signaling.

AB  - AKR1C3 is frequently overexpressed and it is a validated therapeutic target in various tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study showed that AKR1C3 facilitated HCC proliferation and metastasis by forming a positive feedback loop of AKR1C3-NF-kappa B-STAT3. Ferroptosis is a form of iron-dependent cell death driven by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species and plays an important role in tumor suppression. However, little is known about the role of AKR1C3 in ferroptosis susceptibility. In this study, we found that knockdown of AKR1C3 potently enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to ferroptosis inducers both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of AKR1C3 protected against ferroptosis in HCC cells. Mechanistically, AKR1C3 regulated ferroptosis through YAP/SLC7A11 signaling in HCC. AKR1C3 knockdown led to a decrease in YAP nuclear translocation, resulted in the inhibition of cystine transporter SLC7A11, and a subsequent increase in the intracellular levels of ferrous iron and ultimately ferroptosis. Moreover, we found that the combination of AKR1C3 and SLC7A11 was a strong predictor of poor prognosis in HCC. Collectively, these findings identify a novel role of AKR1C3 in ferroptosis, and highlighting a candidate therapeutic target to potentially improve the effect of ferroptosis-based antitumor therapy.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the central nervous system, are implicated in several neurological disorders marked by dysfunctional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). The present study aimed at investigating the role of hnRNP A1 in the proteome of the corpus callosum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus of a murine cuprizone-induced demyelination model. Right after the cuprizone insult, we administered an hnRNP A1 splicing activity inhibitor and analyzed its impact on brain remyelination by nanoESI-LC-MS/MS label-free proteomic analysis to assess the biological processes affected in these brain regions. Significant alterations in essential myelination proteins highlighted the involvement of hnRNP A1 in maintaining myelin integrity. Pathways related to sphingolipid and endocannabinoid signaling were affected, as well as the synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapses. Although behavioral impairments were not observed, molecular changes suggest potential links to memory, synaptic function, and neurotransmission processes. These findings enhance our understanding of the multifaceted roles of hnRNP A1 in the central nervous system, providing valuable insights for future investigations and therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases.image

AB  - Lead exposure may weaken the ability of learning and memory in the nervous system through mitochondrial paramorphia and dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In our works, with SD rats, primary culture of hippocampal neuron and PC12 cell line model were built up and behavioral tests were performed to determine the learning and memory insults; Western blot, immunological staining, and electron microscope were then conducted to determine endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial paramorphia and dysfunction. Co-immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate potential protein-protein interaction. The results show that lead exposure may cripple rats' learning and memory capability by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial paramorphia and dysfunction. Furthermore, we clarify that enhanced MFN2 ubiquitination degradation mediated by PINK1 may account for mitochondrial paramorphia and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our work may provide important clues for research on the mechanism of how Pb exposure leads to nervous system damage.

AB  - Animals navigate by learning the spatial layout of their environment. We investigated spatial learning of mice in an open maze where food was hidden in one of a hundred holes. Mice leaving from a stable entrance learned to efficiently navigate to the food without the need for landmarks. We developed a quantitative framework to reveal how the mice estimate the food location based on analyses of trajectories and active hole checks. After learning, the computed 'target estimation vector' (TEV) closely approximated the mice's route and its hole check distribution. The TEV required learning both the direction and distance of the start to food vector, and our data suggests that different learning dynamics underlie these estimates. We propose that the TEV can be precisely connected to the properties of hippocampal place cells. Finally, we provide the first demonstration that, after learning the location of two food sites, the mice took a shortcut between the sites, demonstrating that they had generated a cognitive map.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is one of the most important economic oil species in China. This study established an efficient protocol for the induction and multiplication of embryogenic callus, and the isolation, purification and Polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced fusion of protoplasts in C. oleifera. It is shown that the embryogenic callus induction was best when nodular embryogenic structures were treated with the hormone of 1.5 mg/L 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 1.5 mg/L 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, and the highest induction rate of embryogenic callus was 18.82% after 25 days of culture. Embryogenic callus was further multiplied on woody plant medium (WPM) with 0.75 mg/L 2,4-D, pH 5.8. The Proliferating rate of embryogenic callus reached 1.8 after 20 days of culture. The maximum yield (3.16 x 10(6) protoplasts per gram fresh tissue) and viability (93%) of embryogenic callus protoplast were reached when embryogenic callus was treated in dark for 24 h, vacuumed at -0.03 MPa for 10 min, digested of embryogenic callus with 0.75% (w/v) Cellulase R-10 and 0.5% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 for 6 hours at 28 degrees C. The purification effect was the best when using W buffer as a cleaning agent centrifuged 400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 4 min by precipitation method. Moreover, the maximum fusion efficiency (11.18%) of mesophyll protoplasts and embryogenic callus protoplasts was obtained with 30% PEG 6000 for 15 min. The study lays a foundation for future research in somatic hybridization in C. oleifera.

AB  - A combination of morphological analysis and DNA barcoding (partial sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene) was used to differentiate four gobiid fish species in the family Oxudercidae. Rhinogobius chiengmaiensis and Rhinogobius mekongianus were found in Thailand, while Eugnathogobius siamensis and Pseudogobiopsis oligactis were used for comparative purposes. Morphological identification relied on appearances, counts, and measurements. The 707-base pair COI sequences from eleven samples of four gobiid species were compared with reference sequences in public databases to confirm their scientific names. The average AT content was 51.8 +/- 0.5% and the GC content was 48.2 +/- 0.5%. Intraspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.00-0.28%, while interspecific genetic distances ranged from 0.86-16.63%. A neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree depicted the relationships among the COI sequences of these species. Morphological analysis and COI sequences successfully distinguished the four gobiid species. Notably, the COI sequences of R. chiengmaiensis, R. mekongianus, and E. siamensis were previously unreported, hence, this study is the first report to add their sequences to public databases. These results can serve as valuable information for the management of aquatic resources, conservation, and aquaculture efforts.

AB  - BackgroundDiapause is a physiological adaptation that evolves in arthropods to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions. By synchronizing their development and reproduction to seasonal variations, these animals can maximize their odds to survive adverse conditions. Among the environmental cues that trigger diapause, photoperiod is the most extensively studied. The hawthorn spider mite, Amphitetranychus viennensis, is one of the most devastating arthropod pests in fruit trees and woody ornamental plants. Overwintering females undergo a reproductive facultative diapause when A. viennensis immatures are exposed to long nights, which is consistent with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying diapause in A. viennensis remain unexplored.ResultsHere, we first developed a photoperiodic diapause bioassay for A. viennensis and identified protochrysalis, a non-feeding resting stage between the larva and protonymph, as a crucial developmental stage for diapause induction. We then identified six genes related to the carotenoid pathway, including three involved in synthesis, AvPD, AvLC/PS1, and AvLC/PS2, and the other three associated with metabolism, AvBCO1, AvBCO2, and AvCYP384A1. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that AvPD, AvLC/PS1, and AvLC/PS2 were acquired through horizontal transfer from fungi. Finally, functional characterization using RNA interference (RNAi) demonstrated that AvPD, AvLC/PS1, AvBCO2, and AvCYP384A1 contribute to pigmentation, while AvPD, AvLC/PS1, and AvBCO1 are involved in the regulation of diapause in A. viennensis.ConclusionsThis study not only advances our current knowledge on the molecular basis governing pigmentation and diapause, but also sheds light on the development of long-term sustainable management strategies for these polyphagous herbivores in spider mites in general and A. viennensis in particular.

AB  - Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia may result in long-lasting motor, auditory and learning impairments. The mechanisms responsible for the localization of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) to specific brain areas as well as those involved in potentially permanent central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions are far from being clear. One area of investigation includes exploring how hyperbilirubinemia determines neuronal alterations predisposing to neurodevelopmental disorders. We focused on the hippocampus and pyramidal cell dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and synaptic activity, with a particular focus on early forms of correlated network activity, i.e., giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), crucially involved in shaping mature synaptic networks. We performed live calcium imaging and patch clamp recordings from acute hippocampal slices isolated from wild-type rats exposed to exogenous high bilirubin concentration. We then explored the impact of endogenous bilirubin accumulation in hippocampal slices isolated from a genetic model of hyperbilirubinemia, i.e., Gunn rats. Our data show in both models an age-dependent dysregulation of calcium dynamics accompanied by severe alterations in GDPs, which were strongly reduced in hippocampal slices of hyperbilirubinemic rats, where the expression of GABAergic neurotransmission markers was also altered. We propose that hyperbilirubinemia damages neurons and affects the refinement of GABAergic synaptic circuitry during a critical period of hippocampal development.

AB  - We investigated associations between domestic exposure and respiratory health in students inNorthern Thailand in wet and dry season (1159 participants), calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by multilevel logistic regression. Totally 6.0% had wheeze, 23.0% dyspnoea, 4.0% current asthma, 54.6% rhinitis and 31.5% rhinoconjunctivitis. Girls had less wheeze (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.00) and current asthma (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54). Water leakage was associated with wheeze (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.09-5.06), dyspnea (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.24-3.23) and rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.11-2.38). Mould was associated with rhinitis (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.06-3.38). Window pane condensation was associated with wheeze (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.13-5.98) and rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.08-2.67). Biomass burning was associated with wheeze, dyspnoea, rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis. In conclusion, household dampness and pollution from domestic biomass burning can increase asthma symptoms and rhinitis symptoms in students in northern Thailand.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Banxia Xiexin decoction (BXD) is a classic Chinese herbal formulation consisting of 7 herbs including Pinelliae Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Ginseng Radix, Glycyrrhizae Radix, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Jujubae Fructus, which can exert effects on lowering lipids and alleviating depressive mood disorders via affecting gastrointestinal tract.Aim of the study: The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (AS) co-depression disease has not been well studied, and the current clinical treatment strategies are not satisfactory. As a result, it is critical to find novel methods of treatment. Based on the hypothesis that the gut microbiome may promote the development of AS co-depression disease by regulating host lipid metabolism, this study sought to evaluate the effectiveness and action mechanism of BXD in regulation of the gut microbiome via an intervention in AS co-depression mice.Materials and methods: To determine the primary constituents of BXD, UPLC-Q/TOF-MS analysis was carried out. Sixteen C56BL/6 mice were fed normal chow as a control group; 64 ApoE-/- mice were randomized into four groups (model group and three treatment groups) and fed high-fat chow combined with daily bind stimulation for sixteen weeks to develop the AS co-depression mouse model and were administered saline or low, medium or high concentrations of BXD during the experimental modeling period. The antidepressant efficacy of BXD was examined by weighing, a sucrose preference test, an open field test, and a tail suspension experiment. The effectiveness of BXD as an anti-AS treatment was evaluated by means of biochemical indices, the HE staining method, and the Oil red O staining method. The impacts of BXD on the gut microbiome structure and brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex tissue) lipids in mice with the AS co-depression model were examined by 16S rDNA sequencing combined with lipidomics analysis.Results: The main components of BXD include baicalin, berberine, ginsenoside Rb1, and 18 other substances. BXD could improve depression-like behavioral characteristics and AS-related indices in AS co-depression mice; BXD could regulate the abundance of some flora (phylum level: reduced abundance of Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres; genus level: reduced abundance of Clostridium_IV, Helicobacter, and Pseudoflavonifractor, Acetatifactor, Oscillibacter, which were significantly different). The lipidomics analysis showed that the differential lipids between the model and gavaged high-dose BXD (BXH) groups were enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC(20:3)(rep)(rep)) in the hippocampus and LPC(20:4)(rep) in the prefrontal

AB  - Although we can learn new information while asleep, we usually cannot consciously remember the sleep-formed memories - presumably because learning occurred in an unconscious state. Here, we ask whether sleep-learning expedites the subsequent awake-learning of the same information. To answer this question, we reanalyzed data (Zust et al., 2019, Curr Biol) from napping participants, who learned new semantic associations between pseudowords and translation-words (guga-ship) while in slow-wave sleep. They retrieved sleep-formed associations unconsciously on an implicit memory test following awakening. Then, participants took five runs of paired-associative learning to probe carry-over effects of sleep-learning on awake-learning. Surprisingly, sleeplearning diminished awake-learning when participants learned semantic associations that were congruent to sleep-learned associations (guga-boat). Yet, learning associations that conflicted with sleep-learned associations (guga-coin) was unimpaired relative to learning new associations (resun-table; baseline). We speculate that the impeded wake-learning originated in a deficient synaptic downscaling and resulting synaptic saturation in neurons that were activated during both sleep-learning and awake-learning.

AB  - Seneca Valley virus (SVV) causes vesicular disease in pigs, posing a threat to global pork production. OPTN (optineurin) is a macroautophagy/autophagy receptor that restricts microbial propagation by targeting specific viral or bacterial proteins for degradation. OPTN is degraded and cleaved at glutamine 513 following SVV infection via the activity of viral 3C protease (3C[pro]), resulting in N-terminal and a C-terminal OPTN fragments. Moreover, OPTN interacts with VP1 and targets VP1 for degradation to inhibit viral replication. The N-terminal cleaved OPTN sustained its interaction with VP1, whereas the degradation capacity targeting VP1 decreased. The inhibitory effect of N-terminal OPTN against SVV infection was significantly reduced, C-terminal OPTN failed to inhibit viral replication, and degradation of VP1 was blocked. The knockdown of OPTN resulted in reduced TBK1 activation and phosphorylation of IRF3, whereas overexpression of OPTN led to increased TBK1-IRF3 signaling. Additionally, the N-terminal OPTN diminished the activation of the type I IFN (interferon) pathway. These results show that SVV 3C[pro] targets OPTN because its cleavage impairs its function in selective autophagy and type I IFN production, revealing a novel model in which the virus develops diverse strategies for evading host autophagic machinery and type I IFN response for survival.Abbreviations: Co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; GFP-green fluorescent protein; hpi: hours post-infection; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; IFN: interferon; IFNB/IFN-beta: interferon beta; IRF3: interferon regulatory factor 3; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MOI: multiplicity of infection; OPTN: optineurin; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; SVV: Seneca Valley virus; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; TBK1: TANK binding kinase 1; TCID50: 50% tissue culture infectious doses; UBAN: ubiquitin binding in TNIP/ABIN (TNFAIP3/A20 and inhibitor of NFKB/NF-kB) and IKBKG/NEMO; UBD: ubiquitin-binding domain; ZnF: zinc finger.

AB  - Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5), a glycolytic enzyme, plays an important role in cell death and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. In this study, we investigated the effects of PGAM5 on oxidative stress in HT22 hippocampal cells and ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampus to elucidate the role of PGAM5 in oxidative and ischemic stress. Constructs were designed with a PEP-1 expression vector to facilitate the intracellular delivery of PGAM5 proteins. We observed time-and concentration-dependent increases in the intracellular delivery of the PEP-1-PGAM5 protein, but not its control protein (PGAM5), in HT22 cells, and morphologically demonstrated the localization of the transduced protein, which was stably expressed in the cytoplasm after 12 h of PEP1-PGAM5 treatment. PEP-1-PGAM5 treatment significantly ameliorated cell death, reactive oxygen species formation, DNA fragmentation, and the reduction of cell proliferation induced by H2O2 treatment in HT22 cells. In addition, PEP-1-PGAM5 was effectively delivered to the gerbil hippocampus 8 h after treatment, and ischemiainduced hyperlocomotion and neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region were significantly alleviated 1 and 4 days after ischemia, respectively. Ischemia-induced microglial activation was also mitigated by treatment with 1.0 mg/kg PEP-1-PGAM5. At 3 h after ischemia, PEP-1-PGAM5 treatment significantly ameliorated the increase in lipid peroxidation, as assessed by malondialdehyde and hydroperoxide levels, and decreased glutathione levels (increases in glutathione disulfide, the oxidized form of glutathione) in the hippocampus. Two days after ischemia, treatment with PEP-1-PGAM5 significantly alleviated the ischemia-induced reduction in glutathione peroxidase activity and further increased superoxide dismutase activity in the hippocampus. The neuroprotective effects of PEP-1-PGAM5 are partially mediated by a reduction in oxidative stress, such as the formation of reactive oxygen species, and increases in the activity of antioxidants such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase.

AB  - The aim of the experiment was to assess the content of N-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn) in dried Sea buckthorn berries (SB) when fed to Ross 308 broiler chickens. Two experimental diets (basal and basal + 12 g/kg dried and milled SB berries) were fed to an equal number of replicated pens (n=8; two birds in each) from 7 to 21d age, following randomisation. The basal diet was formulated to meet breeder's recommendations. The inclusion of dried SB berries at 12 g/kg diet, did not significantly (P>0.05) affect broiler chicken growth performance, dietary nutrient availability or AMEn. Using the substitution method, it was found that the AMEn of the dried SB berries was 14.29 MJ/ kg DM. Although relatively high in AMEn, the absence of starch in SB berries, suggests SB berries are not a suitable substitute for cereals in poultry diets, but further research on their health benefits as a minor supplement for poultry diets is warranted.

AB  - Neuronal damage in the hippocampus induced by high glucose has been shown to promote the onset and development of cognitive impairment in diabetes, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Guided by single-cell RNA sequencing, we here report that high glucose increases O-GlcNAcylation of Bmal1 in hippocampal neurons. This glycosylation promotes the binding of Clock to Bmal1, resulting in the expression of transcription factor Bhlhe41 and its target Dnajb4. Upregulated Dnajb4 in turn leads to ubiquitination and degradation of the mitochondrial Na + /Ca2+ exchanger NCLX, thereby inducing mitochondrial calcium overload that causes neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in mice. Notably, Bhlhe41 downregulation or treatment with a short peptide that specifically blocks O-GlcNAcylation of Bmal1 on Ser424 mitigated these adverse effects in diabetic mouse models. These data highlight the crucial role of O-GlcNAcylation in circadian clock gene expression and may facilitate the design of targeted therapies for diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.
   The molecular mechanism of high-glucose-induced cognitive impairment in diabetes remains unclear. This work demonstrates that high glucose levels increase Bmal1 O-GlcNAcylation and cause mitochondrial calcium overload and neuronal damage via a Bhlhe41/Dnajb4/NCLX signaling pathway.High- glucose-mediated Bmal1 O-GlcNAcylation upregulates expression of Bhlhe41 and Dnajb4, which promote ubiquitination and degradation of NCLX in hippocampal neurons.Decreased NCLX expression in high-glucose conditions promotes mitochondrial calcium overload and subsequent hippocampal neuron damage.A short synthetic peptide, S424-pe, protects against high-glucose-induced neuronal apoptosis and cognitive dysfunction in mice by inhibiting Bmal1 S424 O-GlcNAcylation.
   High-glucose-mediated Bmal1-OGlcNAcylation impairs cognitive function in diabetic mice by inducing mitochondrial calcium overload and neuronal damage.

AB  - In livestock, selection programs on reproductive traits are time consuming due to long generation interval and low heritability; however understanding the genetic factors that influence reproductive performance facilitates an accurate selection and genetic improvement of these quantitative traits. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the effect of lactation order and polymorphisms of FGFBP1, leptin , k-casein, and alpha s1-casein genes on reproductive performance in dromedary she-camels. Blood samples were collected from one hundred she-camels using vacutainer tube containing EDTA as an anticoagulant for DNA extraction. PCR-DNA sequencing approach was performed to investigate the polymorphisms in fragments for coding sequence (CDS) parts of FGFBP1 (539-bp) and leptin (359-bp), 5'-flanking region of k-casein (488-bp) and intervening non-coding fragment spanning from exon 4 to exon 6 (924-bp) of alpha s1-casein genes. Results revealed that there were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the investigated genes between enrolled she-camels except for leptin gene that elicited a monomorphic pattern. The identified SNPs allocated camels into different groups according to which animal harbored the explored SNPs. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) reveled that identified SNPs and parity order had significant effects on age at first calving (AFC), days open (DO), calving interval (CI), number of services/conception (NS/C) and milk yield traits. Determination coefficients (R-2) value indicated also that variability in the phenotypic measurements of studied traits might be correlated with the identified SNPs in the reproduction related genes. This study highlights that parity order has a remarkable effect on reproductive performance. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the investigated genes could be also used as proxy predictors and genetic markers that permit a marker assisted selection for reproductive performance traits in dromedary she-camels.

AB  - Objective To describe and study the population statistics, hearing phenotype, and pathological changes of a porcine congenital single-sided deafness (CSSD) pedigree. Methods Click auditory brainstem response (ABR), full-frequency ABR, and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) were used to assess the hearing phenotype of the strain. Tympanogram was used to assess the middle ear function since birth. Celloidin embedding-hematoxylin-eosin (CE-HE) stain and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to study the pathological changes of cochlear microstructures. Chi-square analysis was used to analyze the relation between hearing loss and other phenotypes. Results The mating mood of CSSD with CSSD was most efficient in breeding-targeted CSSD phenotype (47.62%), and the prevalence of CSSD reached 46.67% till the fifth generation, where 42.22% were bilateral hearing loss (BHL) and 9.00% were normal hearing (NH) individuals. Hearing loss was proved to have no relation with coat color (P = 0.0841 > 0.05) and gender (P = 0.4621 > 0.05) by chi-square analysis. The deaf side of CSSD offspring in the fifth generation had no relation with that of their maternal parent (P = 0.2387 > 0.05). All individuals in this strain exhibited congenital severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with no malformation and dysfunction of the middle ear. The good hearing ear of CSSD stayed stable over age. The deaf side of CSSD and BHL presented cochlear and saccular degeneration, and the hair cell exhibited malformation since birth and degenerated from the apex to base turn through time. The pathology in BHL cochlea progressed more rapidly than CSSD and till P30, the hair cell had been totally gone. The stria vascularis (SV) was normal since birth and degenerated through time and finally exhibited disorganization of three layers of cells. Conclusion This inbred porcine strain exhibited high and stable prevalence of CSSD, which highly resembled human non-syndromic CSSD disease. This porcine model could be used to further explore the etiology of CSSD and serve as an ideal tool for the studies of the effects of single-sided hearing deprivation on neural, cognitive, and behavioral developments and the benefits brought by CI in CSSD individuals.

AB  - The maturation of oocytes has an important impact on the subsequent development of the embryo. However, during the in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes, oocytes are separated from the follicular environment, resulting in a low maturation rate of oocytes in vitro. In order to improve maturation rate of IVM of porcine oocytes, this study was conducted to investigate using sodium alginate (SA) to encapsulate porcine mural granulosa cells (MGs) to develop an SA three-dimensional (3D) co-culture system for IVM of porcine oocytes. And, gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential, parthenogenetic activation development results of cultured oocytes, and as well as ROS and glutathione (GSH) levels in cumulus granulosa cells (CGs) were detected. Our results showed that the maturation rate of the SA 3D co-culture group was 85.41 %, that of the negative control (NC) group was 79.24 %, and that of the MGs co-culture group was 81.62 %. In SA 3D co-culture group, mitochondrial membrane potential level of oocytes was 1.6, ROS level was 19 and the ATP level was 1.7. While in NC group, mitochondrial membrane potential level of oocytes was 1.2, the ROS level was 52, and the ATP level was 0.4. The ROS level in the CGs of SA 3D co-culture group decreased by 1.5 times, and the glutathione content increased by 2.3 times. In the SA 3D co-culture group, GDF9 gene expression level was 2.0, and BMP15 gene expression level was 1.2. While in NC group, GDF9 gene expression level was 0.7, and BMP15 gene expression level was 0.6. The blastocyst rate in the SA 3D co-culture group was 41.4 %, and that in the NC group was 36.6 %. In conclusion, encapsulating MGs in SA gel and co-culturing them with porcine oocytes in 3D during IVM can improve the developmental potential of oocytes. This result will provide an important reference for improving the methods of in vitro maturation of oocytes.

AB  - High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 mu mx100 mu mx200 mu m resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

AB  - A new functional deficit caused by a stroke can be understood as a situation of uncertainty that has to prompt deficit discovery and subsequent incorporation into an altered selfperception. Anosognosia for visual field deficits is frequent after stroke. For hemiplegia, patients' performance in a riddle test provided evidence that the inability to generate and adjust beliefs in face of uncertainty contributes to anosognosia for hemiplegia. In this prospective study, the same riddles are used in patients with homonymous hemianopia due to a first-ever stroke in the posterior cerebral artery territory and in an age-matched control cohort. The riddles create a situation of uncertainty that is resolved with five successive clues which progressively delimit the target word. After each clue, patients have to guess the target word and rate their confidence in the answer's correctness. Patients were tested once during the hospital stay. According to the Bisiach score for anosognosia, 12 out of 29 patients were unaware of their visual field deficits. All patients with anosognosia for hemianopia had right hemisphere lesions. Patients with and without anosognosia did not differ significantly in global cognitive impairment, mental flexibility or memory function. Importantly, patients with anosognosia showed higher confidence ratings than patients without anosognosia and controls in the first two clues (situations of uncertainty). This was demonstrated by a significant interaction effect in a mixed ANOVA with the factors group (anosognosia, nosognosia, controls) and riddle clues. An exploratory lesion subtraction analysis showed a high proportion of deficit unawareness in patients with lesions in the right fusiform and (para)hippocampal gyri. Our findings suggest that overconfidence in situations of uncertainty might contribute to the appearance of anosognosia for hemianopia. Because this has been demonstrated before in anosognosia for hemiplegia, we suggest that overconfidence is a supra-modal contributor to deficit unawareness. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Cisplatin (CP) as an important chemotherapeutic drug is used for the treatment of various malignancies; but it has some side effects on central nervous system, in particular hippocampus. The present study was aimed to determine the protective effects of Aloe vera (AV) gel on CP-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and neurons structure changes in the hippocampus of rats. Forty-eight rats were divided into six groups including control, CP (5.00 mg kg-1 per week; intraperitoneally), CP + AV (400 mg kg-1 per day; orally), CP + metformin (200 mg kg-1 per day; orally), AV (400 mg kg-1 per day; orally) and metformin (200 mg kg-1 per day; orally). At the end of treatment, brain samples were obtained for analysis of apoptotic genes expression and anti-oxidant markers as well as histological study. The results showed that CP caused an increase in malondialdehyde level and a decrease in glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase levels in CP group compared to control. The AV gel could diminish oxidative stress in the hippocampus of CP group and it resulted in down-regulation of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-8 and up regulation of Bcl-2 in CP group. It could ameliorate degenerative changes in hippocampus after exposure to CP. Our results showed that AV gel ameliorated oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of rats under CP treatment. (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Canine circovirus is a deadly pathogen of dogs and causes vasculitis and hemorrhagic enteritis. It causes lethal gastroenteritis in pigs, fox, and dogs. Canine circovirus genome contains two main (and opposite) transcription units which encode two open reading frames (ORFs), a replicase-associated protein (Rep) and the capsid (Cap) protein. The replicase protein and capsid protein consist of 303 amino acids and 270 amino acids respectively. Several immuno-informatics methods such as epitope screening, molecular docking, and molecular-dynamics simulations were used to craft peptide-based vaccine construct against canine circovirus. Results The vaccine construct was designed by joining the selected epitopes with adjuvants by suitable linker. The cloning and expression of the vaccine construct was also performed using in silico methods. Screening of epitopes was conducted by NetMHC server that uses ANN (Artificial neural networking) algorithm. These methods are fast and cost-effective for screening epitopes that can interact with dog leukocyte antigens (DLA) and initiate an immune response. Overall, 5 epitopes, YQHLPPFRF, YIRAKWINW, ALYRRLTLI, HLQGFVNLK, and GTMNFVARR, were selected and used to design a vaccine construct. The molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies show that these epitopes can bind with DLA molecules with stability. The codon adaptation and in silico cloning studies show that the vaccine can be expressed by Escherichia coli K12 strain. Conclusion The results suggest that the vaccine construct can be useful in preventing the dogs from canine circovirus infections. However, the results need further validation by performing other in vitro and in vivo experiments.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the crystallographic, functional group and microstructural analysis of elephant grass biochar reinforced hybrid polystyrene composite doped with aluminium. The composites were prepared by the mixing and hand-layup technique. Composites were characterised by x-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope. It was observed that crystallographic properties of the composite were improved by aluminium doping. Crystallite size and d-spacing were found to decrease from 6.3542 to 5.2453 nm and 3.183 to 2.362 angstrom respectively due to 8% aluminium doping. Functional group analysis revealed that doping affected interactions between biochar and polystyrene resin. Microstructural analysis revealed that dispersion was optimal at 2% doping and interfacial adhesion was optimal at 8% doping.

AB  - Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCMs) are ubiquitous in low-latitude oceans, and of recognized biogeochemical and ecological importance. DCMs have been observed in the Southern Ocean, initially from ships and recently from profiling robotic floats, but with less understanding of their onset, duration, underlying drivers, or whether they are associated with enhanced biomass features. We report the characteristics of a DCM and a Deep Biomass Maximum (DBM) in the Inter-Polar-Frontal-Zone (IPFZ) south of Australia derived from CTD profiles, shipboard-incubated samples, a towbody, and a BGC-ARGO float. The DCM and DBM were similar to 20 m thick and co-located with the nutricline, in the vicinity of a subsurface ammonium maximum characteristic of the IPFZ, but similar to 100 m shallower than the ferricline. Towbody transects demonstrated that the co-located DCM/DBM was broadly present across the IPFZ. Large healthy diatoms, with low iron requirements, resided within the DCM/DBM, and fixed up to 20 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). The BGC-ARGO float revealed that DCM/DBM persisted for >3 months. We propose a dual environmental mechanism to drive DCM/DBM formation and persistence within the IPFZ: sustained supply of both recycled iron within the subsurface ammonium maxima, and upward silicate transport from depth. DCM/DBM cell-specific growth rates were considerably slower than those in the overlying mixed layer, implying that phytoplankton losses such as herbivory are also reduced, possibly because of heavily silicified diatom frustules. The light-limited seasonal termination of the observed DCM/DBM did not result in a "diatom dump", rather ongoing diatom downward export occurred throughout its multi-month persistence.

AB  - Prickly acacia, Vachellia nilotica subsp. indica (Benth.) Kyal. & Boatwr. (Fabaceae), native to India, is a target for biological control in Australia. Native range insecticide exclusion studies were conducted at two sites (Coimbatore and Thoppur) in India to evaluate the impact of insect herbivores on prickly acacia, to prioritise agents. At each site, prickly acacia plants were either exposed to or protected from insect herbivores and the incidence of insects were recorded at quarterly intervals. More insect species occurred at Thoppur (12) than at Coimbatore (9) and among them the scale insect Anomalococcus indicus Ayyar (Hemiptera: Lecanodiaspididae) was the predominant species at both sites. Insect herbivory significantly reduced plant height, basal stem diameter, number of branches, the number of leaves, and stem biomass at Coimbatore, while the impact was evident only for plant height at Thoppur. However, there were significant reductions in plant height (38-55%), basal stem diameter (20-31%), number of branches (21-45%), number of leaves (79-99%), leaf biomass (81-96%), stem biomass (67-84%) and root biomass (61-84%) in plants infested with A. indicus than in plants without A. indicus in insects excluded plots. Infestation by A. indicus resulted in 18 and 27% plant mortality in Coimbatore and Thoppur, respectively. Based on potential impact, A. indicus was prioritised for importation and detailed host-specificity testing in Australia.

AB  - Computer vision enables the development of new approaches to monitor the behavior, health, and welfare of animals. Instance segmentation is a high-precision method in computer vision for detecting individual animals of interest. This method can be used for in-depth analysis of animals, such as examining their subtle interactive behaviors, from videos and images. However, existing deep-learning-based instance segmentation methods have been mostly developed based on public datasets, which largely omit heavy occlusion problems; therefore, these methods have limitations in real-world applications involving object occlusions, such as farrowing pen systems used on pig farms in which the farrowing crates often impede the sow and piglets. In this paper, we adapt a Center Clustering Network originally designed for counting to achieve instance segmentation, dubbed as CClusnet-Inseg. Specifically, CClusnet-Inseg uses each pixel to predict object centers and trace these centers to form masks based on clustering results, which consists of a network for segmentation and center offset vector map, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, Centers-to-Mask (C2M), and Remain-Centers-to-Mask (RC2M) algorithms. In all, 4,600 images were extracted from six videos collected from three closed and three half-open farrowing crates to train and validate our method. CClusnet-Inseg achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 84.1 and outperforms all other methods compared in this study. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of core modules of our method. In addition, we apply CClusnet-Inseg to multi-object tracking for animal monitoring, and the predicted object center that is a conjunct output could serve as an occlusion-resistant representation of the location of an object.

AB  - Background: Scattered tubular-like cells (STCs) are dedifferentiated renal tubular cells endowed with progenitor-like characteristics to repair injured parenchymal cells. STCs may be damaged and rendered ineffective by renal artery stenosis (RAS), but the underlying processes remain unclear. We hypothesized that RAS alters the epigenetic landscape on DNA and the ensuing gene transcriptional profile of swine STCs. Methods: CD24+/CD133+ STCs were isolated from pig kidneys after 10 weeks of RAS or sham (n = 3 each) and their whole 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profiles were examined by 5mC and 5hmC immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-/hMeDIP-seq, respectively). A subsequent integrated (MeDIP/hMeDIP-seq/mRNA-seq) analysis was performed by comparing all online available gene sets using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Apoptosis, proteolysis, and mitochondrial structure and function were subsequently evaluated in vitro. Results: Differential expression (DE) analysis revealed 239 genes with higher and 236 with lower 5mC levels and 275 genes with higher and 315 with lower 5hmC levels in RAS-STCs compared to Normal-STCs (fold change >= 1.4 or <= 0.7, p <= 0.05). Integrated MeDIP-/hMeDIP-seq/mRNA-seq analysis identified several overlapping (DE-5mC/mRNA and DE-5hmC/mRNA levels) genes primarily implicated in apoptosis, proteolysis, and mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, RAS-STCs exhibited decreased apoptosis, mitochondrial matrix density, and ATP production, and increased intracellular amino acid concentration and ubiquitin expression. Conclusions: Renal ischemia induces epigenetic changes in apoptosis-, proteolysis-, and mitochondria-related genes, which correlate with alterations in the transcriptomic profile and corresponding function of swine STCs. These observations may contribute to developing novel targeted interventions to preserve the reparative potency of STCs in renal disease.

AB  - Using anatomical and histological methods, we studied the norm and pathological changes in the skin of 12 Baikal seals of different ages (Pusa sibirica) (alopecia, ulcers, scars, etc.). Similar changes are usually observed in many seals appearing on coastal rookeries. Norm: the skin has a folded epidermis on the body and flippers. Hyperkeratosis of the epithelium is noted. No border between the papillary and reticular layers of the dermis is expressed. The papillary layer is formed by thin bundles of collagen fibers, the reticular layer by thick bundles of collagen fibers. In the reticular layer of the skin of the body, there are powerful, numerous bundles of smooth muscles. The dermis of the skin of the flippers is thinner in comparison with the dermis of the skin of the body. In the skin of the body, the sebaceous glands are small and multi- lobed; each hair bundle is usually surrounded by two such glands. The lower secretory sections of the apocrine sweat glands are weakly convoluted and tubular, being located in the deep layers of the reticular dermis and in the adipose tissue separately from the hair follicles and next to the network of blood vessels. Their narrow excretory ducts open into the funnel of the hair at the level of its upper third. In the skin of the flippers, large convoluted apocrine glands are located at the level of the lower sections of the bulbs of the guard hairs, elongated polymorphic excretory ducts of the sebaceous glands open into the hair bags. Morphophysiological adaptations of the skin of seals, contributing to the improvement of its hydrodynamic, thermoregulatory and sun-protective properties, are discussed. Pathology: two main complexes of skin pathologies in seals have been identified: (1) koilocytosis, subepidermal inflammation (the infiltrate is represented by lymphocytes with a small admixture of histiocytes), lymphocyte exocytosis in hair follicles with spongiosis; (2) formation of a subepidermal blister with neutrophilic infiltration in the papillary layer of the dermis. These pathologies may be associated with global warming and changes in the ice regime of Lake Baikal, which may have led to the development of immune inflammatory processes in the skin. The effect of an unknown viral pathogen that caused koilocytosis in seals cannot be ruled out.

AB  - Kumquat, the main economic fruit of Guangxi, China was selected as the research object of this study. Pot and field experiments were conducted to systematically study the safe utilization of Cd- and Pb-contaminated orchard soil, which is a typical karst zone surrounding a historical Pb-Zn mining area in Yangshuo County, Guilin City, Guangxi Province. The pot experiment compared the Cd and Pb accumulation ability of different kumquat cultivars. The results showed that Cuipi (CP) had a lower Cd and Pb accumulation ability. Compared with Yingmu (YM), the Cd and Pb contents of CP leaves were reduced by 39.71% and 32.83%, respectively. In the field experiment (one year), CP with low accumulation was combined with 0.5% amendments including rice husk biochar (RB), pig manure (PB), soil conditioner (SC), and organic fertilizer (OF) in real Cd- and Pbcontaminated kumquat orchard soils. The results showed that all amendments reduced non-carcinogenic health risks and improved agricultural sustainability. In terms of health risk reduction, the amendments significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd and Pb in fruit of CP. In particular, RB decreased Cd and Pb by 76.90% and 25.59%, respectively, achieving the highest health risk reduction (37.16%). Moreover, RB is more advantageous owing to its low cost. To determine agricultural sustainability, the soil quality and kumquat production were evaluated. After adding amendments, the available Cd and Pb contents in soil decreased by 42.19-60.94% and 41.64-57.79%, respectively. SC and OF improved soil quality more effectively, while RB increased the fruit biomass and the basic quality of CP. Comprehensive analysis, RB has more advantages. The mechanism of immobilization by the different amendments was further analyzed.

This study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the remediation of heavy metal-contaminated orchard soil.

AB  - Prolonged inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure is widely associated with brain damage particularly in the hippo-campus via oxidative and apoptotic pathways. Resveratrol (RES) has gained considerable attention because of its benefits to human health. However, its neuroprotective potential against iAs-induced toxicity in CA1 region of hippocampus remains unexplored.
   Therefore, we investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of RES against arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-induced adverse effects on neuronal morphology, apoptotic markers and oxidative stress parameters in mouse CA1 region (hippocampus).
   Adult female Swiss albino mice of reproductive maturity were orally exposed to either As2O3 (2 and 4 mg/kg bw) alone or in combination with RES (40 mg/kg bw) for a period of 45 days. After animal sacrifice on day 46, the perfusion fixed brain samples were used for the observation of neuronal morphology and studying the morphometric features. While the freshly dissected hippocampi were processed for biochemical estimation of oxidative stress markers and western blotting of apoptosis-associated proteins.
   Chronic iAs exposure led to significant decrease in Stratum Pyramidale layer thickness along with reduction in cell density and area of Pyramidal neurons in contrast to the controls. Biochemical analysis showed reduced hippocampal GSH content but no change in total nitrite (NO) levels following iAs exposure. Western blotting showed apparent changes in the expression levels of Box and Bcl-2 proteins following iAs exposure, however the change was statistically insignificant. Contrastingly, iAs +RES co-treatment exhibited substantial reversal in morphological and biochemical observations.
   Together, these findings provide preliminary evidence of neuroprotective role of RES on structural and biochemical alterations pertaining to mouse hippocampus following chronic iAs exposure.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in immune response against viral infections and tumors. However, further investigation is needed to better understand the key molecules responsible for determining the fate and function of NK cells. In this study, we made an important discovery regarding the involvement of the Hippo kinases Mst1 and Mst2 as novel regulators in maintaining mouse NK cell homeostasis. The presence of high Mst1 and Mst2 (Mst1/2) activity in NK cells is essential for their proper development, survival and function in a canonical Hippo signaling independent mode. Mechanistically, Mst1/2 induce cellular quiescence by regulating the processes of proliferation and mitochondrial metabolism, thereby ensuring the development and survival of NK cells. Furthermore, Mst1/2 effectively sense IL-15 signaling and facilitate the activation of pSTAT3-TCF1, which contributes to NK cell homeostasis. Overall, our investigation highlights the crucial role of Mst1/2 as key regulators in metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation for mouse NK cell survival and function, emphasizing the significance of cellular quiescence during NK cell development and functional maturation.

AB  - Depression, recognized globally as a primary cause of disability, has its pathogenesis closely related to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Arctiin (ARC), the major bioactive component of Fructus arctii, has various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Building on previous findings that highlighted ARC's capability to mitigate depression by dampening microglial hyperactivation and thereby reducing neuroinflammatory responses and cortical neuronal damage in mice, the current study delves deeper into ARC's therapeutic potential by examining its impact on hippocampal neuronal damage in depression. Utilizing both chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression model in mice and corticosterone (CORT)-stimulated PC12 cell model of neuronal damage, the techniques including Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase assays, colony formation assays, immunofluorescence staining and molecular docking were employed to unravel the mechanisms behind ARC's neuroprotective effects. The findings revealed that ARC not only mitigates hippocampal neuropathological damage and reduces serum CORT levels in CUMS-exposed mice but also enhances cell activity while reducing lactate dehydrogenase release in CORT-stimulated PC12 cells. ARC attenuated neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the overactivation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)/NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathway, similar to the effect of A438079 (P2X7R antagonist). Interestingly, pretreatment with A438079 blocked the neuroprotective effect of ARC. Computer modeling predicted that both ARC and A438079 have strong binding with P2X7R and they have the same binding site. These results suggested that ARC may exert a neuroprotective role by binding to P2X7R, thereby inhibiting the P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway.

AB  - Enhancement of neuronal plasticity by small-molecule therapeutics protects cognitive skills and also ameliorates progressive neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. One such compound, a novel histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) inhibitor named JRM-28, was shown here to enhance dendritic strength, augment spine density, and upregulate post-synaptic neurotransmission in hippocampal neurons. The molecular basis for this effect correlates with JRM-28-induced upregulation of the transcription of cAMP response element-binding protein(CREB), induction of its transcriptional activity, and subsequent stimulation of expressions of CREB-dependent plasticity-associated genes, such as those encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1. Specifically, JRM-28 stimulated the NMDA- and AMPA-receptor-sensitive ionotropic calcium influx in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, JRM-28 did not induce NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive calcium influx in hippocampal neurons once the expression of CREB was knocked down by creb siRNA, suggesting the critical role of CREB in JRM-28-mediated upregulation of synaptic plasticity. Finally, JRM-28 upregulated CREB mRNA, CREB-dependent plasticity-associated markers, and ionotropic calcium influx in iPSC-derived AD human neurons, indicating its therapeutic implications in the amelioration of AD pathologies.

AB  - Repeated maternal separation (MS) is a useful experimental model in rodents for studying the long-term influence of early-life stress on brain neurophysiology. In our work, we assessed the effect of repeated MS (postnatal day (PND)1-21, 180 min/day) on the postnatal development of rat brain regions involved in memory using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) for tissue volume and the level of amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus. We assessed whether these effects are sex dependent. We also use novel object recognition (NOR) task to examine the effect of MS on memory and the effect of ethanol on it. Finally, we attempted to ameliorate postnatal stress-induced memory deficits by using VU-29, a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the metabotropic glutamate type 5 (mGlu5) receptor. In males, we noted deficits in the levels of glutamate, glycine and glutamine and increases in GABA in the hippocampus. In addition, the values of perirhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and insular cortex and CA3 were decreased in these animals. MS females, in contrast, demonstrated significant increase in glutamate levels and decrease in GABA levels in the hippocampus. Here, the CA1 values alone were increased. VU-29 administration ameliorated these cognitive deficits. Thus, MS stress disturbs amino acids levels mainly in the hippocampus of adult male rats, and enhancement of glutamate neurotransmission reversed recognition memory deficits in these animals.

AB  - Caviomorpha are an exceptional group among rodents due to their extended gestational period and the delivery of precocial offspring. Among them, Lagostomus maximus is characterized by its polyovulation, polyembryony, and the highest embryonic death known in mammals. Its chorioallantoic placenta is hemomonochorial, an ancestral character among rodents. It resembles more the human placenta than the murine models. As in all caviomophs, the chorioallantoic placenta is divided in a main placenta and a subplacenta. The former is organized in labyrinth lobes surrounded by trophospongium, as in most caviomorphs. The giant cells (more numerous than in other caviomorphs) near the decidua could be related to invasiveness. During placentation of L. maximus, uterine natural killer cells are found. These cells have been related to invasiveness and remodeling of blood vessels in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, although in other caviomorphs are not frequently found. In L. maximus, the placenta develops in all conceptuses (5-6 per uterine horn). Necrosis was observed in each implantation site at day 70 post-coitum, except in that closest to the vagina in each horn. This process of embryo death followed by resorption begins at day 26-30 post-coitum. Recently, we found variations in the percentage of blood vessel and uterine gland areas that could explain the regional differences in embryo survival. The characteristics of the placenta and implantation of L. maximus are important to stablish a unique model for studying placentation as well as early embryonic death, of interest for human and veterinary medicine.

AB  - Field host-range surveys and fixed plot trials were undertaken in Jamaica to gain an understanding of the host range of the fly Melanagromyza eupatoriella (Diptera: Agromyzidae), a potential biological control agent of the neotropical shrub Chromolaena odorata in South Africa. The fly larvae form helical mines in growing, vegetative stem tips, causing them to wilt and die. Seventy-seven sites at which C. odorata was present along with 30 other species of Asteraceae were surveyed for the presence of damage similar to that caused by M. eupatoriella. Twelve of these sites, chosen for the high (>10) number of M. eupatoriella mines present on C. odorata, were used to determine the abundance of 19 Asteraceae species encountered and the proportion of shoot tips with helical mines on each of these species. Similar mines were found on six species other than C. odorata: Mikania micrantha, M. cordifolia, Bidens alba, B. pilosa, B. reptans and Calea jamaicensis. Damaged plant material was field-collected from M. micrantha, C. odorata and B. alba and the causative herbivores (all Agromyzidae) were preserved for identification. Mines on Mikania species were longer than those caused by M. eupatoriella, and the species collected from M. micrantha was tentatively identified as Melanagromyza vulgata. Helical shoot-tip mines on Bidens species continued internally to completion further down the stem, unlike those of M. eupatoriella, where pupation occurs near the base of the helical mine. Only adult females were reared out of B. alba, therefore the fly could only be identified as a Melanagromyza species. The proportion of shoot tips with helical mines was highest on the two Mikania species, intermediate on C. odorata, and lowest on B. alba. For the quantitative, 12-site survey, five plant species in addition to C. odorata were present at four or more sites, and were significantly less likely than C. odorata to host M. eupatoriella. A fixed-plot trial was undertaken using two forms of C. odorata (plants from Jamaica and the southern African biotype), six Asteraceae (all encountered in the host-range sur-veys) and two crop species. Over 19 months, both C. odorata forms were attacked by M. eupatoriella and one mine was encountered on B. alba. The surveys, trials and identification of insects indicate that shoot-tip mines caused by M. eupatoriella were encountered only on C. odorata, out of 31 Asteraceae and two other plant species. Further laboratory-based host-range trials are required, should there be a need for this insect as a biocontrol agent in future.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are more than 200 nucleotides in length. Emerging evidence suggest that lncRNAs by regulating gene expression can act as key regulators of diverse biological processes in plants. The identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs associated with drought tolerance/susceptibility is important to study and understand the complex regulation of drought responses of the tea plant. In this study, we identified 21,241 lncRNAs based on computational analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data of Camellia sinensis, among them 1395 lncRNAs were identified as drought specific. Some of these drought specific lncRNAs acts as target mimic of known mRNAs or putative targets for many already reported abiotic stress responsive microRNAs (miRNAs). One hundred and thirty two lncRNAs of tea were predicted to act as potential endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for 136 transcripts, which includes stress responsive transcription factors (TFs) such as GAMYB, RAP2-7 and MYC2. KEGG pathway analyses of the genes for which 132 lncRNAs act as eTMs showed highest number of genes in purine and thiamine metabolism pathways. This study gives an overview of the drought responsive lncRNAs and their possible functional roles in tea during drought stress conditions.

AB  - Insects are a threat to plants and cause havoc in considerable ways. Interestingly, a group of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) are found to be associated with the regulatory processes of plants both in pre and post-infestation scenarios either elevating or demoting expression levels of different genes involved in plant-insect interaction. Studies show roles of a number of miRNAs during plant-insect interaction targeting a range of genes from transcription factors (TFs) to genes involved in plant growth and development, from transmembrane receptors to molecules involved in various signalling pathways. The role of miRNAs in regulating phytohormone signalling show the complex interaction of miRNA/mRNA modules in plant-insect herbivory. Biotechnological approaches involving RNAi strategy prove to be successful in eradicating pests. In this review, we have discussed the progress made so far in understanding the role of miRNAs in plant insect interactions and artificial miRNA (amiRNA) mediated RNAi strategies used to combat the menace of insect pests in plants.

AB  - We previously reported that rats raised in small litters (SL) exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and poor performance in the episodic-like memory (ELM) test compared to normal litters (NL). Additionally, mRNA expression of aromatase was increased, and 5 alpha-reductase 1 was reduced in the dentate girus (DG) of SL compared to NL rats. In this work, the objective was to analyze whether environmental enrichment (EE) can reverse or attenuate the behavioral and molecular effects observed in SL animals. Thus, male rats were raised in SL (4 pups/mother; SL), where pups consumed larger amounts of milk and gained more body weight compared to rats raised in normal litters (10 pups/mother; NL). On postnatal day (PND) 21, male rats were housed under standard conditions (SE, 4 rats/cage) or EE (8 rats/cage). For EE, cages were equipped with objects and tunnels that were changed daily. At PND75, the animals underwent locomotion activity, episodic-like memory (ELM) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. At PND90, the animals were euthanized, and their brains were microdissected. dentate girus (DG), CA1, and CA3 regions were isolated for mRNA quantification and methylation studies. We found that EE attenuates anxiety-like behavior and rescues spatial memory deficits in SL animals. Furthermore, EE prevented the increase in aromatase and decline in 5 alpha-reductase 1, expression associated with SL. Some of these changes were correlated with alterations in methylation patterns of the promoter regions of these genes. These findings demonstrate that environmental interventions can mitigate the long-term effects observed in the SL model and restore brain and behavioral functions. (c) 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world with poor prognosis. Despite the promising applications of immunotherapy, the objective response rate is still unsatisfactory. We have previously shown that Hippo/YAP signaling acts as a powerful tumor promoter in ESCC. However, whether Hippo/YAP signaling is involved in tumor immune escape in ESCC remains largely unknown. Here, we show that YAP directly activates transcription of the "don't eat me" signal CD24, and plays a crucial role in driving tumor cells to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages. Mechanistically, YAP regulates CD24 expression by interacting with TEAD and binding the CD24 promoter to initiate transcription, which facilitates tumor cell escape from macrophage-mediated immune attack. Our animal model data and clinical data show that YAP combined with CD24 in tumor microenvironment redefines the impact of TAMs on the prognosis of ESCC patients which will provide a valuable basis for precision medicine. Moreover, treatment with YAP inhibitor altered the distribution of macrophages and suppressed tumorigenesis and progression of ESCC in vivo. Together, our study provides a novel link between Hippo/YAP signaling and macrophage-mediated immune escape, which suggests that the Hippo-YAP-CD24 axis may act as a promising target to improve the prognosis of ESCC patients.A proposed model for the regulatory mechanism of Hippo-YAP-CD24-signaling axis in the tumor-associated macrophages mediated immune escape.

AB  - Oxytocin regulates social behavior via direct modulation of neurons, regulation of neural network activity, and interaction with other neurotransmitter systems. The behavioral effects of oxytocin signaling are determined by the species-specific distribution of brain oxytocin receptors. The socially monogamous prairie vole has been a useful model organism for elucidating the role of oxytocin in social behaviors, including pair bonding, response to social loss, and consoling. However, there has been no comprehensive mapping of oxytocin receptor-expressing cells throughout the prairie vole brain. Here, we employed a highly sensitive in situ hybridization, RNAscope, to construct an exhaustive, brain-wide map of oxytocin receptor mRNA-expressing cells. We found that oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was widespread and diffused throughout the brain, with specific areas displaying a particularly robust expression. Comparing receptor binding with mRNA revealed that regions of the hippocampus and substantia nigra contained oxytocin receptor protein but lacked mRNA, indicating that oxytocin receptors can be transported to distal neuronal processes, consistent with presynaptic oxytocin receptor functions. In the nucleus accumbens, a region involved in oxytocin-dependent social bonding, oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was detected in both the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing subtypes of cells. Furthermore, natural genetic polymorphisms robustly influenced oxytocin receptor expression in both D1 and D2 receptor cell types in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, our findings further elucidate the extent to which oxytocin signaling is capable of influencing brain-wide neural activity, responses to social stimuli, and social behavior. Key points Oxytocin receptor mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with strong expression concentrated in certain areas involved in social behavior. Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression and protein localization are misaligned in some areas, indicating that the receptor protein may be transported to distal processes. In the nucleus accumbens, oxytocin receptors are expressed on cells expressing both D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, and the majority of variation in oxytocin receptor expression between animals is attributable to polymorphisms in the oxytocin receptor gene.

AB  - Introduction: Animal vehicle collisions (AVCs) are a global safety concern, requiring analysis and predictive models for understanding and mitigation. Police crash report data are one of the main sources of AVC data globally. However, they are prone to reporting policy change and other inconsistencies, particularly in rural areas, hindering the development of predictive models. Through development of a robust approach for data cleaning, quality control, feature selection, and contribution level identification, this study proposes a pipeline to address this shortcoming. Method: North Dakota crash data set is used as a case study due to high rates on AVC in this rural region and its diverse wildlife ecosystem. Theil's U association index, and chi-square tests were implemented in the pipeline to evaluate the proposed pipeline effectiveness. The pipeline detects and removes skewed proportion samples, while addressing data collection inconsistency, low variance, and duplicated features. Results: Pipeline imposed 3.5% sample size and 88.9% feature size reduction on the original crash data over 20 years. Observation on the modified dataset revealed year, day, and driver features had the lowest while hour, county, and speed limit had the highest statistical contribution to the AVC. Light, hour, and month were lumped in daily solar cycle and represented as a single temporal feature that can be used effectively to develop predictive model. Finally, presented pipeline increased spatiotemporal integrity while reducing the runtime by 92.46% for the association analysis.

AB  - Elephant grass has stood out as a potential crop for energy production. Therefore, aiming to increase selection efficiency and considering the importance of this crop as an energy source worldwide, we selected full-sib families of elephant grass based on the yield, adaptability and stability of the progeny and predicted genetic gains between and within the best full-sib families. In addition, we estimated the repeatability coefficient of traits related to elephant grass yield to infer the minimum number of assessments necessary to identify genotypes with potential for energy purposes. Crosses were performed between ten elephant grass genotypes in the partial-diallel genetic design. To evaluate the clones, the experiment was laid out in a randomized-block design with three replicates. Dry matter yield, number of tillers per clump, plant height and stem diameter were evaluated. For the evaluated traits, deviance analysis was performed, genetic parameters estimated and gains predicted. Additionally, analyses of repeatability, adaptability and stability of the genotypes were conducted via mixed models (REML/BLUP), using the computational resources of Selegem software. The repeatability coefficients found in this study were sufficient to estimate the real value of the individuals, with over 60% reliability. There was agreement between the HMGV, RPGV and HMRPGV statistics in choosing the most productive, adaptable and stable genotypes. Families 1, 7, 8 and 10 were considered genetically superior, as they associated high yield potential, adaptability and genotypic stability. Individual selection within families showed significant advantages over selection of families.

AB  - Modified citrus pectin (MCP) modulates galectin-3, a key player in neuroinflammation linked to Alzheimer's disease. By inhibiting galectin-3, MCP reduces the brain's inflammatory response and may alleviate cognitive decline. This study examines MCP's impact on neuroinflammation, cognitive function, and its role in galectin-3 inhibition in a dementia model. Male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups: control (n = 6), scopolamine (SCP) (n = 7), SCP + MCP (n = 7), and MCP only (n = 7). MCP was administered orally at 100 mg/kg/day via drinking water for six weeks. SCP was injected intraperitoneally at 1 mg/kg for seven days to induce an Alzheimer's-type dementia model. The researchers assessed cognitive performance through the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. After behavioral tests, blood and brain tissues, including the hippocampus, were collected and stored at -80 degrees C for analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inflammatory markers (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and galectin-3). The data were analyzed with SPSS 22. SCP treatment increased lipid peroxidation (MDA) and elevated inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and galectin-3), while reducing BDNF and impairing spatial memory. Co-administering MCP with SCP significantly reduced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and galectin-3 levels; increased BDNF; and improved memory performance. Although MCP did not lower MDA levels, it boosted SOD activity, suggesting antioxidant effects. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) alleviated cognitive impairments and reduced neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's-type dementia by inhibiting galectin-3. MCP also exhibited antioxidant potential, underscoring its therapeutic promise for neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Origin and evolution of secondary cell wall is considered key to colonization of terrestrial habitat by plants. The primary component of secondary cell wall, lignin, imparts strength and rigidity and enables plants to endure negative pressure created during transpiration. Members of the MYB transcription family, AtMYB42 and AtMYB85, play critical roles as regulators of lignin biosynthesis. Inspite of their functional significance, evolutionary history of homologs of AtMYB42 and AtMYB85 across land plants remains to be investigated. Our analysis revealed that homologs of AtMYB42 and AtMYB85 as two distinct genes are not present in any plant lineage outside Brassicaceae and only the ancestral form exists as AtMYB42/AtMYB85. Analysis of homologs of AtMYB42 and AtMYB85 across green plants combined with comparative genomics, selection pressure, and character-state reconstruction reveals that AtMYB42 and AtMYB85 are paralogous, and arose via segmental duplication, which may coincide with the alpha-event of WGD that occurred after the split of Brassicaceae-Caricaceae from the last common ancestor. Within Brassicaceae, homeologs and paralogs that arose as a result of poly-ploidization, and species-and lineage-specific changes could be observed. For instance, homologs of AtMYB42 were found to be deleted from the entire Brassica lineage. Analysis of homeologous segments in neopolyploids (B. napus, B. juncea, Camelina sativa), and meso-polyploid (B. rapa) revealed differential degrees of gene loss and retention. In Brassicaceae, homologs of AtMYB42 were found to be under purifying selection and of AtMYB85 under positive selection. High sequence identity in the coding region between homologs of AtMYB42 and AtMYB85 is indicative of redundant roles, and the loss of homologs of AtMYB42 in Brassica may be compensated by presence of AtMYB85 homologs and homeologs. The study thus forms the basis to investigate questions on regulatory diversification owing to variation in cis-elements between the paralogs and among homeologs, and, impact of differential selection pressure vis-a-vis redundant function.

AB  - Circulating prolactin aberrations (chronically high or low concentrations) have been shown to have strong associations with ovarian dysfunction in African female elephants. However, despite the well-established pleiotropic role that prolactin plays in human health, comprehensive metabolic effects from chronically elevated or suppressed prolactin have yet to be investigated in this species. In humans, in addition to amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemic women have shown increased risks for accelerated atherosclerosis, hyperandrogenemia, lowered metabolism, and insulin resistance. The aim of the study was to determine if elephants with long-term abnormal prolactin secretion were also experiencing alterations in metabolic biomarkers. One year of serum samples, collected biweekly, were obtained from female African elephants (n = 74) housed in North American zoos and categorized based on ovarian cyclicity and prolactin status: normal cycling, normal prolactin (NORMAL, n = 25), acyclic, high prolactin (HIGH, n = 25), or acyclic, low prolactin (LOW, n = 24). Each sample was further analyzed for measures of metabolic function, glucose metabolism, and cardiovascular health. Overall, thyroid hormones were significantly lower in both HIGH (TSH, T3, T4) and LOW (TSH) prolactin elephants compared to NORMAL counterparts. Additionally, HIGH prolactin elephants exhibited lower glucose, G:I ratios, and low-density lipoprotein values, but higher cholesterol concentrations compared to normal cycling females. Overall, LOW prolactin elephants exhibited higher body condition scores and G:I ratios, and higher concentrations of insulin, high-density lipoproteins, cortisol and testosterone, but decreased triglyceride values compared to NORMAL elephants in the study. Data suggest that HIGH prolactin elephants may be experiencing hypothyroidism as a comorbidity, whereas LOW prolactin elephants may be exhibiting aspects of insulin resistance, albeit different from human clinical data. Specific studies are suggested that would help elucidate the underlying mechanisms at play and increase our understanding of prolactin's role in elephant physiology.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of selected plant additives on changes in the content of fatty acids, lipid quality indicators and mineral composition of yogurts produced from cow's milk. The analysis included natural yogurts and yogurts enriched with 10% of chia seeds, hulled hemp seeds, quinoa seeds and oat bran. The fatty acid composition, the content of lipid quality indicators and the content of mineral components was varied in all analyzed yogurts. The plant additives used caused significant (p <= 0.05) changes in their fatty acid content, i.e., a significant decrease in the content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and a significant increase in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The plant additives used caused significant (p <= 0.05) changes in the content of fatty acids, i.e., a significant decrease in the content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and a significant increase in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). It was shown that additives such as chia seeds and peeled hemp seeds caused the greatest changes in the analyzed yogurts. Yogurts with these additives were characterized by a significant increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including n-3 acids, and a more favorable n-6/n-3 ratio. Yogurts with these additives were also characterized by significantly (p <= 0.05) lower atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI) indices and a higher hypocholesterolemia-to-hypercholesterolemia ratio (H/H). The addition of peeled hemp seeds caused the greatest changes in the content of minerals. Yogurts with hemp seeds were characterized by the highest content of all measured macroelements, as well as copper, iron and zinc. In turn, the highest manganese content was determined in the yogurts with the addition of chia seeds.

AB  - Psoriasis is an autoinflammatory skin disease characterized by the abnormal activation of epidermal keratinocytes. The Hippo-YAP pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that plays important roles in organ size control and tumorigenesis. Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrated that YAP1, the core downstream component of Hippo-YAP pathway, was up-regulated in psoriasis patients, suggesting its possible role in psoriasis development. However, its precise function and mechanism in psoriasis pathogenesis are still not well-clarified. In the present study, we confirmed the up-regulation of YAP1 in psoriasis keratinocytes by measuring its expression in psoriatic patient skins, psoriatic-like cellular model, and IMQ-induced mouse model. Further functional studies showed that YAP1 promoted keratinocyte proliferation and inflammation in vitro. Meanwhile, VP, a selective YAP1 antagonist, inhibited keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory factor production in a dose-dependent way. Moreover, intradermal injection of si-Yap1 or VP hindered psoriasis development by impeding epidermal hyperplasia and relieving systemic inflammatory response in the IMQ-induced mouse model. Therefore, our findings suggest that YAP1 plays a crucial role in psoriasis pathogenesis through modulating keratinocyte activation and may serve as a novel target for the treatment of psoriasis.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Qinzhizhudan Formula (QZZD) is composed of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Huang Qin) extract, Gardenia jasminoides (Zhizi) extract and Suis Fellis Pulvis (Zhudanfen) (ratio of 4:5:6). This formula is optimized from Qingkailing (QKL) injection. Regarding brain injury, QZZD is protective. However, the mechanism by which QZZD treats vascular dementia (VD) has not been elucidated. Aim of the study: To ascertain QZZD's effect on the treatment of VD and further investigate the molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: In this study, we screened the possible components and targets of QZZD against VD and microglia polarization using network pharmacology (NP), then an animal model of bilateral common carotid artery ligation method (2VO) was induced. Afterward, The Morris water maze was employed to evaluate cognitive ability, and pathological alterations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus were detected using HE and Nissl staining. To confirm the affect of QZZD on VD and its molecular mechanism, the contents of inflammatory factors IL-1 & beta;, TNF-& alpha;, IL-4, and IL-10 were performed to detect by ELISA, the phenotype polarization of microglia cells was detected by immunofluorescence staining, and the expressions of MyD88, p-I & kappa;B & alpha; and p-NF-& kappa;B p65 in brain tissue were detected by western blot. Results: A total of 112 active compounds and 363 common targets of QZZD, microglia polarization, and VD were identified, according to the NP analysis. 38 hub targets were screened out from the PPI network. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis showed that QZZD may regulate microglia polarization through anti-inflammatory mechanism such as Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway. The further results showed that QZZD can alleviate the memory impairment induced by 2VO. QZZD profoundly rescued brain hippocampus neuronal damage and increased the number of neurons. These advantageous outcomes were linked to the control of microglia polarization. QZZD decreased M1 phenotypic marker expression while increasing M2 phenotypic marker expression. QZZD may controll the polarization of the M1 microglia by blocking the core part of Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, that is the MyD88/NF-& kappa;B signaling pathway, which reduced the neurotoxic effects of the microglia. Conclusion: Here, we explored the anti-VD microglial polarization characteristic of QZZD for the first time and clarified its mechanisms. These findings will provide valuable clues for the discovery of anti-VD agents.

AB  - Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Inflammation, demyelination, synaptic alteration, and neuronal loss are hallmarks detectable in MS. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model widely used to study pathogenic aspects of MS. Autophagy is a process that maintains cell homeostasis by removing abnormal organelles and damaged proteins and is involved both in protective and detrimental effects that have been seen in a variety of human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. This study is aimed at investigating the autophagy signaling pathway through the analysis of the main autophagic proteins including Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3, autophagosome marker), and p62 also called sequestosome1 (SQSTM1, substrate of autophagy-mediated degradation) in the hippocampus of EAE-affected mice. The expression levels of Beclin-1, LC3, and p62 and the Akt/mTOR pathway were examined by Western blot experiments. In EAE mice, compared to control animals, significant reductions of expression levels were detectable for Beclin-1 and LC3 II (indicating the reduction of autophagosomes), and p62 (suggesting that autophagic flux increased). In parallel, molecular analysis detected the deregulation of the Akt/mTOR signaling. Immunofluorescence double-labeling images showed co-localization of NeuN (neuronal nuclear marker) and Beclin-1, LC3, and p62 throughout the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields. Taken together, these data demonstrate that activation of autophagy occurs in the neurons of the hippocampus in this experimental model.

AB  - Background: Air pollution exposure is associated with impaired neurodevelopment, altered structural brain morphology in children, and neurodegenerative disorders. Differential susceptibility to air pollution may be influenced by genetic features.Objectives: To evaluate whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype or the polygenic risk score (PRS) for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) modify the association between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and child-hood and structural brain morphology in preadolescents.Methods: We included 1186 children from the Generation R Study. Concentrations of fourteen air pollutants were calculated at participants' home addresses during pregnancy and childhood using land-use-regression models. Structural brain images were collected at age 9-12 years to assess cortical and subcortical brain volumes. APOE status and PRS for AD were examined as genetic modifiers. Linear regression models were used to conduct single -pollutant and multi-pollutant (using the Deletion/Substitution/Addition algorithm) analyses with a two-way interaction between air pollution and each genetic modifier.Results: Higher pregnancy coarse particulate matter (PMcoarse) and childhood polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure was differentially associated with larger cerebral white matter volume in APOE epsilon 4 carriers compared to non-carriers (29,485 mm3 (95% CI 6,189; 52,781) and 18,663 mm3 (469; 36,856), respectively). Higher preg-nancy PMcoarse exposure was differentially associated with larger cortical grey matter volume in children with higher compared to lower PRS for AD (19436 mm3 (825, 38,046)).Discussion: APOE status and PRS for AD possibly modify the association between air pollution exposure and brain structural morphology in preadolescents. Higher air pollution exposure is associated with larger cortical volumes in APOE epsilon 4 carriers and children with a high PRS for AD. This is in line with typical brain development, sug-gesting an antagonistic pleiotropic effect of these genetic features (i.e., protective effect in early-life, but neurodegenerative effect in adulthood). However, we cannot discard chance findings. Future studies should evaluate trajectorial brain development using a longitudinal design.

AB  - Melamine-impregnated paper waste (MIPW) is an unavoidable byproduct of the melamine-impregnated paper production process, and it must be urgently disposed. In this paper, due to its high N content, MIPW was used as a N source to co-pyrolyze with camellia oleifera shell (COS). By changing the proportion of MIPW in the raw materials, the migration path of the N was studied during the co-pyrolysis process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis (EA), total nitrogen analysis (TN) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry were used to determine the content and the types of N-containing components in raw materials and products. The results showed that during the co-pyrolysis process, the N in MIPW and COS would be converted into different types of N-containing components, and the proportion of MIPW in raw materials directly impacts the product distribution and the N migration path. With the increase in the proportion of MIPW from 10 to 50 wt.% (daf, mass ratio), the proportion of N in raw materials that migrated into the solid phase decreased from 27.58 to 16.31 wt.%, while that which migrated to the gas and liquid phases increased from 24.92 and 47.50 wt.% to 25.97 and 57.72 wt.%, respectively. The proportions of N in the raw materials that changed into pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N in the solid phase and N2-N in the gas phase were decreased. The proportions of NH3-N and HCN-N in the gas phase and NH3-N and organic-N in the liquid phase were increased. Moreover, synergies were observed during the co-pyrolysis process, which affected the N migration path in the raw material. This study will provide policy directions and theoretical support for the comprehensive utilization of MIPW and COS.

AB  - This study evaluates the olfactory response of Chrysoperla externa to the volatiles of the Embrapa 51 genotype of the cashew induced by the herbivory of Aleurodicus cocois, identifies the chemical profile of these compounds and evaluates the development of C. externa fed on A. cocois. The volatiles emitted by the leaves of the cashew genotype, both infested and not infested with A. cocois, were analysed by solid-phase microextraction with GC-MS. In the olfactometry tests, C. externa was attracted to and spent more time in the olfactometer arm containing cashew plant volatiles induced by A. cocois. From the analysis of the volatile profiles, alpha-phellandrene, alpha-terpinene, rho-mentha-2,4(8)-diene, beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D were released in large amounts by the Embrapa 51 genotype only after infestation by A. cocois; these compounds may therefore be involved in attracting the predator. Under laboratory conditions, although the development time and survival of some immature stages of C. externa may vary with the type of prey, when fed on A. cocois, the predator is able to complete the egg-adult development cycle. Based on the behavioural and biological assays, C. externa is an effective biocontrol agent for A. cocois in the cashew.

AB  - Overexpression or activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) is common in cancer cells. Thus, targeting YAP may be a strategy for cancer therapy. Licochalcone A (LicA) is a primary active compound of licorice root and is known to have medicinal effects, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer effects. However, the anticancer pharmacological mechanism of LicA has not been investigated in cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of LicA and the underlying molecular mechanism in HCCC-9810 and RBE human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Our experiments indicated that LicA suppressed the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells through inactivation of the Hippo pathway. Pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES1) was notably upregulated and related to carcinogenesis. We also found that LicA suppressed the expression and nuclear localization of PES1, which was associated with the inhibition of YAP expression and transcriptional activity.

AB  - Exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) has been associated with the modulation of neuronal electrophysiology and synaptic plasticity. Given the potential of these changes to coincide with alterations in gene expression, this study investigated whether a transcriptional response would occur in neurons following exposure to RF-EMF, under both thermal and nonthermal conditions. Rat primary hippocampal neurons (PHNs) underwent either a single (one-time) or a multiple (3-times, once a day) exposures to RF-EMF (3.0 GHz, CW) at two different mean specific absorption rate (SAR) values of 0.57 W/kg or 5.91 W/kg, which induced a temperature change (Delta T degrees C) of approximately 0.3 degrees C or 3.6 degrees C, respectively. Alteration in transcription in the RF-EMF-exposed PHNs versus the sham counterparts was assessed at 0, 4, and 24 h postexposure via high-throughput RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq. 2000. A total of 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibited significant upregulation due to RF-EMF exposure, observed only with the high SAR dose that induced a thermal rise. However, the expression of these DEGs was not significant at 24 h postexposure. Our findings confirmed a lack of nonthermal effects on gene expression under low RF-EMF exposure conditions as evaluated. Additionally, the results indicated a slight thermal effect of exposures at the dose nearing the standards threshold of 4 W/kg; however, the effect appeared to be transient. The study suggests that RF-EMF exposures at a level close to the standards threshold, despite inducing mild temperature elevations (i.e., 3-5 degrees C above normal), would not trigger biologically critical cellular changes.
   An investigation of the effect of single and multiple exposure to 3.0 GHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) at low and high doses (i.e., mean SAR values of 0.57 and 5.91 W/kg, respectively) on gene transcription in primary hippocampal neurons is presented. Significant change in a subset of genes was observed following RF-EMF exposure to the higher dose, which also resulted in a temperature rise in the media up to 3.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C. The expression level was shown to revert to baseline at 24 h postexposure, suggesting no significant biological impact on cells at the evaluated RF-EMF conditions.

AB  - Stem cell dysfunction drives many age-related disorders. Identifying mechanisms that initially compromise stem cell behavior represent early targets to promote tissue function later in life. Here, we pinpoint multiple factors that disrupt neural stem cell (NSC) behavior in the adult hippocampus. Clonal tracing showed that NSCs exhibit asynchronous depletion by identifying short-term NSCs (ST-NSCs) and long-term NSCs (LTNSCs). ST-NSCs divide rapidly to generate neurons and deplete in the young brain. Meanwhile, multipotent LT-NSCs are maintained for months but are pushed out of homeostasis by lengthening quiescence. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of deep NSC quiescence revealed several hallmarks of molecular aging in the mature brain and identified tyrosine-protein kinase Abl1 as an NSC aging factor. Treatment with the Abl inhibitor imatinib increased NSC activation without impairing NSC maintenance in the middle-aged brain. Our study indicates that hippocampal NSCs are particularly vulnerable and adaptable to cellular aging.

AB  - To build biophysically detailed models of brain cells, circuits, and regions, a data-driven approach is increasingly being adopted. This helps to obtain a simulated activity that reproduces the experimentally recorded neural dynamics as faithfully as possible, and to turn the model into a useful framework for making predictions based on the principles governing the nature of neural cells. In such a context, the access to existing neural models and data outstandingly facilitates the work of computational neuroscientists and fosters its novelty, as the scientific community grows wider and neural models progressively increase in type, size, and number. Nonetheless, even when accessibility is guaranteed, data and models are rarely reused since it is difficult to retrieve, extract and/or understand relevant information and scientists are often required to download and modify individual files, perform neural data analysis, optimize model parameters, and run simulations, on their own and with their own resources. While focusing on the construction of biophysically and morphologically accurate models of hippocampal cells, we have created an online resource, the Build section of the Hippocampus Hub -a scientific portal for research on the hippocampus- that gathers data and models from different online open repositories and allows their collection as the first step of a single cell model building workflow. Interoperability of tools and data is the key feature of the work we are presenting. Through a simple click-and-collect procedure, like filling the shopping cart of an online store, researchers can intuitively select the files of interest (i.e., electrophysiological recordings, neural morphology, and model components), and get started with the construction of a data-driven hippocampal neuron model.

AB  - Simple Summary Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is called a rare disease because it affects relatively few people. It is characterized by malformations in some blood vessels and usually results in profuse nose bleedings. In a recent article, we found that these patients have higher levels of adrenomedullin (AM), a molecule with cardiovascular activities, than healthy people. Thus we wanted to know whether the mutations that cause the HHT disease are directly responsible for these higher levels of AM. To investigate this issue, we used mutant mice, which express lower levels of the genes involved in the disease (called Eng and Acvrl1), and measured how much AM was found in different tissues. Although we expected a higher amount of AM in all organs, that was not the case. Some organs showed no variation, some had lower levels of AM than normal mice (fat, skin, and adrenals), and others had a higher expression (cerebellum and colon). Interestingly, our results suggest that these genes and the related molecule BMP-9 may have novel functions, which have not been yet investigated, which may shed more light on the physiopathology of HHT. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease characterized by vascular malformations and profuse bleeding. The disease is caused by mutations in the components of the BMP-9 receptor: endoglin (ENG) and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes. Recently, we reported that HHT patients expressed higher serum levels of adrenomedullin (AM) than healthy volunteers; thus, we studied the expression of AM (by enzyme immunoassay, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting) in mice deficient in either one of the receptor components to investigate whether these defects may be the cause of that elevated AM in patients. We found that AM expression is not affected by these mutations in a consistent pattern. On the contrary, in some organs (blood, lungs, stomach, pancreas, heart, kidneys, ovaries, brain cortex, hippocampus, foot skin, and microvessels), there were no significant changes, whereas in others we found either a reduced expression (fat, skin, and adrenals) or an enhanced production of AM (cerebellum and colon). These results contradict our initial hypothesis that the increased AM expression found in HHT patients may be due directly to the mutations, but open intriguing questions about the potential phenotypic manifestations of Eng and Acvrl1 mutants that have not yet been studied and that may offer, in the future, a new focus for research on HHT.

AB  - Gastrodia elata Bl. has a long edible history and is considered an important functional food raw material. Gastrodin (GAS) is one of the main functional substances in G. elata BI. and can be used as a health care product for the elderly to enhance resistance and delay aging. This study investigated the ameliorative effect and mechanism of GAS on cognitive dysfunction in vascular dementia (VaD) rats, which provides a theoretical basis for development and utilization of functional food. The water maze test shows that GAS improves learning and memory impairment in VaD rats. Meanwhile; GAS significantly decreased the levels of Fe2+ and malondialdehyde (MDA); increased the content of glutathione (GSH); and significantly up-regulated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), the key regulatory factors of ferroptosis; while it down-regulated the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). However, GAS does not directly regulate GPx4 and COX2 to inhibit ferroptosis. Furthermore, compared with GAS alone, GAS combined with Bardoxolone (an agonist of Nrf2) did not further affect the increase in GPx4 levels and decrease in COX2 levels, nor did it further affect the regulation of GAS on the biochemical parameters of ferroptosis in HT22 hypoxia injury. These findings revealed that GAS inhibited ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons by activating the Nrf2/Keap1-GPx4 signaling pathway, suggesting its possible application as a functional food for improving vascular dementia by inhibiting ferroptosis.

AB  - Ca2+ transients (CaT) underlying cardiomyocyte (CM) contraction require efficient Ca2+ coupling between sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels (RyR) for their generation; reduced coupling in disease contributes to diminished CaT and arrhythmogenic Ca2+ events. SR Ca2+ release also occurs via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) in CM. While this pathway contributes negligeably to Ca2+ handling in healthy CM, rodent studies support a role in altered Ca2+ dynamics and arrhythmogenic Ca2+ release involving InsP3R crosstalk with RyRs in disease. Whether this mechanism persists in larger mammals with lower T-tubular density and coupling of RyRs is not fully resolved. We have recently shown an arrhythmogenic action of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) in end stage human heart failure (HF), often associated with underlying ischemic heart disease (IHD). How IICR contributes to early stages of disease is however not determined but highly relevant. To access this stage, we chose a porcine model of IHD, which shows substantial remodelling of the area adjacent to the infarct. In cells from this region, IICR preferentially augmented Ca2+ release from non-coupled RyR clusters that otherwise showed delayed activation during the CaT. IICR in turn synchronised Ca2+ release during the CaT but also induced arrhythmogenic delayed after-depolarizations and action potentials. Nanoscale imaging identified co-clustering of InsP3Rs and RyRs, thereby allowing Ca2+-mediated channel crosstalk. Mathematical modelling supported and further delineated this mechanism of enhanced InsP3R-RyRs coupling in MI. Our findings highlight the role of InsP3R-RyR channel crosstalk in Ca2+ release and arrhythmia during post-MI remodelling.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the primary form of liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Hernandonine is a natural alkaloid derived from Hernandia nymphaeifolia that has been shown to exert various biological functions. In a previous study, hernandonine was shown to suppress the proliferation of several solid tumor cell lines without affecting normal human cell lines. However, little is known about the effect of hernandonine on HCC. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of hernandonine on HCC in relation to autophagy. We found that hernandonine inhibited HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, hernandonine elicited autophagic cell death and DNA damage in HCC cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that hernandonine upregulated p53 and Hippo signaling pathway-related genes in HCC cells. Small RNA interference of p53 resulted in hernandonine-induced autophagic cell death attenuation. However, inhibition of YAP sensitized HCC cells to hernandonine by increasing the autophagy induction. This is the first study to illustrate the complex involvement of p53 and YAP in the hernandonine-induced autophagic cell death in human HCC cells. Our findings provide novel evidence for the potential of hernandonine as a therapeutic agent for HCC treatment.

AB  - Liver damage seriously affects human health. Over 35% of cases of acute liver damage are caused by alcohol damage. Thus, finding drugs that can inhibit and effectively treat this disease is necessary. This article mainly focuses on the effect of the metabolome physical activity of active peptides in Camellia vietnamensis active peptide (CMAP) and improving liver protection. DEAE Sepharose FF ion-exchange column chromatography was used in separating and purifying crude peptides from Camellia vietnamensis Two components, A1 and A2, were obtained, and the most active A1 was selected. Sephadex G-100 gel column chromatography was used in A1 separation and purification. Three components, Al-1, Al-2, and Al-3, were obtained. Through antioxidant activity in vitro as an index of inspection, the relatively active component A1-2 was removed. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the purity of component A1-2 was 93.45%. The extracted CMAPs acted on alcoholic liver injury cells. Metabolomics studies revealed that the up-regulated metabolites were ribothymidine and xanthine; the down-regulated metabolites were hydroxyphenyllactic acid, creatinine, stearoylcarnitine, and inosine. This study provides an effective theoretical support for subsequent research.

AB  - Fireweed, Senecio madagascariensis Poiret (Asteraceae), is a target for biological control in Australia and Hawaii. Candidate agents recorded in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, the region of origin of the invasive populations, include stem-boring insects. The seasonal abundance of stem borers associated with S. madagascariensis populations was studied at four field sites in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands region, during 2017/18. DNA barcoding was used to differentiate and link insect taxa with their endophagous larvae. Monthly sampling revealed that stem-boring larvae comprised largely Diptera (42% of specimens) and Curculionidae (38.9%), with Lepidoptera (19.8%) the least abundant. Differences in larval herbivore loads between sites were statistically significant, with the warmer and drier sites supporting 59% higher larval numbers. DNA barcoding focused on Curculionidae and Lepidoptera, which took precedence due to restricted host ranges. Of the four lineages of weevil larvae recorded, 95% of sequenced specimens comprised two maternal lineages of Gasteroclisus tricostalis (Thunberg). Collectively, G. tricostalis was detected across nine months of the year, with peaks in abundance in autumn and summer. Similarly, of the three lineages of lepidopteran larvae recorded, 83% of sequenced specimens comprised Metamesia elegans (Walsingham) (Tortricidae). Metamesia elegans was collected across six months of the year, with an autumn peak. These results support the prioritisation of G. tricostalis and M. elegans as the most promising stem-boring agents for S. madagascariensis. The higher seasonal abundance of G. tricostalis, together with the good track record of weevils in weed biocontrol, suggest that it should take precedence in subsequent laboratory host-range assessments.

AB  - Most studies on mechanisms by which prenatal stress affects offspring behavior were conducted during late pregnancy using in vivo models; studies on the effect of preimplantation stress are rare. In vivo models do not allow accurate specification of the roles of different hormones and cells within the complicated living organism, and cannot verify whether hormones act directly on embryos or indirectly to alter progeny behavior. Furthermore, the number of anxiety-related miRNAs identified are limited. This study showed that both mouse embryculture with corticosterone (ECC) and maternal preimplantation restraint stress (PIRS) increased anxiety-like behavior (ALB) while decreasing hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in offspring. ECC/PIRS downregulated GR and BDNF expression by increasing miR-211-5p expression via promoter demethylation of its host gene Trpm1, and this epigenetic cell fate determination was exclusively perpetuated during development into mature hippocampus. Transfection with miR-211-5p mimic/inhibitor in cultured hippocampal cell lines confirmed that miR-211-5p downregulated Gr and Bdnf. Intrahippocampal injection of miR-211-5p agomir/antagomir validated that miR-211-5p dose-dependently increased ALB while decreasing hippocampal GR/BDNF expression. In conclusion, preimplantation exposure to glucocorticoids increased ALB by upregulating miR-211-5p via Trpm1 demethylation, and miR-211-5p may be used as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for anxiety-related diseases.

AB  - A significant body of evidence shows that neuroinflammation is one of the key processes in the development of brain pathology in trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, and epilepsy. Various brain insults, including severe and prolonged seizure activity during status epilepticus (SE), trigger proinflammatory cytokine release. We investigated the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) and interleukin-6 (Il6), and anti-inflammatory fractalkine (Cx3cl1) in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and neocortex of rats 24 h, 7 days, and 5 months after lithium-pilocarpine SE. We studied the relationship between cytokine expression and neuronal death in the hippocampus and evaluated the effect of modulation of endocannabinoid receptors on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration after SE. The results of the present study showed that inhibition of endocannabinoid CB1 receptors with AM251 early after SE had a transient neuroprotective effect that was absent in the chronic period and did not affect the development of spontaneous seizures after SE. At the same time, AM251 reduced the expression of Il6 in the chronic period after SE. Higher Cx3cl1 levels were found in rats with more prominent hippocampal neurodegeneration.

AB  - Neuronal maturation is the phase during which neurons acquire their final characteristics in terms of morphology, electrical activity, and metabolism. However, little is known about the metabolic pathways governing neuronal maturation. Here, we investigate the contribution of the main metabolic pathways, namely glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid oxidation, during the maturation of primary rat hippocampal neurons. Blunting glucose oxidation through the genetic and chemical inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter reveals that this protein is critical for the production of glutamate, which is required for neuronal arborization, proper dendritic elongation, and spine formation. Glutamate supplementation in the early phase of differentiation restores morphological defects and synaptic function in mitochondrial pyruvate transporter-inhibited cells. Furthermore, the selective activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors restores the impairment of neuronal differentiation due to the reduced generation of glucose-derived glutamate and rescues synaptic local translation. Fatty acid oxidation does not impact neuronal maturation. Whereas glutamine metabolism is important for mitochondria, it is not for endogenous glutamate production. Our results provide insights into the role of glucose-derived glutamate as a key player in neuronal terminal differentiation.
   Glucose oxidation sustains glutamate production and the terminal differentiation of neurons. Blunting glucose oxidation affects glutamate levels, neuronal maturation in terms of morphology and synaptic activity, and impairs protein synthesis.Genetic and chemical inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter reduces glutamate levels, and impairs neuronal complexity, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission. The combination of a reduction in glutamate levels and altered mitochondrial function upon inhibition of glucose oxidation decreases the energy-demanding process of protein translation. The activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors rescues dendritic architecture, spine morphology defects, and restores local translation of synaptic proteins.

AB  - Pancreatic encephalopathy (PE) is a frequent complication of acute pancreatitis. This study explored the mechanism of taraxasterol (TAS) in PE treatment by inhibiting pyroptosis via L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) up-regulation. PE rat models were established and treated with TAS, NLRP3 activator, and sh-L1CAM lentivirus. Serum amylase and lipase activities and Serum, hippocampus, and amygdala IL-18 and IL-1 beta levels were determined by ELISA, followed by TUNEL and HE staining. Rat nerve injury was evaluated by modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). Spontaneous behaviors, learning, memory, and emotions in rats were separately assessed by open field, new object recognition, tail suspension, and forced swimming tests. Microstructures of hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala were observed. NLRP3 + GSDMD + cells, pyroptosis markers, L1CAM, and myelin basic protein (MBP) were detected. PE rat model displayed elevated serum amylase and lipase activities and IL-18 and IL-1 beta levels, increased mNSS, shortened moving distance, reduced discrimination rate, prolonged immobility time, pathological damage in hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala, increased TUNEL-positive and NLRP3 + GSDMD + cells, raised NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD-N, IL-1 beta and IL-18 levels, and reduced L1CAM and MBP levels. TAS mitigated behavioral deficits and brain injury and curbed NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala in PE rats. NLRP3 activation partly averted the beneficial impacts of TAS on PE rats. TAS suppressed nerve cell pyroptosis and facilitated myelin regeneration by up-regulating L1CAM. L1CAM silencing partially abrogated TAS's effect on behavioral deficits and brain injury in PE rats. TAS treated PE by inhibiting pyroptosis via L1CAM up-regulation.

AB  - This investigation examined the potential of ginsenoside Rg3 in addressing traumatic brain injury (TBI). A TBI mouse model underwent treatment with ginsenoside Rg3 and nicotinamide (NAM). Neurological and motor functions were assessed using modified neurological severity score and rotarod tests. Brain water content in mice was detected. Primary mouse microglia were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ginsenoside Rg3, and NAM. Nissl and immunofluorescence staining were utilized to investigate hippocampal damage, and localization of P65, Iba1 and INOS in microglia. Hippocampal neurons were grown in a culture medium derived from microglia. CCK-8 and TUNEL assays were employed to evaluate the viability and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Proinflammatory factors and proteins were tested using ELISA, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. As a result, ginsenoside Rg3 enhanced neurological and motor functions in mice post-TBI, reduced brain water content, alleviated hippocampal neuronal neuroinflammation and damage, activated SIRT1, and deactivated the NF-kB pathway. In LPS-stimulated microglia, ginsenoside Rg3 diminished inflammation, activated SIRT1, deactivated the NF-kB pathway, and facilitated nuclear localization of P65 and co-localization of Iba1 and INOS. The effects of ginsenoside Rg3 were countered by NAM in both TBI mice and LPS-stimulated microglia. Hippocampal neurons cultured in a medium containing LPS, ginsenoside Rg3, and NAM-treated microglia showed improved viability and reduced apoptosis compared to those cultured in a medium with LPS and ginsenoside Rg3-treated microglia alone. Ginsenoside Rg3 was effective in reducing neuroinflammation and damage in hippocampal neurons following TBI by modulating the SIRT1/NF-kB pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for TBI.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with depression, cognitive dysfunction, and other neurological disorders. Increasing evidence has suggested that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in regulating the development of depression. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota is associated with CPF-related depression. This study aimed to explore the effect of CPF on depressive-like behavior in mice and investigated the role of gut microbiota in this behavior. In our study, we selected fifty male C57BL/6 J mice for the model and subjected them to CPF poisoning by gavage for 14 days. The depressive-like behaviors of mice were assessed by the open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), and forced swimming test (FST). Furthermore, we selected the high-dose group (CPF10) with obvious changes in depressive-like behaviors for the hippocampus and colon histopathological analysis, examined the changes in the gut microbiota by 16 S rRNA sequencing, screened the different microbiota among groups by linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), analyzed the correlation between intestinal bacteria and depression-like behavior indicators by Spearman analysis, and evaluated the predictive ability of different bacteria to CPF-induced depressive-like behavior using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The results showed that CPF caused depressive-like behaviors with pathological changes in the hippocampus and colon. CPF induced changes in gut microbiota, including 49 differential bacteria. Among the top 10 abundant bacteria, Actinobacteria and Deferribacteres were increased, and Cyanobacteria, Patescibacteria and Verrucomicrobia were decreased at the phylum level. Muribaculum, Ruminococcaceae.UCG.014 and uncultured Bacteroides bacterium were decreased at the genus level. Correlation analysis demonstrated that 18 differentially abundant bacteria were correlated with CPF-induced depression. ROC curves revealed that Deferribacteres, Mucispirillum, Rikenella and GCA900066575 are potential biomarkers for depression caused by CPF. These findings will provide an experimental basis for the neurological health of the pesticide-exposed population.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer biological processes. Nevertheless, the contributions and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain largely unexplored. Dysregulated circRNAs between cancerous tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues were identified by circRNA microarray in PDAC. The biological effect of hsa_circ_007367 both in vitro and in vivo was demonstrated by gain- and loss-of-function experiments. Further, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were performed to confirm the interaction among hsa_circ_007367, miR-6820-3p, and Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). The expression of hsa_circ_007367 and YAP1 were detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using tissue microarray (TMA) in 128 PDAC samples. We first identified that a novel circRNA, hsa_circ_0007367, was markedly upregulated in PDAC tissues and cells. Functionally, in vivo and in vitro data indicated that hsa_circ_0007367 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of PDAC. Mechanistically, we confirmed that hsa_circ_0007367 could facilitate the expression of YAP1, a well-known oncogene, by sponging miR-6820-3p, which function as a tumor suppresser in PDAC cells. The results of ISH and IHC demonstrated that hsa_circ_0007367 and YAP1 were upregulated in PDAC tissues. Furthermore, clinical data showed that higher hsa_circ_0007367 expression was correlated with advanced histological grade and lymph node metastasis in PDAC patients. In conclusion, our findings reveal that hsa_circ_0007367 acts as an oncogene via modulating miR-6820-3p/YAP1 axis to promote the progression of PDAC, and suggest that hsa_circ_0007367 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of PDAC.

AB  - Combined exposure of chronic stress and alumina nanoparticles (AlNPs) aggravates hippocampal injury, but the pathogenesis is unevaluated. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of co-exposure to chronic stress and AlNPs on hippocampal microglia pyroptosis. In this study, chronic restraint stress (CRS) alone caused NLRP3-mediated hippocampal microglia pyroptosis, but AlNPs did not. Moreover, co-exposure to CRS and AlNPs exacerbated hippocampal microglia pyroptosis, resulting in more severe hippocampal damage and behavioral deficits in rats. Protein-protein interaction network predicted that cathepsin B was a potential regulatory protein of NLRP3. CRS up-regulated cathepsin B expression which had a more pronounced increase in co-exposure group. Whereas, caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 alleviated hippocampal microglia pyroptosis and behavioral deficits in rats. Consistent with in vivo results, co-exposure of corticosterone and AlNPs aggravated NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and cathepsin B expression in HAPI cells. Nevertheless, the pyroptosis of HAPI cells was inhibited by cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me and NLRP3 knockout, respectively. NLRP3 agonist nigericin failed to promote the pyroptosis of HAPI cells in the presence of cathepsin B inhibition. These results demonstrated that co-exposure to chronic stress and AlNPs could aggravate hippocampal microglia pyroptosis by activating cathepsin B/NLRP3 signaling pathway, resulting in hippocampal damage and behavioral deficits.

AB  - Multifunctional hydrogels with excellent adhesion, biodegradability, and conductivity are essential for overcoming the obstacles of postoperative secondary injury, flexible sensing instability, and so on. Herein, we develop a multifunctional silk fibroin (SF) hydrogel modified with poly(acrylic acid). Owing to the stable chemical cross-linking network and the abundant carboxylic acid groups of the SF network, the SF hydrogel exhibits a high tensile strength of 74.34 kPa due to sufficient cohesion and interfacial interactions. Additionally, the tensile strain reaches a maximum of 414.6%, the compressive strength is 0.9 MPa, and the shear adhesive strength for pig skin tissues is as high as 64 kPa. Compared with most hydrogels, our multifunctional SF hydrogel with a low swelling ratio provides excellent adhesion, biodegradation, and conductivity, which shows advantages in terms of invasive tissue sealing. The use of self-adhesive SF hydrogels as conductive hydrogels in flexible sensors also benefits the collection of physiological electricity and human motion signals in the field of wearable and implantable electronic devices.

AB  - Parasitoid wasps may rely on chemical volatiles from herbivorous insects and their plant hosts for finding their preferred host. This study was conducted to test the reaction of Trichogramma papilionis Nagarkatti (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) to chemical volatiles that from host eggs and egg infested plants. Several volatile compounds were selected, singly, and as combinations of chemicals to determine whether these volatile compound blends could enhance orientation responses of T. papilionis wasps toward the source of the stimulus. In a Y-tube olfactometer, female wasps were significantly attracted to only two chemical volatiles among the seven compounds tested. The compounds were: trans-isoeugenol, anisole, beta-myrcene, cis-3-Hexenyl butyric acid (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, acetophenone, and alpha-farnesene (>95% purity). Only anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were attractive to T. papilionis wasps when used separately in olfactometer experiments. The wasps showed a significant attraction to a blend of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at a ratio of 25 mu L/100 mu L. There was no significant response to the other bled ratios of that combination of chemicals. Greenhouse studies showed that the wasps were not significantly attracted to anisole alone, but exhibited short-distance attraction to the above blend.

AB  - Cryopreservation of buck semen is essential in animal breeding but often damages sperm viability and integrity. The Honamli breed, a hardy Turkish goat, can benefit from improved freezing techniques using antioxidants such as Trolox (T). This study explores the effects of varying T concentrations on Honamli buck semen, assessing parameters such as motility, viability, and membrane integrity to enhance post-thaw quality. Findings support T's potential to improve semen extender formulations for preserving Honamli genetics.This study aims to freeze Honamli buck semen with T and to evaluate in vitro spermatological parameters. Three Honamli bucks, aged 2-3 years, were used in the study. Semen was collected from the bucks and mixed after removing seminal plasma. The mixed semen was diluted with a tris egg yolk extender containing three different concentrations of T (0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, and 1 mM) and control (0 mM). The diluted semen was equilibrated for 2 hours at +4 degrees and subjected to cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen vapor (-120 degrees C for 12 minutes) and frozen. After thawing (37 degrees C water bath for 30 seconds), the groups were evaluated at flow cytometric analysis for viability (SYBR/propidium iodide [PI]), plasma membrane acrosome integrity (FITC-PNA/PI), and mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1), plasma membrane integrity (hypo-osmotic swelling test), microscopic evaluations for motility and morphological integrity (abnormal spermatozoa rate). The 0.5 T and 0.25 T groups showed significant improvements in motility compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The control group had the lowest plasma membrane integrity (p < 0.05). The highest morphological integrity was observed in the T groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing T in buck semen extenders benefits spermatological parameters; particularly, 0.25 and 0.5 mM T could be used in Tris semen extenders during the cryopreservation process.

AB  - Oral tolerance blocks the development of specific immune responses to proteins ingested by the oral route. One of the first registries of oral tolerance showed that guinea pigs fed corn became refractory to hypersensitivity to corn proteins. Mice fed with chow containing corn are tolerant to zein, and parenteral injection of zein plus adjuvant blocks immunization to unrelated proteins injected concomitantly and reduces unspecific inflammation. Extensive and prolonged inflammatory infiltrate in the wound bed is one of the causes of pathological wound healing. Previous research shows that intraperitoneal injection of zein concomitant with skin injuries reduces the inflammatory infiltrate in the wound bed and improves wound healing. Herein, we tested if one subcutaneous injection of zein before skin injury improves wound healing. We also investigated how long the effects triggered by zein could improve skin wound healing. Mice fed zein received two excisional wounds on the interscapular skin under anesthesia. Zein plus Al(OH)(3) was injected at the tail base at 10 min, or 3, 5, or 7 days before skin injuries. Wound healing was analyzed at days 7 and 40 after injury. Our results showed that a zein injection up to 5 days before skin injury reduced the inflammatory infiltrate, increased the number of T-cells in the wound bed, and improved the pattern of collagen deposition in the neodermis. These findings could promote the development of new strategies for the treatment and prevention of pathological healing using proteins normally found in the common diet.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and results in severe neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive decline. Neurotrophins are growth factors involved in the development and survival of neurons, but also in underlying mechanisms for memory formation such as hippocampal long-term potentiation. Our aim was to identify small molecules with stimulatory effects on the signaling of two neurotrophins, the nerve growth factor (NGF) and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To identify molecules that could potentiate neurotrophin signaling, 25,000 molecules were screened, which led to the identification of the triazinetrione derivatives ACD855 (Ponazuril) and later on ACD856, as positive allosteric modulators of tropomyosin related kinase (Trk) receptors. ACD855 or ACD856 potentiated the cellular signaling of the neurotrophin receptors with EC50 values of 1.9 and 3.2 or 0.38 and 0.30 mu M, respectively, for TrkA or TrkB. ACD855 increased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus by 40% and facilitated long term potentiation in rat brain slices. The compounds acted as cognitive enhancers in a TrkB-dependent manner in several different behavioral models. Finally, the age-induced cognitive dysfunction in 18-month-old mice could be restored to the same level as found in 2-month-old mice after a single treatment of ACD856. We have identified a novel mechanism to modulate the activity of the Trk-receptors. The identification of the positive allosteric modulators of the Trk-receptors might have implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases and other diseases characterized by cognitive impairment.

AB  - Microvascular dysfunction is a pathological hallmark of diabetes, and is central to the ethology of diabetes-associated cardiac events. Herein, previous studies have highlighted the role of the vasoactive micro-RNA 92a (miR-92a) in small, as well as large, animal models. In this study, we explore the effects of miR-92a on mouse and human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (MCMEC, HCMEC), and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Diabetic HCMEC displayed impaired angiogenesis and a pronounced inflammatory phenotype. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed an upregulation of miR-92a in primary diabetic HCMEC. Downregulation of miR-92a by antagomir transfection in diabetic HCMEC rescued angiogenesis and ameliorated diabetic endothelial bed inflammation. Furthermore, additional analysis of potential in silico-identified miR-92a targets in diabetic HCMEC revealed the miR-92a dependent downregulation of an essential metalloprotease, ADAM10. Accordingly, downregulation of ADAM10 impaired angiogenesis and wound healing in MCMEC. In myocardial tissue slices from diabetic pigs, ADAM10 dysregulation in micro- and macro-vasculature could be shown. Altogether, our data demonstrate the role of miR-92a in cardiac microvascular dysfunction and inflammation in diabetes. Moreover, we describe for the first time the metalloprotease ADAM10 as a novel miR-92a target, mediating its anti-angiogenic effect.

AB  - Aging is an ultimate reality that everyone has to face. D-galactose (D-gal) has been used extensively to develop aging model. Trace elements such as selenium (Se) have been used as a potential antioxidant for neuro-protection. The present work aims to develop therapeutic agents such as Se for the treatment of aging-induced neurological ailments such as anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. For this purpose, mice were treated with D-gal at a dose of 300 mg/ml/kg and various doses of Se (0.175 and 0.35mg/ml/kg) for 28 days. Behavioral tests were monitored after treatment days. After the behavioral assessment, mice were decapitated and their brains were collected. Hippocampi were removed from the brain for biochemical, neurochemical, and histopathological analysis. The present findings of behavioral analysis showed that D-gal-induced anxiety- and depression-like symptoms were inhibited by both doses of Se. D-gal-induced memory alteration was also prevented by repeated doses of Se (0.175 and 0.35mg/ml/kg). Biochemical analysis showed that D-gal-induced increase of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers and decrease of antioxidant enzymes and total protein contents in the hippocampus were prevented by Se administration. An increase in the activity of acetylcholinesterase was also diminished by Se. The neurochemical assessment showed that D-gal-induced increased serotonin metabolism and decreased acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus were restored by repeated treatment of Se. Histopathological estimations also exhibited; normalization of D-gal induced neurodegenerative changes. It is concluded that D-gal-induced dysfunction in mice hippocampus caused anxiety, depression, memory impairment, oxidative stress, neuro-inflammation, and histological alterations that were mitigated by Se via its antioxidant potential, anti-inflammatory property, and modulating capability of serotonergic and cholinergic functions.

AB  - Brain metal homeostasis is essential for healthy neurological function, and disturbed brain metal homeostasis has deleterious consequences for neurodevelopment or cognitive outcome following injury or during disease. Specific regions of the brain (e.g. the hippocampus and subregions within) are known to be enriched with transition metals (i.e. ions of iron, copper, and zinc). Neither the physiological need for localized enrichment, nor the mechanisms driving the enrichment, however, are well understood. In this study we have applied a multimodal template, incorporating elemental mapping using X-ray fluorescence microscopy with spatial transcriptomics, to help reveal a molecular basis for metallomic heterogeneity across key subregions of the hippocampus. Our results reveal that significant differences in iron, zinc, and copper enrichment are associated with regional enrichment of specific transcripts related to metal transport, metal storage, and metal regulatory proteins. In addition to providing novel biological insight into the neurometallomic profile of the hippocampus, this study also provides an important template for others to integrate transcriptomics into multimodal workflows investigating the neurometallome.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) in regulating the AKT/TP53 pathway and reducing inflammatory responses for the treatment of chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) using UHPLC-QE-MS combined with network pharmacology, molecular docking techniques, and animal experiment validation. Methods: Targets of seven herbal components in BHD, such as Astragalus membranaceus, Paeoniae Rubra Radix, and Ligusticum chuanxiong, were identified through TCMSP and HERB databases. CCI-related targets were obtained from DisGeNET and Genecards, with an intersection analysis conducted to determine shared targets between the disease and the herbal components. Functional enrichment analysis of these intersecting targets was performed. Networks of gene ontology and pathway associations with these targets were constructed and visualized. A pharmacological network involving intersecting genes and active components was delineated. A protein-protein interaction network was established for these intersecting targets and visualized using Cytoscape 3.9.1. The top five genes from the PPI network and their corresponding active components underwent molecular docking. Finally, the 2-vessel occlusion (2-VO) induced CCI rat model was treated with BHD, and the network pharmacology findings were validated using Western blot, RT-PCR, behavioral tests, laser speckle imaging, ELISA, HE staining, Nissl staining, LFB staining, and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Results: After filtration and deduplication, 150 intersecting genes were obtained, with the top five active components by Degree value identified as Quercetin, Beta-Sitosterol, Oleic Acid, Kaempferol, and Succinic Acid. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis linked key target genes significantly with Lipid and atherosclerosis, AGERAGE signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. The PPI network highlighted ALB, IL-6, AKT1, TP53, and IL-1 beta as key protein targets. Molecular docking results showed the strongest binding affinity between ALB and Beta-Sitosterol. Behavioral tests using the Morris water maze indicated that both medium and high doses of BHD could enhance spatial memory in 2-VO model rats, with high-dose BHD being more effective. Laser speckle results showed that BHD at medium and high doses could facilitate CBF recovery in CCI rats, demonstrating a dose-response relationship. HE staining indicated that all doses of BHD could reduce neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region to varying extents, with the highest dose being the most efficacious. Nissl staining showed that nimodipine and medium and high doses of BHD could alleviate Nissl body damage. LFB staining indicated that nimodipine and medium and high doses of BHD could reduce the pathological damage to fiber bundles and myelin sheaths in the internal capsule and corpus callosum of CCI rats. ELISA results showed that nimodipine and BHD at medium and high doses could decrease the levels of TNF-alpha, IL6, IL-17, and IL-1 beta in the serum of CCI rats (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence demonstrated that BHD could activate the AKT signaling pathway and inhibit TP53 in treating CCI. Western blot and RT-PCR results indicated that nimodipine and all doses of BHD could upregulate Akt1 expression and downregulate Alb, Tp53, Il-1 beta, and Il-6 expression in the hippocampus of CCI rats to varying degrees (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: BHD exerts therapeutic effects in the treatment of CCI by regulating targets, such as AKT1, ALB, TP53, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, and reducing inflammatory responses.

AB  - The neuro-gliovascular unit is a crucial structure for providing a balanced well-functioning environment for neurons and their synapses. Activation of the immune system during the developmental period is believed to affect the gliovascular unit, which may trigger neurodevelopmental and neurological/neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, we hypothesized that vulnerability of the male brain to a neonatal insult was conditioned by sex-dependent differences in the impairment of the hippocampal gliovascular unit. Male and female C57BL/6J pups received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg/kg) or saline on postnatal day (P) 5. Brains were collected at P12 and morphological quantifications of hippocampal fibrillary glial acid protein (GFAP(+)) astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 protein (Iba1+) microglia were performed by using 3-D image analysis together with measuring the length of CD31(+) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4(+)) vessels. We found a significant increase in the length of CD31(+) capillaries in the male LPS group compared to the saline group; however, coverage of capillaries by astrocytic end-feet (AQP4(+)) was significantly reduced. In contrast, there was a significant increase in AQP4(+) capillary length in female pups 1 week after LPS injection. GFAP(+) astrocytes via morphological changes in the hippocampus showed significant enhancement in the activity 1 week following LPS injection in male mice. We propose that neonatal inflammation could induce susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders through modification of hippocampal gliovascular interface in a sex-dependent manner.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia remains a clinically and pharmacologically unsolved challenge. Clinical and preclinical studies have revealed that the concomitant reduction in dysbindin (DYS) and dopamine receptor D3 functionality improves cognitive functions. However, the molecular machinery underlying this epistatic interaction has not yet been fully elucidated. The glutamate NMDA receptors and the neurotrophin BDNF, with their established role in promoting neuroplasticity, may be involved in the complex network regulated by the D3/DYS interaction. Furthermore, as inflammation is involved in the etiopathogenesis of several psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, the D3/DYS interaction may affect the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, by employing mutant mice bearing selective heterozygosis for D3 and/or DYS, we provide new insights into the functional interactions (single and synergic) between these schizophrenia susceptibility genes and the expression levels of key genes for neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation in three key brain areas for schizophrenia: the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the epistatic interaction between D3 and DYS reversed to the wild-type level the downregulated mRNA levels of GRIN1 and GRIN2A were observed in DYS +/- and D3 +/- mice. In all the areas investigated, double mutant mice had higher BDNF levels compared to their single heterozygote counterparts, whereas D3 hypofunction resulted in higher pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results may help to clarify the genetic mechanisms and functional interactions involved in the etiology and development of schizophrenia.

AB  - Cuticular wax ubiquitously covers the outer layer of plants and protects them against various abiotic and biotic stresses. Nevertheless, the characteristics of cuticular wax and its role in cold resistance in tea plants remain unclear. In our study, cuticular wax from different tissues, cultivars, and leaves during different spatio-temporal growth stages were characterized and compared in tea plants. The composition, distribution pattern, and structural profile of cuticular wax showed considerable tissue specificity, particularly in petals and seeds. During the spatial development of tea leaves, total wax content increased from the first to fifth leaf in June, while a decreasing pattern was observed in September. Additionally, the total wax content and number of wax compounds were enhanced, and the wax composition significantly varied with leaf growth from June to September. Ten cultivars showed considerable differences in total wax content and composition, such as the predominance of saturated fatty acids and primary alcohols in SYH and HJY cultivars, respectively. Correlation analysis suggested that n-hexadecanoic acid is positively related to cold resistance in tea plants. Further transcriptome analysis from cold-sensitive AJBC, cold-tolerant CYQ, and EC 12 cultivars indicated that the inducible expression of wax-related genes was associated with the cold tolerance of different cultivars in response to cold stress. Our results revealed the characterization of cuticular wax in tea plants and provided new insights into its modification in cold tolerance.

AB  - Plants regulate the biosynthesis and emission of metabolic compounds to manage herbivorous stresses. In this study, as a destructive pest, the pre-infestation of rice striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis) larvae on rice (Oryza sativa) reduced the subsequent SSB female adult oviposition preference. Widely targeted volatilomics and transcriptome sequencing were used to identify released volatile metabolic profiles and differentially expressed genes in SSB-infested and uninfested rice plants. SSB infestation significantly altered the accumulation of 71 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 13 terpenoids. A total of 7897 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified, and genes involved in the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolic pathways were highly enriched. Correlation analysis revealed that DEGs in terpenoid metabolism-related pathways were likely involved in the regulation of VOC biosynthesis in SSB-infested rice plants. Furthermore, two terpenoids, (-)-carvone and cedrol, were selected to analyse the behaviour of SSB and predators. Y-tube olfactometer tests demonstrated that both (-)-carvone and cedrol could repel SSB adults at higher concentrations; (-)-carvone could simultaneously attract the natural enemies of SSB, Cotesia chilonis and Trichogramma japonicum, and cedrol could only attract T. japonicum at lower concentrations.

AB  - High altitude cerebral edema does not fall in routine definition of hypoxia and requires alternative therapeutic strategies. 12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15 LOX), a key proinflammatory lipid peroxidative enzyme which site specifically inserts into cellular and subcellular membranes and plays an instrumental role in hypobaric hypoxia induced neuropathogenesis. Mitochondria, the master regulator organelles for oxygen consumption and ATP generation are sensitive to intracellular oxygen perturbations and are associated with activation of apoptosis based cell death cascades that seal the fate of the cell. The mechanistic involvement of 12/15 LOX in mito-chondria mediated cell death in brain microenvironment during hypobaric hypoxia conditions can be an interesting preposition. In the present study, we have investigated underlying involvement of 12/15 LOX in hypobaric hypoxia (HH) induced disturbance in mitochondrial integrity and its relation with neuronal apoptosis. Male Balb/c mice subjected to simulated HH condition for three consecutive days showed robust increase in intra-hippocampal 12(S)HETE (12/15 LOX metabolite), which was significantly reduced following baicalein (12/ 15 LOX Inhibitor) treatment. The elevated level of 12(S)HETE following hypobaric hypoxia condition correlated with simultaneous increase in expression of 12/15 LOX in neurons and microglia lining the hippocampal CA3 region. Further, 12/15 LOX gets embedded onto the periphery of mitochondria following HH and a strong correlation has been observed with loss of mitochondrial integrity as evident from increased cytochrome-c in the cytosolic compartment and a subsequent upregulated activity of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 as well as Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio. The observed effects seen under HH were reversed upon treatment with baicalein suggesting a critical role of 12/15 LOX in HH induced mitochondrial damage Further, the hypobaric hypoxia-mediated increase in hippocampal pAKT and pmTOR protein expression were significantly ameliorated following 12/15 LOX inhibition, suggesting a mitochondrial involvement. We hereby demonstrate the contribution of 12/15 LOX in disorienting mitochondrial integrity with subsequent release of cytochrome-c in cytosol which drives the neuronal cells to intrinsic mode of cell death during hypobaric hypoxia. The protective role of baicalein by in-hibition of 12/15 LOX dependent neuronal cell death and preservation of mitochondrial integrity suggests it to be a plausible therapeutic target in CNS related disorders.

AB  - The toxicity of glucosinolate, isothiocyanate and sinapin limits canola meal's use as non-ruminant animal feed. While monoculture microbial biorefining has been explored, the potential and capability of insect-associated microbiomes in this context remain underexplored. Herein, we extracted the gut and frass extracts from canola feeding larvae of Heliothis moth (HP), cabbage white (WCF) and cabbage looper (CL). Canola meal was fermented for one week with these extracts, followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-assisted metabolomics analysis. Elevated branched-SCFAs 2-hydroxy butyrate and 3-hydroxy butyrate and propionate were observed in HP and WCF ferments, respectively. Aliphatic glucosinolates and sinapins showed >= 2-fold depletion in the HP and WCF frass ferments. In gut extract and frass-fermented canola meal, particularly of the HP group, tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine and glutathione metabolism were the most impactful pathways, aiding biogenic amine and branched-SCFA synthesis. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) led salvaging, playing a key role in amino acid recycling via mercapturate metabolism, oxidative stress handling via the methionine and cysteine metabolism pathway, and sinapin metabolism through syringate degradation. These findings highlight the metabolic mechanism of brassica herbivore insect gut microbiome in detoxifying and adding value to canola meal. Such microbial communities have the potential to upcycle canola meal into a nutrient-rich feed additive with gut-health-promoting properties.

AB  - Clustering Epilepsy (CE) is a neurological disorder caused by pathogenic variants of the Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) gene. PCDH19 encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion and Estrogen Receptor alpha mediated-gene regulation. To gain further insights into the molecular role of PCDH19 in the brain, we investigated the PCDH19 interactome in the developing mouse hippocampus and cortex. Combined with a meta-analysis of all reported PCDH19 interacting proteins, our results show that PCDH19 interacts with proteins involved in actin, microtubule, and gene regulation. We report CAPZA1, alpha N-catenin and, importantly, beta-catenin as novel PCDH19 interacting proteins. Furthermore, we show that PCDH19 is a regulator of beta-catenin transcriptional activity, and that this pathway is disrupted in CE individuals. Overall, our results support the involvement of PCDH19 in the cytoskeletal network and point to signalling pathways where PCDH19 plays critical roles.

AB  - Behavior and innervation suggest a high tactile sensitivity of elephant trunks. To clarify the tactile trunk periphery we studied whiskers with the following findings. Whisker density is high at the trunk tip and African savanna elephants have more trunk tip whiskers than Asian elephants. Adult elephants show striking lateralized whisker abrasion caused by lateralized trunk behavior. Elephant whiskers are thick and show little tapering. Whisker follicles are large, lack a ring sinus and their organization varies across the trunk. Follicles are innervated by similar to 90 axons from multiple nerves. Because elephants don't whisk, trunk movements determine whisker contacts. Whisker-arrays on the ventral trunk-ridge contact objects balanced on the ventral trunk. Trunk whiskers differ from the mobile, thin and tapered facial whiskers that sample peri-rostrum space symmetrically in many mammals. We suggest their distinctive features-being thick, non-tapered, lateralized and arranged in specific high-density arrays-evolved along with the manipulative capacities of the trunk.

AB  - Hippocampus-related cognitive deficits in working and verbal memory are frequent in schizophrenia, and hippocampal volume loss, particularly in the cornu ammonis (CA) subregions, was shown by magnetic resonance imaging studies. However, the underlying cellular alterations remain elusive. By using unbiased design-based stereology, we reported a reduction in oligodendrocyte number in CA4 in schizophrenia and of granular neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG). Here, we aimed to replicate these findings in an independent sample. We used a stereological approach to investigate the numbers and densities of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes in CA4 and of granular neurons in the DG of left and right hemispheres in 11 brains from men with schizophrenia and 11 brains from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In schizophrenia, a decreased number and density of oligodendrocytes was detected in the left and right CA4, whereas mean volumes of CA4 and the DG and the numbers and density of neurons, astrocytes, and granular neurons were not different in patients and controls, even after adjustment of variables because of positive correlations with postmortem interval and age. Our results replicate the previously described decrease in oligodendrocytes bilaterally in CA4 in schizophrenia and point to a deficit in oligodendrocyte maturation or a loss of mature oligodendrocytes. These changes result in impaired myelination and neuronal decoupling, both of which are linked to altered functional connectivity and subsequent cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is the ongoing generation of functional new neurons from neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the mammalian brain. However, this process declines with aging, which is implicated in the recession of brain function and neurodegeneration. Understanding the mechanism of adult neurogenesis and stimulating neurogenesis will benefit the mitigation of neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy, a highly conserved process of cellular degradation, is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal function. Whether and how autophagy affects adult neurogenesis remains poorly understood. In present study, we revealed a close connection between impaired autophagy and adult neurogenetic decline. Expression of autophagy-related genes and autophagic activity were significantly declined in the middle-adult subventricular/subgranular zone (SVZ/SGZ) homogenates and cultured NPCs, and inhibiting autophagy by siRNA interference resulted in impaired proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, stimulating autophagy by rapamycin not only revitalized the viability of middle-adult NPCs, but also facilitated the neurogenesis in middle-adult SVZ/SGZ. More importantly, autophagic activation by rapamycin also ameliorated the olfactory sensitivity and cognitional capacities in middle-adult mice. Taken together, our results reveal that compromised autophagy is involved in the decline of adult neurogenesis, which could be reversed by autophagy activation. It also shed light on the regulation of adult neurogenesis and paves the way for developing a therapeutic strategy for aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Changes in structural and functional neuroplasticity have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c is a critical regulatory molecule of lipid homeostasis in the brain. Recently, our findings have shown the potential involvement of SREBP-1c deficiency in the alteration of novel modulatory molecules in the hippocampus and occurrence of schizophrenia-like behaviors in mice. However, the possible underlying mechanisms, related to neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus, are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the hippocampus-dependent memory function and neuronal architecture of hippocampal neurons in SREBP-1c knockout (KO) mice. During the passive avoidance test, SREBP-1c KO mice showed memory impairment. Based on Golgi staining, the dendritic complexity, length, and branch points were significantly decreased in the apical cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampi of SREBP-1c KO mice, compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, significant decreases in the dendritic diameters were detected in the CA3 and DG subregions, and spine density was also significantly decreased in the apical CA3 subregion of the hippocampi of KO mice, compared with that of WT mice. Alterations in the proportions of stubby and thin-shaped dendritic spines were observed in the apical subcompartments of CA1 and CA3 in the hippocampi of KO mice. Furthermore, the corresponding differential decreases in the levels of SREBP-1 expression in the hippocampal subregions (particularly, a significant decrease in the level in the CA3) were detected by immunofluorescence. This study suggests that the contributions of SREBP-1c to the structural plasticity of the mouse hippocampus may have underlain the behavioral alterations. These findings offer insights into the critical role of SREBP-1c in hippocampal functioning in mice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder associated with memory loss, but the AD-associated neuropathological changes begin years before memory impairments. Investigation of the early molecular abnormalities in AD might offer innovative opportunities to target memory impairment prior to onset. Decreased protein synthesis plays a fundamental role in AD, yet the consequences of this dysregulation for cellular function remain unknown. We hypothesize that alterations in the de novo proteome drive early metabolic alterations in the hippocampus that persist throughout AD progression. Using a combinatorial amino acid tagging approach to selectively label and enrich newly synthesized proteins, we found that the de novo proteome is disturbed in young APP/PS1 mice prior to symptom onset, affecting the synthesis of multiple components of the synaptic, lysosomal, and mitochondrial pathways. Furthermore, the synthesis of large clusters of ribosomal subunits were affected throughout development. Our data suggest that large-scale changes in protein synthesis could underlie cellular dysfunction in AD.
   Elder et al. investigated the de novo proteome in isolated hippocampal slices of young APP/PS1 Alzheimer's model mice and revealed that large-scale changes in protein synthesis precede symptom onset. These results suggest that broad dysregulation of protein synthesis could contribute toward cellular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution exposure is associated with child's brain morphology, but the relationship between air pollution and longitudinal changes in the development of brain volumes has yet to be investigated. We studied the association of exposure to air pollution in pregnancy and childhood with the change of brain volumes from childhood into adolescence, using repeated assessments of brain volumes. We used data from 4243 children of a large Dutch population-based birth cohort. Exposure to 14 air pollutants during pregnancy and childhood was estimated using land-use regression models. We obtained structural brain MRI data at 3 timepoints, resulting in 6059 useable scans of white matter, cortical grey matter, cerebellum, and 7 subcortical volumes. For 1191 participants we had data on both last two timepoints. We conducted single-pollutant analyses for each air pollutant and brain volume, using linear mixed models adjusted for life-style and socioeconomic status variables. Then we performed multi-pollutant analyses with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator for mixed models. Air pollution exposure was not associated with changes in white matter, cortical grey matter, and cerebellar volumes. Higher exposure to copper and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) during pregnancy was associated with a smaller hippocampal volume at the first neuroimaging assessment, followed by faster growth of hippocampal volume (e.g. 25.1 mm(3) increase of hippocampal volume [95 % CI 8.6; 41.7] per 5 ng/m(3) increase in copper exposure per year of age). Results were comparable when restricting the analyses to children with complete data for the last two timepoints. Exposure to copper and PM2.5 during pregnancy was related with a smaller hippocampal volume in mid childhood, followed by catch-up growth. Plasticity of the hippocampus might mitigate adverse effects of air pollution early in life.

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), as a widely used brominated flame retardant, has been implicated as a potential neurotoxicant. However, the mechanism of TBBPA-induced neurotoxicity has not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, using mouse hippocampal neuron cell HT22 as the in vitro model, the neuronal cytotoxicity of TBBPA and the mechanism by focusing on mitophagy have been studied. We found that neuronal cytotoxic effects were indeed induced by TBBPA exposure at concentrations of >20 IrM for 24 h, including decreased cell viability (to 92.38 % at 20 IrM; 18.25 % at 80 IrM), enhanced ROS (enhanced 53.26 % at IC50 of 60 IrM, compared with that in the control group) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels (enhanced 24.12 % at 60 IrM), reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (decreased 33.60 % at 60 IrM). As a protective mechanism in cells, autophagy was initiated; however, mitophagy was inhibited, where PINK1 (PINK1-Parkin activation is critical in the depolarized MMP-induced mitophagy) expression was found to be repressed and decreased, further leading to the failure of Parkin recruitment to the damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy activator, nicotinamide mono nucleotide (13-NMN) that activates the PINK1-Parkin pathway, could alleviate TBBPA-induced mitophagy deficiency and further reduce the neuronal cytotoxicity, demonstrating that TBBPA-induced PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy deficiency contributed to the neuronal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we found TBBPA caused the upregulation of Atf3 (activating transcription factor 3) gene transcription and expression levels, alongside reduced Pink1 levels; whereas enhanced Pink1 transcript levels were observed after ATF3 depletion even under TBBPA treatment, demonstrating TBBPA-induced overexpression of ATF3 should be responsible for the reduced PINK1 expression. Therefore, for the first time, here we demonstrate that TBBPA can inhibit PINK1-Parkinmediated mitophagy via upregulating ATF3 expression, which further contributes to its neuronal cytotoxicity. This study should be able to improve our understanding of the mechanism of TBBPA-induced neuronal cytotoxicity.

AB  - Prion protein peptide (PrP) has demonstrated neurotoxicity in brain cells, resulting in the progression of prion diseases with spongiform degenerative, amyloidogenic, and aggregative properties. Thymosin beta 4 (T beta(4)) plays a role in the nervous system and may be related to motility, axonal enlargement, differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and proliferation. However, no studies about the effects of T beta(4) on prion disease have been performed yet. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of T beta(4) against synthetic PrP (106-126) and considered possible mechanisms. Hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were treated with T beta(4) and PrP (106-126) for 24 h. T beta(4) significantly reversed cell viability and reactive oxidative species (ROS) affected by PrP (106-126). Apoptotic proteins induced by PrP (106-126) were reduced by T beta(4). Interestingly, a balance of neurotrophic factors (nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and receptors (nerve growth factor receptor p75, tropomyosin related kinase A and B) were competitively maintained by T beta(4) through receptors reacting to PrP (106-126). Our results demonstrate that T beta(4) protects neuronal cells against PrP (106-126) neurotoxicity via the interaction of neurotrophic factors/receptors.

AB  - BackgroundEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies and frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles and serve as biomarkers of multiple cancers, including ESCC. Our previous studies have confirmed that lncRNA Kinectin 1 antisense RNA 1 (KTN1-AS1) is highly expressed in ESCC and exerts oncogene function through RBBP4/HDAC1 complex.ObjectiveOur present study focused on exploring a novel molecular mechanism of KTN1-AS1 in ESCC.MethodsIn this study, qRT-PCR assay, Western blot assay, Luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted.ResultsWe found that KTN1-AS1 could bind to miR-885-5p in ESCC cells, and miR-885-5p was low expressed in ESCC. Overexpression of miR-885-5p inhibited esophageal cancer cells proliferation and invasion in vitro. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that miR-885-5p specifically targeted striatin 3 (STRN3), and KTN1-AS1/miR-885-5p promoted the EMT process by Hippo pathway in STRN3/YAP1 dependent manner.ConclusionTo sum up, KTN1-AS1 facilitates ESCC progression by acting as a ceRNA for miR-885-5p to regulate STRN3 expression and the Hippo pathway, and KTN1-AS1 maybe used as a promising therapeutic target for ESCC.

AB  - Background/objectives: The acute stress response affects brain metabolites closely linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This response involves time-dependent changes in hormones and neurotransmitters, which contribute to resilience and the ability to adapt to acute stress while maintaining homeostasis. This physiological mechanism of metabolic dynamics, combined with time-series analysis, has prompted the development of new methods to observe the relationship between TCA cycle-related brain metabolites. This study aimed to observe the acute stress response through metabolic interactions using time-series proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the left hippocampus of mice. Methods: In this study, 4-week-old male C57BL/6N mice (n = 24) were divided into control (n = 12) and acute stress groups (n = 12). Acute stress was induced through a 2 h restraint protocol. Time-series 1H-MRS data were obtained on the left hippocampus of both groups using a 9.4 T 1H-MRS scanner. Time-series MRS data were quantified using LCModel, and significant metabolic interactions were identified through Spearman correlation analysis, a one-tailed sign test, and false discovery rate correction. Results: No significant metabolic correlation coefficient was observed in the control group. However, in the acute stress group, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) showed a significant positive correlation over time, with a high correlation coefficient exceeding 0.5. Conclusions: Temporal measurement of GSH and NAA, combined with correlation analysis, offers a comprehensive understanding for the metabolic dynamics during acute stress. This approach emphasizes their distinct roles and interdependence in the progression of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and the maintenance of physiological homeostasis.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shengyu Decoction (SYD), a classical Chinese medicine formula, is good at nourishing blood, promoting blood circulation, and soothe the nerves. SYD can improve cognitive ability. This decoction is suitable for treating vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). however, its active ingredients and possible mechanism have not been investigated. Aim of the study: This study was conducted to observe the effects of SYD on improving the cognitive abilities of rats with VCI, to explore its active ingredients and mechanism. Materials and methods: The rats with VCI model were established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO), and the effects of SYD (5, 2.5 g/kg) on the cognitive abilities of VCI rats were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) and neurological assessment. The pathological changes of hippocampal CA1 were observed by H &E and Nissl staining. The effect of SYD on cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated by Laser Speckle Contrast Imager. The expression of CD31 in the cerebral cortex was measured by immunofluorescence (IF) to evaluate the number of cerebral micro vessels. The levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus were determined using an ELISA kit, and the active components in the plasma and brain tissues of rats after SYD administration were analyzed using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The interaction network of the compound-target pathway was established using the SWISS Target, GO, and DAVID databases. The expression of AKT/HIF-1 alpha/ VEGF and p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the brain tissues was determined using western blotting (WB). Results: SYD (2.5, 5 g/kg) significantly improved the cognitive abilities of VCI rats in the MWM and neurological assessment. H&E and Nissl staining showed that SYD significantly ameliorated the pathological hippocampal CA1 area and increased the number of Nissl bodies. The Laser Speckle Contrast Imager showed that the cortical CBF of VCI rats in the SYD group was significantly increased, and the IF results showed that CD31 expression was significantly increased in the SYD group. The ELISA results showed that the contents of IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in SYD were significantly reduced. A total of 29 compounds were found in the plasma and brain tissues of the rats treated with SYD. Network pharmacology revealed 99 targets for the treatment of VCI. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the HIF-1 and MAPK signaling pathways might be important for SYD to ameliorate VCI. WB showed that the expressions of AKT, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF in the brain tissues of rats were significantly increased; in addition, NF-kappa B and p38 MAPK were significantly reduced in the SYD group. Conclusion: SYD can improve the cognitive abilities of VCI rats. The mechanism of action of its active ingredients improves cognitive impairment by affecting the AKT/HIF-1 alpha/VEGF and p38 MAPK/NF-kappa B signaling pathways, promoting cerebrovascular generation, and ameliorating neuroinflammation.

AB  - The alpha s2-casein is a phosphoprotein secreted in the milk of most mammals, and it is the most hydrophilic of all caseins. Contrary to genes found in ruminants, in donkeys two different encoding genes for donkey alpha s2-casein (CSN1S2 I and CSN1S2 II) have been identified. However, unlike in ruminants, the variability at these loci has not been characterized in detail in donkeys until now. In this study, we analyze the transcript profile of the donkey CSN1S2 I and CSN1S2 II genes, and we identify and describe the variability of these loci in the Ragusana and Amiatina breeds reared in Italy. The analysis of the CSN1S2 I Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) products and subsequent sequencing showed, in addition to correctly spliced mRNA, seven other minor mRNAs resulting from differential splicing events involving, in various combinations, entire exons (4, 5, 6, and 11), parts of exons (5 ' or 3 ' end of exon 17), or the recognition of intronic sequences as an exon (exon 12 '). Similarly, the transcription analysis of the CSN1S2 II gene revealed a remarkable variability in splicing events, mainly concerning the alternative insertion of an extra exon 7 (named 7 '); the first 33 bp of exon 13; or the alternative skipping of exons 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15, and their combinations. At the mRNA level for CSN1S2 I, seven SNPs were observed, five of which led to amino acid changes: p.T73>A, p.I109>V, p.I130>V, p.I146>T, and p.D217>Y. Similarly, nine SNPs were observed at the CSN1S2 II locus, seven of which are non-synonymous: p.L63>F, p.H70>Q, p.D90>N, p.129A>T, p.H131>Y, p.E144>G, and p.F157>S. In addition, the DNA sequencing of exon 17 and flanking introns of the CSN1S2 I gene revealed a G>A transition at the splice acceptor site of CSN1S2 I exon 17 (FM946022.1:c.375-1G>A), resulting in an allele-specific skipping of the first 15 nucleotides of this exon, which encode the peptide 176NKINQ180, and the recognition of an in-frame cryptic splicing acceptor site: arAACAAAATCAACCAG. A genotyping method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (XbaI PCR-RFLP) was set up for this SNP. In the total population studied (105 Ragusana and 14 Amiatina donkeys), the A allele had a frequency of 0.2437 with no evidence of deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This study adds new knowledge regarding the genetic variability of alpha s2-caseins in donkeys and may contribute significantly to the genetic improvement of milk production for this species.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer nanovesicles released by most functional cells to body fluids, containing bioactive molecules, mainly proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids having actions at target cells. The EVs have essential functions in cell-to-cell communication by regulating different biological processes in target cells. Fluids from the male reproductive tract, including seminal plasma, contain many extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which have been evaluated to a lesser extent than those of other body fluids, particularly in farm animals and pets. Results from the few studies that have been conducted indicated epithelial cells of the testis, epididymis, ampulla of ductus deferens and many accessory sex glands release sEVs mainly via apocrine mechanisms. The sEVs are morphologically heterogeneous and bind to functional cells of the male reproductive tract, spermatozoa, and cells of the functional tissues of the female reproductive tract after mating or insemination. The sEVs encapsulate proteins and miRNAs that modulate sperm functions and male fertility. The sEVs, therefore, could be important as reproductive biomarkers in breeding sires. Many of the current findings regarding sEV functions, however, need experimental confirmation. Further studies are particularly needed to characterize both membranes and con-tents of sEVs, as well as the interaction between sEVs and target cells (spermatozoa and functional cells of the internal female reproductive tract). A priority for conducting these studies is devel-opment of methods that can be standardized and that are scalable, cost-effective and time-saving for isolation of different subtypes of EVs present in the entire population of sEVs.

AB  - Simple Summary Olfaction in animals plays important roles in many aspects, such as food recognition, mate detection and risk avoidance and social communication. Compared to other Ursidae species, the obligate bamboo feeder, giant panda, shows special diet, and how the diet transformation affects the olfactory system remains little known. In this study, we identified the olfactory receptor (OR) genes of the giant panda based on the chromosome-level genome and conducted comparative analysis of OR genes among Ursidae species. The giant panda had 639 OR genes, and chromosome 8 had the most OR genes. The giant panda had 31 unique OR gene subfamilies (containing 35 OR genes), of which 10 genes were clustered into 8 subfamilies with 10 known human OR genes (OR8J3, OR51I1, OR10AC1, OR1S2, OR1S1, OR51S1, OR4M1, OR4M2, OR51T1 and OR5W2). Compared to other Ursidae species, the giant panda lacked OR genes similar to OR2B1, OR10G3, OR11H6 and OR11H7P, which may be related to the diet transformation from carnivore to herbivore. Hence, these results may shed light on the olfactory function and variation of the giant panda. The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is the epitome of a flagship species for wildlife conservation and also an ideal model of adaptive evolution. As an obligate bamboo feeder, the giant panda relies on the olfaction for food recognition. The number of olfactory receptor (OR) genes and the rate of pseudogenes are the main factors affecting the olfactory ability of animals. In this study, we used the chromosome-level genome of the giant panda to identify OR genes and compared the genome sequences of OR genes with five other Ursidae species (spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), American black bear (Ursus americanus), brown bear (Ursus arctos), polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus)). The giant panda had 639 OR genes, including 408 functional genes, 94 partial OR genes and 137 pseudogenes. Among them, 222 OR genes were detected and distributed on 18 chromosomes, and chromosome 8 had the most OR genes. A total of 448, 617, 582, 521 and 792 OR genes were identified in the spectacled bear, American black bear, brown bear, polar bear and Asian black bear, respectively. Clustering analysis based on the OR protein sequences of the six species showed that the OR genes distributed in 69 families and 438 subfamilies based on sequence similarity, and the six mammals shared 72 OR gene subfamilies, while the giant panda had 31 unique OR gene subfamilies (containing 35 genes). Among the 35 genes, there are 10 genes clustered into 8 clusters with 10 known human OR genes (OR8J3, OR51I1, OR10AC1, OR1S2, OR1S1, OR51S1, OR4M1, OR4M2, OR51T1 and OR5W2). However, the kind of odor molecules can be recognized by the 10 known human OR genes separately, which needs further research. The phylogenetic tree showed that 345 (about 84.56%) functional OR genes were clustered as Class-II, while only 63 (about 15.44%) functional OR genes were clustered as Class-I, which required further and more in-depth research. The potential odor specificity of some giant panda OR genes was identified through the similarity to human protein sequences. Sequences similar to OR2B1, OR10G3, OR11H6 and OR11H7P were giant panda-specific lacking, which may be related to the transformation and specialization from carnivore to herbivore of the giant panda. Since our reference to flavoring agents comes from human research, the possible flavoring agents from giant panda-specific OR genes need further investigation.
   Moreover, the conserved motifs of OR genes were highly conserved in Ursidae species. This systematic study of OR genes in the giant panda will provide a solid foundation for further research on the olfactory function and variation of the giant panda.

AB  - The mammalian fetus thrives at oxygen tensions much lower than those of adults. Gestation at high altitude superimposes hypoxic stresses on the fetus resulting in increased erythropoiesis. We hypothesized that chronic hypoxia at high altitude alters the homeostasis of iron and bioactive nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) in gestation. To test for this, electron paramagnetic resonance was used to provide unique measurements of iron, metalloproteins, and free radicals in the blood and aorta of fetal and maternal sheep from either high or low altitudes (3801 or 300 m). Using ozone-based chemiluminescence with selectivity for various NOx species, we determined the NOx levels in these samples immediately after collection. These experiments demonstrated a systemic redistribution of iron in high altitude fetuses as manifested by a decrease in both chelatable and total iron in the aorta and an increase in non-transferrin bound iron and total iron in plasma. Likewise, high altitude altered the redox status diversely in fetal blood and aorta. This study also found significant increases in blood and aortic tissue NOx in fetuses and mothers at high altitude. In addition, gradients in NOx concentrations observed between fetus and mother, umbilical artery and vein, and plasma and RBCs demonstrated complex dynamic homeostasis of NOx among these circulatory compartments, such as placental generation and efflux as well as fetal consumption of iron-nitrosyls in RBCs, probably HbNO. In conclusion, these results may suggest the utilization of iron from non-hematopoietic tissues iron for erythropoiesis in the fetus and increased NO bioavailability in response to chronic hypoxic stress at high altitude during gestation.

AB  - The limited efficacy of antipsychotics in treating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia has prompted the exploration of adjuvant therapies. Several drugs developed for other indications-including caffeine, metformin, and furosemide-have shown procognitive potential. This study evaluated the effects of these agents on behavioral parameters using the reward-based Ambitus test, and on the cerebral D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) expression and binding. The drugs were administered individually and in combination in a schizophrenia-like triple-hit animal model (Lisket rats), derived from the Long Evans (LE) strain. Lisket rats received 14 days of drug treatment via drinking water; water-drinking LE rats served as the controls. The Ambitus test was conducted before treatment and on days 11-14. Caffeine enhanced activity without affecting learning or memory. Metformin and furosemide reduced exploratory behavior but improved reference memory; these effects were inhibited by caffeine co-administration. Although no statistically significant behavioral differences were found compared to water-treated Lisket rats, a trend toward reduced exploratory visits was observed in the triple-combination group. Lisket rats exhibited moderately reduced D2R binding in the cortex and increased binding in the hippocampus. Caffeine alone and in combination enhanced hippocampal D2R binding, while furosemide increased cortical D2R expression. This study is the first to highlight the behavioral and molecular effects of these non-antipsychotic agents in a schizophrenia model, supporting their potential for adjunctive use.

AB  - D-galactose has been widely used as an inducer of cellular senescence and pathophysiological processes related to aging because it induces oxidative stress. On the other hand, the consumption of antioxidants such as curcumin can be an effective strategy to prevent phenotypes related to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as aging and senescence. This study aimed to evaluate the potential protective effect of curcumin on senescence and oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by D-galactose treatment in Lilly Laboratories Culture-Porcine Kidney 1 (LLC-PK1) and human kidney 2 (HK-2) proximal tubule cell lines from pig and human, respectively. For senescence induction, cells were treated with 300 mM D-galactose for 120 h and, to evaluate the protective effect of the antioxidant, cells were treated with 5 mu M curcumin for 24 h and subsequently treated with curcumin + D-galactose for 120 h. In LLC-PK1 cells, curcumin treatment decreased by 20% the number of cells positive for senescence-associated (SA)-beta-D-galactosidase staining and by 25% the expression of 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and increased by 40% lamin B1 expression. In HK-2 cells, curcumin treatment increased by 60% the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, 50% Klotho levels, and 175% catalase activity. In both cell lines, this antioxidant decreased the production of ROS (20% decrease for LLC-PK1 and 10 to 20% for HK-2). These data suggest that curcumin treatment has a moderate protective effect on D-galactose-induced senescence in LLC-PK1 and HK-2 cells.

AB  - Radiation exposure causes neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss, leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments. This study aims to evaluate the effect of niacin interventions on whole-brain irradiation (WBI)-induced cognitive and behavioral impairment. Female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to Control (Group 1), Radiation +Saline (Group 2), and Radiation +niacin (Group 3) groups. Rats in the irradiated groups (Groups 2 and 3) received a single dose of 20 Gy photon irradiation. Group 2 received water seven days after irradiation, while Group 3 received niacin (60 mg/kg, 2 mL) oral gavage for 15 days. On days 22, 23, and 24, behavioral assessments were performed, including the Open Field Test, the Sociability Test, and the Passive Avoidance Learning (PAL) task. Biochemical analyses included MDA, BDNF, TNF-alpha, CREB), SIRT1, and SIRT6 measured by ELISA. Histological assessments included neuronal density and GFAP immunostaining in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Radiation exposure importantly increased MDA and TNF-alpha levels, while SIRT1, SIRT6, BDNF, and CREB were notably reduced. This was accompanied by neuronal loss in the cerebellum and hippocampus, astrogliosis, and behavioral and cognitive deficits. Niacin treatment significantly decreased MDA and TNF-alpha levels while increasing BDNF, CREB, SIRT1, and SIRT6 expression, attenuating neuronal apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that niacin treatment enhanced neuronal density in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and cerebellar Purkinje neurons while reducing GFAP immunoreactivity in the CA1, CA3, and cerebellum following WBI. Behaviorally, niacin treatment improved social interaction, locomotor activity, and memory performance, underscoring its neuroprotective potential against WBI-induced damage. These findings suggest that niacin may ameliorate behavioral and cognitive impairments following whole brain irradiation by activating the SIRT1/CREB/BDNF or SIRT1/SIRT6/MDA/TNF-alpha signaling pathway.

AB  - Although seizures are a hallmark feature of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), psychiatric comorbidities, including psychosis, are frequently associated with TLE and contribute to decreased quality of life. Currently, there are no defined therapeutic protocols to manage psychosis in TLE patients, as antipsychotic agents may induce epileptic seizures and are associated with severe side effects and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with antiepileptic drugs. Thus, novel treatment strategies are necessary. Several lines of evidence suggest that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathology of both TLE and psychosis; therefore, restoring hippocampal activity back to normal levels may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating psychosis in TLE. In rodent models, increased activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) results in aberrant dopamine system function, which is thought to underlie symptoms of psychosis. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that targeting & alpha;5-containing & gamma;-aminobutyric acid receptors (& alpha;5GABA(A)Rs), an inhibitory receptor abundant in the hippocampus, with positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), can restore dopamine system function in rodent models displaying hippocampal hyperactivity. Thus, we posited that & alpha;5-PAMs may be beneficial in a model used to study TLE. Here, we demonstrate that pilocarpine-induced TLE is associated with increased VTA dopamine neuron activity, an effect that was completely reversed by intra-vHipp administration of GL-II-73, a selective & alpha;5-PAM. Further, pilocarpine did not alter the hippocampal & alpha;5GABA(A)R expression or synaptic localization that may affect the efficacy of & alpha;5-PAMs. Taken together, these results suggest augmenting & alpha;5GABA(A)R function as a novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of psychosis in TLE.

AB  - Several evidences suggest that immuno-inflammatory responses are involved in the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa (AN). Herein we investigate the possible alteration of key mediators of inflammation, redox balance, and neuroplasticity in the brain of rats showing an anorexic-like phenotype. We modeled AN in adolescent female rats using the activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm and measured gene expression levels of targets of interest in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal hippocampus (DH). We observed reduced mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1(3 and TNF-alpha, the inflammasome NLRP3, and the microglial marker CD11b in both PFC and DH of ABA animals. Conversely, the mRNA of IL-6, which acts as both a pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokine, was increased. Moreover, we observed an overall upregulation of different antioxidant enzymes in PFC, while their profile was not affected or opposite in the DH, with the exception of MT1 alpha. Interestingly, ABA animals showed elevated levels of the neuroplasticity marker BDNF in both PFC and DH. Our data indicate that ABA induction is associated with anatomical-specific cerebral alteration of mediators of neuroinflammation, oxidative balance and neuroplasticity. Although more research should be conducted, these results add important information about the role of these systems in the complex AN etiopathogenesis.

AB  - Cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse reaction during drug treatment. The cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels play a crucial role in driving cardiac action potential repolarization and are a key target for drug-induced cardiac toxicity. Chelerythrine (CHE) has anticancer effects on various human cancer cells. But little is known about its drug safety currently. The purpose of this study is to explore the key mechanism of cardiac toxicity induced by CHE under pathological conditions. CHE and hypoxia prolonged QT interval and action potential duration compared with control group in guinea pigs, as measured by BL-420S biological acquisition and processing system in conjunction with optical mapping technology. hERG current was measured by patchclamp technique, and the interaction between ubiquitin molecules and hERG channels was assessed using immunoprecipitation method at the molecular level. The colocalization of proteins and the function of lysosomes were determined via confocal laser scanning microscopy. Further research indicates that CHE enhances the ubiquitination process of hERG proteins by catalyzing the formation of K63 ubiquitin chains, the stasis, and promotes the degradation of the channel. Mechanistically, CHE accelerates the degradation of hERG channels through lysosomes via HDAC6, which may easily induce cardiotoxicity caused by prolonged QT interval under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Existing research suggests the involvement of a brain-liver-communication-related mechanism in the occurrence of depression. In this study, we selected Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that can simultaneously affect liver and depression, as a probe to investigate the involvement of the brain-liver-communication-related mechanism in perimenopausal depression. A total of 50 experimental perimenopausal depression rat models were established by ovariectomy surgery (PMS) followed by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) processes. Animals underwent CSS treatment or treatments with CSS + Ly294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. We observed the behavioural performances of depression and anxiety, serum concentrations of biochemical indices, serum estrogen two levels, hippocampal 5-HT and NE levels and the morphological changes in liver tissues. The protein and mRNA expressions of PI3K and Akt were also evaluated. CSS treatment significantly ameliorated the behavioural performance, partial biochemical indices and the morphological changes in the liver tissues of PMS + CUMS rats. Ly294002 partially inhibited the CSS effects. The expressions of PI3K and Akt were significantly downregulated by PMS + CUMS processes but upregulated by CSS treatment, which could be significantly suppressed by Ly294002. A brain-liver-communication-related mechanism may be involved in perimenopausal depression, where the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway plays a vital role.

AB  - Background: Cerebral ischemic injury induces the polarization of astrocytes toward two different phenotypes, i.e., the proinflammatory A1 phenotype and the protective, anti-inflammatory A2 phenotype, affects the prognosis of cerebral ischemia. To explore the neuroprotective effect of phytoestrogens ICT on cerebral ischemic rehabilitation and the preliminary mechanism of regulating astrocyte polarization. Methods: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)/reperfusion was performed on rats and then treated with ICT (i.p.) once daily for 28 days. Intervention of GPER specific inhibitor G15 was repeated. The body weight, Garcia JH scale, right/left brain weight ratio, CatWalk gait test and Y maze test to assess overall neural function in rats. Inflammatory factors in ischemic cortical were detected by Western blotting. The number of newborn neurons was observed by BrdU staining, and the double immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting to evaluated the activation and A1 and A2 polarization of astrocytes. Results: The results showed that ICT treatment markedly perfected functional outcomes on a long-term basis after ischemic stroke, it also improved learning and memory and gait. ICT inhibited the polarization of A1 type astrocytes and promoted the polarization of A2 type astrocytes, promote neuron regeneration in hippocampus DG region. G15 removes some of the protective effects of ICT. Conclusions: The experimental results show that ICT exerts neuroprotective effects and regulates astrocyte polarization through GPER, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke during the recovery period.

AB  - The neuroprotective effects of choline chloride, an essential nutrient, a precursor for the acetylcholine and synthesis of membrane phospholipids, have been associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Its contribution to autism spectrum disorder, a neurodevelopmental disorder, remains unknown. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of choline chloride on social behaviours, and histopathological and biochemical changes in a rat autism model. The autism model was induced by administration of 100 mu g/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the 10th day of gestation. Choline chloride treatment (100 mg/kg/day) was commenced on PN5 and maintained until PN50. Social deficits were assessed by three-chamber sociability, open field, and passive avoidance learning tests. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-2 (IL) and IL-17, nerve growth factor (NGF), and glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) levels were measured to assess neuroinflammatory responses. In addition, the number of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression were evaluated. Social novelty and passive avoidance learning tests revealed significant differences in choline chloride-treated male rats compared with saline-treated groups. TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-17 were significantly decreased after choline chloride treatment in both males and females. NGF and GAD67 levels were unchanged in females, while there were significant differences in males. Histologically, significant changes in terms of gliosis were detected in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions and cerebellum in choline chloride-treated groups. The presence of ameliorative effects of choline chloride treatment on social behaviour and neuroinflammation through neuroinflammatory, neurotrophic, and neurotransmission pathways in a sex-dependent rat model of LPS-induced autism was demonstrated.
   This study explores the neuroprotective effects of choline chloride in a rat model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Choline treatment improved social behaviors and reduced neuroinflammation in sex-dependent ways, with notable reductions in TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-17 levels, and changes in hippocampal and cerebellar gliosis. These findings suggest choline chloride's potential in modulating neuroinflammatory pathways and enhancing social interaction in autism. image

AB  - Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications following surgery and anesthesia, especially in the elderly. These disorders are associated with disruptions in neuronal energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. This study explores the potential of intranasal insulin administration as a therapeutic strategy to prevent PND by targeting the calcium transport protein complex IP3R/GRP75/VDAC1 on mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice underwent partial hepatectomy to induce PND and were subsequently treated with either intranasal insulin or saline. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze test, and hippocampal tissue was analyzed for calcium transport protein complex IP3R/GRP75/VDAC1 expression and apoptosis markers. In vitro, HT22 and BV2 cell co-cultures were utilized to simulate surgical injury, with IP3R knockdown employed to assess its effects on oxidative stress and apoptosis. Results: Intranasal insulin effectively alleviated cognitive impairment as demonstrated by improved performance in the Morris water maze. It significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis and modulated the expression of the IP3R/ GRP75/VDAC1 complex, enhancing mitochondrial ATP production and stabilizing MAMs. Furthermore, insulin administration also increased PI3K/AKT signaling, counteracting the impact of surgical stress. In vitro experiments confirmed that IP3R knockdown mitigated inflammation-induced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, while insulin's beneficial effects were blocked by inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Conclusion: Intranasal insulin mitigates PND by modulating the IP3R/GRP75/VDAC1 complex and enhancing mitochondrial function through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study supports the potential of intranasal insulin as a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing and managing PND, potentially leading to improved surgical outcomes for elderly patients.

AB  - The mammalian brain can store and retrieve memories of related events as distinct memories and remember common features of those experiences. How it computes this function remains elusive. Here, we show in rats that recent memories of two closely timed auditory fear events share overlapping neuronal ensembles in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and are functionally linked. However, remote memories have reduced neuronal overlap and are functionally independent. The activity of parvalbumin (PV) -expressing neurons in the BLA plays a crucial role in forming separate remote memories. Chemogenetic blockade of PV preserves individual remote memories but prevents their segregation, resulting in reciprocal associations. The hippocampus drives this process through specific excitatory connections with BLA GABAergic interneurons. These findings provide insights into the neuronal mechanisms that minimize the overlap between distinct remote memories and enable the retrieval of related memories separately.

AB  - Background: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy can affect the neurological development of offspring. Glial cellderived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), and neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) are three important proteins for brain development. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impacts of the mentioned neurotrophic factors in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rat offspring born to diabetic mothers. Methods: Wistar female rats were randomly allocated into diabetic (STZ-D) [(45 mg/kg BW, STZ (Streptozotocin), i.p)], diabetic + NPH insulin (STZ-INS) [(4-6 unit/kg/day SC)], and control groups. The animals in all groups were mated by non-diabetic male rats. Two weeks after birth, male pups from each group were sacrificed and then protein contents of GDNF, NRTN, and NCAM were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Results: The study found that the expression of GDNF and NRTN in the hippocampus of diabetic rat offspring was significantly higher compared to the diabetic+ insulin and control groups, respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). Additionally, the expression of NCAM was significantly higher in the diabetic group the diabetic+ insulin and control groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of the study revealed that diabetes during pregnancy significantly impacts the distribution pattern of GDNF, NRTN, and NCAM in the hippocampus of rat neonates.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Periplaneta americana (L.) (PA) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years for the effect of invigorating blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Modern pharmacological research shown that PA extract exhibits promising effects in promoting wound healing and regeneration, as well as in brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether it is effective for neuroregeneration and neurological function recovery after stroke still unknown. Aim of the study: This study aims to investigate the potential effect of PA extract to promote brain remodeling through the activation of endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis, in addition, preliminary exploration of its regulatory mechanism. Methods: Firstly, BrdU proliferation assay and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to evaluate the effect of PA extract on the neurogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, the effects of PA extract on brain injury in stroke rats were assessed by TTC and HE. While mNSS score, adhesive removal test, rota-rod test, and morris water maze test were used to assess the impact of PA extract on neurological function in post-stroke rats. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of PA extract regulation were explored by RNA-Seq and western blotting. Results: The number of BrdU+ cells in C17.2 cells, NSCs and BMECs dramatically increased, as well as the expression of astrocyte marker protein GFAP and neuronal marker protein Tuj-1 in C17.2 and NSCs. Moreover, PA extract also increased the number of BrdU+DCX+, BrdU+GFAP+, BrdU+CD31+ cells in the SGZ area of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model (tMCAO) rats. TTC and HE staining revealed that PA extract significantly reduced the infarction volume and ameliorated the pathological damage. Behavioral tests demonstrated that treatment with PA extract reduced the mNSS score and the time required to remove adhesive tape, while increasing the time spent on the rotarod. Additionally, in the morris water maze test, the frequency of crossing platform and the time spent in the platform quadrant increased. Finally, RNA-Seq and Western blot revealed that PA extract increased the expression of p-ERK, p-CREB and BDNF. Importantly, PA extract mediated proliferation and differentiation of C17.2 and NSCs reversed by the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 and the BDNF inhibitor ANA-12, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that PA extract promoted neurogenesis and angiogenesis by activating the CREB/ERK signaling pathway and upregulating BDNF expression, thereby recovering neurological dysfunction in post-stroke.

AB  - Excessive glycogen deposition is a common feature of liver enlargement, liver adenoma, and liver cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that NUMB, a well-known cell fate determinant, is downregulated in glycogen-rich adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NUMB-deficient livers developed excessive glycogen accumulation and adenoma formation particularly in aged mice. Surprisingly, the Alb-Cre:Trp53loxP/loxP liver displayed no similar defective morphology and function, although p53 is considered an important downstream target of NUMB and closely related to glucose metabolism. Instead, we observed a synergistic interaction between NUMB and p53 in regulating glycogen metabolism in HCC tissues and cell lines. Combined knockout of NUMB and p53 in mice significantly enhances glycogen accumulation and hepatomegaly, particularly when mice are subjected to a high sugar diet (HSD), leading to higher cancer incidence. Mechanistically, NUMB deficiency disrupts the PTEN-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting glycogen accumulation. Subsequently, successive glycogen deposition triggers hepatomegaly and tumorigenesis via the Hippo signaling pathway. Our results suggest that NUMB plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of glucose metabolism and suppressing the development of liver tumors associated with glycogen deposition.

AB  - As an important part of environmental science and water resources management, water quality prediction is of great importance. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) at the outlet of a reservoir, this paper proposes an improved Seahorse Optimizer to enhance the hybrid kernel extreme learning machine model for water quality prediction. Firstly, the circle chaotic map is used to initialize the hippocampus population to improve the diversity and quality of the population, and then the sine and cosine strategy is used to replace the predation behavior of the hippocampus to improve the global search ability. Finally, the lens imaging reverse learning strategy is used to expand the search range and prevent it from falling into the local optimal solution. By introducing two kernel functions, a global kernel function (Poly) and a local kernel function (RBF), a new hybrid kernel function extreme learning machine is formed by linearly combining these two kernel functions. The parameters of this HKELM are optimized with the improved Seahorse Optimizer, and the water quality prediction model of CZTSHO-HKELM is constructed. The simulation results show that the operating efficiency and prediction accuracy of the model are better than those of the ELM, CZTSHO-ELM, CZTSHO-KELM, and SHO-HKELM models, with the correlation coefficients increased by 5.5%, 3.3%, 3.4%, and 7.4%, respectively. The dissolved oxygen prediction curve is close to the actual dissolved oxygen change, which can better meet the requirements of reservoir water quality prediction. The above method can be applied to further accurately predict the water quality of the reservoir.

AB  - New active ingredients, including those of plant origin, which could protect the skin against various harmful factors, such as UV radiation and free radicals responsible for skin ageing, are still being sought. The present study was focused on the antioxidant activity of Hippopha & euml; rhamnoides L. and Vaccinium oxycoccos L. fruit glycolic extracts. Investigations were also carried out to evaluate the effect of UVA radiation and the storage of the sea buckthorn and European cranberry extracts at an elevated temperature of 50 degrees C on their interactions with free radicals. The kinetics of the interactions of the extracts with DPPH were assessed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The sea buckthorn and European cranberry extracts quench the EPR signal of DPPH free radicals, which indicates their antioxidant potential. The EPR method further showed that a mixture of sea buckthorn and cranberry extracts in a volume ratio of 2:1 was more potent in quenching free radicals compared to a mixture of these extracts in a ratio of 1:2. Our findings demonstrate that long-term UVA radiation exposure reduces the ability of sea buckthorn and cranberry extracts to interact with free radicals. Moreover, storage at elevated temperatures does not affect the interaction of sea buckthorn extract with free radicals, while it alters the ability of cranberry extract to interact with free radicals. This study has demonstrated that an important factor in maintaining the ability to scavenge radicals is the storage of raw materials under appropriate conditions. H. rhamnoides and V. oxycoccos extracts can be used as valuable raw materials with antioxidant properties in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

AB  - Hemodynamic models provide a mathematical representation and computational framework that describe the changes in blood flow, blood volume, and oxygenation levels that occur in response to neural activity and systemic changes, while near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and other chromophores to analyze cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism. In this study, we apply a dynamic hemometabolic model to NIRS data acquired during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in pigs. Our goals were to test the model's ability to accurately describe the observed phenomena, to gain an understanding of the intricate behavior of cerebral microvasculature, and to compare the obtained parameters with known values. By employing the inverse of the hemometabolic model, we measured a range of significant physiological parameters, such as the rate of oxygen diffusion from blood to tissue, the arteriole and venule volume fractions, and the Fahraeus factor. Statistical analysis uncovered significant differences in the baseline and post-cardiac arrest values of some of the parameters.

AB  - Introduction: Iron is crucial for brain function, but excessive iron is neurotoxic. Abnormally high brain iron accumulation is one of the pathogenic factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of iron dyshomeostasis in AD is vital for disease mitigation. Calcium, another essential bioelement involved in cell signaling, also exhibits dysregulated homeostasis in AD. Calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling can influence iron homeostasis through multiple effectors. Our previous studies identified Ca2+/calmodulin (CAM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) as a regulator of transferrin (TF)-bound iron trafficking through the TF receptor (TFRC). Given CAMKK2's high expression in brain cells, it was hypothesized that abnormal CAMKK2-TF/TFRC signaling may underlie excessive iron deposition in AD brains. This study aims to retrospectively investigate CAMKK2, TF, TFRC proteins, and iron content in temporal cortex tissues from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals, postmortem. Methods: Postmortem temporal cortex tissues from 74 AD patients, 27 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 17 CN individuals were analyzed for CAMKK2, TF, and TFRC protein levels by Western blotting. Additionally, prefrontal/temporal cortex tissues from 30 CN individuals of various ages were examined for age-related effects. Iron content in cortical tissues was measured using a colorimetric assay. Results: CAMKK2, TF, and TFRC levels were significantly decreased in AD patients' temporal cortices compared to CN individuals, independent of age or postmortem interval-related changes. PD patients' also exhibited similar reductions in CAMKK2/TF/TFRC levels. The increased iron content in AD brains was significantly correlated with reduced TF/TFRC protein levels. Discussion: Building on the previous identification of CAMKK2 as a regulator of TF/TFRC trafficking and iron homeostasis, the findings from this study suggest that downregulation of CAMKK2 in AD cortices may disrupt TF/TFRC signaling and contribute to iron overloading and neurodegeneration through iron-induced toxicity. The decreased levels of TF/TFRC and increased iron in AD brains may result from enhanced clearance or post-trafficking degradation of TF/TFRC due to CAMKK2 downregulation. Restoring CAMKK2 levels in the AD brain could offer a novel therapeutic approach to reestablish iron homeostasis. Further studies are needed to explore the pathways linking CAMKK2 and iron dysregulation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Red mud, a byproduct of alumina production, presents significant challenges due to its large-scale production and inefficient utilization, leading to substantial environmental and health hazards. Traditional disposal methods, such as land-based stockpiling, exacerbate environmental degradation, including soil and groundwater contamination, air pollution, and associated health risks. However, red mud, rich in valuable metals, particularly iron, offers a secondary resource for value-added utilization. This review evaluates various iron extraction methods, including physical, chemical, and pyrometallurgical techniques. Physical methods like magnetic separation and flotation, alongside chemical and hydrometallurgical methods like acid leaching, often encounter obstacles such as low iron recovery rates and acidic wastewater generation. Pyrometallurgical methods, despite their effectiveness, are hindered by high energy consumption and environmental concerns. Conversely, biomass pyrolytic reduction followed by magnetic separation within pyrometallurgical methods has emerged as a promising alternative. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the transformation mechanisms of iron minerals and impurities during biomass pyrolytic reduction, the kinetics of reduction specific to red mud, optimizing biomass quantities, and the nature of produced pyrolytic gases. Addressing these gaps is essential for realizing the full potential of biomass pyrolytic reduction as a sustainable solution for iron extraction from red mud, mitigating environmental impact and fostering sustainability.

AB  - Description of the subject. Urea is a feed additive authorized in ruminant feedingstuff with a maximum content in compound feed of 8,800 mg.kg -1 . Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009 displays the official method for the determination of urea in feed but does not specify the type of feed for which the method is applicable. Following reports from Member States stating that the official spectrophotometric method is not fit for purpose for other feed than ruminant feed and given the fact that no method performance characteristics are set, the Joint Research Centre organized an interlaboratory exercise for the validation of this method. Objectives. The objective was to carry out an interlaboratory ring trial for the validation of the official spectrophotometric method for the determination of urea in compound feed for ruminants, under specific request from DG SANTE of the European Commission. Method. A collaborative study was carried out on six different test materials prepared from ruminant compound feeds containing urea at various mass fractions and a blank test material. Nineteen laboratories enrolled for the study and eighteen laboratories from ten EU Member States submitted results. Results. The performance characteristics were established, namely, the validation criterion used in this study (RSD R ) was in all cases, except in sheep feed at 3,000 mg.kg -1 measured at 420 nm, achieved ( i.e. lower than 20%). Slightly better results in terms of precision and trueness were obtained at 435 nm. Conclusions. Commission Regulation (EC) No 152/2009 should be revised as regards the official spectrophotometric method with a restriction of the scope, which is the determination of urea in ruminant compound feedingstuff at authorized level. Additionally, the selected measurement wavelength, which is either 420 nm or 435 nm, has a minor impact on the performance profile of the method.

AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD) more than 50% of the patients are affected by capillary cerebral amyloid-angiopathy (capCAA), which is characterized by localized hypoxia, neuro-inflammation and loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Moreover, AD patients with or without capCAA display increased vessel number, indicating a reactivation of the angiogenic program. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for BBB dysfunction and angiogenesis in capCAA is still unclear, preventing a full understanding of disease pathophysiology. The Liver X receptor (LXR) family, consisting of LXR alpha and LXR beta, was reported to inhibit angiogenesis and particularly LXR alpha was shown to secure BBB stability, suggesting a major role in vascular function. In this study, we unravel the regulatory mechanism exerted by LXR alpha to preserve BBB integrity in human brain endothelial cells (BECs) and investigate its role during pathological conditions. We report that LXR alpha ensures BECs identity via constitutive inhibition of the transcription factor SNAI2. Accordingly, deletion of brain endothelial LXR alpha is associated with impaired DLL4-NOTCH signalling, a critical signalling pathway involved in vessel sprouting. A similar response was observed when BECs were exposed to hypoxia, with concomitant LXR alpha decrease and SNAI2 increase. In support of our cell-based observations, we report a general increase in vascular SNAI2 in the occipital cortex of AD patients with and without capCAA. Importantly, SNAI2 strongly associated with vascular amyloid-beta deposition and angiopoietin-like 4, a marker for hypoxia. In hypoxic capCAA vessels, the expression of LXR alpha may decrease leading to an increased expression of SNAI2, and consequently BECs de-differentiation and sprouting. Our findings indicate that LXR alpha is essential for BECs identity, thereby securing BBB stability and preventing aberrant angiogenesis. These results uncover a novel molecular pathway essential for BBB identity and vascular homeostasis providing new insights on the vascular pathology affecting AD patients.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Current antiepileptic drugs fail to control approximately 30% of epilepsies. Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective antiepileptic drugs, and medicinal plants provide an attractive source for new compounds. Pergularia daemia (Asclepiadaceae) is used in Cameroon traditional medicine to treat stroke, anemia, inflammation, and epilepsy. Recently, traditional healers claim that an hydroethanolic extract of the roots of P. daemia is more effective than an aqueous extract on refractory seizures.
   Aim of the study: The antiepileptic effect of P. daemia hydro-ethanolic extract was investigated on the pentylenetetrazole kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy in mice and possible mechanisms of action.
   Materials and methods: Mice were divided into 8 groups treated as follows: normal group received distilled water (10 ml/kg, p.o.), control group received distilled water (10 ml/kg, p.o.), ethanol group received ethanol (5%, p. o.), positive control received sodium valproate (300 mg/kg, p.o.), and test groups received P. daemia hydroethanolic (HE) extract (1.6, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg, p.o.). All groups were kindled by 11 injections of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (35 mg/kg, i.p.), once every alternate day (48 +/- 2 h), until the development of kindling, i.e., the occurrence of stage 5 seizures for two consecutive trials. One week later, i.e., 29th day, mice were challenged with a single and lower dose of PTZ (25 mg/kg, i.p.) that does not induce seizures in normal mice but causes seizures in mice prone to seizures and behavioral alterations. After completion of the kindling procedure, Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and open field tests were performed. Afterward, animals were euthanized, and hippocampi were removed for the estimation of the levels of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), L-glutamate decarboxylase (L-GAD), and.-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation markers also were quantified. Finally, histological analysis of the hippocampus was carried out.
   Results: PTZ-kindling induced myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in control mice. However, the HE extract of P. daemia (4-16 mg/kg), compared to sodium valproate, significantly protected mice against myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Also, the HE extract (1.6-16 mg/kg) significantly increased the seizure score. Furthermore, the HE extract of P. daemia significantly reduced seizure-induced cognitive impairments. PTZ-kindling induced significant alterations in GABA, GABA-T, and L-GAD contents as well as oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, and the HE extract significantly reversed these effects, suggesting possible mechanisms. All these activities of the HE extract were confirmed by its protective effect against neuronal loss in the hippocampus.
   Conclusions: The HE extract of P. daemia protected mice against kindled seizures and cognitive impairments, and these effects were greater than those of sodium valproate, a widely used antiepileptic drug. These effects may be mediated by neuromodulatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, thus suggesting a neuroprotective effect. These findings help to explain the beneficial use of these HE extracts of P. daemia in traditional medicine to treat epilepsy in Cameroon.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Crocus sativus L. known as saffron, is a popular food condiment with a high aroma, deep colour, and long and thick threads (stigmas) cultivated in Iran, Morocco, Spain, Italy, China, Japan, France, Turkey, and India. In 'Ayurveda', saffron is acknowledged for its immunostimulant, aphrodisiac, cardiotonic, liver tonic, nervine tonic, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, galactagogue, febrifuge, sedative, relaxant, and anxiolytic activities. The renowned Persian physician and philosopher, Avicenna, delineated saffron as an antidepressant, hypnotic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, bronchodilator, and aphrodisiac in his book, the Canon of Medicine. Within traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM), saffron is characterized as a mood elevator and a rejuvenator for the body and senses. Further, the ethnopharmacological evidence indicates that saffron has shown an effect against neurodegenerative disorders namely, dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's with its bioactive constituents i.e., carotenoids and apocarotenoids. Aim: The present study aimed to investigate the potential of standardized (Kashmir Saffron, India) Crocus sativus extract (CSE) in chronic scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment, amyloid beta (Al3) plaque, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) accumulation in rat brains by targeting AChE inhibition and scopolamine mechanistic effect. Methods: The experimental animals were divided into six groups: group 1: normal control, group 2: scopolamine, group 3,4 and 5 rivastigmine tartrate, CSE (p.o. 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg) respectively. Each treatment group received scopolamine after 20 min of dosing, till 4 weeks. The effects of different treatments on learning, acquisition, and reversal memory were performed using a Morris water maze test. In addition to behavioral assessments, biochemical parameters such as AChE, IL -6, and antioxidants were measured in isolated brains. Histological observations were also conducted to assess the presence of Al3 plaques and NFT. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed to explore the potential AChE inhibitory activity of the bioactive constituents of standardized CSE. Results: Scopolamine produces memory impairment, and its chronic administration forms Al3 plaque and NFT in rat brains. Supplementation with CSE in presence of scopolamine has shown remarkable effects on behavioural activity, special acquisition, and reversal memory. The CSE has also shown promising effects on AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity. The results of the docking study also indicate that trans-crocetin, i.e., a biologically active metabolite of Crocins, has strong AChE inhibitory activity, supported by an in vivo animal experiment. Conclusion: Supplementation with CSE significantly attenuates the formation of Al3 plaque and NFT in the hippocampus at a dose of 20 mg/kg per day. In addition, CSE also counters scopolamine-induced neuroinflammation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to alleviate negative impacts of elephant crop-raiding faced by smallholder farmers around the Okavango delta. Although many studies have identified the relationship between crop-raiding and climatic factors, little attention was paid to aligning cropping duration to high rainfall. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how crop maturity duration influences farmers' vulnerability to elephant crop raiding and food loss. An experimental plot consisting of early and late maturing varieties of maize, sorghum and cowpea was set up and monitored in farms adjacent to corridors. Early maturing varieties yielded more (mean = 0.35 tha(-1)) than later maturing varieties (mean = 0.25 tha(-1)). The prolonged stay of crops in fields exposed them more to elephants (p < 0.001). Unlike late varieties, early varieties served as an evasion strategy by allowing earlier harvesting when there was adequate rainfall and elephants rarely frequented farms. Late maturing varieties were harvested at 16-19 weeks when elephants frequented the fields. This harvest timing significantly influences the vulnerability of crops to debilitating elephant raiding. This outcome suggests that policy reviews should incorporate more climate action into smallholder farming systems to strengthen SDG 1: no poverty and SDG 2: zero hunger, ease hostility toward elephants and improve elephant conservation.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are one of the most common consequences of ethanol exposure during pregnancy. In adulthood, these disorders can be manifested by learning and memory deficits and depressive-like behavior. Ethanol-induced oxidative stress may be one of the factors that induces FASD development. The mammalian target of the Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway that acts via two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, can affect oxidative stress. We investigated whether mTOR-dependent or mTOR-independent mechanisms are engaged in this phenomenon. Thus, Rapamycin-a selective inhibitor of mTORC1, Torin-2-a non-selective mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, and FK-506-a drug that impacts oxidative stress in an mTOR-independent manner were used. Behavioral tests were performed in adult (PND60-65) rats using a passive avoidance (PA) task (aversive learning and memory) and forced swimming test (FST) (depressive-like behaviors). In addition, the biochemical parameters of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)-sites were determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in adult (PND65) rats. The rat FASD model was induced by intragastric ethanol (5 g/kg/day) administration at postnatal day (PND)4-9 (an equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy). All substances (3 mg/kg) were given 30 min before ethanol. Our results show that neonatal ethanol exposure leads to deficits in context-dependent fear learning and depressive-like behavior in adult rats that were associated with increased oxidative stress parameters in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Because these effects were completely reversed by Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, this outcome suggests its usefulness as a preventive therapy in disorders connected with prenatal ethanol exposure.

AB  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is one of the most severe type of cerebral strokes, which can cause multiple cellular changes in the brain leading to neuronal injury and neurological deficits. Specifically, SAH can impair adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, thus may affecting poststroke neurological and cognitive recovery. Here, we identified a non-canonical role of milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFGE8) in rat brain after experimental SAH, involving a stimulation on adult hippocampal neurogenesis(AHN). Experimental SAH was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats via endovascular perforation, with the in vivo effect of MFGE8 evaluated via the application of recombinant human MFGE8 (rhMFGE8) along with pharmacological interventions, as determined by hemorrhagic grading, neurobehavioral test, and histological and biochemical analyses of neurogenesis related markers. Results: Levels of the endogenous hippocampal MFGE8 protein, integrin-beta 3 and protein kinase B (p-Akt) were elevated in the SAH relative to control groups, while that of hippocalcin (HPCA) and cyclin D1 showed the opposite change. Intraventricular rhMGFE8 infusion reversed the decrease in doublecortin (DCX) immature neurons in the DG after SAH, along with improved the short/long term neurobehavioral scores. rhMGFE8 treatment elevated the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), CyclinD1, HPCA and DCX in hippocampal lysates, but not that of integrin beta 3 and Akt, at 24 hr after SAH. Treatment of integrin beta 3 siRNA, the PI3K selective inhibitor ly294002 or Akt selective inhibitor MK2206 abolished the effects of rhMGFE8 after SAH. In conclusion, MFGE8 is upregulated in the hippocampus in adult rats with reduced granule cell genesis. rhMFGE8 administration can rescue this impaired adult neurogenesis and improve neurobehavioral recovery. Mechanistically, the effect of MFGE8 on hippocampal adult neurogenesis is mediated by the activation of integrin beta 3/Akt pathway. These findings suggest that exogenous MFGE8 may be of potential therapeutic value in SAH management.Graphical abstract and proposed pathway of rhMFGE8 administration attenuate hippocampal injury by improving neurogenesis in SAH models. SAH caused hippocampal injury and neurogenesis interruption. Administered exogenous MFGE8, recombinant human MFGE8(rhMFGE8), could ameliorate hippocampal injury and improve neurological functions after SAH. Mechanistically, MFGE8 bind to the receptor integrin beta 3, which activated the PI3K/Akt pathway to increase the mTOR expression, and further promote the expression of cyclin D1, HPCA and DCX. rhMFGE8 could attenuated hippocampal injury by improving neurogenesis after SAH, however, know down integrin beta 3 or pharmacological inhibited PI3K/Akt by ly294002 or MK2206 reversed the neuro-protective effect of rhMFGE8.

AB  - In the brain, vesicular zinc, which refers to a subset of zinc that is sequestered into synaptic vesicles by zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3), has extensive effects on neuronal signalling and modulation. Vesicular zinc-focused research has mainly been directed to its role in the hippocampus, particularly in adult neurogenesis. However, whether vesicular zinc is involved in modulating neurogenesis during the early postnatal period has been less studied. As a first step to understanding this, we used ZnT3 knockout (KO) mice, which lack ZnT3 and, thus, vesicular zinc, to evaluate cell proliferation at three different age points spanning postnatal development (P6, P14, and P28). The survival and the neuronal phenotype of these cells was also assessed in adulthood. We found that male ZnT3 KO mice exhibited lower rates of cell proliferation at P14, but a greater number of these cells survived to adulthood. Additionally, significantly more cells labelled on P6 survived to adulthood in male and female ZnT3 KO mice. We also found sex-dependent differences, whereby male mice showed higher levels of cell proliferation at P28, as well as higher levels of cell survival for P14-labelled cells, compared to female mice. However, female mice showed greater percentages of neuronal differentiation for P14-labelled cells. Finally, we found significant effects of age of BrdU injections on cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our results suggest that the loss of vesicular zinc affects normal proliferation and survival of cells born at different age points during postnatal development and highlight prominent sex- and age-dependent differences. Our findings provide the foundation for future studies to further probe the role of vesicular zinc in the modulation of developmental neurogenesis.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dementias including Alzheimer disease (AD) are three times higher in meno-pausal women than in men. Phytoestrogens, a group of plant-derived compounds are known to alleviate menopausal complaints including dementia. Millettia griffoniana Baill is a phytoestrogen-rich plant used to treat menopausal complaints and dementia. Aim: Evaluating the estrogenic and neuroprotective potential of Millettia griffoniana on ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Materials and methods: The in vitro safety of M. griffoniana ethanolic extract was assayed by MTT in human mammary epithelial (HMEC) and mouse neuronal (HT-22) cells and its lethal dose 50 (LD50) was estimated following OECD 423 guidelines. For estrogenicity, in vitro the well known E-screen assay on MCF-7 cells was performed and in vivo four groups of OVX rats were treated either with 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg M. griffoniana extract doses or estradiol (1 mg/kg BW) for three days; and changes in uterine and vagina were analyzed. Then, for neuroprotective effect, Alzheimer-type dementia induction was achieved by scopolamine (1.5 mg/kg B.W., i. p.) injection four days/week and M. griffoniana extract as well as piracetam (standard) were administered daily for 2 weeks to evaluate the extract's neuroprotective potential. The endpoints were the assessment of learning and working memory, oxidative stress state (SOD, CAT, and MDA) in brain, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) ac-tivity and the histopathological changes in hippocampus. Results: No toxic effect was observed when incubating mammary (HMEC) and neuronal (HT-22) cells with M. griffoniana ethanol extract for 24 h and its LD50 was found >2000 mg/kg. The extract also exhibited both in vitro and in vivo estrogenic activities, displayed by a significant (p < 0.01) increment in MCF-7 cells population in vitro and an increase in the epithelium height of the vagina and the wet weight of the uterus mainly with the 150 mg/kg BW extract dose compared to untreated OVX rats. The extract also reversed scopolamine-induced memory impairment in rat by improving learning, working and reference memory. This was associated with an increment in CAT and SOD expression, alongside a decrement in MDA content and AChE activity in hippocampus. Further, the extract reduced neuronal cell loss in hippocampal structures (CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus). High Perfor-mance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) spectra, revealed the presence of numerous phytoestrogens in M. griffoniana extract. Conclusion: M. griffoniana ethanolic extract has estrogenic, anticholinesterase and antioxidant activities that could account for its anti-amnesic effects. These findings therefore sheds light on why this plant is commonly used in the therapy of menopausal complaints and dementia.

AB  - Dysphagia is a common complication of stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The construction of animal models of dysphagia is an important way to explore its pathogenesis and treatment. At present, the animal models of dysphagia mainly include rodents, nonhuman primates, and other mammals, such as pigs and dogs. This review systematically summarizes the establishment and evaluation of dysphagia animal models in stroke, PD, and ALS in three kinds of experimental animals, providing a basis for the selection of appropriate animal models of dysphagia.

AB  - Background: Over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is involved in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Silibinin, a natural flavonoid gained from the seeds of Silybum marianum, exerts neuroprotective effects on sporadic AD models, but its impacts on NMDARs remain unknown.
   Purpose: To study silibinin's regulatory effects on NMDARs pathway in sporadic AD models.
   Methods: MTT assay, western blotting, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and siRNA transfection etc. were used for cellular and molecular studies. The direct interactions between silibinin and NMDAR subunits were evaluated by computational molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Y maze test, novel objects recognition test and Morris water maze test were conducted to examine the learning and memory ability of rats.
   Results: An in vitro AD model was established by treating HT22 murine hippocampal neurons with streptozotocin (STZ), as evidenced by the amyloid beta (A beta) deposition and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Silibinin shows protection of neurons against STZ-induced cell damage. It is noteworthy that STZ-induced cellular calcium influx is inhibited by silibinin-treatment, indicating the possible modulation of calcium channels. Studies on NMDARs, the most widely distributed calcium channel, by using molecular docking, DARTS and CESTA, reveal that the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, is the potential target of silibinin. Further studies using the pharmacological agonist (NMDA) and the GluN2B-specific inhibitor (Ifenprodil) or siRNA, indicate that the protection by silibinin treatment from STZ-induced cytotoxicity is medicated through interference with GluN2B-containing NMDARs, followed by the upregulation of CaMKII alpha/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and improved levels of synaptic proteins (SYP and PSD-95). The results in vivo using rats intracerebroventricularly injected with STZ (ICV-STZ), a well-established sporadic AD model, confirm that silibinin improves learning and memory ability in association with modulation of the GluN2B/CaMKII alpha/ BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: Inhibiting over-activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs is involved in the neuroprotective effect of silibinin on STZ-induced sporadic AD models.

AB  - Brain signalling pathways involved in subclinical anxiety and depressed mood can be modulated via the gut brain axis (GBA), providing the potential for diet and dietary components to affect mood. We investigated behavioural, physiological and gut microbiome responses to the Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strain HN001 (LactoB HN001 (TM)), which has been shown to reduce postpartum anxiety and depression, and a milk fat globule membrane-enriched product, Lipid 70 (Surestart (TM) MFGM Lipid 70), which has been implicated in memory in stress-susceptible Wistar Kyoto rats. We examined behaviour in the open field, elevated plus maze and novel object recognition tests in conjunction with the expression of host genes in neuro-signalling pathways, and we also assessed brain lipidomics. Treatment-induced alterations in the caecal microbiome and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles were also assessed. Neither ingredient induced behavioural changes or altered the brain lipidome (separately or when combined). However, with regard to brain gene expression, the L. rhamnosus HN001 + Lipid 70 combination produced a synergistic effect, reducing GABAA subunit expression in the amygdala (Gabre, Gat3, Gabrg1) and hippocampus (Gabrd). Treatment with L. rhamnosus HN001 alone altered expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (Grm4) in the amygdala but produced only minor changes in gut microbiota composition. In contrast, Lipid 70 alone did not alter brain gene expression but produced a significant shift in the gut microbiota profile. Under the conditions used, there was no observed effect on rat behaviour for the ingredient combination. However, the enhancement of brain gene expression by L. rhamnosus HN001 + Lipid 70 implicates synergistic actions on region-specific neural pathways associated with fear, anxiety, depression and memory. A significant shift in the gut microbiota profile also occurred that was mainly attributable to Lipid 70.

AB  - Whether a Roman diet existed is a constant issue in Classical archaeology, as it is also its persistence in late Antiquity. Here, we review the isotopic composition (delta C-13(col) and delta N-15(col) ) of 15 (n = 384) necropolis dating to the 1st to 8th centuries AD from Hispania. We worked with human and animal raw data and calculated the human enrichment regarding herbivores average. Although diet was not homogeneous, intra-site variability was greater than inter-site variability. The results show a diet characterised by consumption of C-3 plants with some intake of meat/eggs/dairy products from terrestrial herbivores fed on C-3 plants, with no clear differences between periods. NW Hispanic sites show an exceptional consumption of C-4 plants (millet) and marine resources. There is a slight correlation between delta N-15 and distance from the sea, but marine resource consumption seems to have been mostly absent or low. Most sites studied were rural or located at the coast and this may result in some bias in the interpretation. Therefore, more effort in analysing inland urban sites is needed. The comparison with sites from France, Britain and Italy indicates a slightly higher dependence on millets in Hispania, which can be traced back to the Iron Age. The data suggest the existence of a certain homogeneity in diet that persisted in later centuries while displaying specificities and local adaptations.

AB  - Simple Summary During annual periods of heightened sexual activity (musth), male African elephants expend a significant amount of energy communicating their reproductive status, as well as searching and competing for potential mates. To locate females, musth males may risk venturing outside protected areas and into landscapes shared with humans where conflict between wildlife and people can occur. Adverse interactions between elephants and people can be detrimental to human livelihoods, resulting in negative attitudes towards elephants and, in some cases, retaliatory killings. Interactions with aggressive musth males can also be life-threatening to community members who attempt to confront them. Mitigation strategies that effectively target the reproductive motivations of musth males may offer solutions as the human-elephant interface continues to expand. In this study, we build on earlier research showing that playbacks of female elephant reproductive calls, (i.e., estrous rumbles) can change the movement trajectory and behavior of male elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. Individuals belonging to three male groups were opportunistically subjected to playback experiments and evaluated based on their reaction intensity. Our results demonstrate that mature musth adults are more likely to change directions and approach the source of a female's estrous call than mature, sexually-inactive adult elephants. We also show that post-dispersal young males that were not in musth also respond strongly to the stimulus. These findings support further exploration of mitigation solutions that incorporate elephant behavior, reproductive status, and context-specific vocalizations. Driven by reproductive motives, male African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in musth often expand their home ranges to locate estrous females. This extended range, coupled with heightened aggression often observed in musth males, can be particularly problematic in regions where human-modified landscapes and elephant territories increasingly overlap. Several mitigation tools have been tested to resolve a wide range of human-elephant conflicts with varying degrees of success due to geographical disparities and habituation. We present findings on the potential application of estrous call playbacks in manipulating the behavior and movement of male elephants non-invasively, particularly mature musth adults and younger post-dispersal males, in Etosha National Park. Estrous vocalizations were presented across 26 experimental trials to mature musth adults (n = 5), mature non-musth adults (n = 6), and non-musth males belonging to younger, post-dispersal age classes (n = 8), with behavioral responses scored on a gradient scale from 0-1. Both mature musth adults and younger non-musth elephants were significantly more likely to respond with the highest intensity by approaching the acoustic source compared to mature non-musth adults that avoided the call. However, younger males tested in the presence of an older, higher-ranking male tended to react with a lower intensity than those tested alone. This result likely demonstrates the influence of social hierarchy and associations on male elephant behavior. We also observed a significant increase in physiological response, measured by defecation rate, across all male groups in response to the estrous call playbacks.
   Our findings suggest that using estrous calls as acoustic deterrents may effectively and non-invasively aid in reducing tension at the human-elephant interface, depending on the age, social context, and reproductive status of the male elephant.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury as found in stroke is a complex and heterogeneous disorder and closely related to disability and death. Today, nutraceuticals and protective therapy to increase neuronal integrity and prevent pathological complication are common. We investigated the neuroprotective effect of betanin against cerebral IR injury in mice. Forty male institute of cancer research (ICR) mice were divided into Sham-veh, IR-veh, IR-Bet50 and IR-Bet100 groups. After 2 weeks of oral administration of normal saline (vehicle; veh) or 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of betanin (Bet), mice were subjected to IR induction using 30-min bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Brain infarction, oxidative status, cortical and hippocampal neurons and white matter pathologies were evaluated. Results showed that IR significantly increases brain infarction, Cornus Ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampal and corpus callosum (CC) and internal capsule (IC) white matter degeneration (P<0.05). Brain oxidative status revealed significant elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) together with a significant decrease in catalase (CAT) activity, induced by IR (P<0.05). Pretreatment with betanin 100 mg/kg led to a significant reduction in brain infarction and MDA, CA1 hippocampus, CC and IC white matter degeneration. Betanin also led to a significant increase in CAT activity (P<0.05), with enhancing effect on reduced glutathione levels (GSH, P<0.05). The present study revealed the neuroprotective efficacy of betanin against IR injury in mice's brains, including its inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and boosting of GSH and CAT activity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Notopterygium incisum Ting ex H. T. Chang, also called 'Qianghuo', is a distinct umbelliferae plant in China. The rhizomes and roots of Notopterygium incisum have long been used to treat headaches, colds, analgesia and rheumatoid arthritis. It is a main traditional Chinese medicine in Qianghuo Yufeng Decoction, which was used to treat diseases such as liver and kidney insufficiency, mental paralysis and dementia. Aim of this study: As the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a complicated pathogenesis. So far, there is no effective drug to prevent its pathological process. Previous research has shown that Notopterygium incisum root extract (NRE) may inhibit the release of A/1 and the activation of tau in mice with AD. However, the effect of NRE on the pathological process of neuroinflammation is still unclear. Materials and methods: We determined the pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in BV2 cells exposed to LPS/A/142 after treated with NRE. APP/PS1 and LPS-induced C57BL/6 neuroinflammatory mice were given NRE for 8 weeks and 5 days respectively to detect the pathological changes of neuroinflammation. Results: The findings showed that NRE had a notable inhibitory effect on the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1/1 in BV2 cells induced by LPS/A/142. The results of in vivo experiments show that following NRE treatment, there was a notable decrease in the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice as indicated by immunofluorescence results. Sholl analysis showed that microglia branches increased in NRE group, indicating that M1 microglia activation was inhibited. In the mice model injected with LPS in the tail vein, PCR and Western Blot results confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of NRE, Nissl staining showed the protective effect of NRE on neurons, and immunofluorescence results also indicated that the activation of M1 microglia was inhibited. Conclusion: These results suggest that long term oral administration of NRE may inhibit neuroinflammation in the progression of AD.

AB  - At present, there exist many methods for liquefaction analysis of a soil deposit. Some of them are suitable for only coarse grained soils, while a few others can also evaluate the liquefaction potential of both fine-and coarse-grained soils. It is important to identify the most suitable method for liquefaction analysis. The current study looks at measuring soil's liquefaction potential using various methods such as Seed (ASCE J Soil Mech Found Div 97:1249-1273, 1971), Toprak et al. (CPT-and SPT-based probabilistic assessment of liquefaction potential. In: 7th US-Japan Workshop on Earthquake Resistant Design of Lifeline Facilities and Countermeasures against Liquefaction, Seattle. Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research Buffalo, NY, p 18,1999), and Idriss and Boulanger (Soil Dyn Earthq Eng 26:115-130, 2006). The main objective of this study is to identify the most suitable method for liquefaction analysis based on factor of safety and Performance Fitness Error Metrics (PFEMs), Rank analysis, Gini index, etc. The contribution of various independent variables, such as corrected SPT N values, fine content, maximum horizontal ground acceleration, total vertical stress, total effective stress, magnitude moment, and depth below ground level towards the evaluated liquefaction potential and probability of liquefaction has been assessed through the use of Gini Index (GI). The computed probability of liquefaction (PL) values are compared with the given liquefaction status of case history data using Performance Fitness Error Metrices. Performance Fitness Error Metrics for the Idriss and Boulanger (2006) method are found to be higher than those for Toprak et al. (1999) and Seed and Idriss (ASCE J Soil Mech Found Div 97:1249-1273) methods. Based on these PFEMs, it is found that the Idriss and Boulanger (2006) methods of liquefaction analysis at any site are more accurate than the other two methods. It is observed that Idriss and Boulanger (2006) method gives the highest rate of successful prediction percentage of correctly predicted liquefied and non-liquefied cases.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cornus officinalis Sieb. et Zucc has significant neuroprotective activity and has been widely studied for its potential to improve cognitive function. Our team's previous research has found that loganin isolated from Cornus officinalis has an antidepressant effect. Depression is a mental disorder accompanied by dysfunction of Connexin43 (Cx43)-formed astrocytic gap junctions. However, the precise mechanisms of loganin involved remain uncertain. Aim of the study: We aimed to examine the mechanism by which loganin produces its antidepressant properties. Materials and methods: Using a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression in rats, the study evaluated the behavioral responses to treatment with loganin, fluoxetine, and their combination. Biochemical analyses were conducted to measure the expression and phosphorylation status of Cx43, (3-catenin, GSK-3(3 in the brain. In vitro experiments were also performed how loganin protects the gap junctions in astrocytes that have been exposed to corticosterone. Results: After four weeks of loganin treatment, rats exposed to CUS showed a decrease in depressive-like behaviors. When combined with fluoxetine, the antidepressant-like effects were observed faster than with either treatment alone. Loganin significantly increased Cx43 expression in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippo- campus, reversed Cx43 mimetic peptide Gap26-induced depressive-like behaviors, decreased Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368, increased (3-catenin levels, and promoted GSK-3(3 phosphorylation at Ser9. In vitro, loganin prevented corticosterone-induced damage to gap junctions between astrocytes, an effect that was negated by XAV-939 ((3-catenin inhibitor). Conclusion: These results implied that loganin could exert antidepressant-like effects by improving the gap junctions of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, acting through the GSK-3(3/(3-catenin signaling pathway.

AB  - Tendinopathies are at the frontier of advanced responses to health challenges and sectoral policy targets. Cell-based therapy holds great promise for tendon disorder resolution. To verify the role of stepwise trans-differentiation of amniotic epithelial stem cells (AECs) in tendon regeneration, in the present research three different AEC subsets displaying an epithelial (eAECs), mesenchymal (mAECs), and tendon-like (tdAECs) phenotype were allotransplanted in a validated experimental sheep Achilles tendon injury model. Tissue healing was analyzed adopting a comparative approach at two early healing endpoints (14 and 28 days). All three subsets of transplanted cells were able to accelerate regeneration: mAECs with a lesser extent than eAECs and tdAECs as indicated in the summary of the total histological scores (TSH), where at day 28 eAECs and tdAECs had better significant scores with respect to mAEC-treated tendons (p < 0.0001). In addition, the immunomodulatory response at day 14 showed in eAEC-transplanted tendons an upregulation of pro-regenerative M2 macrophages with respect to mAECs and tdAECs (p < 0.0001). In addition, in all allotransplanted tendons there was a favorable IL10/IL12 compared to CTR (p < 0.001). The eAECs and tdAECs displayed two different underlying regenerative mechanisms in the tendon. The eAECs positively influenced regeneration mainly through their greater ability to convey in the host tissue the shift from pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative responses, leading to an ordered extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and blood vessel remodeling. On the other hand, the transplantation of tdAECs acted mainly on the proliferative phase by impacting the density of ECM and by supporting a prompt recovery, inducing a low cellularity and angle alignment of the host cell compartment. These results support the idea that AECs lay the groundwork for production of different cell phenotypes that can orient tendon regeneration through a crosstalk with the host tissue. In particular, the obtained evidence suggests that eAECs are a practicable and efficient strategy for the treatment of acute tendinopathies, thus reinforcing the grounds to move their use towards clinical practice.

AB  - Camelids have the peculiarity of having classical antibodies composed of heavy and light chains as well as single-chain antibodies. They have lost their light chains and one heavy-chain domain. This evolutionary feature means that their terminal heavy-chain domain, VH, called VHH here, has no partner and forms an independent domain. The VHH is small and easy to express alone; it retains thermodynamic and interaction properties. Consequently, V(H)Hs have garnered significant interest from both biotechnological and pharmaceutical perspectives. However, due to their origin in camelids, they cannot be used directly on humans. A humanization step is needed before a possible use. However, changes, even in the constant parts of the antibodies, can lead to a loss of quality. A dedicated tool, Llamanade, has recently been made available to the scientific community. In a previous paper, we already showed the different types of VHH dynamics. Here, we have selected a representative VHH and tested two humanization hypotheses to accurately assess the potential impact of these changes. This example shows that despite the non-negligible change (1/10th of residues) brought about by humanization, the effect is not drastic, and the humanized VHH retains conformational properties quite similar to those of the camelid VHH.

AB  - Background: Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disorders, and its pathological mechanisms are closely related to disturbed energy metabolism and lipid remodeling. Exploring the spatial heterogeneity of metabolomics is essential to analyze the pathological process of HIE. Methods: In this study, we established a neonatal mouse hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) model by the modified Rice method, and analyzed various metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, purine metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the ischemic edema area, with contralateral and control brain tissues using matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) with a spatial resolution of 50 mu m. Results: In the HIBD model, key metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (citrate, succinate, L-glutamate, glucose, aspartate, and glutamine) were significantly enriched in the edematous area compared with the control (fold change: 1.52-2.82), which suggests a blockage of mitochondrial function; ATP/ADP/AMP levels were reduced by 53-73% in the edematous area, and xanthine was abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus of the affected side, suggesting energy depletion and altered purine metabolism; lipid remodeling showed regional specificity: some unsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, were abnormally accumulated in the hippocampus. In contrast, pentadecanoic acid levels were reduced across the entire brain in the HIBD model, with a more pronounced decrease in the ipsilateral hippocampus, suggesting impaired membrane stability. Conclusions: The neonatal mouse HIBD model exhibits reprogramming of energy metabolism, characterized by a blockage in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ATP depletion, along with an abnormal spatial distribution of lipids. By targeting xanthine metabolic pathways, restoring mitochondrial function, and intervening in region-specific lipid remodeling, brain energy homeostasis may be improved and neurological damage attenuated. Further studies should validate the clinical feasibility of xanthine and lipid imbalance as diagnostic markers of HIBD and explore the critical time window for metabolic intervention to optimize therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety disorders are prevalent psychiatric conditions, and currently utilized chemical drugs typically come with significant adverse effects. China boasts a wealth of medicinal and food herbs known for their safe and effective properties. Purpose: This study aimed to develop novel formulations with improved antidepressant and anxiolytic effects derived from medicinal and food herbs. Study design: Screening combinations with antidepressant and anxiolytic effects using techniques such as network pharmacology and validating their effects in vitro and in vivo experiments. Methods: Utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking, we identified the top ten medicinal herbs with anxiolytic and antidepressant potential. Herbs with cytoprotective effects and non-toxic characteristics were further screened to formulate the herbal blends. Subsequently, we established a PC12 cell injury model and a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in mice to assess the effects of our formulations. Results: Ten medicinal herbs were initially screened, and six of them were deemed suitable for formulating the blend, namely Gancao, Dazao, Gouqizi, Sangye, Huangqi, and Jinyinhua (GDGSHJ). The GDGSHJ formulation reduced Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, decreased apoptosis, and demonstrated a favorable antidepressant and antianxiety effect in the CUMS mouse model. Besides, GDGSHJ led to the upregulation of serum 5Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) content and brain tissue 5-HT, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and Dopamine (DA) levels. It also downregulated the expression of SLC6A4 and SLC6A3 genes in the mouse hippocampus while upregulating HTR1A, DRD1, DRD2, and GABRA1 genes. Conclusion: Our formulation exhibited robust antidepressant and antianxiety effects without inducing substantial toxicity. This efficacy appears to be mediated by the expression of relevant genes within the hippocampus of mice. The formulation achieved this effect by balancing 5-HT levels in the serum and DA, GABA, and 5-HT levels within brain tissue.

AB  - Variants of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) alter metabolism in cancer cells by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to (2R)-hy-droxyglutarate. However, it is unclear how derivatives of 2OG can affect cancer cell metabolism. Here, we used synthetic C3-and C4-alkylated 2OG derivatives to investigate the sub-strate selectivities of the most common cancer-associated IDH1 variant (R132H IDH1), of two cancer-associated IDH2 variants (R172K IDH2, R140Q IDH2), and of WT IDH1/2. Absorbance -based, NMR, and electrochemical assays were employed to monitor WT IDH1/2 and IDH1/2 variant-catalyzed 2OG de-rivative turnover in the presence and absence of 2OG. Our results reveal that 2OG derivatives can serve as substrates of the investigated IDH1/2 variants, but not of WT IDH1/2, and have the potential to act as 2OG-competitive inhibitors. Kinetic parameters reveal that some 2OG derivatives, including the natural product 3-methyl-2OG, are equally or even more efficient IDH1/2 variant substrates than 2OG. Furthermore, NMR and mass spectrometry studies confirmed IDH1/2 variant-catalyzed production of alcohols in the cases of the 3-methyl-, 3-butyl-, and 3-benzyl-substituted 2OG de-rivatives; a crystal structure of 3-butyl-2OG with an IDH1 variant (R132C/S280F IDH1) reveals active site binding. The combined results highlight the potential for (i) IDH1/2 variant -catalyzed reduction of 2-oxoacids other than 2OG in cells, (ii) modulation of IDH1/2 variant activity by 2-oxoacid natural products, including some present in common foods, (iii) inhi-bition of IDH1/2 variants via active site binding rather than the established allosteric mode of inhibition, and (iv) possible use of IDH1/2 variants as biocatalysts.

AB  - Objective: To develop, train and test neural networks for predicting heart surface potentials (HSPs) from body surface potentials (BSPs). The method re-frames traditional inverse problems of electrocardiography into regression problems, constraining the solution space by decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian impulse basis functions. Methods: Impulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete heart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume conductor torso model. Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to regular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive capabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental data. Results: A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to map body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for reconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were predicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of 9.1 +/- 1.4%. Predicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to displacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and predictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4% increase in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse function data could be reduced, and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded HSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time Gaussian basis functions. Activation times calculated from predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean absolute error of 10.4 +/- 11.4 ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with similar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are potentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data models for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. Significance: The HSPs predicted by the neural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively identify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent treatment options.

AB  - Decreased synaptic spine density has been the most consistently reported postmortem finding in schizophrenia (SCZ). A recently developed in vivo measure of synaptic vesicle density estimated using the novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [C-11]UCB-J is a proxy measure of synaptic density. In this study we determined whether [C-11]UCB-J binding, an in vivo measure of synaptic vesicle density, is altered in SCZ. SCZ patients (n = 13, 3 F) and age-, gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n = 15, 3 F) underwent PET imaging using [C-11]UCB-J and high-resolution research tomography (HRRT). [C-11]UCB-J distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND) were estimated using a 1T model with centrum-semiovale as the reference region. Relative to HCs, SCZ patients, showed significantly lower [C-11]UCB-J BPND with significant differences in the frontal cortex (-10%, Cohen's d = 1.01), anterior cingulate (-11%, Cohen's d = 1.24), hippocampus (-15%, Cohen's d = 1.29), occipital cortex (-14%, Cohen's d = 1.34), parietal cortex (-10%, p = 0.03, Cohen's d = 0.85) and temporal cortex (-11%, Cohen's d = 1.23). These differences remained significant after partial volume correction. [C-11]UCB-J BPND did not correlate with cumulative antipsychotic exposure or gray-matter volume. Consistent with the postmortem and in vivo findings, synaptic vesicle density is lower across several brain regions in SCZ. Frontal synaptic vesicle density correlated with psychosis symptom severity and cognitive performance on social cognition and processing speed. These findings indicate that [C-11]UCB-J PET is a sensitive tool to detect lower synaptic density in SCZ and holds promise for future studies of early detection and disease progression.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis is dysregulated in neurological disorders, including depression. Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are close to the vasculature and the cerebrospinal fluid, placing them in an ideal position to receive extrinsic signals and transmit these cues to the neurogenic niche. Herein, we aimed to explore how different systemic cues influence the regenerative properties of NSC secretome on recipient differentiating cells and microglia, key neurogenic components. To mimic signals that NSCs may sense in pathological conditions, we used the secretome of oxidative damaged cells (acute oxidative damage), and the serum from depressed mice (depression-associated chronic signals). Alternatively, NSCs were conditioned with different mitochondrial metabolic regulators to mimic a pro-metabolic NSC environment. Results showed that both injury and metabolic stimuli triggered the increase of NSC proliferation and mitochondrial fragmentation, along with the delivery of a neuroprotective secretome toward injured recipient cells. However, premature differentiation was only observed in NSCs sensing depression-associated chronic signals. The secretome from metabolic-stimulated NSCs favored neurogenesis of target cells, being enriched in regenerative metabolites. Depression-associated signals promoted a NSC secretome with reduced regenerative metabolites and microRNAs that repressed microglial phagocytosis and differentiation in target NSCs. At last, the reduction of oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins in the neurogenic niche of depressed mice was rescued by physical exercise. Our data indicate a central role of external metabolic and injury signals in regulating the neurogenic niche through NSC paracrine activity, unveiling distinct NSC regenerative responses upon transient acute and chronic injuries, and new cues for physical exercise-induced alleviation of depression.

AB  - Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and account for nearly 30% of all nervous system tumors. Approximately half of meningioma patients exhibit neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene inactivation. Here, NF2 was shown to interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1) in IOMM-Lee, a high-grade malignant meningioma cell line, and the F1 subdomain of NF2 plays a critical role in this interaction. Functional assays indicated that NF2 promotes the phosphorylation of IP3R (Ser 1756) and IP3R-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release by binding to IP3R1, which results in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Knockout of NF2 decreased Ca2+ release and promoted resistance to apoptosis, which was rescued by wild-type NF2 overexpression but not by F1 subdomain deletion truncation overexpression. The effects of NF2 defects on the development of tumors were further studied in mouse models. The decreased expression level of NF2 caused by NF2 gene knockout or mutation affects the activity of the IP3R channel, which reduces Ca2+-dependent apoptosis, thereby promoting the development of tumors. We elucidated the interaction patterns of NF2 and IP3R1, revealed the molecular mechanism through which NF2 regulates IP3R1-mediated Ca2+ release, and elucidated the new pathogenic mechanism of meningioma-related NF2 variants. Our study broadens the current understanding of the biological function of NF2 and provides ideas for drug screening of NF2-associated meningioma.

AB  - The top concrete in the negative bending moment zone of steel-concrete composite continuous beams is particularly vulnerable to cracking at elevated temperatures. To improve the fire resistance of these beams, a rubber-ring Perfobond leiste (RPBL) with perforated steel plates is utilized to connect the top concrete slab to the bottom steel beam in this critical area. This study designed two composite beams for a comparative analysis of fire resistance: one steel-concrete composite beam CCB-RPBL and the control beam CCB-SD. Both types of beams underwent fire resistance tests, subjected to ISO 834 fire curves. The results revealed that, at the critical state, the two steel beams at mid-support buckled in different sequences, with critical temperatures recorded at 702 degrees C for the control beam and 747 degrees C for the RPBL-connected composite beam, indicating that the critical temperature for composite beams with RPBL is 6.4 % higher than that of conventional beams. Furthermore, during the failure stage, composite beams with RPBL connectors demonstrated a reduced rate of deflection development and exhibited smaller deflections at the critical state. The CCB-RPBL connector in the hogging moment region further diminishes the shear connection between the concrete slab and the bottom steel beam, resulting in lower bending moments on the concrete slab and enhanced bending performance of the composite beam. Additionally, the CCBRPBL connector reduces plastic strain from 0.0965 for the conventional beam to 0.0712 for the beam CCB-RPBL at the surface of the concrete slab at mid-support, improves the slab's crack resistance, and elevates the critical temperature of the composite beam. The PEMAG maximum value for the concrete slab in the negative bending moment zone of CCB-RPBL is 0.0712, which is significantly lower compared to 0.0965 for CCB-SD. Overall, the RPBL connector significantly mitigates the shear lag effect in steel-concrete composite beams at mid-support, thereby enhancing the bending stiffness of the composite beam in the negative moment region.

AB  - T-2 toxin (T-2) with a molecular weight of 466.52 g/mol is an inevitable mycotoxin in food products and feeds, posing a significant threat to human and animal health. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of T-2 exposure on porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) remain unclear. Here, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of T-2 exposure on IPEC-J2 through the detection of cell viability, cell morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, apoptosis and autophagy. Further transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of IPEC-J2 upon T-2 exposure were performed by using RNA-seq and TMT techniques. A total of 546 differential expressed genes (DEGs) and 269 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected. Among these, 24 common DEGs/DEPs were involved in IPEC-J2 upon T-2 exposure. Interestingly, molecular docking analysis revealed potential interactions between T-2 and three key enzymes (PHGDP, PSAT1, and PSPH) in the serine biosynthesis pathway. Besides, further experimental showed that PSAT1 knockdown exacerbated T2-induced oxidative damage. Together, our findings indicated that the serine biosynthesis pathway including PHGDP, PSAT1, PSPH genes probably acts critical roles in the regulation of T-2-induced cell damage. This study provided new insights into the global molecular effects of T-2 exposure and identified the serine biosynthesis pathway as molecular targets and potential treatment strategies against T-2.

AB  - Saltlicks are fundamental resources for wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). This study aimed to assess the nutrients found in natural saltlicks (NSs) and artificial saltlicks (ASs), as well as general soils (GS) in the natural forest of Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS) and a restoration area of Kui Buri National Park (KNP), a which is a forest in Western Thailand. We monitored 33 NSs, 35 ASs, and 20 GSs used by wild Asian elephants. In both areas, the K, Mg, Fe, and Cu in NSs were significantly higher than in ASs. The Ca and Zn in NSs of KNP were lower than the ASs of SWS. The salinity of ASs was the highest, making it significantly higher than that of the NSs in both areas. The ASs can supplement Na, thereby increasing salinity in both areas. The Ca, K, Mg, Fe, and Cu in NSs were significantly higher than in ASs, making them a primary target for elephants. These findings have consequences for conserving elephants and other large herbivores by supplementing essential macro- and micro-nutrients in ASs.

AB  - Trichinella britovi is a widely distributed parasitic nematode, transmitted through ingestion of raw or poorly cooked meat containing muscle larvae. This helminth can regulate the host immune system during the early phase of infection. The immune mechanism mainly involves the interaction of Th1 and Th2 responses and related cytokines. Chemokines (C-X-C or C-C) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have also shown to be implicated in a number of parasitic infections, mainly malaria, neurocysticercosis, angiostronyloidosis, and schistosomiasis, but poor is known about their role in human Trichinella infection. We previously found that serum MMP-9 levels were significantly increased in T. britovi infected patients with relevant symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, and facial oedema, which makes these enzymes a potential reliable indicator of inflammation in trichinellosis pa-tients. These changes were also observed in T. spiralis/T. pseudospiralis experimentally infected mice.No data are available about circulating levels of two pro-inflammatory chemokines, CXCL10 and CCL2, in trichinellosis patients with or w/o clinical signs of the infection. In this study, the association of serum level of CXCL10 and CCL2 with clinical outcome of T. britovi infection and their relation to MMP-9 were investigated. Patients (median age 49 +/- 0.33 years) acquired infection by consuming raw sausages prepared with wild boar and pork meat. Sera were collected during the acute and the convalescent phases of the infection. A positive significant association (r = 0.61, p = 0.0004) was observed between MMP-9 and CXCL10 levels. The CXCL10 level significantly correlated with the severity of symptoms in patients being particularly higher in patients suffering diarrhea, myalgia, and facial oedema, thus suggesting a positive association of this chemokine with symptomatologic traits, especially myalgia (and increased LDH and CPK levels) (p < 0.005). No correlation was found between levels of CCL2 and the clinical symptoms.

AB  - Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult-born neurons would prevent epilepsy. Adult-born neurons were selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene Bax from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete Bax in Nestin-CreER(T2)Bax(fl/fl) mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult-born neurons exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were more affected by Bax deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in Bax. The female mice with enhanced adult-born neurons also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild-type females or males, which is notable because loss of these two hilar cell types is implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective Bax deletion to increase adult-born neurons can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.

AB  - This research aimed to elaborate a gelatin-Kappa carrageenan-based packaging with 0.22 %, 0.44 %, and 0.88 % w/v of Mekwiya date palm seeds extract (DSEMK). This extract improved the mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of the films. Moisture content, water solubility, and water vapor permeability were reduced from 17.54 +/- 0.02 to 12.18 +/- 0.02, from 77.61 +/- 0.02 to 25.35 +/- 0.29 %, and from 5.28 +/- 0.29 to 1.69 +/- 0.03 g s(-1) m(-1) Pa-1 x 10(-10), respectively. During thermal degradation, DSEMK4 film had a residual weight of 27.99 %, compared to 20.67 % for the control. Despite a decline in the film's tensile strength from 24.19 to 8.94 MPa with the incorporation of DSEMK, elongation at the breaking point increased from 37.66 +/- 0.16 to 46.17 +/- 0.25 %. The film containing DSEMK4 displayed the highest phenolic contents and illustrated the best antioxidant effects in DPPH and FRAP assays, with IC50s of 756 and 1445 mu g/mL, respectively and inhibited pathogen growth on the meat surface. Over storage at 4 degrees C, monitoring of pH, lipid and protein oxidation parameters, microbial spoilage, optical properties, and sensory attributes disclosed that the DSEMK-films successfully enhanced the meat quality and safety. These findings were supported by principal component analysis and heat maps.

AB  - Cell (somatic) polyploidy is a general biological phenomenon characteristic of unicellular and multicellular animals and plants. In mammals, polyploid cells occur in all tissues; in some cases they are few in number, while in other cases they may be the most numerous cells in an organ. The mechanism of polyploidization is a usual, but incomplete, mitosis. The cause of incompletion of the mitosis is competition between proliferation and differentiation. At the genome level, the cause is associated with metabolic disorders of cyclin-dependent kinases, some other mitotic kinases (AURORA), transcription factors Ect2, E2F, some regulatory proteins (p53, laminin, septin), and components of the Hippo signalling pathway. The timing of polyploidization is restricted to early postnatal ontogenesis and, as experiments with heart transplants have shown, is part of the developmental programme. A typical way of genome multiplication is the change from binucleate to polyploid mononucleate cells from cycle to cycle. Polyploidization of cells is irreversible. It is a normal mechanism of organ growth and, for some cells, a way of differentiation. Using cardiac muscle and liver as examples, it has been shown that the composition and number of polyploid cells depend on the life conditions in the early postnatal period. After leaving the mitotic cycle, the cells continue to grow; postmitotic hypertrophy is one of the main ways of the growth of the cardiac muscle in ontogenesis and the only way of its regeneration. A certain growth reserve of the cardiac muscle in case of damage (heart attack, etc.) has been revealed, which is associated with its ploidy formed in childhood. In case of damage to mammalian liver, all hepatocytes enter the cycle and both cell division and polyploidization occur. Polyploidy in the course of ontogenesis up to the stage of aging fully complements the restoration of tissue and organ activity.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of leptin on primordial follicle survival and activation after in vitro culture of ovine ovarian tissue and if leptin acts through the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway. Ovarian fragments were fixed for histology (fresh control) or cultured for 7 days in control medium ( a-MEMthorn) alone or supplemented with leptin (1, 5, 10, 25 or 50 ng/ml). Follicle morphology, activation and apoptosis were analyzed. Next, the fragments were cultured in the medium that showed the best results in the absence or the presence of the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), and immunohistostaining of p-Akt protein was assessed. After culture, the percentage of normal follicles decreased (P < 0.05) in all treatments compared with the fresh control. Moreover, control medium and 1 ng/ml leptin had similar (P > 0.05) percentages of normal follicles, which were significantly higher than those in other treatments. However, culture with 1 ng/ml leptin maintained apoptosis similarly (P > 0.05) to that of the fresh control and lower (P < 0.05) than that in a-MEMthorn. Leptin did not influence follicle activation (P > 0.05) compared with the control medium (a-MEMthorn). Culture in 1 ng/ml leptin with LY294002 decreased the normal follicles and increased apoptosis, inhibited follicle activation (P < 0.05), and reduced p-Akt immunostaining, compared with the medium containing 1 ng/ml leptin without PI3K inhibitor. In conclusion, leptin at 1 ng/ml reduces apoptosis and promotes the activation of primordial follicles compared with the fresh control after in vitro culture of ovine ovarian tissue possibly through the PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - The slmap gene is alternatively spliced to generate many isoforms that are abundant in developing myocardium. The largest protein isoform SLMAP3 is ubiquitously expressed and has been linked to cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome and Hippo signaling. To examine any role in cardiogenesis, mice homozygous for floxed slmap allele were crossed with Nkx2.5-cre mice to nullify its expression in cardiac progenitors. Targeted deletion of the slmap gene resulted in the specific knockout (KO) of the SLMAP3 (similar to 91 KDa) isoform without any changes in the expression of the SLMAP2 (similar to 43 kDa) or the SLMAP1 (similar to 35 kDa) isoforms which continued to accumulate to similar levels as seen in Wt embryonic hearts. The loss of SLMAP3 from cardiac progenitors resulted in decreased size of the developing embryonic hearts evident at E9.5 to E16.5 with four small chambers and significantly thinner left ventricles. The proliferative capacity assessed with the phosphorylation of histone 3 or with Ki67 in E12.5 hearts was not significantly altered due to SLMAP3 deficiency. The size of embryonic cardiomyocytes, marked with anti-Troponin C, revealed significantly smaller cells, but their hypertrophic response (AKT1 and MTOR1) was not significantly affected by the specific loss of SLMAP3 protein. Further, no changes in phosphorylation of MST1/2 or YAP were detected in SLMAP3-KO embryonic myocardium, ruling out any impact on Hippo signaling. Rat embryonic cardiomyocytes express the three SLMAP isoforms and their knockdown (KD) with sh-RNA, resulted in decreased proliferation and enhanced senescence but without any impact on Hippo signaling. Collectively, these data show that SLMAP is critical for normal cardiac development with potential for the various isoforms to serve compensatory roles. Our data imply novel mechanisms for SLMAP action in cardiac growth independent of Hippo signaling.

AB  - BackgroundIn 2021, the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b Avian Influenza Viruses (AIVs) emerged on the American continent. At the same time, a further global spread took place. Infections have been reported in avian species as well as in over 50 mammalian species in 26 countries, and often result in severe disease with notable neurological pathology. Outbreaks in dairy cattle in the United States in 2024 illustrate viral transmission at a non-traditional interface and cross-species transmission. This development raises significant global concern regarding the virus's potential for wider spread. Given that H5N1 infections in birds reached record-high levels in Germany by late 2022, it is important to investigate whether Influenza A Virus (IAV) infections were also occurring in mammals sharing habitats with wild birds.Methods and ResultsSelected wild and domestic mammal populations were monitored over a two-year period (from January 2022 to December 2023), which coincided with a major infection period in wild birds in Bavaria. Genomes of Highly Pathogenic Avian IAV H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) were detected in red foxes but not in samples from ruminants such as red deer or domestic cattle. Analyses of viral whole genome sequences revealed several mutations associated with mammalian adaptation.ConclusionOur results indicate a high frequency of spillover events to red foxes at a time when there was a peak of H5N1 infections in wild birds in Bavaria. Phylogenetic analyses show no specifically close genetic relationship between viruses detected in mammalian predators within a geographic area. While direct fox-to-fox transmission has not yet been reported, the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b AIVs' ability to spread through non-traditional interfaces and to cross species barriers underlines the importance of continuous IAV surveillance in mammals and possibly including previously unknown host species.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the cell responses, potential skin reactions during the treatment process and burn wound healing efficacy of electrospun polycaprolactone/polyethylene oxide (PCL/PEO) nanofibers (NFs) containing Centella asiatica mediated synthesized silver nanoparticles (CA-AgNPs) by in vitro and in vivo studies. Apoptosis-necrosis, genotoxicity, hemolysis, and cell attachment studies are carried out within the scope of in vitro tests, and irritation, sensitivity, and burn wound studies are carried out within the scope of in vivo tests. The apoptotic index value of CA-AgNPs-[PCL/PEO] NFs material on L929 fibroblast cells is determined as 5.0 +/- 1.0% at the highest concentration and the necrotic index value is 5.0 +/- 0.3%. Micronucleus rates (%) of NFs treated with CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells are not at genotoxic level. The hemolytic index value of NFs dressing is determined as 0.23 +/- 0.03%, The primary irritation index (PII) value of NFs wound dressing is calculated as 0.36 by irritation tests. In addition, the potential sensitization reaction of NFs extract on guinea pigs is evaluated and the sensitization score is determined as 0.9. The healing efficacy of NFs material on second-degree burn wounds compared to a commercial product is supported by pathomorphological findings.

AB  - Shrews are small animals found in many different habitats. Like other mammals, adult neurogenesis occurs in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal formation. We asked whether the number of new generated cells in shrews depends on their brain size. We examined Crocidura russula and Neomys fodiens, weighing 10-22 g, and Crocidura olivieri and Suncus murinus that weigh three times more. We found that the density of proliferated cells in the SVZ was approximately at the same level in all species. These cells migrated from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB). In this pathway, a low level of neurogenesis occurred in C. olivieri compared to three other species of shrews. In the DG, the rate of adult neurogenesis was regulated differently. Specifically, the lowest density of newly generated neurons was observed in C. russula, which had a substantial number of new neurons in the OB compared with C. olivieri. We suggest that the number of newly generated neurons in an adult shrew's brain is independent of the brain size, and molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis appeared to be different in two neurogenic structures.

AB  - Electric fields (EFs) are thought to play a decisive role in wound healing. However, most studies focused on the effects of EF on single species of cells in vitro. Here, we aimed to investigate the coordination function of EFs on wound healing. Using a bamamini pig whole-layer wound model, we further evaluated the potential of EFs as a treatment modality by applying continuous and stable EF to the wound, and we found that EF promoted wound contraction and re-epithelialization in vivo, which accelerated wound healing. In vitro, we found that EFs significantly promoted the collective migration of HaCaT cells, guided HSF cells rearrangement, and promoted collagen secretion and myofibroblast transformation, and the electrotaxis of HaCaT cells was significantly enhanced on the collagen substrate and F-actin polarization at the leading edge of the cells was more pro-nounced. Overall, we determined that EF promotes wound contraction by promoting myofibrillar trans-formation, while accelerating the formation of collagen substrates, and the substrates could provide a good basis for electric field-guided re-epithelialization. EF may promote wound healing in multiple dimensions interaction and coordinate the whole process of wound healing. These findings provide support for the continued devel-opment of EF for wound treatment applications.

AB  - Fertility control has traditionally been applied in zoos to control captive populations, and reversible contraception is important. However, contraceptive methods for male bears have not been reported. We aimed to establish a reversible contraceptive for male brown bears by investigating the effects of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine (Improvac (R)) that was developed for the immune castration of pigs. We vaccinated six bears with two sequential doses of 400 (n = 2) or 600 mu g Improvac (R) (n = 4) with a 1-month interval during the pre-breeding season (February to April). We compared the reproductive parameters (testosterone levels and semen parameters) of the six vaccinated and four non-vaccinated (control) bears once during the breeding season (May or June). To investigate whether the reproductive performance could be restored in the following year of contraception, we also compared the reproductive parameters once during the breeding season in two bears between the year with GnRH vaccination and the following year without vaccination. Vaccination treatments suppressed reproductive parameters in 5 bears, although vaccination with 400 mu g of Improvac (R) was not effective in one bear. Testosterone levels and the rate of progressive sperm motility were significantly lower, and total sperm count and testis size tended to be lower in vaccinated bears, compared with the controls. Blood biochemical findings and direct observations after Improvac (R) vaccination did not reveal side effects. Moreover, testosterone levels and spermatogenic scores of two bears were restored in the following year. We confirmed that the Improvac (R) vaccine elicited a reversible contraceptive effect in male brown bears.

AB  - Pigs are vital for meat production, and their intramuscular fat content significantly impacts pork quality and flavor. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on porcine intramuscular fat, we found that adipose progenitor cells express highly inflammatory genes, including IL-1 alpha, during adipogenic differentiation. IL-1 alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine present in various cell types, can translocate to the nucleus via its nuclear localization sequence (NLS), yet its nuclear function remains unclear. By constructing an inactivated NLS carrier for IL-1 alpha, we discovered that nuclear IL-1 alpha promotes pyroptosis in porcine intramuscular adipocytes through the IRF2-NOCT-ROS pathway. This study reveals a novel role of nuclear IL-1 alpha in pyroptosis regulation, providing insights into enhancing the intramuscular fat content and improving pork quality.

AB  - Kumquat polyphenols, known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, have been less studied for their potential to delay aging and enhance cognitive memory. This research involved extracting and analyzing free and bound phenols from oil-skinned kumquat (Fortunella japonica Swingle) for their antioxidant and anti-aging effects. Whole fruit free phenols (WFP) at low dose (WFP-L, 50 mg per kg per day) and high dose (WFP-H, 200 mg per kg per day) were administered to d-galactose-induced senescence model mice over six weeks, examining their impact on cognitive memory function and intestinal flora. Peel free phenols and seed-bound phenols displayed the strongest activities, with key compounds like quinic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid identified. WFP significantly reduced oxidative stress in aging mice, enhanced antioxidant capacity, lowered inflammatory markers and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus, and increased acetylcholine levels. By modulating the p53/SIRT1/NF-kappa B signaling pathway, WFP effectively delayed aging and cognitive decline. Furthermore, WFP improved intestinal microbial communities, regulating flora imbalances and enhancing the intestinal barrier by boosting beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful strains like Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella. These findings highlight kumquat polyphenols' therapeutic potential against age-related cognitive impairment.

AB  - Age, female sex, and apolipoprotein E4 (E4) are risk factors to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are three major human apoE isoforms: E2, E3, and E4. Compared to E3, E4 increases while E2 decreases AD risk. However, E2 is associated with increased risk and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In cognitively healthy adults, E4 carriers have greater brain activation during learning and memory tasks in the absence of behavioral differences. Human apoE targeted replacement (TR) mice display differences in fear extinction that parallel human data: E2 mice show impaired extinction, mirroring heightened PTSD symptoms in E2 combat veterans. Recently, an adaptive role of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in immediate early gene expression (IEG) has been described. Age and disease synergistically increase DNA damage and decrease DNA repair. As the mechanisms underlying the relative risks of apoE, sex, and their interactions in aging are unclear, we used young (3 months) and middle-aged (12 months) male and female TR mice to investigate the influence of these factors on DSBs and IEGs at baseline and following contextual fear conditioning. We assessed brain-wide changes in neural activation following fear conditioning using whole-brain cFos imaging in young female TR mice. E4 mice froze more during fear conditioning and had lower cFos immunoreactivity across regions important for somatosensation and contextual encoding compared to E2 mice. E4 mice also showed altered co-activation compared to E3 mice, corresponding to human MRI and cognitive data, and indicating that there are differences in brain activity and connectivity at young ages independent of fear learning. There were increased DSB markers in middle-aged animals and alterations to cFos levels dependent on sex and isoform, as well. The increase in hippocampal DSB markers in middle-aged animals and female E4 mice may play a role in the risk for developing AD.

AB  - Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI)-encompassing anxiety, depression, and memory deficits-significantly diminishes the quality of life in patients with cancer, yet remains underrecognized in clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of tabernanthalog (TBG), a non-hallucinogenic analog of psychedelic compounds, as a novel intervention for CRCI using a Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) mouse model. Behavioral assessments revealed heightened anxiety-like behavior and memory impairment following 3LL cell transplantation. Biochemical analysis revealed reduced tryptophan levels in both blood and hippocampal tissue, accompanied by the downregulation of serotonergic receptor genes and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in the hippocampus of tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, microglial density and morphological activation were markedly elevated. TBG treatment reversed these behavioral deficits, improving both anxiety-related behavior and memory performance. These effects were associated with the normalization of microglial density and morphology, as well as the restoration of serotonergic receptor and cytokine gene expression. In vitro, TBG partially suppressed neuroinflammatory gene expression in BV-2 microglial cells exposed to conditioned medium from 3LL cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that TBG alleviates CRCI-like symptoms by modulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation. This study highlights TBG as a promising therapeutic candidate for improving cognitive and emotional functioning in patients with cancer.

AB  - Objective Here, we demonstrate the first successful use of static neural stimulation patterns for specific information content. These static patterns were derived by a model that was applied to a subject's own hippocampal spatiotemporal neural codes for memory.Approach We constructed a new model of processes by which the hippocampus encodes specific memory items via spatiotemporal firing of neural ensembles that underlie the successful encoding of targeted content into short-term memory. A memory decoding model (MDM) of hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neural firing was computed which derives a stimulation pattern for CA1 and CA3 neurons to be applied during the encoding (sample) phase of a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) human short-term memory task.Main results MDM electrical stimulation delivered to the CA1 and CA3 locations in the hippocampus during the sample phase of DMS trials facilitated memory of images from the DMS task during a delayed recognition (DR) task that also included control images that were not from the DMS task. Across all subjects, the stimulated trials exhibited significant changes in performance in 22.4% of patient and category combinations. Changes in performance were a combination of both increased memory performance and decreased memory performance, with increases in performance occurring at almost 2 to 1 relative to decreases in performance. Across patients with impaired memory that received bilateral stimulation, significant changes in over 37.9% of patient and category combinations was seen with the changes in memory performance show a ratio of increased to decreased performance of over 4 to 1. Modification of memory performance was dependent on whether memory function was intact or impaired, and if stimulation was applied bilaterally or unilaterally, with nearly all increase in performance seen in subjects with impaired memory receiving bilateral stimulation.Significance These results demonstrate that memory encoding in patients with impaired memory function can be facilitated for specific memory content, which offers a stimulation method for a future implantable neural prosthetic to improve human memory.

AB  - Advancements in molecular biology have revolutionized our understanding of complex diseases, with Alzheimer's disease being a prime example. Single-cell sequencing, currently the most suitable technology, facilitates profoundly detailed disease analysis at the cellular level. Prior research has established that the pathology of Alzheimer's disease varies across different brain regions and cell types. In parallel, only machine learning has the capacity to address the myriad challenges presented by such studies, where the integration of large-scale data and numerous experiments is required to extract meaningful knowledge. Our methodology utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing data from healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) samples, focused on the cortex and hippocampus regions in mice. We designed three distinct case studies and implemented an ensemble feature selection approach through machine learning, also performing an analysis of distinct age-related datasets to unravel age-specific effects, showing differential gene expression patterns within each condition. Important evidence was reported, such as enrichment in central nervous system development and regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation between the hippocampus and cortex of 6-month-old AD mice as well as regulation of epinephrine secretion and dendritic spine morphogenesis in 15-month-old AD mice. Our outcomes from all three of our case studies illustrate the capacity of machine learning strategies when applied to single-cell data, revealing critical insights into Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - CaMKII has long been known to be a key effector for synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have shown that a variety of modulators interact with the subunits of CaMKII to regulate the long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal neurons. However, whether long non-coding RNAs modulate the activity of CaMKII and affect synaptic plasticity is still elusive. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized long non-coding RNA Carip that functions as a scaffold, specifically interacts with CaMKIIb, and regulates the phosphorylation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in the hippocampus. The absence of Carip causes dysfunction of synaptic transmission and attenuates LTP in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, which further leads to impairment of spatial learning and memory. In summary, our findings demonstrate that Carip modulates long-term synaptic plasticity by changing AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor activities, thereby affecting spatial learning and memory in mice.

AB  - Interleukin-18 (IL-18) can effectively activate natural killer (NK) cells and induce large concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In healthy humans, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) can inhibit the binding of IL-18 to IL-18R and counteract the biological action of IL-18 due to its high concentration and high affinity, thus preventing the production of IFN-gamma and inhibiting NK-cell activation. Through previous studies and the phenomena observed by our group in pig-non-human primates (NHPs) liver transplantation experiments, we proposed that the imbalance in IL-18/IL-18BP expression upon transplantation encourages the activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic effects of NK cells, ultimately causing acute vascular rejection of the graft. In this research, we used Lewis-Brown Norway rat orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) as a model of acute vascular rejection. AAV8-Il18bp viral vectors as gene delivery vehicles were constructed for gene therapy to overexpress IL-18BP and alleviate NK-cell rejection of the graft after transplantation. The results showed that livers overexpressing IL-18BP had reduced damage and could function longer after transplantation, effectively improving the survival time of the recipients.

AB  - Background: Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), exhibits a broad host range, manifesting as both a beneficial commensal and an opportunistic pathogen across various species. In humans, it poses significant risks, causing neonatal sepsis and meningitis, along with severe infections in adults. Additionally, it impacts livestock by inducing mastitis in bovines and contributing to epidemic mortality in fish populations. Despite its wide host spectrum, the mechanisms enabling GBS to adapt to specific hosts remain inadequately elucidated. Therefore, the development of a rapid and accurate method differentiates GBS strains associated with particular animal hosts based on genome-wide information holds immense potential. Such a tool would not only bolster the identification and containment efforts during GBS outbreaks but also deepen our comprehension of the bacteria's host adaptations spanning humans, livestock, and other natural animal reservoirs. Methods and results: Here, we developed three machine learning models-random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) based on genome-wide mutation data. These models enabled precise prediction of the host origin of GBS, accurately distinguishing between human, bovine, fish, and pig hosts. Moreover, we conducted an interpretable machine learning using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and variant annotation to uncover the most influential genomic features and associated genes for each host. Additionally, by meticulously examining misclassified samples, we gained valuable insights into the dynamics of host transmission and the potential for zoonotic infections. Conclusions: Our study underscores the effectiveness of random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) models based on mutation data for accurately predicting GBS host origins. Additionally, we identify the key features associated with each GBS host, thereby enhancing our understanding of the bacteria's host -specific adaptations.

AB  - Integrated biochemical and biophysical signals regulate embryonic development. Correct neural tube formation is critical for the development of central nervous system. However, the role of microgravity in neurodevelopment and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the effects of stimulated microgravity (SMG) on the development of human brain organoids are investigated. SMG impairs N-cadherin-based adherens junction formation, leading to neural tube defects associated with dysregulated self-renewal capacity and neuroepithelial disorganization in human brain organoids. Bulk gene expression analyses reveal that SMG alters Hippo and BMP signaling in brain organoids. The neuropathological deficits in SMG-treated organoids can be rescued by regulating YAP/BMP/ID1 axis. Furthermore, sing-cell RNA sequencing data show that SMG results in perturbations in the number and function of neural stem and progenitor cell subpopulations. One of these subpopulations senses SMG cues and transmits BMP signals to the subpopulation responsible for tube morphogenesis, ultimately affecting the proliferating cell population. Finally, SMG intervention leads to persistent neurologic damage even after returning to normal gravity conditions. Collectively, this study reveals molecular and cellular abnormalities associated with SMG during human brain development, providing opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal neurodevelopment in space.

AB  - Ischemia-like conditions reflect almost the entire spectrum of events that occur during cerebral ischemia, including the induction of oxidative stress, Ca2+ overload, glutamate excitotoxicity, and activation of necrosis and apoptosis in brain cells. Mechanisms for the protective effects of the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-6 (Prx-6) on hippocampal cells during oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) were investigated. Using the methods of fluorescence microscopy, inhibitory analysis, vitality tests and PCR, it was shown that 24-h incubation of mixed hippocampal cell cultures with Prx-6 does not affect the generation of a reversible phase of a OGD-induced rise in Ca2+ ions in cytosol ([Ca2+](i)), but inhibits a global increase in [Ca2+](i) in astrocytes completely and in neurons by 70%. In addition, after 40 min of OGD, cell necrosis is suppressed, especially in the astrocyte population. This effect is associated with the complex action of Prx-6 on neuroglial networks. As an antioxidant, Prx-6 has a more pronounced and astrocyte-directed effect, compared to the exogenous antioxidant vitamin E (Vit E). Prx-6 inhibits ROS production in mitochondria by increasing the antioxidant capacity of cells and altering the expression of genes encoding redox status proteins. Due to the close bond between [Ca2+](i) and intracellular ROS, this effect of Prx-6 is one of its protective mechanisms. Moreover, Prx-6 effectively suppresses not only necrosis, but also apoptosis during OGD and reoxygenation. Incubation with Prx-6 leads to activation of the basic expression of genes encoding protective kinases-PI3K, CaMKII, PKC, anti-apoptotic proteins-Stat3 and Bcl-2, while inhibiting the expression of signaling kinases and factors involved in apoptosis activation-Ikk, Src, NF-kappa b, Caspase-3, p53, Fas, etc. This effect on the basic expression of the genome leads to the cell preconditions, which is expressed in the inhibition of caspase-3 during OGD/reoxygenation. A significant effect of Prx-6 is directed on suppression of the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta and factor TNF alpha, as well as genes encoding NMDA- and kainate receptor subunits, which was established for the first time for this antioxidant enzyme. The protective effect of Prx-6 is due to its antioxidant properties, since mutant Prx-6 (mutPrx-6, Prx6-C47S) leads to polar opposite effects, contributing to oxidative stress, activation of apoptosis and cell death through receptor action on TLR4.

AB  - Rearing insect as food and feed has been identified as an emerging solution to improve global food security. Rhynchophorus phoenicis larvae are widely consumed in Ghana and Africa. However, the continuous production of the larvae is limited by the identification of available substrates and technology for mass production of the larvae. Substrates which include sliced false yam, spoilt garden eggs, spoilt onion, cocoa pod, elephant ear corm, peeled sugarcane, cocoyam cake, coconut coir, banana corm, oil palm yolk, and softer part of Raphia palm with each weighing 250 g were evaluated with R. phoenicis adults to assess the preferable substrates for egg-laying, hatching, and larval development. The results showed significant differences (P<0.005) on all the studied parameters of R. phoenicis reared on the different substrates. The parameters include pre-oviposition period, oviposition period, fecundity, number of eggs hatched, percentage hatchability, percentage larval survival, the average weight of larva, and percentage weight categories of 3-4 g, 4-5 g, and 5-6 g. There was a negative relationship between the number of male and female pairs and fecundity; the highest oviposition was achieved with one pair. Cocooning duration, percentage cocooning, and percentage adult eclosion were significantly different (P<0.005) among the substrates. Multiple regression analysis indicated that elephant ear corm, sliced false yam, and peeled sugarcane show a potential as alternative feed substrates for R. phoenicis larvae rearing.

Using data from 5556 genomically-confirmed European ancestry youth who completed the baseline session of the ongoing the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development(SM) Study (ABCD Study (R)), our phenome-wide association study estimating associations between four indices of genetic risk for late-onset AD (i.e., AD polygenic risk scores (PRS), APOE rs429358 genotype, AD PRS with the APOE region removed (AD(PRS-APOE)), and an interaction between AD(PRS-APOE) and APOE genotype) and 1687 psychosocial, behavioral, and neural phenotypes revealed no significant associations after correction for multiple testing (all ps > 0.0002; all p(fdr) > 0.07). These data suggest that AD genetic risk may not phenotypically manifest during middle-childhood or that effects are smaller than this sample is powered to detect.

AB  - Clay, or more precisely, certain clay typologies, have been used traditionally by humans for therapeutic, nutritional, and skin-care purposes though they may be responsible for some relatively rare but significant health and skin-care risks. For example, clay particles could adsorb and make available for elimination or excretion any potential toxic elements or toxins being ingested or produced, but they could also adsorb and make available for incorporation, through ingestion or through dermal absorption, toxic elements, e.g. heavy metals. Geophagy has been observed in all parts of the world since Antiquity, reflecting cultural practices, religious beliefs, and physiological needs, be they nutritional (dietary supplementation) or as a remedy for disease. Some clays and clay minerals are employed widely in both the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries as active compounds/agents and as excipients. In the biomedical field, some clay minerals such as halloysite and montmorillonite are known for their effective role as carriers for the control and sustainable delivery of active drug molecules, and in the biomaterials field some clay minerals are used for scaffold, hydrogel, foam, and film production. Constraints, both chemical and microbiological, on the use of clay-based products for therapeutic and cosmetic topical applications are generally imposed by sanitary regulations, and some solutions are proposed herein to control and reduce such restrictions. Particular emphasis is placed here on peloids and pelotherapy, as well as on manipulated and modified peloids, and specifically on tailored peloids or 'designed and engineered' peloids, and their derivatives, bactericidal peloids and ointments. As far as the so-called 'killer clays' are concerned, their pre-requisites, mechanisms of action, and disinfection role are also enhanced. Podoconiosis is an environment-related or geochemical disease that occurs in tropical highland areas, and is caused by long-term exposure of bare feet to volcanic, red-clay soil and affects some people, particularly those working in agriculture in some regions of Africa, Asia, and South America.

AB  - Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, currently con-sidered the number one cause of chronic liver disease. MAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension. Emphasis has been placed on the use of green tea (GT), produced from the Camellia sinensis plant, rich in antioxidants as polyphenols and catechins, on obesity and MAFLD treatment/prevention. Studies carried out in rodent models housed at a standard temperature (ST, 22 & DEG;C) are being questioned as ST is a determining factor on generating changes in the physiology of immune response, and energy metabolism. On the other hand, it seems that thermoneu-trality (TN, 28 & DEG;C) represents a closer parallel to human physiology. In this perspective, we investigated the effects of GT (500 mg/kg of body weight, over 12 weeks, 5 days/week) by comparing mice housed at ST or TN in a model of MAFLD of diet-induced obese males C57Bl/6 mice. We show that the liver phenotype at TN exhibits a more severe MAFLD while GT ameliorates this condition. In parallel, GT restores the expression of genes involved in the li-pogenic pathway, regardless of temperature, with slight modifications in lipolysis/fatty acid oxidation. We observed an increase promoted by GT in PPAR & alpha; and PPAR & gamma; proteins independently of housing temperature and a dual pattern of bile acid synthesis. Thus, animals' conditioning temperature is a key factor that can interfere in the results involving obesity and MAFLD, although GT has beneficial effects against MAFLD independently of the housing temperature of mice. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emerging bat-borne Henipavirus that has caused numerous outbreaks with public health concerns. It is able to inhibit the host innate immune response. Since the NF-kappa B pathway plays a crucial role in the innate antiviral response as a major transcriptional regulator of inflammation, we postulated its implication in the still poorly understood NiV immunopathogenesis. We report here that NiV inhibits the canonical NF-kappa B pathway via its nonstructural W protein. Translocation of the W protein into the nucleus causes nuclear accumulation of the cellular scaffold protein 14-3-3 in both African green monkey and human cells infected by NiV. Excess of 14-3-3 in the nucleus was associated with a reduction of NF-kappa B p65 subunit phosphorylation and of its nuclear accumulation. Importantly, W-S449A substitution impairs the binding of the W protein to 14-3-3 and the subsequent suppression of NF-kappa B signaling, thus restoring the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Our data suggest that the W protein increases the steady-state level of 14-3-3 in the nucleus and consequently enhances 14-3-3-mediated negative feedback on the NF-kappa B pathway. These findings provide a mechanistic model of W-mediated disruption of the host inflammatory response, which could contribute to the high severity of NiV infection.
   In a study using both human cells and the African green monkeys, Enchery et al report that the highly pathogenic bat-borne Nipah virus (NiV), inhibits the NF-kappa B pathway via its nonstructural W protein. They demonstrate that it exerts this effect by causing nuclear accumulation of the cellular scaffold protein 14-3-3, which sheds light on pathomechanism of NiV infection.

AB  - This study discusses the importance of providing animals with adequate nutrients to promote their health and welfare. Current methods for estimating amino acid (AA) requirements only consider growth and protein retention, without considering other physiological responses. To address this, the authors used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate whether growth and protein retention measurements are enough to develop dietary AA recommendations that optimize animal performance, health, and survival. The EDA revealed that AA dietary levels above those for maximum growth can lead to improvements in physiological responses related to milk yield, litter size, immune response, intestinal permeability, and plasma AA concentrations.This study aimed to determine whether current methods for estimating AA requirements for animal health and welfare are sufficient. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted, which involved a review of assumptions underlying AA requirements research, a data mining approach to identify animal responses to dietary AA levels exceeding those for maximum protein retention, and a literature review to assess the physiological relevance of the linear-logistic model developed through the data mining approach. The results showed that AA dietary levels above those for maximum growth resulted in improvements in key physiological responses, and the linear-logistic model depicted the AA level at which growth and protein retention rates were maximized, along with key metabolic functions related to milk yield, litter size, immune response, intestinal permeability, and plasma AA concentrations. The results suggest that current methods based solely on growth and protein retention measurements are insufficient for optimizing key physiological responses associated with health, survival, and reproduction. The linear-logistic model could be used to estimate AA doses that optimize these responses and, potentially, survival rates.

AB  - This experimental study was performed to evaluate the alterations in the expression of a few subunits composing glutamate AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the hippocampal cells of Wistar rats in response to long-term fluoride (F-) exposure. The animals were given water with background 0.4 (control), 5, 20, and 50 ppm F- (as NaF) for 12 months. The cognitive capacities of rats were examined by novel object recognition (NOR), Y-maze test, and Morris water maze tests. RT-qPCR and Western blotting techniques were used to evaluate the expression of different AMPA and NMDA subunits at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Long-term F- poisoning disturbed the formation of hippocampus-dependent working spatial and long-term non-spatial memory. The expression of Gria1, Gria2, and Gria3 genes encoding different subunits of AMPA receptors were comparable in hippocampi of control and F--exposed animals, although the levels of both Grin2a and Grin2b mRNA increased. Long-term F- intake enhanced the ratio of phospho-GluA1/total-GluA1 proteins in subcellular fraction enriched with cytosolic proteins, while decreased content of GluA2 but elevated level of GluA3 were observed in subcellular fraction enriched with membrane proteins. Such changes were accompanied by increased phosphorylation of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, higher ratios of GluN2A/GluN1 and GluN2B/GluN1 proteins in the cytosol, and GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in membranes. These changes indicate the predominance of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in membranes and a shift between different NMDARs subunits in hippocampal cells of F--exposed rats, which is typical for neurodegeneration and can at least partially underly the observed disturbances in cognitive capacities of animals.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Biyuantong decoction (BYT), a traditional Chinese medicinal formulation, has been used for years to treat chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with good clinical results. However, the underlying mechanisms of its treatment for CRS remain to be fully elucidated. Study aim: This research investigates the molecular mechanism by which BYT ameliorates CRS and provide new perspectives for CRS treatment research. Materials and methods: Clinical research is conducted on CRS patients who underwent surgery, and post-operative treatments and observations were performed. The pathological alterations of CRS were inspected by H&E staining and nasal endoscopy. Flow cytometry and ELISA were employed to measure the levels of inflammatory cells and cytokines in the peripheral blood of CRS patients. The cytotoxic impacts of BYT were assessed by cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. The effects of BYT on the adhesion and invasion of inflammatory cells to endothelial cells were evaluated by hetero-adhesion and transwell assay. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on HUVECs. The effects of BYT on NF-kappa B signaling pathway was analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The chemical components of BYT was determined by UPLC-HRMS, and network pharmacology analysis was adopted to predict potential targets in the NF-kappa B pathway. Results: Clinical samples demonstrated that BYT treatment could effectively alleviate sinus mucosal edema and significantly decreased the recurrence rate after surgery. H&E staining disclosed obvious inflammatory cell infiltration in the sinus mucosa of CRS patients. Flow cytometry and ELISA results indicated that BYT treatment reduced the levels of eosinophils (median decrease 16.21 %) and cytokines in peripheral blood. Cell adhesion and transwell assays manifested that BYT inhibited the adhesion and invasion of U937 cells to TNF-alpha-induced HUVECs. Moreover, BYT counteracted the TNF-alpha-induced upregulation of CAMs on endothelial cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that BYT reduced the expression of NF-kappa B-related proteins and hindered the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B. Network pharmacology analysis and component identification of BYT further supported the function of its compounds in synergistically modulating NF-kappa B signaling.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a simulation model that accounts for skin-specific properties in order to predict photothermal damage during skin laser treatment. To construct a computational model, surface geometry information was obtained from an optical coherence tomography image, and the absorption coefficient of the skin was determined through spectrophotometry. The distribution of the internal light dose inside the skin medium was calculated using the light propagation model based on the Monte Carlo method. The photothermal response due to the absorption of laser light was modeled by a finite difference time domain model to solve the bio-heat transfer equation. The predicted depth and area of the damaged lesions from the simulation model were compared to those measured in ex vivo porcine skin. The present simulation model gave acceptable predictions with differences of approximately similar to 10% in both depth and area.

AB  - C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) is a chemokine receptor involved in immune responses and a co -receptor for HIV infection. Recently, CCR5 has also been reported to play a role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and cognitive deficits associated with normal aging, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and HIV -associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In contrast, the role of CCR5 in cognitive deficits associated with other disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is much less understood. Studies have reported an increase in expression of CCR5 or its ligands in both AD patients and AD rodent models, suggesting a correlation between AD and CCR5 expression. However, whether blocking CCR5 in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, could improve memory deficits in AD mouse models is unknown. To study the potential causal role of CCR5 in cognitive deficits in AD, we injected soluble A beta(1-42) or a control (A beta 42-1) oligomers in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus and found that A beta(1-42) injection resulted in severe memory impairment in the object place recognition (OPR) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. A beta(1-42) injection caused an increase in Ccr5, Ccl3, and Ccl4 in the dorsal hippocampus, and the expression levels of CCR5 and its ligands remained elevated at 2 weeks after A beta(1-42) injection. Knocking down Ccr5 in the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus reversed the increase in microglia number and size in dorsal CA1 and rescued memory deficits. These results indicate that CCR5 plays an important role in modulating A beta(1-42)-induced learning and memory deficits, and suggest that CCR5 antagonists may serve as a potential treatment to improve cognitive deficits associated with AD.

AB  - The role of nasal microbiota in contributing to neuroinflammation is gradually emerging. Multiple sclerosis and chronic rhinosinusitis share important clinical and epidemiological similarities, and the hypothetical connection among these two pathological entities should be carefully investigated. This editorial is based on a review of available literature on this topic. The main international databases were searched using the following keywords: neuroinflammation, nasal microbiota, multiple sclerosis, chronic rhino-sinusal disorders, chronic sinusitis. Four fully-consistent articles that investigated nasal microbiota alteration and/or chronic rhinosinusitis presence in subjects affected by multiple sclerosis were identified. Overall, these studies showed a significant connection between nasal microbiota dysbiosis and the presence of multiple sclerosis. New specific studies to analyze the nasal microbiota and its metabolism in patients affected by multiple sclerosis should be performed. In fact, a series of treatments able to change this flora could improve the rhino-sinusal state with consequent reduction of recurrent episodes of neuro-inflammation.

AB  - Health hazards from long-term exposure to microwaves, especially the potential for changes in cognitive function, are attracting increasing attention. The purpose of this study was to explore changes in spatial learning and memory and synaptic structure and to identify differentially expressed proteins in hippocampal and serum exosomes after long-term exposure to 2.856 and 9.375 GHz microwaves. The spatial reference learning and memory abilities and the structure of the DG area were impaired after long-term exposure to 2.856 and 9.375 GHz microwaves. We also found a decrease in SNARE-associated protein Snapin and an increase in charged multivesicular body protein 3 in the hippocampus, indicating that synaptic vesicle recycling was inhibited and consistent with the large increase in presynaptic vesicles. Moreover, we investigated changes in serum exosomes after 2.856 and 9.375 GHz microwave exposure. The results showed that long-term 2.856 GHz microwave exposure could induce a decrease in calcineurin subunit B type 1 and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain in serum exosomes. While the 9.375 GHz long-term microwave exposure induced a decrease in proteins (synaptophysin-like 1, ankyrin repeat and rabankyrin-5, protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit alpha and sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 1) in serum exosomes. In summary, long-term microwave exposure could lead to different degrees of spatial learning and memory impairment, EEG disturbance, structural damage to the hippocampus, and differential expression of hippocampal tissue and serum exosomes.

AB  - The threat to human health from cold stimulation is increasing due to the frequent occurrence of temperature extremes. It is a challenge for people to resist the negative effects of prolonged cold stimulation on the heart. In this study, we created prolonged cold stimulation pig models to investigate the cardiac energy metabolism and injury during prolonged cold stimulation, and the molecular mechanisms by which dietary supplementation with full-fat rice bran reduces cardiac injury. The results showed that lesions in the morphological structure of the heart were detected under prolonged cold stimulation. At the same time, dystrophin was downregulated under the effect of prolonged cold stimulation. Cardiac fatty acid transport and utilization were promoted, and oxidative stress was increased under prolonged cold stimulation. It also increased MDA content and decreased T-AOC level in the heart, while promoting the mRNA expression of Nrf2 and NQO1, as well as the protein content of Nrf2 and HO-1. Prolonged cold stimulation induced mitochondrial lesions, mitochondrial fusion, and mitophagy in the heart. Prolonged cold stimulation promoted the mRNA expression of PTGS2, TLR4, MyD88, NLRP3, and IL-1 beta; and protein expression of PTGS2, NLRP3, and mature-IL-1 beta. GCH1 and FtH inhibited by prolonged cold stimulation caused the activation of heart ferroptosis. In addition, dietary supplementation with full-fat rice bran improved oxidative stress in the heart and inhibited mitophagy, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. In conclusion, prolonged cold stimulation heightens the risk of cardiac ferroptosis and imbalance of energy metabolism, whereas dietary supplementation with full-fat rice bran mitigates the adverse effects of prolonged cold stimulation on the heart.

AB  - Utilization of marine photovoltaic energy is primarily focused on surface harvesting with limited photovoltaic cell implementations in submarine environments. Potential applications include marine wildlife telemetry devices, autonomous underwater vehicles, or remote sensing assets. In these applications, understanding the power at depth is critical, but there has yet to be a long-term study of cell performance in a realistic marine environment that spans time, geographic location, and depth. In this paper, we present photovoltaic assessments carried out by devices mounted to adult female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) during their spring migrations in the Pacific Ocean with deployment times between 76 and 107 days. Encompassing a large geographic area between Santa Cruz, California, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska during their migrations, elephant seal behavior allows for repeated depth profiles each day, making them an ideal host for subsurface power assessments. This paper presents the first longitudinal study of photovoltaic cell performance in the marine environment that spans location, time, and depth. This work discusses the calibration, data time alignment, and power calculations of these oceanic deployments. Deployment results, including power results and energy predictions from the data record, are presented up to 22 m in depth. We highlight how the recorded power data of these cells compares to previously published results and how depth impacts subsurface power and energy harvesting.
   Custom photovoltaic assessment modules (CPAMs) were designed to measure photovoltaic performance via current-voltage measurements at depth. They were attached to adult female northern elephant seals prior to migrations in the Pacific Ocean. The results of this deployment, including power and energy averages, are presented up to 22 meters in depth.image

AB  - Many animal structures and appendages are pressurized, cylindrical, and helically wrapped with fibers. Squid tentacles, elephant trunks, echinoderm tube feet, notochords, arteries, and the bodies of sharks, nematodes, and annelids are all helically wrapped and their structural function depends on force transmission by this wrapping. Classical understanding of helically-wrapped cylinders in biology originates with calculations and concepts developed in the context of worm bodies, particularly nemerteans, turbellarians, and nematodes. This work recognized the geometric effects of the fiber angle on the cylinder volume and the fiber stretch. Subsequent work on tongues, tentacles, trunks, and polychaete worms used cylinder geometry to infer mechanical advantage. However, these studies did not explicitly consider forces and hence are limited in developing a general understanding for the mechanics of soft skeletons. Recently, a more precise theory was developed that incorporates force transmission, enhancing an understanding of mechanical and displacement advantage in these biological hydrostats. Some general insights are derivable from this foundation. A pressurized cylinder has a hoop stress that is twice the longitudinal stress and a crossed-helical wrapping of fibers can carry all of those stresses, if the fibers are at the magic angle of 54.7 degrees. In a variable-volume cylinder with inextensible fibers, the magic angle corresponds to the maximum enclosed volume, but in a constant-volume cylinder, shape change necessitates stretching of the helical fibers. Strain and the length-to-radius ratio (aspect ratio) are functions of fiber angle, but aspect ratio also depends on the number of fiber wrappings. A constant-volume cylinder at any other angle will generate higher pressure, stretch helical fibers, store energy, cause shape changes, and possibly generate axial or radial external forces. Due to geometry, the mechanical advantage of force transmission from longitudinal muscles to radial output forces is not the inverse of the mechanical advantage of circumferential muscles transmitting force to the axial direction. Additionally, the mechanical advantage of short, wide cylinders is higher in extension than that of longer, thinner cylinders, suggesting that short and wide earthworm and polychaete segments have a higher mechanical advantage in generating axial forces during burrowing. Helical fibers can reduce the mechanical advantage during extension and retraction because energy is stored in the fibers; stiffer fibers reduce the mechanical advantage more; and some worms have helical muscles that might allow behavioral modulation of mechanical advantage. These inferences demonstrate insights that may be gleaned from explicit considerations of the mechanical principles of hydrostatic skeletons.

TI  - Improving multi-trait genomic prediction by incorporating local genetic correlations
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Genomic prediction holds significant potential for advancing precision medicine in humans, as well as accelerating genetic improvement in animals and plants. For multi-trait prediction, the conventional multi-trait models are primarily based on global genetic correlations between traits. With the development of local genetic correlation (LGC) estimation methods, it is now possible to analyze LGCs confined to specific genomic regions and it is expected that incorporating LGCs into multi-trait prediction model would enhance the prediction ability. Here, we proposed three models to address this issue and evaluated their performances using simulated data and three real datasets from human, cow, and pig populations. Our results demonstrate that LGCs are heterogeneous across the genome and incorporating LGCs in multi-trait prediction would increase the prediction accuracy by an average of 12.76% +/- 2.07% compared to conventional multi-trait genomic prediction method (MTGBLUP) in the real datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of considering LGCs in improving multi-trait genomic prediction.

AB  - Fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) is prominently expressed in astrocytes and is a critical regulator of inflammatory responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that FABP7 is crucial in neuropsychological disease through the modulation of spinogenesis. Nonetheless, the impact of FABP7 on depressive disorders and the underlying mechanisms is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the antidepressant properties of FABP7 using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced model of depression and possible mechanisms. Our results revealed that depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS was associated with decreased levels of FABP7 protein in the hippocampus (HP). Furthermore, the overexpression of FABP7 in the HP mitigated the depressive-like behavior and increased the expression of its downstream target caveolin-1 (Cav-1). FABP7 overexpression in the HP specifically regulates the expression of the astrocyte marker protein GFAP, as well as the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-associated proteins AQP4, CLDN-5, occludin, and LRP1. Notably, the CUMS-induced upregulation of the pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and IL-6 was also significantly reversed by FABP7 overexpression in the HP. This intervention also led to increased levels of postsynaptic proteins, including PSD95 and GluA1, as well as an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhanced neuronal dendritic spine density. The findings indicate that FABP7 exerts antidepressant-like properties by inhibiting inflammation, regulating spinogenesis, and modulating BBB-related proteins.

AB  - Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) affects the venous system of the lower limbs, leading to pain, edema, skin anomalies, ulceration, and extended venous hypertension. Aesculus hippocastanum seed extract has been traditionally used for CVI treatment. This study aims to elucidate its mechanism of action using in silico approaches. An integrated network pharmacology technique identified potential components for CVI treatment. From 105 chemical elements of A. hippocastanum collected via literature research, 12 active phytochemicals with notable drug-like properties and bioavailability were selected. These chemicals were linked to 213 putative target genes using the SwissTargetPrediction database. Comparison with CVI-related genes from GeneCards and OMIM databases narrowed these 147 crucial genes shared by A. hippocastanum and CVI pathophysiology. A compound-target network revealed interactions influencing CVI-related pathways. After that, protein-protein interaction analysis using STRING and Cytoscape identified key hub genes, including SRC and MAPK3, critical to CVI pathogenesis. GO and KEGG pathway analyses further highlighted biological functions and signaling pathways associated with A. hippocastanum's anti-CVI effects. Moreover, virtual screening and molecular docking analysis demonstrated high binding affinities of alpha-spinasterol with MAPK3 (-9.3 kcal/mol) and kaempferol with SRC (-9.0 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the binding capacity and stability of SRC-kaempferol and MAPK3-alpha-spinasterol. Ligands showed strong catalytic site binding, as evidenced by molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) analysis. This comprehensive investigation highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of A. hippocastanum seed extract for CVI treatment and encourages further studies on its mechanism and clinical applications.

AB  - Objective: Experience-dependent modulation of the visual evoked potential (VEP) has emerged as a promising non-invasive proxy for assaying long term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in the cerebral cortex. LTP is considered the principal candidate mechanism underlying learning and memory. There is, however, a paucity of evidence exploring associations between LTP-like plasticity and performance-based learning and memory. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between VEP-plasticity and higher-order learning and memory in healthy adults.Method: Visual and verbal learning and memory was assessed using the Aggie Figures Learning Test (AFLT) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). The study included 111 healthy adults (61.1% females; mean age 37.6 years, range 17-71) who underwent a VEP paradigm employing visual high-frequency stimulation to induce a change in visual evoked responses recorded by scalp EEG. In addition, a more comprehensive neuro-psychological assessment was administered.Results: Several significant moderate age-corrected positive correlations were found between modulation of the later VEP components (N1 and P1-N1 peak-to-peak) and both visual and verbal learning and memory perfor-mance. Further, there were significant differences in learning and memory performance between participants showing a higher degree of modulation (>1 SD above mean) compared to participants showing a lower degree of modulation. No significant associations were found between VEP-plasticity and other neurocognitive domains.Conclusions: The current results suggest that LTP-like plasticity indexed by VEP modulation reflect processes specific to learning and memory. Future research is needed to further delineate the complex relationship between neural plasticity and learning and memory, specifically concerning possible clinical implications in populations with deficits in learning and memory function.

AB  - Pocaterra et al. demonstrate that Fascin1 F-actin bundling protein sustains YAP activation in the tumour environment in response to extracellular matrix mechanical cues. This study highlights Fascin1 as a potential clinical target in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma development.
   Mechanical forces control cell behavior, including cancer progression. Cells sense forces through actomyosin to activate YAP. However, the regulators of F-actin dynamics playing relevant roles during mechanostransduction in vitro and in vivo remain poorly characterized. Here we identify the Fascin1 F-actin bundling protein as a factor that sustains YAP activation in response to ECM mechanical cues. This is conserved in the mouse liver, where Fascin1 regulates YAP-dependent phenotypes, and in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Moreover, this is relevant for liver tumorigenesis, because Fascin1 is required in the AKT/NICD cholangiocarcinogenesis model and it is sufficient, together with AKT, to induce cholangiocellular lesions in mice, recapitulating genetic YAP requirements. In support of these findings, Fascin1 expression in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas strongly correlates with poor patient prognosis. We propose that Fascin1 represents a pro-oncogenic mechanism that can be exploited during intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma development to overcome a mechanical tumor-suppressive environment.

AB  - Replay of neuronal sequences in the hippocampus during resting states and sleep play an important role in learning and memory consolidation. Consistent with these functions, replay sequences have been shown to obey current spatial constraints. Nevertheless, replay does not necessarily reflect previous behavior and can construct never-experienced sequences. Here, we propose a stochastic replay mechanism that prioritizes experiences based on three variables: 1. Experience strength, 2. experience similarity, and 3. inhibition of return. Using this prioritized replay mechanism to train reinforcement learning agents leads to far better performance than using random replay. Its performance is close to the state-of-the-art, but computationally intensive, algorithm by Mattar & Daw (2018). Importantly, our model reproduces diverse types of replay because of the stochasticity of the replay mechanism and experience-dependent differences between the three variables. In conclusion, a unified replay mechanism generates diverse replay statistics and is efficient in driving spatial learning.

AB  - Memories are stored as ensembles of engram neurons and their successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular networks. However, significant gaps remain in connecting these cell ensembles with the process of forgetting. Here, we utilized a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. Direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of an object memory. In addition, through behavioral and pharmacological interventions, we successfully prevented or accelerated forgetting of an object memory. Finally, we showed that these results can be explained by a computational model in which engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten. Together, these findings suggest that forgetting may be an adaptive form of engram plasticity which allows engrams to switch from an accessible state to an inaccessible state.

AB  - The mechanisms of anxiety disorders, the most common mental illness, remain incompletely characterized. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is critical for the expression of anxiety. However, current studies primarily focus on vHPC neurons, leaving the role for vHPC astrocytes in anxiety largely unexplored. Here, genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m and in vivo fiber photometry calcium imaging are used to label vHPC astrocytes and monitor their activity, respectively, genetic and chemogenetic approaches to inhibit and activate vHPC astrocytes, respectively, patch-clamp recordings to measure glutamate currents, and behavioral assays to assess anxiety-like behaviors. It is found that vHPC astrocytic activity is increased in anxiogenic environments and by 3-d subacute restraint stress (SRS), a well-validated mouse model of anxiety disorders. Genetic inhibition of vHPC astrocytes exerts anxiolytic effects on both innate and SRS-induced anxiety-related behaviors, whereas hM3Dq-mediated chemogenetic or SRS-induced activation of vHPC astrocytes enhances anxiety-like behaviors, which are reversed by intra-vHPC application of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Furthermore, intra-vHPC or systemic application of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, a U.S. FDA-approved drug for Alzheimer's disease, fully rescues SRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors. The findings highlight vHPC astrocytes as critical regulators of stress and anxiety and as potential therapeutic targets for anxiety and anxiety-related disorders.
   Astrocytes in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) display increased intracellular calcium levels in response to stress stimuli, leading to an ambient glutamate excess and enhanced anxiety behaviors. Disruption or enhancement of vHPC astrocytic calcium signals decreases or increases anxiety, respectively. In an anxiety mouse model, intra-vHPC or systemic application of antagonists for the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors rescues anxiety behaviors. image

AB  - Major depressive disorder, a prevalent and severe psychiatric condition, necessitates development of new and fast-acting antidepressants. Genetic suppression of astrocytic inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (Kir4.1) in the lateral habenula ameliorates depression-like phenotypes in mice. However, Kir4.1 remains an elusive drug target for depression. Here, we discovered a series of Kir4.1 inhibitors through high-throughput screening. Lys05, the most potent one thus far, effectively suppressed native Kir4.1 channels while displaying high selectivity against established targets for rapid-onset antidepressants. Cryogenic-electron microscopy structures combined with electrophysiological characterizations revealed Lys05 directly binds in the central cavity of Kir4.1. Notably, a single dose of Lys05 reversed the Kir4.1-driven depression-like phenotype and exerted rapid-onset (as early as 1 hour) antidepressant actions in multiple canonical depression rodent models with efficacy comparable to that of (S)-ketamine. Overall, we provided a proof of concept that Kir4.1 is a promising target for rapid-onset antidepressant effects.
   Zhou et al. developed a specific small-molecule inhibitor of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels, Lys05, which exerts rapid-onset antidepressant effects in rodents without unwanted side effects, indicating Kir4.1 as a promising drug target.

AB  - Influenza D virus (IDV) is a novel influenza virus, first isolated from swine with influenza-like symptoms in the USA in 2011. To date, IDV circulation has been reported in various animal species such as cattle, pigs, horses with the ability to expand its range of hosts. UV radiation has been widely used for the disinfection of various sources such as water, air, and surfaces, especially in places at greater risk of contamination by viruses and bacteria, such as hospitals and health facilities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential virucidal effect of a violet-blue light against IDV. Viral suspension of IDV was exposed to a violet-blue light (405 nm) for different times (radiant exposures): 22 min and 30 s (5.4 J/cm(2)), 45 min (10.8 J/cm(2)), 90 min (21.6 J/cm(2)), 180 min (43.2 J/cm(2)), and 360 min (86.4 J/cm(2)), and different temperatures (room temperature, 4 and 37 degrees C). At the end of exposure, virus titration was performed on MDCK cells. After violet-blue light exposure, a viral titre reduction proportional to exposure time was observed: 0.228 log(10) after 22 min and 30 s, 0.668 log(10) after 45 min, 0.940 log(10) after 90 min, 1.375 log(10) after 180 min and 2.293 log(10) after 360 min. Differences were observed among temperatures of exposure, with the greatest virucidal effect observed at room temperature. As reported for other respiratory viruses, this violet-blue light can potentially be used to reduce IDV spread in potentially hotspot areas for animals and humans.

AB  - The ostrich ( Struthio camelus ) is an important wild species highlighted in national and international livestock industry. This research was conducted to analyze the development of the ostrich respiratory system during fetal and embryonic stages. A total of 50 fertile ostrich eggs were collected from commercial farms and then incubated at 36.00- 37.00 & ring;C and 25.00 +/- 2.00% humidity for 40 days. Sections were taken on days 13, 22, 26, 30, 36, and 42 of incubation from the lung and the cranial, middle, and caudal parts of the neck after decapitation of ostrich embryos and blood drainage. After fixation, processing, blocking, and sectioning, all samples were stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin, Alcian Blue (AB), Van Gieson, and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) techniques. It was concluded that the trachea in the 13-day-old embryo and goblet cells (PAS-positive and AB-positive) had incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and differentiation of mesenchymal to the loose connective tissue. The bronchial stage of the lung was observed in the 22-day-old embryo, pseudoglandular stage in the 26day-old embryo, and parabrachial and air capillary stage in the 30-day-old embryo. The information obtained from this study will be useful for diagnosing pathologies affecting this vital system and results in improving industrial breeding management. (c) 2024 Urmia University.

AB  - The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is a major apolipoprotein receptor that regulates cholesterol homeostasis. LDLR deficiency is associated with cognitive impairment by the induction of synaptopathy in the hippocampus. Despite the close relationship between LDLR and neurodegenerative disorders, proteomics research for protein profiling in the LDLR knockout (KO) model remains insufficient. Therefore, understanding LDLR KO-mediated differential protein expression within the hippocampus is crucial for elucidating a role of LDLR in neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we conducted first-time proteomic profiling of hippocampus tissue from LDLR KO mice using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based MS analysis. LDLR deficiency induces changes in proteins associated with the transport of diverse molecules, and activity of kinase and catalyst within the hippocampus. Additionally, significant alterations in the expression of components in the major synaptic pathways were found. Furthermore, these synaptic effects were verified using a data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based proteomic method. Our data will serve as a valuable resource for further studies to discover the molecular function of LDLR in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Direct in vivo measurements of neurometabolic markers in the brain with high spatio-temporal resolution, sensitivity, and selectivity is highly important to understand neurometabolism. Electrochemical biosensors based on microelectrodes are very attractive analytical tools for continuous monitoring of neurometabolic markers, such as lactate and glucose in the brain extracellular space at resting and following neuronal activation. Here, we assess the merits of a platinized carbon fiber microelectrode (CFM/Pt) as a sensing platform for developing enzyme oxidase-based microbiosensors to measure extracellular lactate in the brain. Lactate oxidase was immobilized on the CFM/Pt surface by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The CFM/Pt-based lactate microbiosensor exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, good operational stability, and low dependence on oxygen, temperature, and pH. An array consisting of a glucose and lactate microbiosensors, including a null sensor, was used for concurrent measurement of both neurometabolic substrates in vivo in the anesthetized rat brain. Rapid changes of lactate and glucose were observed in the cortex and hippocampus in response to local glucose and lactate application and upon insulin-induced fluctuations of systemic glucose. Overall, these results indicate that microbiosensors are a valuable tool to investigate neurometabolism and to better understand the role of major neurometabolic markers, such as lactate and glucose.

AB  - Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) that causes lethal watery diarrhea in neonatal pigs and poses economic and public health burdens. Currently, there are no effective antiviral agents against PDCoV. Curcumin is the active ingredient extracted from the rhizome of turmeric, which has a potential pharmacological value because it exhibits antiviral properties against several viruses. Here, we described the antiviral effect of curcumin against PDCoV. At first, the potential relationships between the active ingredients and the diarrhea-related targets were predicted through a network pharmacology analysis. Twenty-three nodes and 38 edges were obtained using a PPI analysis of eight compound-targets. The action target genes were closely related to the inflammatory and immune related signaling pathways, such as the TNF signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and so on. Moreover, IL-6, NR3C2, BCHE and PTGS2 were identified as the most likely targets of curcumin by binding energy and 3D protein-ligand complex analysis. Furthermore, curcumin inhibited PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells at the time of infection in a dose-dependent way. In poly (I:C) pretreated LLC-PK1 cells, PDCoV reduced IFN-beta production via the RIG-I pathway to evade the host's antiviral innate immune response. Meanwhile, curcumin inhibited PDCoV-induced IFN-beta secretion by inhibiting the RIG-I pathway and reduced inflammation by inhibiting IRF3 or NF-kappa B protein expression. Our study provides a potential strategy for the use of curcumin in preventing diarrhea caused by PDCoV in piglets.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is presently one of the most public health critical concerns. The frequent and often incorrect use of antibiotics in animal husbandry has led to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in this setting. Wastewater from slaughterhouses can be contaminated with multidrug-resistant bacteria, representing a possible cross-contamination route. We evaluated the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wastewater samples from slaughterhouses located in an Italian region. Specifically, 18 slaughterhouses were included in the study. Of the tested samples, 40 bacterial strains were chosen, identified, and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., and Citrobacter spp. were the most detected genera. The most resistant strains were on average those belonging to Enterobacter spp. The highest resistance rate was recorded for macrolides. Among beta-lactams, penicillins and cephalosporins were by far the molecules towards which the highest resistance was detected. A very interesting finding is the difference found in strains detected in wastewater from poultry slaughterhouses, in which higher levels for almost all the considered drugs were detected compared to those from ungulates slaughterhouses. Our results indicate wastewater from slaughterhouses as a potential vehicle of resistant bacteria and highlight the importance of correct management of these kinds of waters.

AB  - To investigate the role of P2Y12 receptor-mediated microglia activation in delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning (DEACMP), we used static inhalation carbon monoxide to build DEACMP rat model. DEACMP rats were randomly assigned into DEACMP group and intervention group. A control goup was also set. The rats in intervention group received intraperitoneal injection of 100uM suramin (a P2Y12 receptor antagonist). In control group, the escape latency, level of microglia activation and ATP content were similar between different time points. In both DEACMP group and intervention group, the escape latency, level of microglia activation and ATP content were significanlty increased at 21th and 28th day. The hippocampal cells in DEACMP group and intervention group were severely and moderately, respectively, damaged at 21th and 28th day. Meanwhile, compared to control group, both DEACMP group and intervention group had significanlty longer escape latency, higher level of microglia activation and ATP content at 21th and 28th day. Compared to DEACMP group, the intervention group had significantly shorter escape latency and lower level of microglia activation at 21th and 28th day. These results suggested that the microglia activation regulated by ATP through P2Y12 receptor pathway might be closely related to the development of DEACMP.

AB  - Plant natural products are crucial in defending against herbivorous insects and are widely used in pest control, yet their mechanisms remain complex and insufficiently studied. This study employed a reverse strategy to investigate the mechanism of camptothecin (CPT), a botanical pesticide. By using a CPT-based chemical probe coupled with proteomic analysis, immune-related proteins, including those involved in prophenoloxidase (PPO) activation and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) synthesis, were identified in the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis. The findings demonstrated that CPT weakens insect immunity, primarily by inhibiting AMP synthesis rather than affecting PPO activation. Specifically, CPT downregulated the expression of genes in the IMD pathway and those encoding AMPs (attacin and gloverin). Additionally, CPT-fed insects exhibited reduced antibacterial activity.

AB  - The experience of hospitalization of a newborn in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) may become distressing both for the baby and parent. The study aimed to assess the degree of parental stress and coping strategies in parents giving KMC to their babies hospitalized in NICU compared to the control group parents not giving KMC. The prospective observational study enrolled a cohort of 337 parents of premature babies hospitalized in NICU in 2016 in Eastern Poland. The Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations were used. The level of stress in parents giving KMC was defined as low or moderate. Analysis confirmed its greater presence in the group of parents initiating KMC late (2-3 weeks) compared to those starting this initiative in week 1 of a child's life. An additional predictor of a higher level of stress in parents initiating KMC "late" was the hospital environment of a premature baby. Task oriented coping was the most common coping strategy in the study group. KMC and direct skin-to-skin contact of the parent with the baby was associated with a higher level of parental stress only initially and decreased with time and KMC frequency.

AB  - In China, Armillaria mellea (Vahl) P. Kumm. has been used as a folk medicine to treat insomnia for several hundred years. However, the underlying mechanisms involved are currently unknown. In this study, the anti-insomnia efficacy of A. mellea fermentation liquor (AFL) was evaluated in p-chlorophenylalanine-induced insomnia rats by measuring the serotonergic systems and gut microbiota. Our results demonstrate that all doses of AFL significantly reduced locomotor activity and alleviated decreasing weights in insomnia rats. Further, AFL exhibited better sedative effects by reducing sleep latency and increasing sleep duration in pentobarbital-treated rats. AFL treatment also elevated serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase levels, while reducing serum interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta levels. Furthermore, AFL alleviated insomnia by enhancing 5-hydroxytryptamine content and the expression 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, AFL treatment normalized the composition of gut microbiota in insomnia-model rats, while increasing relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Saccharimonadaceae restores the gut microbial ecosystem altered in insomnia rats. The experiments show that A. mellea alleviated insomnia by modulating serotonergic system and gut microbiota. Practical applications Insomnia has become a serious health issue of global concern. As a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, Armillaria mellea has been clinically employed in the treatment of insomnia for centuries in Asia with significant efficacy. In the present study, we firstly reported A. mellea fermentation liquor potentially relieved insomnia rats by alteration of gut microbiota and serotonergic systems and could guide future clinical studies. As a popular edible and medicinal mushroom, A. mellea also can be potentially used in the development and production of novel food products in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental stage and cryopreservation method have significant impact on the pregnancy rate after transfer of embryos produced in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pregnancy outcomes from ovine embryos cryopreserved at different developmental stages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryos at different developmental stages were obtained from donor ewes through simultaneous estrus treatment and laparoscopic artificial insemination. Embryos, either cryopreserved via vitrification or slow freezing method, were implanted into recipient ewes. The pregnancy rate was determined 35 days after transfer. RESULTS: The pregnancy rate of developing embryos increases after transfer from the morula stage, early blastocyst to expanded blastocyst stages (64.9%, 73.9% and 81.3%, respectively). However, cryopreservation significantly decreases the pregnancy rate of embryos at all three developmental stages, and there is no significant difference among developmental stages (43.9%, 43.7%, 52.9%, respectively). There is also no significant difference in the pregnancy rate between slowly-frozen embryos and vitrified embryos. CONCLUSION: The pregnancy outcomes of embryo transfer is better at the expanded blastocyst stage than at earlier stages. However, no difference is observed in the pregnancy rate of embryos at different developmental stage after cryopreservation, either by slow freezing and vitrification. Cryopreservation methods for ovine embryos, both slow freezing and vitrification, need further improvement.

AB  - Spiral artery remodeling is the process by which the uterine vessels become large bore low resistance conduits, allowing delivery of high volumes of maternal blood to the placenta to nourish the developing fetus. Failure of this process is associated with the pathophysiology of most of the major obstetric complications, including late miscarriage, fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. However, the point at which remodeling 'fails' in these pathological pregnancies is not yet clear. Spiral artery remodeling has predominantly been described in terms of its morphological features, however we are starting to understand more about the cellular and molecular triggers of the different aspects of this process. This review will discuss the current state of knowledge of spiral artery remodeling, in particular the processes involved in loss of the vascular smooth muscle cells, and consider where in the process defects would lead to a pathological pregnancy.

AB  - Identifying progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) and stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) plays a significant role in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, which can effectively boost the life quality of patients. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)- based methods using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) images have shown effective for AD identification. However, these CNN-based methods fail to effectively explore the feature extraction of disease-related multi-scale tissues, such as ventricles, hippocampi and cerebral cortex. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end disease-related attentional UNet framework (DAUF) for identifying pMCI and sMCI, by embedding a devised dual disease-related attention module (D2AM) and a novel tree-structured feature fusion classifier (TFFC). Specifically, D2AM leverages the complementarity between feature maps and attention maps and the complementary features from the encoder and decoder, so as to highlight discriminative semantic and detailed features. Additionally, TFFC is a powerfully joint multi-scale feature fusion and classification head, by employing the homogeneity among multi-scale features, so that the discriminative features of the multi-scale tissues are adequately fused for enhancing classification performance. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DAUF, with the effectiveness of D2AM and TFFC on identifying pMCI and sMCI subjects.

AB  - Muslims are prohibited from consuming products that contain pig products and their derivatives, including porcine gelatin. Medical and dental products are not exempt from the use of gelatin in their formulation. This study employs attenuated total reflectance -Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) to detect and distinguish between porcine and bovine gelatins in dental materials. The results were further verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Species-specific primers targeting the 212 bp porcine cytochrome b and 271 bp bovine cytochrome b genes were used to amplify DNA in nine dental material samples. Detection and distinction of gelatin standards (bovine and porcine) against gelatin present in the dental materials was achieved using ATR-FTIR combined with PCA within wavenumber 1756 cm-1-1584 cm-1 (Amide I and Amide II). The detection limit for DNA was 0.001 ng/mu L and 0.0001 ng/mu L for bovine and porcine gelatins, respectively. Using PCR, one sample, BDM 01, was found to contain both porcine and bovine DNA, while one sample (BDM 14) was found to be positive for bovine DNA. The findings suggest that ATR-FTIR combined with PCA and conventional PCR are applicable for the identification of porcine and bovine gelatin in dental materials.

AB  - Prestin (SLC26A5) promotes mechanical feedback via outer hair cells (OHC) within the organ of Corti, governed by voltage-dependent kinetics of its charge movements; namely, nonlinear-capacitance (NLC). We study NLC frequency response in mouse OHC membrane patches. The characteristic frequency cut-off (Fis) is 27 kHz. Single point mutations within prestin's chloride binding pocket (S396E and S398E) lack usual anion influence. In agreement, we show absence of anion binding in these mutants through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. NLC Fis in S396E knock-in mice is unaltered, indicating that high frequency activity is not governed by chloride but likely by viscoelastic loads. Also, the allosteric action of chloride does not underlie piezoelectric-like behavior in prestin, since tension sensitivity of S396E NLC is comparable to WT. Because structures of all studied species appear indistinguishable, with analogous chloride binding pockets, prestin performance likely evolved by modifying, not its protein-anion interaction, but instead mechanical loads on the protein.

Thyroxine (T4) administration has been shown to prevent the cognitive impairments induced by mTBI in mice but the mechanism is poorly understood. To understand the underlying mechanism, we carried out a single cell transcriptomic study to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of T4 on individual cell types in the hippocampus and frontal cortex at three post-injury stages in a mouse model of mTBI. We found that T4 treatment altered the proportions and transcriptomes of numerous cell types across tissues and timepoints, particularly oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, which are crucial for injury repair. T4 also reversed the expression of mTBI-affected genes such as Ttr, mt-Rnr2, , Ggn12, Malat1, Gnaq, and Myo3a, , as well as numerous pathways such as cell/energy/iron metabolism, immune response, nervous system, and cytoskeleton-related pathways. Cell-type specific network modeling revealed that T4 mitigated select mTBIperturbed dynamic shifts in subnetworks related to cell cycle, stress response, and RNA processing in oligodendrocytes. Cross cell-type ligand-receptor networks revealed the roles of App, Hmgb1, Fn1, and Tnf in mTBI, with the latter two ligands having been previously identified as TBI network hubs. mTBI and/or T4 signature genes were enriched for human genome-wide association study (GWAS) candidate genes for cognitive, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders related to mTBI. Our systems-level single cell analysis elucidated the temporal and spatial dynamic reprogramming of cell-type specific genes, pathways, and networks, as well as cell- cell communications as the mechanisms through which T4 mitigates cognitive dysfunction induced by mTBI.

AB  - The utilization of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) with entrapped fish oil (FO) loaded in collagen-based scaffolds for cutaneous wound healing using a porcine model is unique for the present study. Full-depth cutaneous excisions (5 x 5 cm) on the pig dorsa were treated with pure collagen scaffold (control, C), empty PLGA NPs (NP), FO, mupirocin (MUP), PLGA NPs with entrapped FO (NP/FO) and PLGA NPs with entrapped MUP (NP/MUP). The following markers were evaluated on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 post-excision: collagen, hydroxyproline (HP), angiogenesis and expressions of the COX2, EGF, COL1A1, COL1A3, TGFB1, VEGFA, CCL5 and CCR5 genes. The hypothesis that NP/FO treatment is superior to FO alone and that it is comparable to NP/MUP was tested. NP/FO treatment increased HP in comparison with both FO alone and NP/MUP (day 14) but decreased (p < 0.05) angiogenesis in comparison with FO alone (day 3). NP/FO increased (p < 0.05) the expression of the CCR5 gene (day 3) and tended (p > 0.05) to increase the expressions of the EGF (day 7, day 14), TGFB1 (day 21) and CCL5 (day 7, day 21) genes as compared with NP/MUP. NP/FO can be suggested as a suitable alternative to NP/MUP in cutaneous wound treatment.

TI  - Nuclear ribonucleoprotein RALY targets virus nucleocapsid protein and induces autophagy to restrict porcine epidemic diarrhea virus replication
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

KW  - EXPRESSION
KW  - INFECTION
AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea and dehydration in pigs and leads to great economic losses in the commercial swine industry. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of host response to viral infection remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism by which RALY, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, significantly promotes the degradation of the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, we identified an interaction between RALY and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (membrane-associated RINGCH 8), as well as the cargo receptor NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa), suggesting that RALY could suppress PEDV replication by degrading the viral N protein through a RALYMARCH8-NDP52-autophagosome pathway. Collectively, these results suggest a preventive role of RALY against PEDV infection via the autophagy pathway and open up the possibility of inducing RALY in vivo as an effective prophylactic and preventive treatment for PEDV infection.

AB  - Hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis are the hallmarks of metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious health risk. This study emphasizes how important gelsolin (GSN) is to the pathophysiology of MASH. The results show that GSN is significantly overexpressed in both MASH patients and animal models. Under MASH models, Gsn knockout (KO) (Gsn-/-) mice demonstrate exacerbated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, underscoring GSN's protective function. Remarkably, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated restoration of Gsn substantially alleviates these pathological features, indicating its therapeutic potential. Mechanistically, the absence of GSN leads to increased F-actin polymerization and heightened activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), thereby intensifying the inflammatory response. Subsequently, the experimental data identify a co-expression relationship between GSN and MDM2, and GSN is found to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of P53 via MDM2, a crucial process for liver protection. These findings imply that GSN is essential for controlling important molecular pathways in MASH by encouraging P53's MDM2-mediated degradation, which lessens the severity of hepatic steatosis. The research offers important new understandings of the molecular mechanisms of MASH and suggests GSN as a viable therapeutic target to reduce liver damage and preserve hepatic homeostasis.

AB  - Background Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. Though recent development in targeted therapy has improved NSCLC prognosis, yet there is an unmet need to identify novel causative factors and appropriate therapeutic regimen against NSCLCs. Methods and results In this study, we identify key molecular factors de-regulated in NSCLCs. Analyze their expression by real-time PCR and immunoblot; map their localization by immuno-fluorescence microscopy. We further propose an FDA approved drug, chloroquine (CQ) that affects the function of the molecular factors and hence can be repurposed as a therapeutic strategy against NSCLCs. Available NSCLC mutation data reflects a high probabilistic chance of patients harboring a p53 mutation, especially a gain of function (GOF)-R273H mutation. The GOF-P53 mutation enables the P53 protein to potentially interact with non-canonical protein partners facilitating oncogenesis. In this context, analysis of existing transcriptomic data from R273H-P53 expressing cells shows a concomitant up-regulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional targets and its protein partner TEAD1 in NSCLCs, suggesting a possible link between R273H-P53 and YAP. We therefore explored the inter-dependence of R273H-P53 and YAP in NSCLC cells. They were found to co-operatively regulate NSCLC proliferation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP and GOF-P53 resulted in sensitization of NSCLC cells. Further analysis of pathways controlled by GOF-P53 and YAP showed that they positively regulate the cellular homeostatic process- autophagy to mediate survival. We hence postulated that a modulation of autophagy might be a potent strategy to curb proliferation. In accordance to above, autophagy inhibition, especially with the FDA-approved drug- chloroquine (CQ) resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation and reduced transcriptional activity of GOF-P53 and YAP, leading to growth arrest of NSCLC cells. Conclusion Our study highlights the importance of GOF-P53 and YAP in NSCLC proliferation and proposes autophagy inhibition as an efficient strategy to attenuate NSCLC tumorigenesis.

AB  - Microplastic is an environmental hazard to which both animals and humans are exposed. Current reports show that it can cause inflammation, including in the gastrointestinal tract. To examine the impact on the ileum, 15 eight-week-old gilts (five individuals/group) were exposed to PET microplastics (7.6 mu m-416.9 mu m) at a dose of 0.1 g/day or 1 g/day for 28 days. The collected ileum fragments were investigated for the cytokine concentrations (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha; ELISA test), neuron populations (cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript, galanin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, substance P, vesicular acetylcholine transporter, and vasoactive intestinal peptide; immunofluorescence staining), and morphometric parameters (histological analysis). Under the influence of MP-PET, there was a reduction in the populations of CART- and GAL-positive neurons in the submucosal plexuses and of nNOS-, VAChT-, and VIP-positive neurons in all the plexuses. In contrast, there was an increase in GAL-positive neurons in the myenteric plexus and SP-positive neurons in all the plexuses. The concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha did not undergo statistically significant changes under the influence of the low or high dose of MP-PET. The changes in the histological structure exclusively concerned the thinning of the mucosa and the muscularis externa. The results support the thesis that MP-PET is not neutral to the ileal cells.

AB  - Maintaining an appropriate concentration of vitamin D is essential for the proper functioning of the body, regardless of age. Nowadays, there are more and more indications that vitamin D supplementation at higher than standard doses may show protective and therapeutic effects. Our study identified differences in the body's response to long-term supplementation with cholecalciferol at an increased dose. Two groups of pigs were used in the experiment. The first group received a standard dose of cholecalciferol (grower, 2000 IU/kg feed, and finisher, 1500 IU/kg feed), and the second group received an increased dose (grower, 3000 IU/kg feed, and finisher, 2500 IU/kg feed). After slaughter, lung samples were collected and used for RRBS and mRNA sequencing. Analysis of the methylation results showed that 2349 CpG sites had significantly altered methylation patterns and 1116 (47.51%) identified DMSs (Differentially Methylated Sites) were related to genes and their regulatory sites. The mRNA sequencing results showed a significant change in the expression of 195 genes. The integrated analysis identified eleven genes with DNA methylation and mRNA expression differences between the analyzed groups. The results of this study suggested that an increased vitamin D intake may be helpful for the prevention of lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis. These actions may stem from the influence of vitamin D on the expression of genes associated with collagen production, such as SHMT1, UGT1A6, and ITIH2.The anti-cancer properties of vitamin D are also supported by changes in KLHL3 and TTPA gene expression.

AB  - Hypercholesterolemia (Hch) is a risk factor for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, manifesting with symptoms that vary depending on damage to specific brain regions. Hch triggers inflammatory responses and cell death. However, the progression of these processes in relation to the duration of Hch and the location of pathology in the central nervous system remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate (1) the impact of age and duration of Hch on neuroinflammatory responses and programmed cell death in the brain and (2) the intensity of these processes in various brain areas during Hch. In this study, we used 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old male Apo E-/-/LDLR-/- double-knockout mice and age-matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice (control group). Concentrations of cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-4, and IL-6, as well as apoptotic mediators AIF and Cas-3, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the whole brain and separately in the prefrontal cortex (PFCx), hippocampus (HIP), and striatum (STR). The results showed that the Hch-induced release of cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6, decreased expression of IL-4, and elevated level of apoptotic markers AIF and Cas-3 correlated with Hch duration. The inflammatory response and expression of apoptotic markers were more pronounced in the HIP and STR compared to the PFCx. Our results indicate a correlation between the neurodegenerative effects of Hch and its duration and highlight the varying susceptibility of different brain areas to Hch-induced damage.Graphical AbstractHypercholesterolemia (Hch)-induced inflammatory response and programmed cell death activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFCx), hippocampus (HIP), and striatum (STR) of 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old, Apo E-/-/LDLR-/- double-knockout mice. In three age-groups the Hch-induced response involved release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 ss and IL-6), a decrease of anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokine level, and activation of programmed cell death markers (AIF and Cas-3). The inflammatory response and expression of apoptotic markers were more pronounced in the HIP and STR, compared to the PFCx.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring molecules found in various organisms that can help to defend against invading microorganisms and reduce the likelihood of drug resistance development. This study focused on the isolation of new AMPs from the genome library of a Gram-positive bacterium called Arthrobacter sp. H5. To achieve this, we used the Bacillus subtilis expression system and employed bioinformatics techniques to optimize and modify the peptides, resulting in the development of a new synthetic antimicrobial peptide (SAMP). Ap920 is expected to be a new antimicrobial peptide with a high positive charge (+12.5). Through optimization, a new synthetic antimicrobial peptide, Ap920-WI, containing only 15 amino acids, was created. Thereafter, the antimicrobial and antifungal activities of Ap920-WI were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the concentration for 50% of maximal effect (EC50). The Ap920-WI peptide was observed to target the outer membrane of fungal hyphae, leading to inhibition of growth in Rhizoctonia Solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Botrytis cinerea. In plants, Ap920-WI showed significant antifungal activity and inhibited the infestation of S. sclerotiorum on rape leaves. Importantly, Ap920-WI was found to be safe for mammalian cells since it did not show any hemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells. Overall, the study found that the new synthetic antimicrobial peptide Ap920-WI exhibits broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms and may offer a new solution for controlling plant diseases, as well as hold potential for drug development.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases leading to impairments in memory, orientation, and behavior. However, significant work is still needed to fully understand the progression of such disease and develop novel therapeutic agents for AD prevention and treatment. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have received attention in recent years due to their potential therapeutic effects on AD. The aim of this study was to determine the potential effect of sEVs in an in vitro model of AD. sEVs were isolated from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by asymmetric depth filtration, a method developed recently by us. AD was modeled in vitro using cells obtained from the hippocampi of newborn 5xFAD transgenic mice carrying mutations involved in familial AD. After isolation, sEVs underwent detailed characterization that included scanning electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, and Luminex assay. When added to 5xFAD hippocampal cells, sEVs were nontoxic, colocalized with neurons and astrocytes, decreased the level of A beta peptide, and increased the synaptic density. These results support the possibility that sEVs can improve brain cell function during aging, decrease the risk of AD, and potentially be used for AD therapeutics.

AB  - Aging induces cognitive decline, reduces of synaptic plasticity and increases oxidative reactive species (ROS) in the central nervous system. Traditional medicine has long benefitted from naturally occurring molecules such as curcumin (diferuloymethane). Curcumin is extracted from the plant Curcuma longa and is known for its synaptic and antioxidant-related benefits. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic curcumin treatment reduces cognitive and cellular effects of aging. Curcumin-treated mice showed improved learning and memory using the Morris Water Maze and novel object recognition task. In addition, using the Golgi-Cox stain, curcumin treatment increased spine density in all evaluated regions and increased dendritic arborization in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) layer 3 and CA3 subregion of the hippocampus. Moreover, chronic curcumin exposure increased synaptophysin and actin expression and reduced glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, a marker of astrocytes, in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 subregions), while simultaneously reducing the ROS-related molecule, metallothionein 3 expression in the PFC and hippocampus. Collectively, these novel findings suggest that curcumin reduces cognitive, neuronal and astrocytic signs of aging in mice.

AB  - Simple Summary Feed efficiency is generally associated with a considerable consumption of grains by ruminants. However, high-grain feeding may induce digestive problems in ruminant animals. The gradual adaptation to high-grain diets can be considered an effective strategy to reduce these issues. Free-oil supplementation in the adaptation diets of lambs is not common, but may smooth the transition from a high-forage to a high-grain diet, which was evaluated in this study. Lambs received diets without free-oil or containing palm or soybean oil (80 g/day) during and after the adaptation period. In lambs fed free-oil, particularly soybean oil, dry matter intake, daily weight gain, and ruminal pH increased, while concentrations of branched chain fatty acids in the rumen decreased, and the feed efficiency, as well as development of ruminal epithelia, improved compared with those fed the control diet. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of a maximum recommended oil supplementation on growth performance, eating behavior, ruminal fermentation, and ruminal morphological characteristics in growing lambs during transition from a low- to a high-grain diet. A total of 21 Afshari male lambs with an initial body weight (BW) of 41.4 +/- 9.1 kg (mean +/- SD) and at 5-6 months of age were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments (n = 7 per group), including (1) a grain-based diet with no fat supplement (CON), (2) CON plus 80 g/d of prilled palm oil (PALM), and (3) CON plus 80 g/d soybean oil (SOY); oils were equivalent to 50 g/kg of dry matter based on initial dry matter intake (DMI). All lambs were adapted to the high-grain diet for 21 d. In the adaptation period, lambs were gradually transferred to a dietary forage-to-concentrate ratio of 20:80 by replacing 100 g/kg of the preceding diet every 3 d. Thereafter, lambs were fed experimental diets for another 22 days. Fat-supplemented lambs had greater DMI, body weight (BW), and average daily gain (ADG), with a lower feed to gain ratio (p < 0.05), compared to CON lambs. The highest differences of DMI between fat-supplemented and CON-lambs were observed in week 3 of the adaptation period (p = 0.010). PALM- or SOY-supplementation lowered DM and NDF digestibility compared with CON (p < 0.05), and SOY caused the lowest organic matter (OM) digestibility compared with CON and PALM lambs (62.0 vs. 67.6 and 66.9; p < 0.05). Ruminal pH was higher for PALM and SOY compared with CON (p = 0.018). Lambs in SOY tended to have the highest ammonia-N concentrations (p = 0.075), together with a trend for higher concentrations of propionic acid, at the expense of acetic acid in ruminal fluid, on the last day of the adaptation period (diet x time, p = 0.079). Fat-supplemented lambs had lower isovaleric and valeric acid concentrations compared with CON on d 40 (diet x time, p < 0.05). PALM and SOY-fed lambs had a longer eating time (min/d and min/kg of DMI), chewing activity (min/d), meal frequency (n), and duration of eating the first and second meals after morning feeding (p < 0.05), and the largest meal size (p < 0.001). Fat supplemented lambs had greater ruminal papillary length (p < 0.05) and width (p < 0.01), and thicker submucosal, epithelial, and muscle layers, compared with the CON (p < 0.01). Blood metabolites were not influenced by dietary treatments (p > 0.05).
   The results from this study suggest that fat supplementation to high-grain diets may improve the development of ruminal epithelia and modify ruminal fermentation via optimized eating behavior or the direct effect of oils on the ruminal environment, resulting in better growth performance in growing lambs.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with Bacillus megaterium 1259 (BM1259) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood biochemical parameters in Holstein bull calves. The results demonstrated that the addition of BM1259 to the diets can significantly improve the growth performance and elevate the apparent digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber. Moreover, supplementation with BM1259 ameliorated rumen fermentation and reduced the emission of both ammoniacal nitrogen and sulfuretted hydrogen in feces and urine. In addition, adding 12 g/head/day of BM1259 had no adverse effect on blood biochemical parameters and the health status of Holstein bull calves. This study demonstrates that BM1259 can be applied as a potential microecologics to improve production performance and nitrogen utilization in Holstein bull calves. Bacillus megaterium is an ideal microecologics in the feed industry. BM1259 was already isolated from chicken manure and the whole-genome sequencing was also analyzed in our previous study. However, few studies concentrated on dietary supplementation with BM1259 in young ruminants and especially its effect on Holstein bull calves have not been reported. Hence, this experiment was conducted with the aim to evaluate the effects of BM1259 on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and blood biochemical parameters in Holstein bull calves. Twenty-four healthy Holstein bull calves with the initial age of 90 days old and a similar body weight (115 +/- 6.5 kg) were selected and randomly allocated into two groups with one Holstein bull calf in each pen (2.5 m x 2.2 m). Holstein bull calves in the control group (COG) were fed a basal total mixed ration (TMR), while experimental treatments (BMG) were fed with the TMR diet supplemented with 12 g/head/day of BM1259 powder (1 x 10(10) cfu/g) separately. Results showed that (1) the average daily gain and dry matter intake of the BMG were significantly higher than those of the COG (p < 0.01), increased by 12.5% and 8.79%, respectively, during the 4-8 weeks after the addition of 12 g/head/day of BM1259; from 0 to 8 weeks, ADG (p < 0.05) and DMI (p < 0.05) in the BMG were significantly higher than those in the COG, increased by 14.9% and 6.04%, respectively. (2) At the end of the fourth week, the apparent digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the BMG was significantly higher than that in the COG (p < 0.05), increased by 5.97% and 6.70%, respectively; at the end of the eighth week, the apparent digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber was significantly higher than that of the COG (p < 0.01), increased by 5.88% and 10.26%, respectively. (3) At the end of the eighth week, the rumen fluid pH (p < 0.05), MCP (p < 0.05), and acetate (p < 0.05) in the BMG were significantly higher than those in the COG, increased by 9.03%, 19.68%, and 12.74%, respectively; at the end of the fourth and eighth week, NH3-N concentration in the BMG was significantly lower than that in the COG, with a decrease of 21.81% and 16.40%, respectively. (4) At the end of the fourth (p < 0.05) and eighth week (p < 0.05), the glutamate content of the rumen fluid of the Holstein bull calves in the BMG was significantly higher than that in the COG, increased by 13.21% and 14.32%, respectively; at the end of the fourth week, the contents of glutamate in the serum (p < 0.05), urine (p < 0.05), and feces (p < 0.
   05) of the Holstein bull calves in the BMG were significantly lower than those in the COG, decreased by 25.76%, 33.87%, and 9.23%, respectively; at the end of the eighth week, the contents of glutamate in the serum, urine, and feces of the Holstein bull calves in the BMG were significantly lower than those in the COG (p < 0.01), decreased by 26.69%, 27.94%, and 11.11%, respectively. (5) After adding 12 g/head/day of BM1259, the urine ammonia-nitrogen content of the BMG was extremely significantly lower than that of the COG at the end of the fourth and eighth week (p < 0.01), decreased by 54.60% and 40.31%, respectively. (6) After adding 12 g/head/day of BM1259, there was no significant effect on the level of blood biochemical parameters of the Holstein bull calves. This study demonstrates that BM1259 can be applied as a potential microecologics to improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation, and nitrogen utilization in Holstein bull calves.

AB  - Life stress can shorten lifespan and increase risk for aging-related diseases, but the biology underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Here we assessed the effect of chronic stress on cellular senescence-a hallmark of aging. Exposure to restraint stress, a psychological non-social stress model, increased p21Cip1 exclusively in the brains of male, but not female mice, and in a p16Ink4a-independent manner. Conversely, exposure to chronic subordination stress (only males were tested) increased key senescent cell markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, adipose tissue and brain, in a p16Ink4a-dependent manner. p16Ink4a-positive cells in the brain of chronic subordination stress-exposed mice were primarily hippocampal and cortical neurons with evidence of DNA damage that could be reduced by p16Ink4a cell clearance. Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive cells was not sufficient to ameliorate the adverse effects of social stress on measured metrics of healthspan. Overall, our findings indicate that social stress induces an organ-specific and p16Ink4a-dependent accumulation of senescent cells, illuminating a fundamental way by which the social environment can contribute to aging.

AB  - The synovium is a loose connective tissue that separates the intra-articular (IA) joint compartments of all diarthrodial joints from the systemic circulation. It can be divided into two layers: the intima, a thin and cell-dense layer atop a more heterogeneous subintima, composed of collagen and various cell types. The subintima contains penetrating capillaries and lymphatic vessels that rapidly clear injected drugs from the joint space which may vary not only with drug size and charge but also with the microstructure and composition of the intima and subintima of the synovium. Prior work has measured the mechanical properties and solute diffusivities in the synovium of porcine, bovine, and human joints. Here, we measured the Young's moduli of synovium from smaller joints of the rat knee, as well as pig and human, using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The format for AFM enabled testing of intima and subintimal regions of synovium in all three species. The Young's moduli of the subintimal regions were similar across all three species (1-1.5 kPa). Furthermore, there was little evidence of differences in Young's moduli between synovium from the intima and subintima in each species. A general similarity of data from AFM testing with moduli measured with bulk testing of pig and human synovium suggests that AFM can be useful to measure the mechanical properties of smaller joint synovium and spatial variations in stiffness with depth. Enzymatic digestion of synovium tissue from the pig was also performed with findings of lower moduli values following treatment with chondroitinase ABC but not collagenase. Although the molecular composition of the synovium is not yet fully characterized and may vary across species, these findings suggest that noncollagenous species contribute to AFM-measured properties in synovium. These are some of the first data to measure mechanical properties in small joint synovium and will be useful in models studying IA drug clearances in joints with pathology and following treatment.
   Impact Statement This study measured the mechanical properties of human, porcine, and rat synovium using atomic force microscopy. Such observations will allow us to better understand solute and fluid transport through synovium in animal models of intra-articular drug delivery.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may target epitopes that reduce durability or increase the potential for escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Using synthetic vaccinology, we have developed rationally immune-focused SARS-CoV-2 Spike-based vaccines. Glycans can be employed to alter antibody responses to infection and vaccines. Utilizing computational modeling and in vitro screening, we have incorporated glycans into the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and assessed antigenic profiles. We demonstrate that glycan-coated RBD immunogens elicit stronger neutralizing antibodies and have engineered seven multivalent configurations. Advanced DNA delivery of engineered nanoparticle vaccines rapidly elicits potent neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, hamsters, and multiple mouse models, including human ACE2 and human antibody repertoire transgenics. RBD nanoparticles induce high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies against variants of concern with durable titers beyond 6 months. Single, low-dose immunization protects against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Single-dose coronavirus vaccines via DNA-launched nanoparticles provide a platform for rapid clinical translation of potent and durable coronavirus vaccines.

AB  - Although calcineurin inhibitors are very effective as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation, complete graft acceptance remains as a challenge. Transfer of genes with immunosuppressant functions could contribute to improving the clinical evolution of transplantation. In this sense, hydrodynamic injection has proven very efficacious for liver gene transfer. In the present work, the hIL-10 gene was hydrofected 'ex vivo' to pig livers during the bench surgery stage, to circumvent the cardiovascular limitations of the procedure, in a model of porcine orthotopic transplantation with a 10-day follow-up. We used IL-10 because human and porcine proteins can be differentially quantified and for its immunomodulatory pleiotropic functions. Safety (biochemical parameters and histology), expression efficacy (RNA transcription and blood protein expression), and acute inflammatory response (cytokines panel) of the procedure were evaluated. The procedure proved safe as no change in biochemical parameters was observed in treated animals, and human IL-10 was efficaciously expressed, with stationary plasma protein levels over 20 pg/mL during the follow-up. Most studied cytokines showed increments (interferon-alpha, IFN-alpha; interleukin-1 beta, IL-1 beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF alpha; interleukin-6, IL-6; interleukin-8, IL-8; interleukin-4, IL-4; and transforming growth factor-beta, TGF-beta) in treated animals, without deleterious effects on tissue. Collectively, the results support the potential clinical interest in this gene therapy model that would require further longer-term dose-response studies to be confirmed.

AB  - Simple Summary Diarrhea and vomiting caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) F17 are considered significant threats to animal farming. In the present study, RNA-Seq was performed to investigate the potential circRNA and miRNA biomarkers for E. coli F17-antagonism (AN) and -sensitive (SE) lambs. The results indicated that circRNA and miRNA expression is closely associated with the susceptibility of E. coli F17 in lambs. Numbers of circRNAs and miRNAs may serve as potential biomarkers for intestinal inflammatory response against E. coli F17 infection. Our study can provide a preliminary understanding of the underlying mechanisms of intestinal immunity. It has long been recognized that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major pathogen responsible for vomiting and diarrhea. E. coli F17, a main subtype of ETEC, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality in young livestock. However, the transcriptomic basis underlying E. coli F17 infection has not been fully understood. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the expression profiles of circRNAs and miRNAs in the jejunum of E. coli F17-antagonism (AN) and -sensitive (SE) lambs. A total of 16,534 circRNAs and 271 miRNAs (125 novel miRNAs and 146 annotated miRNAs) were screened, and 214 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and 53 DE miRNAs were detected between the AN and SE lambs (i.e., novel_circ_0025840, novel_circ_0022779, novel_miR_107, miR-10b). Functional enrichment analyses showed that source genes of DE circRNAs were mainly involved in metabolic-related pathways, while target genes of DE miRNAs were mainly enriched in the immune response pathways. Then, a two-step machine learning approach combining Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (candidates were first selected by RF and further assessed by XGBoost) was performed, which identified 44 circRNAs and 39 miRNAs as potential biomarkers (i.e., novel_circ_0000180, novel_circ_0000365, novel_miR_192, oar-miR-496-3p) for E. coli infection. Furthermore, circRNA-related and lncRNA-related ceRNA networks were constructed, containing 46 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing triplets and 630 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing triplets, respectively. By conducting a serious of bioinformatic analyses, our results revealed important circRNAs and miRNAs that could be potentially developed as candidate biomarkers for intestinal inflammatory response against E. coli F17 infection; our study can provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of intestinal immunity.

AB  - Simple Summary Antibiotics are essential compounds to cope with bacterial infections. However, their inadequate and excessive use has triggered the rapid arising of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. In this scenario, immunostimulants, which are molecules that boost the immune system, open up a new approach to face this problem, enhancing treatment efficacy and preventing infections by immune system response. Cytokines are central effector molecules of the immune system, and their recombinant production and administration in animals could be an interesting immune modulation strategy. The aim of this study was the development of a highly stable nanoparticle of porcine cytokines to achieve the immunostimulation of intestinal mucosa in piglets. The outcomes of the present study prove this approach is able to stimulate swine intestinal cells and macrophages in vitro and tends to modulate inflammatory responses in vivo, although further studies are required to definitively evaluate their potential in animals. Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat that is worryingly rising in the livestock sector. Among the proposed strategies, immunostimulant development appears an interesting approach to increase animal resilience at critical production points. The use of nanoparticles based on cytokine aggregates, called inclusion bodies (IBs), has been demonstrated as a new source of immunostimulants in aquaculture. Aiming to go a step further, the objective of this study was to produce cytokine nanoparticles using a food-grade microorganism and to test their applicability to stimulate intestinal mucosa in swine. Four cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) involved in inflammatory response were produced recombinantly in Lactococcus lactis in the form of protein nanoparticles (IBs). They were able to stimulate inflammatory responses in a porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2) and alveolar macrophages, maintaining high stability at low pH and high temperature. In addition, an in vivo assay was conducted involving 20 piglets housed individually as a preliminary exploration of the potential effects of IL-1 beta nanoparticles in piglet intestinal mucosa after a 7 d oral administration. The treated animals tended to have greater levels of TNF-alpha in the blood, indicating that the tested dose of nanoparticles tended to generate an inflammatory response in the animals. Whether this response is sufficient to increase animal resilience needs further evaluation.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of substituting zinc oxide with terminalia chebula extract (TCE) on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune function, and intestinal health in weaned pigs. Initially, 72 weaned Duroc x Landrace x Large White piglets, 28 days old with an initial weight of 7.43 +/- 0.14 kg, equally divided by gender, were randomly assigned into three groups, with six replicates and four piglets per replicate. They were fed a basal diet (CON group), a diet containing 2 g/kg zinc oxide (ZnO group), or 2 g/kg TCE (TCE group) for a duration of 28 days. Subsequently, to further confirm the most appropriate levels of TCE in piglets, 96 piglets of the same breeds and age, with an initial weight of 7.42 +/- 0.12 kg, also equally divided by gender, were randomly assigned into four groups, each with six replicates and four piglets per replicate, and fed a basal diet (CON group), or diets supplemented with 1 g/kg TCE (LTCE group), 2 g/kg TCE (MTCE group), or 4 g/kg TCE (HTCE group) for a duration of 28 days. The results demonstrated that both TCE and ZnO reduced diarrhea rates (p = 0.001) and enhanced average daily gain (ADG) (p = 0.014) compared to the control group. TCE at 1 g/kg and 4 g/kg reduced the feed to gain ratio (p = 0.050). Dietary supplementing with TCE and ZnO increased serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) (p = 0.020). Various doses of TCE also increased jejunal IgA (p = 0.000) levels and IL-10 expression (p = 0.004), and decreased the levels of TNF-alpha in both serum (p = 0.043) and jejunal mucosa (p = 0.000). Notably, TCE reduced the crypt depth (CD) of the duodenal (p = 0.007) and increased the villus height (VH) of the ileal (p = 0.045), and with increased dosage, there was a rise in the villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD) in the duodenum (p = 0.000) and jejunum (p = 0.001). Higher abundances of Lactobacillaceae (p = 0.000) and lower levels of Streptococcaceae (p = 0.000) and Peptostreptococcaceae (p = 0.035) in cecal contents were fed the ZnO and TCE pigs compared with CON pigs. Therefore, TCE was firstly presented as being able to replace zinc oxide, improve intestinal morphology, and enhance antioxidant and immune functions, thus safeguarding intestinal mucosal health and promoting piglet growth.

AB  - Cytokines secreted by individual immune cells regulate tissue regeneration and allow communication between various cell types. Cytokines bind to cognate receptors and trigger the healing process. Determining the orchestration of cytokine interactions with their receptors on their cellular targets is essential to fully understanding the process of inflammation and tissue regeneration. To this end, we have investigated the interactions of Interleukin-4 cytokine (IL-4)/Interleukin-4 cytokine receptor (IL-4R) and Interleukin-10 cytokine (IL-10)/Interleukin-10 cytokine receptor (IL-10R) using in situ Proximity Ligation Assays in a regenerative model of skin, muscle and lung tissues in the mini-pig. The pattern of protein-protein interactions was distinct for the two cytokines. IL-4 bound predominantly to receptors on macrophages and endothelial cells around the blood vessels while the target cells of IL-10 were mainly receptors on muscle cells. Our results show that in situ studies of cytokine-receptor interactions can unravel the fine details of the mechanism of action of cytokines.

AB  - Depression is a complex and common mental illness affecting physical and psychological health. Panax ginseng C. A. Mey is a traditional Chinese medicine with abundant pharmacological activity and applications in regulating mood disorders. 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol is the major intestinal metabolite of ginsenoside and one of the active components in ginseng. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol on neuronal damage and depression, which may involve mitochondrial dynamics. However, the mechanism underlying the antidepressant effects of 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol is unelucidated. In the present study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the antidepressant activity of 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol by employing a corticosterone-induced HT22 cellular model and a chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)-induced animal model in combination with a network pharmacology approach. In vitro, the results showed that 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol ameliorated the corticosterone (CORT)-induced decrease in HT22 cell viability, decrease in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels, and increase in nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Furthermore, 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol exerted improvement effects on the CORT-induced increase in HT22 cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. In vivo, the results showed that 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol ameliorated depressive symptoms and hippocampal neuronal damage in CUMS mice, and sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-1-Alpha (PGC-1 alpha) activity were activated in the hippocampus of mice, thereby alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria. In both in vivo and in vitro models, after inhibiting SIRT1 expression, the protective effect of 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol on mitochondria was significantly weakened, and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial division was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that 20 (S)-Protopanaxadiol may exert neuroprotective and antidepressant effects by attenuating DRP1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by modulating the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway.

AB  - We focused on investigation of E. coli infection influence on the turnover and apoptosis of intestinal mucosa. We have verified changes in proliferation and apoptosis in epithelial lining as well as in lamina propria of jejunum and colon of germ-free (GF) piglets as healthy control group and GF piglets in which at 5th day their gut was colonized with E. coli bacteria (ECK group). According to our results we detected significant increase in proliferation of the epithelial cells only in the jejunum of the ECK group, indicating a higher sensitivity to colonization with E. coli. Significant changes in the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry of other studied markers (TNF-alpha, Caspase-3 and HSP-70) were noted only in the lamina propria mucosae of both intestinal segments in the ECK group. In conclusion, we found that the commensal gut microbiota plays a role in regulation of the turnover rate in the epithelial lining, but also in the cells in the lamina propria mucosae in both intestinal segments, and that the host response is dependent on the colonising bacteria.

AB  - Increasing evidences highlight the role of vasopressin (AVP) in the regulation of metabolic functions and the association between hydration state and metabolic disorders. Supraoptic nuclei (SON) neurons are particularly sensitive to metabolic changes, as shown by the loss of plasma AVP rhythmicity during diabetes. We aimed in this work to determine the effect of high energy (HE) feeding on SON clock functioning in Psammomys obesus, a desert herbivore rodent in which metabolic syndrome is nutritionally induced. Animals were subjected to either normal or HE feeding for 3 months. Immunohistochemical study indicates that AVP and the circadian transcription factor CLOCK profiles follow daily oscillations with higher content in the beginning of the rest period in control group fed with low energy (LE) diet. Our data show that HE feeding induces critical changes through impairment of daily AVP and CLOCK cycling in the SON. These findings show clearly that SON clockwork is altered by HE diet-induced metabolic changes. Further studies are needed to better understand SON neurons responses to metabolic derangement.

AB  - Simple Summary Whether a vocalization is emitted though the mouth or nose impacts on its acoustic shape through specific vocal tract resonances. In human language, nasalized compared to oral vowels can change the meaning of words. African elephants mainly use low-frequency rumbles to communicate and can utter them either through the mouth or trunk. In this study, we used an acoustic camera to visualize the sound emission of rumbles in Asian elephants, which have been studied considerably less than African elephants. We recorded nine captive female Asian elephants and analyzed the acoustic structure of 203 calls. We found that most rumbles (64%) were emitted through the trunk, 21% through the mouth, and surprisingly, 13% simultaneously through the mouth and trunk. Some of the rumbles were combined with orally emitted roars. The nasal rumbles concentrated most spectral energy in lower frequencies, whereas the oral and mixed rumbles showed a broader spectral energy distribution and concentration in higher frequencies, and were louder. The roars were the loudest, broadest and highest in frequency. This study is the first to demonstrate coupled oral and nasal emission in a non-human animal, thereby setting an important framework to study the functions of this acoustic variability in elephant communication and the evolution of vocal flexibility across species. Sound production mechanisms set the parameter space available for transmitting biologically relevant information in vocal signals. Low-frequency rumbles play a crucial role in coordinating social interactions in elephants' complex fission-fusion societies. By emitting rumbles through either the oral or the three-times longer nasal vocal tract, African elephants alter their spectral shape significantly. In this study, we used an acoustic camera to visualize the sound emission of rumbles in Asian elephants, which have received far less research attention than African elephants. We recorded nine adult captive females and analyzed the spectral parameters of 203 calls, including vocal tract resonances (formants). We found that the majority of rumbles (64%) were nasally emitted, 21% orally, and 13% simultaneously through the mouth and trunk, demonstrating velopharyngeal coupling. Some of the rumbles were combined with orally emitted roars. The nasal rumbles concentrated most spectral energy in lower frequencies exhibiting two formants, whereas the oral and mixed rumbles contained higher formants, higher spectral energy concentrations and were louder. The roars were the loudest, highest and broadest in frequency. This study is the first to demonstrate velopharyngeal coupling in a non-human animal. Our findings provide a foundation for future research into the adaptive functions of the elephant acoustic variability for information coding, localizability or sound transmission, as well as vocal flexibility across species.

AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been widely used in pharmaceutical applications due to their advantages of higher drug loading, controllable drug release, high stability, biodegradability, biocompat-ibility, and generally lower toxicity. This review presents state-of-the-art advancement in the context of utilizing 2D nanomaterials for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The core patho-logical features of AD include amyloid plaques formed by amyloid beta protein (A beta) aggregation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and the self-assemble of A beta peptides into beta-sheet-rich aggregates. Early and accurate detection of AD biomarkers provide potential means for its diagnosis and treatment. Studies have indicated that 2D nanomaterials can significantly improve the detection accuracy and speci-ficity of AD biomarkers (such as A beta protein, tau protein, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Acetylcholine (ACh), MicroRNAs, and S100 beta protein). In the treatment of AD, inhibiting the aggregation of A beta and transform-ing the beta-sheet structure of A beta aggregates into harmless structures has been proved to be the effective strategies. 2D nanomaterials have application potential in the treatment of AD because they can degrade A beta peptides or inhibit A beta peptide aggregation through photodynamic or photothermal effects. However, most of the in vivo cytotoxicity mediated by nanomaterials has not yet been resolved. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after anesthesia/surgery, especially among elderly patients, and poses a significant threat to their postoperative quality of life and overall well-being. While it is widely accepted that elderly patients may experience POCD following anesthesia/surgery, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that the interaction between silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is crucial in controlling cognitive function and is strongly linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this research aims to explore how SIRT1/BDNF impacts cognitive decline caused by anesthesia/surgery in aged mice.Methods Open field test (OFT) was used to determine whether anesthesia/surgery affected the motor ability of mice, while the postoperative cognitive function of 18 months old mice was evaluated with Novel object recognition test (NORT), Object location test (OLT) and Fear condition test (FC). The expressions of SIRT1 and other molecules were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The hippocampal synaptic plasticity was detected by Golgi staining and Long-term potentiation (LTP). The effects of SIRT1 and BDNF overexpression as well as chemogenetic activation of glutamatergic neurons in hippocampal CA1 region of 18 months old vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) mice on POCD were further investigated.Results The research results revealed that older mice exhibited cognitive impairment following intramedullary fixation of tibial fracture. Additionally, a notable decrease in the expression of SIRT1/BDNF and neuronal excitability in hippocampal CA1 glutamatergic neurons was observed. By increasing levels of SIRT1/BDNF or enhancing glutamatergic neuron excitability in the CA1 region, it was possible to effectively mitigate synaptic plasticity impairment and ameliorate postoperative cognitive dysfunction.Conclusions The decline in SIRT1/BDNF levels leading to changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability in older mice could be a significant factor contributing to cognitive impairment after anesthesia/surgery.

AB  - C. burnetii is a widespread pathogen, causing abortions and reproductive disorders in ruminants. The study aimed to evaluate animal reproductive capacity and productivity after abortion, related and unrelated to C. burnetii. We compared data about the abortion time, the outcome of the animals after an abortion, further reproduction, and productivity for C. burnetii-positive (n = 148) and C. burnetii-negative (n = 149) aborted dairy cows and heifers. C. burnetii-positive animals had a positive serological response or presence of C. burnetii DNA at the time of abortion. C. burnetii-positive animals had a significantly higher number of lactations at the time of abortion. However, in the other indicators, we observed no significant differences between the groups. Comparing indicators of all the aborted animals, we found that if animals started a new lactation after abortion, they had a significantly lower milk yield, lower fat, protein, and somatic cell counts (SCCs) in milk during the standard lactation for both primiparous and multiparous cows compared to herd averages in each group. Lower SCCs can be due to animals with a high SCC being culled earlier. We found an economic disadvantage to aborting, not only because of the loss of offspring, but also because of the high culling rate and lower productivity in both primiparous and multiparous cows.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical contributor to age-related functional declines in skeletal muscle and brain. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and function during aging. While skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of PGC-1 alpha is known to mimic exercise-induced benefits in young animals, its chronic systemic effects on aging tissues remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the lifelong impact of skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha overexpression on mitochondrial health, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cognitive function in aged mice. We established three experimental groups: young wild-type mice (3-4 months old), aged wild-type mice (25-27 months old), and aged mice with skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha overexpression (24-27 months old). In skeletal muscle, aging led to significant reductions in mitochondrial biogenesis markers, including PGC-1 alpha, FNDC5, and mtDNA content. PGC-1 alpha overexpression reversed this decline, elevating the expression of PGC-1 alpha, SIRT1, LONP1, SDHA, CS, TFAM, eNOS, and mtDNA levels, suggesting preserved mitochondrial biogenesis. However, FNDC5 and SIRT3 were paradoxically suppressed, indicating potential compensatory feedback mechanisms. PGC-1 alpha overexpression also enhanced anabolic signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6, and reduced FOXO1 expression, favoring a muscle growth-promoting environment. Moreover, aging impaired mitochondrial dynamics by downregulating MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, FIS1, and PINK1. While PGC-1 alpha overexpression did not restore fusion-related proteins, it further reduced fission-related protein and enhanced mitophagy proteins, as evidenced by increased PINK1 phosphorylation. In contrast, in the hippocampus, muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha overexpression exacerbated age-associated mitochondrial biogenesis decline. Expression levels of key mitochondrial markers, including PGC-1 alpha, SIRT1, CS, FNDC5, Cytochrome C, and TFAM, were further reduced compared to aged wild-type controls. mTOR phosphorylation was also significantly suppressed, whereas cognition-related proteins (BDNF, VEGF, eNOS) and performance in behavioral tests remained unchanged. Importantly, skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha overexpression triggered pronounced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in both skeletal muscle and the hippocampus. In skeletal muscle, elevated levels of protein carbonyls, I kappa B-alpha, NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, SOD2, and NRF2 were observed, accompanied by a reduction in the DNA repair enzyme OGG1. Notably, similar patterns were detected in the hippocampus, including increased expression of protein carbonyls, iNOS, NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha, SOD2, GPX1, and NRF2, alongside decreased OGG1 levels. These findings suggest that the overexpression of PGC-1 alpha in skeletal muscle may have contributed to systemic oxidative stress and inflammation.

AB  - Neurons are polarized and typically extend multiple dendrites and one axon. To maintain polarity, vesicles carrying dendritic proteins are arrested upon entering the axon. To determine whether kinesin regulation is required for terminating anterograde axonal transport, we overexpressed the dendrite -selective kinesin KIF13A. This caused mistargeting of dendrite -selective vesicles to the axon and a loss of dendritic polarity. Polarity was not disrupted if the kinase MARK2/Par1b was coexpressed. MARK2/Par1b is concentrated in the proximal axon, where it maintains dendritic polarity-likely by phosphorylating S1371 of KIF13A, which lies in a canonical 14-3-3 binding motif. We probed for interactions of KIF13A with 14-3-3 isoforms and found that 14-3-3 beta and 14-3-3 zeta bound KIF13A. Disruption of MARK2 or 14-3-3 activity by small molecule inhibitors caused a loss of dendritic polarity. These data show that kinesin regulation is integral for dendrite -selective transport. We propose a new model in which KIF13A that moves dendrite -selective vesicles in the proximal axon is phosphorylated by MARK2. Phosphorylated KIF13A is then recognized by 14-3-3, which causes dissociation of KIF13A from the vesicle and termination of transport. These findings define a new paradigm for the regulation of vesicle transport by localized kinesin tail phosphorylation, to restrict dendrite -selective vesicles from entering the axon.

AB  - General anesthetic exposure during pregnancy has neurotoxic effects on the developing brain, causing long-term cognitive dysfunction in the offspring. Sevoflurane exposure during mid-gestation results in premature differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), being the crucial factor affecting normal hippocampal functions and contributing to neurocognitive impairment. However, the related molecular mechanism remains unclear. For in vivo assays, pregnant rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane once on gestational day 14 (G14) or 3 times on G13, 14, and 15 (2 h per day). For in vitro assays, primary rat NSCs were isolated from fetal hippocampus tissues at 24 and 72 h after birth and on postnatal day 28. NSCs were transfected with GRIN2B or KIF17 overexpression plasmids before exposure to 4.1% sevoflurane for one or three consecutive days (2 h per day). Multiple sevoflurane exposures during the mid-trimester triggered NSC premature differentiation and decreased GRIN2B and KIF17 expression in the hippocampus of offspring rats and primary rat NSCs. GRIN2B or KIF17 overexpression attenuated sevoflurane-induced NSC premature differentiation. GRIN2B interacted with KIF17, and KIF17 silencing reversed the inhibition of GRIN2B overexpression on NSC early differentiation. GRIN2B alleviates NSC premature differentiation induced by repeated mid-gestational sevoflurane exposure via interaction with KIF17.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of lactic acid bacteria inoculation on the fermentation profile and nutritional value of BRS Capia & ccedil;u elephant grass silages harvested at two regrowth ages. The treatments were arranged in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme, with five inoculants (I) and two regrowth ages (A, 90 and 105 days), in a completely randomized design, with three replicates. There were I x A interactions (p < 0.05) on pH, acetic acid, and water-soluble carbohydrates. The silage treated with Kera-Sil showed a lower pH compared with the control silage. The highest ammonia nitrogen content was recorded in the silage treated with Yakult (R). There were I x A interactions (p < 0.05) on the dry matter (DM) content, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in vitro digestibility of DM (IVDMD) and NDF (IVNDFD). Silages treated with Kera-Sil and Silo-Max at 90 days of regrowth showed a higher DM and higher IVDMD (p < 0.05). A higher NDF content and lower IVDMD and IVNDFD were recorded in silages produced with grass harvested at 105 days of regrowth (p < 0.05). The use of commercial microbial inoculants improved the fermentative and nutritional parameters of the silages.

AB  - Cosmetic silicone implants for breast reconstruction often lead to medical complications, such as abnormally excessive fibrosis driven by foreign body granulomatous inflammation. The purpose of this study was to develop a silicone breast implant capable of local and controlled release of a glucocorticoid drug triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for the prevention of silicone-breast-implant-induced fibrosis in a Yorkshire pig model (in vivo). Implants were dip-coated in a TA solution to load 1.85 mu g/cm(2) of TA in the implant shell, which could release the drug in a sustained manner for over 50 days. Immunohistochemical analysis for 12 weeks showed a decline in tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression, capsule thickness, and collagen density by 82.2%, 55.2%, and 32.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the counts of fibroblasts, macrophages, and myofibroblasts in the TA-coated implants were drastically reduced by 57.78%, 48.8%, and 64.02%, respectively. The TA-coated implants also lowered the expression of vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin proteins, the major profibrotic fibroblast and myofibroblast markers, respectively. Our findings suggest that TA-coated silicone breast implants can be a promising strategy for safely preventing fibrosis around the implants.

AB  - Simple SummaryGrowth is an important factor in animal production. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in human foods have been shown to have health benefits. Dietary manipulation strategies such as the inclusion of oilseeds in diets have been used to enhance the FA profile of sheep meat. Chia seeds are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. This study investigated the effect of increasing the amount of dietary chia seeds on lamb growth performance and changes in the fatty acid profile of the meat. The inclusion of chia seeds in lambs' diets to feed lambs increased the bodyweight of neither the meat carcasses nor the non-meat components. However, it tended to increase the oleic acid and decrease stearic acid in the meat (Longissimus thoracis).The aim of this work was to supplement a diet with chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) based on the requirements of finishing lambs for meat, and to analyze biometric parameters and fatty acid profiles in meat. Eighteen male Rambouillet lambs with a bodyweight of 25 kg were used. Animals were kept in individual pens with water and feed provided ad libitum. Three finishing diets were designed with the inclusion of 0, 50 and 100 g dry matter chia seeds and divided among the animals (n = 6). The experimental period lasted 60 days. The weights of the individual lambs were recorded every 14 days. At the end of the experiment, the animals were slaughtered and the weights of the hot carcasses and non-meat components were registered. In addition, an analysis of the fatty acid composition was carried out in the muscles (Longissimus thoracis). The total weight gain and average daily gain displayed significant differences (p < 0.05). Initial and final bodyweights, such as the dry matter intake, did not display differences. The fatty acid profile of the meat tended to decrease the SFA (stearic acid) and increase MUFA (oleic acid) (p < 0.0001) when chia seeds were added to the lamb diets. In conclusion, chia seed supplementation did not increase meat production or other biometric parameters; however, it modified the fatty acid profile in L. thoracis.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze whether taurine has a nootropic effect on short-term and long-term memory in a model of sporadic dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Moreover, we evaluated the immunoreactivity and insulin receptor (IR) distribution and markers for neurons and glial cells in the hippocampus of rats with SDAT and treated with taurine. For this, Male Wistar rats received STZ (ICV, 3 mg/kg, bilateral, 5ul per site, aCFS vehicle) and were treated with taurine (100 mg/kg orally, 1 time per day, saline vehicle) for 25 days. The animals were divided into 4 groups: vehicle (VE), taurine (TAU), ICV-STZ (STZ) and ICV-STZ plus taurine (STZ + TAU). At the end of taurine treatment, short- and long-term memory were assessed by performance on object recognition and Y-maze tasks. Insulin receptor (IR) was evaluated by immunoperoxidase while mature neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP, S100B, SOX9), and microglia (Iba-1) were evaluated by immunofluorescence. STZ induced worse spatial and recognition memory (INDEX) in YM and ORT tasks. Taurine protected against STZ-induced memory impairment. SDAT reduced the population of mature neurons as well as increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity, and taurine protected against these STZ-induced effects, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Taurine increases IR expression in the hippocampus, and protects against the reduction in the density of this receptor in CA1 induced by STZ. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that taurine is able to enhance memory, up-regulates IR in the hippocampus, protects the neuron population, and reduces the astrogliosis found in SDAT.

AB  - Poor access to adequate, clean, and safe water is one of the greatest world problems people encounter. There has been considerable attention in recent times toward the use of natural coagulants for water treatment. This study seeks to promote this by investigating the potential of Elephantorrhiza goetzei (E. goetzei) seed extract as natural coagulants for water treatment. This included the determination of key ingredients responsible for the coagulation process and optimal dosages for the removal of turbidity, fluoride, manganese, and iron. The residual content of organic matter in the treated water and the quality of sludge produced were also investigated. The methodology consisted of a proximate analysis procedure to investigate the active ingredient(s) responsible for coagulation and standard jar tests. Standard methods were used for the analyses. Coagulant dosages ranging from 0 to 300 mg/L at a rapid mixing speed of 120 rpm for 1 min, a slow mixing speed of 30 rpm for 15 min, and a settling time of 15 min were used for the jar test. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) using IBM SPSS Version 20 was conducted, and regression models were developed to determine the effect of coagulant dosage on turbidity, pH, total dissolved solids, fluoride, iron, manganese, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphorus. The results obtained from the proximate analysis of E. goetzei seed extract show that values of 5.25%, 21.40%, 8.23%, 32.99%, 2.20%, and 29.93% were obtained for moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, fat, ash, and carbohydrate content, respectively. Moreover, seed extract of E. goetzei achieved removal efficiencies up to 94.8%, 50.1%, 90.0%, and 53.9% for turbidity, fluoride, iron, and manganese in water, respectively. The coagulant has the potential to achieve the desired World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards for turbidity, fluoride, iron, and manganese. The COD increased from 55.3 to 419.3 mg/L as the coagulant dosage increased from 0 to 100 mg/L. This could cause an unwanted rise in microbial activities, affecting the microbiological quality of the treated water. The total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations obtained in the sludge at 100 mg/L were 0.343 and 0.194 mu g/kg, respectively, and this compromises its attractiveness for agricultural reuse purposes.

AB  - Fourteen quinolizidine derivatives, structurally related to the alkaloids lupinine and cytisine and previously studied for other pharmacological purposes, were presently tested for antiarrhythmic, and other cardiovascular effects on isolated guinea pig heart tissues in comparison to well-established reference drugs. According to their structures, the tested compounds are assembled into three subsets: (a) N-(quinolizidinyl-alkyl)-benzamides; (b) 2-(benzotriazol-2-yl)methyl-1-(quinolizidinyl)alkyl-benzimidazoles; (c) N-substituted cytisines. All compounds but two displayed antiarrhythmic activity that was potent for compounds 4, 1, 6, and 5 (in ascending order). The last compound (N-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)aminohomolupinane) was outstanding, exhibiting a nanomolar potency (EC50 = 0.017 mu M) for the increase in the threshold of ac-arrhythmia. The tested compounds shared strong negative inotropic activity; however, this does not compromise the value of their antiarrhythmic action. On the other hand, only moderate or modest negative chronotropic and vasorelaxant activities were commonly observed. Compound 5, which has high antiarrhythmic potency, a favorable cardiovascular profile, and is devoid of antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats, represents a lead worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and adolescents. Others and our previous studies have shown that Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) as core components of the Hippo pathway are crucial regulators of osteosarcoma formation and progression. Recent studies demonstrated that verteporfin (VP) is an inhibitor of YAP/TAZ signaling in xenograft osteosarcoma. However, whether VP can inhibit primary osteosarcoma in mice is unknown. Mutations of Trp53 and Rb1 occur in approximately 50 similar to 70% of human osteosarcoma. In this study, we successfully generated the Ctsk-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) mice in which Trp53/Rb1 was ablated in Ctsk-expressing cells and found that Ctsk-Cre;Trp53(f/f) /Rb-f/f mice spontaneously developed osteosarcoma with increased expansive osteoid lesions in the cortical bone with aging. Loss of Trp53/Rb1 in Ctsk-expressing cells significantly promoted the expression and nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Micro-CT results showed that inhibition of YAP/TAZ by VP delays osteosarcoma progression and protected against bone erosion in Ctsk-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) mice. Importantly, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves displayed a significantly longer survival rate after VP treatment in Ctsk-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) mice compared to non-injected groups. In vitro studies further showed that VP inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in Trp53/Rbl-mutant Ctsk-expressing cells. Moreover, the results from promoter luciferase activity analysis showed that the transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ was significantly increased in osteosarcoma tissue from Ctsk-Cre;Trp53(f/f)/Rb1(f/f) mice, which was attenuated by VP treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting Hippo pathway by VP may be a potential therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.

AB  - The health and welfare of working elephants is directly related to that of their mahout and to the strength and duration of elephant-human bonds. Such bonds are influenced by the ways in which mahouts understand, describe, and respond to elephant communication and dynamic elephant affective states. This study examined how mahout interpretation of elephant communication and affective states influences mahout behavior during interactions and thus influences the development and maintenance of elephant-human working and living relationships. Using in-person, semi-structured interviews with owners and mahouts, biographical and employment data on mahouts and elephants were collected. These interviews were followed by multispecies ethnographic data collection and participant observations among 41 mahouts and 29 elephants. Narrative analysis of mahout interviews, coupled with observations of mahouts and elephants, resulted in the identification of several themes that mahouts felt impacted the elephant-human working relationship, all tied to the development and nurturing of long-term bonds. The first set of themes that emerged is discussed in this paper, which includes "measures of elephant happiness" and "methods of communication." Identifying these themes was crucial to understanding how humans and elephants build and maintain long-term bonds, as well as determining how these bonds (or their breakage) affect working relationships. Communication and bond building may be key to improving the health, welfare, and working conditions for marginalized groups of humans and elephants employed in tourism practice.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an environmental pollutant, and overexposure can cause neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease that are characterized by beta-amyloid (A beta) overexpression, Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not clearly defined. In our study, a knockout mouse model of Mn exposure combined with gut flora-induced neurotoxicity was constructed to investigate the effect of gut flora on Mn neurotoxicity. The results showed that the levels of Tau, p-Tau and A beta in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice were greater than those in the hippocampus of control mice after 5 weeks of continuous exposure to manganese chloride (Mn content of 200 mg/L). Transplanted normal and healthy fecal microbiota from mice significantly downregulated Tau, p-Tau and A beta expression and ameliorated brain pathology. Moreover, Mn exposure activated the cGAS-STING pathway and altered the cecal microbiota profile, characterized by an increase in Clostridiales, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ligilactobacillus and Desulfovibrio, and a decrease in Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium_ruminantium_group, Fusimonas and Firmicutes, While fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) treatment inhibited this pathway and restored the microbiota profile. FMT alleviated Mn exposure-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by overactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of the cGAS and STING genes and FMT altered the gut microbiota composition and its predictive function. Phenotypic prediction revealed that FMT markedly decreased the abundances of anaerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria and significantly increased the abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria and biofilm-forming bacteria after blocking the cGAS-STING pathway compared to the Mn-exposed group. FMT from normal and healthy mice ameliorated the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure, possibly through alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome associated with the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway. This study provides a prospective direction for future research on the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background Tabanidae (Horse-Flies or Deer-Flies) are one of the most economically important as well as medically significant haematophagous insect family within the order Diptera. Members of this group are also responsible for the mortality of substantial number of live-stock every year. Due to their pathogen transmission potential and vector competencies makes them an important insect group to study. Till now, mitochondrial genome of 18 species of tabanids were available.Methods and results The complete mitogenome of three species T. diversifrons (15,809 bp), T. rubidus (15,878 bp) and T. tenens (15,872 bp) were generated by Next generation sequencing method. They consist 37 genes, with a positive AT skew and a negative GC skew. The gene order of these three species is similar to the typical gene arrangement of infra-order Tabanomorpha. Most of the tRNAs showed typical clover-leaf secondary structure except trnS1, which lacks the DHU arm. The sliding window analysis showed that the nad4L is the most conserved while atp8, and nad6 are the most variable genes. Moreover, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates indicated that all PCGs under the purifying selection. Phylogeny revealed Chrysops and Haematopota are monophyletic while species of Hybomitra are nested within the polyphyletic clade of Tabanus. T. diversifrons exhibits sister relationship with Atylotus miser. Two morphologically divergent species T. rubidus and T. tenens are found to be genetically similar and indistinguishable by mitochondrial genome.Conclusions The hypervariable genes like atp8 and nad6 can be used as molecular markers for the identification of recently diverged lineages of family Tabanidae. Further, to address uncertainties arising from the two morphological divergent species, it is imperative to obtain data from nuclear gene markers.

AB  - Evidence suggests that fluoride-induced neurodevelopment damage is linked to mitochondrial disorder, yet the detailed mechanism remains unclear. A cohort of Sprague-Dawley rats developmentally exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) was established to simulate actual exposure of human beings. Using high-input proteomics and small RNA sequencing technology in rat hippocampus, we found mitochondrial translation as the most striking enriched biolog-ical process after NaF treatment, which involves the differentially expressed Required Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 homolog (RMND1) and neural-specific miR-221-3p. Further experiments in vivo and in vitro neuroendocrine pheochro-mocytoma (PC12) cells demonstrated that NaF impaired mitochondrial translation and function, as shown by declined mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited expression of mitochondrial translation factors, mitochondrial translation products, and OXPHOS complexes, which was concomitant with decreased RMND1 and transcription factor c-Fos in mRNA and proteins as well as elevated miR-221-3p. Notably, RMND1 overexpression alleviated the NaF-elicited mitochondrial translation impairment by up-regulating translation factors, but not vice versa. Interest-ingly, ChIP-qPCR confirmed that c-Fos specifically controls the RMND1 transcription through direct binding with Rmnd1 promotor. Interference of gene expression verified c-Fos as an upstream positive regulator of RMND1, implicat-ing in fluoride-caused mitochondrial translation impairment. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assay evidenced that miR-221-3p targets c-Fos by binding its 3 ' untranslated region. By modulating the miR-221-3p expression, we identified miR-221-3p as a critical negative regulator of c-Fos. More importantly, we proved that miR-221-3p inhibitor improved mitochondrial translation and mitochondrial function to combat NaF neurotoxicity via activating the c-Fos/ RMND1 axis, whereas miR-221-3p mimic tended towards opposite effects. Collectively, our data suggest fluoride impairs mitochondrial translation by dysregulating the miR-221-3p/c-Fos/RMND1 axis to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to neuronal death and neurodevelopment defects.

AB  - Contemporary reconstructive approaches for critical size bone defects carry significant disadvantages. As a result, clinically driven research has focused on the development and translation of alternative therapeutic concepts. Scaffold-guided tissue regeneration (SGTR) is an emerging technique to heal critical size bone defects. However, issues synchronizing scaffold vascularization with bone-specific regenerative processes currently limit bone regeneration for extra large (XL, 19 cm(3)) critical bone defects. To address this issue, we developed a large animal model that incorporates a corticoperiosteal flap (CPF) for sustained scaffold neovascularization and bone regeneration. In 10 sheep, we demonstrated the efficacy of this approach for healing medium (M, 9 cm(3)) size critical bone defects as demonstrated on plain radiography, microcomputed tomography, and histology. Furthermore, in two sheep, we demonstrate how this approach can be safely extended to heal XL critical size defects. This article presents an original CPF technique in a well-described preclinical model, which can be used in conjunction with the SGTR concept, to address challenging critical size bone defects in vivo. Impact statementThis article describes a novel scaffold-guided tissue engineering approach utilizing a corticoperiosteal flap for bone healing in critical size long bone defects. This approach will be of use for tissue engineers and surgeons exploring vascularized tissue transfer as an option to regenerate large volumes of bone for extensive critical size bone defects both in vivo and in the clinical arena.

AB  - Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a highly valuable technique in the fluorescence microscopy toolbox because it is essentially independent of indicator concentrations. Conventional fluorescence microscopy analyzes changes in emission intensity. In contrast, FLIM assesses the fluorescence lifetime, which is defined as the time a fluorophore remains in an excited state before emitting a photon. This principle is advantageous in experiments where fluorophore concentrations are expected to change, e.g., due to changes in cell volume. FLIM, however, requires collecting a substantial number of photons to accurately fit distribution plots, which constrains its ability for dynamic imaging. This limitation has recently been overcome by rapidFLIM, which utilizes ultra-low dead-time photodetectors in conjunction with sophisticated rapid electronics. The resulting reduction in dead-time to the picosecond range greatly enhances the potential for achieving high spatio-temporal resolution. Here, we demonstrate the use of multi-photon-based rapidFLIM with the sodium indicator ION NaTRIUM Green-2 (ING-2) for the quantitative, dynamic determination of Na+ concentrations in neurons in acute rodent brain tissue slices. We describe the loading of the dye into neurons and present a procedure for its calibration in situ. We show that rapidFLIM not only allows the unbiased determination of baseline Na+ concentrations but also allows dynamic imaging of changes in intracellular Na+, e.g., induced by inhibition of cellular ATP production. Overall, rapidFLIM, with its greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatio-temporal resolution, will also facilitate dynamic measurements using other FLIM probes, particularly those with a low quantum yield.

AB  - Simple Summary: Multi-fetal ewes are more likely to suffer from metabolic disorders and pregnancy toxemia than single-fetal ewes in late gestation. The differences in the energy metabolites, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and rumen microbiota of ewes with different numbers of fetuses are unclear. This study found that triplet-fetal ewes were characterized by a lower BCS and antioxidant capacity, and were prone to the triggering of inflammatory responses. With the increase in fetal number, the concentration of BHBA increased, and that of glucose decreased; the relative abundance of Firmicutes was lower, while that of Bacteroidota was higher in triplet-fetal ewes. The differences in the rumen microbiota may be due to differences in the utilization of feed materials by ewes with different numbers of fetuses; multi-fetal ewes tend to ingest more grain-based feed to meet their energy requirements. Therefore, special nutritional strategies and refined feeding management approaches should be developed to meet the physiological requirements of multi-fetal ewes. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the energy metabolites, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and rumen microbiota of ewes with different numbers of fetuses. Thirty healthy ewes were selected and divided into single- (SL, n = 10), twin- (TL, n = 10), and triplet-fetal (PL, n = 10) ewes according to the number of fetuses. Sampling was carried out on days 21 (Q21) and 7 (Q7) before lambing. The results show no differences (p > 0.05) in the DMI and BW of ewes with different numbers of fetuses, and the body condition score (BCS) of PL ewes was lower (p < 0.05) than that of SL ewes. The concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the PL ewes were higher (p < 0.05), while the glucose (Glu), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) values were lower (p < 0.05) than those of the SL ewes. ANOSIM analysis showed that the rumen bacterial structure of the SL, TL, and PL ewes was different on days Q21 and Q7. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota in the rumen was affected (p < 0.05) by the number of fetuses: the relative abundance of Firmicutes (Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Lachnospiraceae_AC2044_group, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, and Anaeroplasma) was higher (p < 0.05), while that of Bacteroidota (Prevotella, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001) was lower (p < 0.05) in the SL ewes than in the PL ewes. In summary, the rumen microbial structure and energy metabolites of ewes in late gestation with different numbers of fetuses were different. Triplet-fetal ewes were characterized by lower BCS and antioxidant capacity and were prone to the triggering of inflammatory responses.

AB  - Featured Application Development of new vegetable-derived rennet for cheese making.Abstract Cheese production is an ancient practice to preserve a perishable food, such as milk, for a long time. The first step of cheese processing involves the addition of rennet, which contains the enzymes necessary for the hydrolysis and coagulation of the caseins present in milk. Typically, animal-derived rennet, such as calf rennet containing chymosin, are used as source of enzymes for cheese processing. Alternatively, microbial chymosin or recombinant chymosin is used. However, recently, plant-derived rennet such as the ones derived from thistle and bitter orange flowers and from artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) have also been demonstrated to be valid sources of enzymes for cheese processing. Therefore, herein, different plant and fruit extracts were tested and compared for their ability to coagulate milk caseins. In particular, beyond artichoke and cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) extracts, those from pineapple (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.), papaya (Carica papaya L.), common fig (Ficus carica L.) milky sap, and oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. ex Fr.) P. Kumm.) were investigated for their proteolytic, esterase, and milk-clotting activities. The extracts were then exploited as vegetable and fruit rennet for the experimental production of cheeses, which were examined, after 30 days of maturation, for their moisture, fat, protein, and free fatty acid (FFA) content. Interestingly, the artichoke, cardoon, and thistle mushroom extracts showed high proteolytic activity compared to calf rennet, while the level of esterase activity appeared to be similar for all the extracts. The papaya extract showed the lowest proteolytic and esterase activity. Although the pH, moisture, fat, and protein contents were very similar to those of cheese made with calf rennet, the medium- and long-chain FFAs broadly differed among produced cheeses, with variations in the lipid quality indices.

AB  - Exposure to adversity during early childhood and adolescence increases an individual's vulnerability to developing substance use disorder. Despite the knowledge of this vulnerability, the mechanisms underlying it are still poorly understood. Excitatory afferents to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate responses to both stressful and rewarding stimuli. Understanding how adolescent social isolation alters these afferents could inform the development of targeted interventions both before and after drug use. Here, we used social isolation rearing as a model of early life adversity which we have previously demonstrated increases vulnerability to cocaine addiction-like behaviour. The current study examined the effect of social isolation rearing on presynaptic glutamatergic transmission in NAc medium spiny neurons in both male and female mice. We show that social isolation rearing alters presynaptic plasticity in the NAc by decreasing the paired-pulse ratio and the size of the readily releasable pool of glutamate. Optogenetically activating the glutamatergic input from the ventral hippocampus to the NAc is sufficient to recapitulate the decreases in paired-pulse ratio and readily releasable pool size seen following electrical stimulation of all NAc afferents. Further, optogenetically inhibiting the ventral hippocampal afferent during electrical stimulation eliminates the effect of early life adversity on the paired-pulse ratio or readily releasable pool size. In summary, we demonstrate that social isolation rearing leads to alterations in glutamate transmission driven by projections from the ventral hippocampus. These data suggest that targeting the circuit from the ventral hippocampus to the nucleus accumbens could provide a means to reverse stress-induced plasticity.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is a low toxic trace element that can accumulate in the nervous system and induce cognitive disorders characterized by reduced learning and memory ability. Neuroepigenetic effects are structural changes in cellular function by the brain in response to environmental stimuli by altering the expression of specific genes and repressing normal cellular transcription, leading to abnormalities in a variety of biological processes within the nervous system and affecting neurobehavioral responses. One of the most important mechanisms of epigenetic control on chromatin shape is histone modification. In the present study, we established an offspring rat model of Al intoxication to investigate the changes in spatial learning and memory retention abilities and the relationship with histone H2B acetylation modification in rats exposed to different doses of Al over a long period of time. The results demonstrated that long-term AlCl3 staining resulted in decreased CBP gene and protein expression, increased HDAC3 gene and protein levels, as well as decreased histone H2B and acH2BK20 protein expression levels in the hippocampus of rats. In conclusion, long-term exposure to Al may vary the expression of histone H2B and acH2BK20 through the regulation of enzymes that specifically regulate histone acetylation, hence hastening the deterioration of the nervous system that impairs cognitive function.

AB  - Avian cerebellum, a highly conserved, laminated and foliated structure, provides an excellent model for developmental studies. During the intermediate embryonic stages, granule cell progenitor proliferation and the inwards migration of post-mitotic granule cells have been implicated in the morphogenesis of cerebellar cortex cytoarchitecture and foliation. The present study questioned the spatio-temporal expression pattern of pleiotrophin, an extracellular matrix growth factor, during the morphogenesis of embryonic cerebellum, and the roles of ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors and the diffusible neuromodulator nitric oxide (NO) in the proliferation pattern of EGL granule cell progenitors. To this end, the density of proliferating cells in the developing embryonic external granule layer (EGL) was determined following acute treatment with AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX or NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, at embryonic stages HH38-41 (E12-E15 days), by means of BrdU immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence. Importantly, at earlier stages, pleiotrophin-like immunoreactivity showed high expression levels in the EGL that gradually decreased, persisting within the growing folia apices, later in development. Interestingly, blockage of AMPA receptors had no effect; while NOS inhibition resulted in transient age-and region-specific increases of EGL granule progenitor cell proliferation at earlier stages, but decreased the post-mitotic granule cells at folia apices, at a later stage HH41 (E15 day). Overall, NO had a transient anti-proliferative effect in EGL similar to mammalian cerebellum, acting as a modulator of the EGL function at different stages, suggesting its possible implication in complex processes guiding cerebellar cytoarchitecture and folia formation.

AB  - Convergent evolution is a widespread phenomenon. While there are many examples of convergent evolution at the phenotypic scale, convergence at the molecular level has been more difficult to identify. A classic example of convergent evolution across scales is that of the digestive lysozyme found in ruminants and Colobine monkeys. These herbivorous species rely on foregut fermentation, which has evolved to function more optimally under acidic conditions. Here, we explored if rodents with similar dietary strategies and digestive morphologies have convergently evolved a lysozyme with digestive functions. At the phenotypic level, we find that rodents with bilocular stomach morphologies exhibited a lysozyme that maintained higher relative activities at low pH values, similar to the lysozymes of ruminants and Colobine monkeys. Additionally, the lysozyme of Peromyscus leucopus shared a similar predicted protonation state as that observed in previously identified digestive lysozymes. However, we found limited evidence of positive selection acting on the lysozyme gene in foregut-fermenting species and did not identify patterns of convergent molecular evolution in this gene. This study emphasizes that phenotypic convergence need not be the result of convergent genetic modifications, and we encourage further exploration into the mechanisms regulating convergence across biological scales.

AB  - Fluoride is recommended for its cariostatic effect, but excessive fluoride intake may have health risks. Increased prevalence of dental fluorosis in areas with low fluoride content in drinking water has been attributed to the inappropriate excessive intake of fluoride supplements (tablets and drops) and toothpaste ingestion. The aim of the present study was to estimate the fluoride intake and the risk of fluorosis in children (6 months-6 years) in the Castelli Romani area (province of Rome, Italy), which is volcanic, therefore with a higher concentration of fluorine. Measurements of the fluoride content in drinking water, mineral waters, vegetables and commercial toothpaste for children were performed. The fluoride concentrations of all samples were determined using a Fluoride Ion Selective Electrode (GLP 22, Crison, Esp). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Differences between samples were determined by Student's t-test. The fluoride content in tap water samples collected from public sources averaged from 0.35 to 1.11 ppm. The Pavona area showed the highest content of fluoride with respect to the others (p <= 0.05). The fluoride content in mineral water samples averaged from 0.07 to 1.50 ppm. The fluoride content of some vegetables showed increased mean values when compared to control vegetables (p <= 0.05). Within the limitations of the present study, considerations should be made when prescribing fluoride toothpaste for infants (6 months-4 years) in the areas with high fluoride content, because involuntary ingestion is consistent.

AB  - The effects of supplementing the diet of sows with beta G-(1,3) derived from Euglena gracilis algae were assessed regarding quality and amount of colostrum as well as performance of piglets. A total of 120 sows (first (nulliparous) to sixth parity (multiparous)) from D85 of gestation until weaning were divided into two groups: the control diet group (n = 60) and the beta G-(1,3) diet group (n = 60). Sows receiving beta G-(1,3) exhibited an average increase of 870 g (24.9%) in colostrum production, leading to a 25.17% higher intake of colostrum by piglets. Furthermore, piglets in the beta G-(1,3) group showed significantly superior weight gain of 34 g (50%) compared to the control group 18 h after birth (p < 0.05). Sows fed with beta G-(1,3) produced colostrum with significantly higher concentrations of IgG (5.914 mg/mL, 16.16%) and IgM (0.378 mg/mL, 16.29%) than the control group (p < 0.05). Similarly, serum concentrations of IgG (13.86 mg/mL, 51.25%), IgA (17.16 mg/mL, 120.19%), and IgM (13.23 mg/mL, 144.78%) were significantly higher in sows fed with beta G-(1,3) than in the control group (p < 0.05). Supplementing sows with beta G-(1,3) derived from the Euglena gracilis algae resulted in increased colostrum production and consumption, along with greater weight gain in piglets during the first 18 h after birth. Additionally, both the colostrum produced by the sows and the blood serum of the piglets exhibited higher concentrations of immunoglobulins.

AB  - Zoos have made efforts to improve the welfare and survival of their animals through ever-evolving husbandry techniques. In principle, this accumulation of expertise and skills should lead to higher survival rates for zoo animals over time, as demonstrated in several zoo animal species in recent years. Hippopotamuses (hippos) are part of the charismatic fauna commonly present in zoos, and their conservation status in natural habitats increases the potential and value that ex situ populations have to offer for their conservation. In this study, historical adult and juvenile survivorship of the two hippo species while kept in zoos was evaluated from 1900 onwards. The survivorship of adult common hippos Hippopotamus amphibius has remained unchanged across this timespan while the survivorship of adult pygmy hippos Choeropsis liberiensis has seen some progress in the last two decades. For both species, juvenile survival has remarkably improved. The survivorship of common hippos in zoos is superior to that observed in the only documented survivorship data from a free-ranging population. For the common hippo, the absence of improvements in recent decades could either indicate that the species has already reached its optimum lifespan, or that a key husbandry practice has yet to be identified to further enhance survivorship rates. The improvements seen in pygmy hippo may be the result of increased collective efforts in the last two decades to better understand the biology and care of this species, as evidenced by scientific interest and husbandry guidelines. In the population of both species, the proportion of juveniles has decreased and that of adults has increased, with the current barrel-shaped population pyramid in the common hippos creating the risk of jeopardising the longterm maintenance of the population. Especially for common hippos, we suggest that a change in the management approach might be necessary to guarantee population sustainability, with the inclusion of a breed-and-cull strategy.

AB  - The recent resurgence of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has led to considerable economic losses in pig farms across China. As a zoonotic pathogen, the increasing number of human PRV infection cases highlights the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies. Since PRV entry is initiated when glycoprotein D (gD) binds to cellular receptors such as Nectin-1, blocking this interaction presents a promising strategy for inhibiting PRV replication. While breakthroughs have been achieved with monoclonal antibodies targeting gD, mini-binders, which are small, computationally designed proteins, and can be rapidly generated by de novo design, offer an attractive alternative. In this work, 3 mini-binders, each approximately 6 kDa in size, were do novo designed targeting the hydrophobic surface of the gD protein in gD/Nectin-1 binding interface, with potent antiviral activity on PRV in PK15 cells. Notably, binder-3 exhibited the strongest binding affinity and inhibitory effect, with an IC50 value of 2.41 nM. All three mini-binders showed significant prophylactic effects, inhibiting PRV replication effectively beginning at the early stages of infection. Additionally, binder-3 show significant antiPRV activity in a dose of 30 mg/kg at intraperitoneal administration three times daily. Our study confirmed that the mini-binders to inhibit PRV replication is a feasible scheme.

AB  - Background Pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli harbouring antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from any source (clinical samples, animal settings, or environment) might be transmitted and contribute to the spread and increase of antibiotic resistance in the biosphere. The goal of this study was to investigate the genome to decipher the repertoire of ARGs, virulence genes carried by E. coli strains isolated from livestock, poultry, and their handlers (humans), and then unveil the genetic relatedness between the strains. Methods Whole genome sequencing was done to investigate the genetic makeup of E. coli isolates (n = 20) [swine (n = 2), cattle (n = 2), sheep (n = 4), poultry (n = 7), and animal handlers (n = 5)] from southern India. The detection of resistome, virulome, biofilm forming genes, mobile genetic elements (MGE), followed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and phylogenetic analyses, were performed. Results E. coli strains were found to be multi drug resistant, with a resistome encompassing > 20 ARGs, the virulome-17-22 genes, and > 20 key biofilm genes. MGE analysis showed four E. coli isolates (host: poultry, swine and cattle) harbouring composite transposons with ARGs/virulence genes (bla(TEM), dfr, qnr/nleB, tir, eae,and esp) with the potential for horizontal transfer. MLST analyses revealed the presence of ST937 and ST3107 in both livestock/poultry and their handlers. Phylogenomic analyses with global E. coli isolates (human/livestock/poultry hosts) showed close relatedness with strains originating from different parts of the world (the United States, China, etc.). Conclusion The current study emphasizes the circulation of strains of pathogenic sequence types of clinical importance, carrying a diverse repertoire of genes associated with antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and virulence properties in animal settings, necessitating immediate mitigation measures to reduce the risk of spread across the biosphere.

AB  - Hormone therapy resistance and the ensuing aggressive tumor progression present a significant clinical challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of tumor malignancy upon inhibition of steroid hormone signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila malignant epithelial tumors show a similar reduction in ecdysone signaling, the main steroid hormone pathway. Our analysis of ecdysone-induced downstream targets reveals that overexpression of the nuclear receptor E75, particularly facilitates the malignant transformation of benign tumors. Genome-wide DNA binding profiles and biochemistry data reveal that E75 not only binds to the transcription factors of both Hippo and Notch pathways, but also exhibits widespread co-binding to their target genes, thus contributing to tumor malignancy. We further validated these findings by demonstrating that depletion of NR1D2, the mammalian homolog of E75, inhibits the activation of Hippo and Notch target genes, impeding glioblastoma progression. Together, our study unveils a novel mechanism by which hormone inhibition promotes tumor malignancy, and describes an evolutionarily conserved role of the oncogene E75/NR1D2 in integration of Hippo and Notch pathway activity during tumor progression.
   The interplay between hormone signaling and malignant transformation remains incompletely understood. This study identifies E75/NR1D2 as an evolutionarily conserved oncogene that promotes malignant transformation of benign tumors by co-regulating the Hippo and Notch signaling pathways.The ecdysone steroid hormone signaling is inhibited in malignant tumors.Overexpression of nuclear receptor facilitates malignant tumor transformation.E75 promotes tumor malignancy by integrating Hippo pathway and Notch pathway signaling at the transcription factor level.The mammalian E75 ortholog also regulates the Hippo and Notch pathways and promotes glioblastoma progression.
   The conserved steroid-hormone-induced transcription factor E75/NR1D2 interacts with Hippo and Notch pathway transcription factors to co-regulate their activity.

AB  - Objective: To explore the novel protective effect of Asperosaponin VI (AVI) on sepsis and its potential mechanism. Methods: In in vitro experiments, bone marrow mononuclear cells and THP-1-derived cells were used to evaluate the viability of AVI treatment. Besides, the quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were adopted to explore the protective effect of AVI on LPS-induced inflammation. For in vivo work, the effect of AVI on mice was evaluated by using both CLP-induced and the LPS-induced sepsis mice model. The fluctuation of anal temperature and the behavior of mice were recorded after surgery. Further, the content of bacteria in peritoneal lavage fluid was detected, as well as the levels of ALT, AST, LD and LDH in serum with ELISA. H&E staining and realtime PCR were used to evaluate the histopathology of liver, spleen and lung. Finally, relevant signaling pathways were detected by Western blot, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.Results: AVI inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors in both CLP-induced and LPS-induced sepsis mice models, and reduced the number of bacteria in abdominal lavage fluid. The preventive treatment with AVI alleviated sepsis-induced organ injuries, reduced inflammatory responses, which was through inhibiting Hippo and Rho signaling pathway.Conclusions: This study indicated that AVI effectively protected mice from sepsis by down-regulating the activation of Hippo signaling and Rho family, and reducing inflammation and organ damage. However, conventional treatment was using antibiotics, and its mechanism was different with AVI.

AB  - The transport mechanisms for water, ammonia and urea in elasmobranch gill, kidney and gastrointestinal tract remain to be fully elucidated. Aquaporin 8 (AQP8) is a known water, ammonia and urea channel that is expressed in the kidney and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and teleost fish. However, at the initiation of this study in late 2019, there was no copy of an elasmobranch aquaporin 8 gene identified in the genebank even for closely related holocephalon species such as elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii) or for the elasmobranch little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). A transcriptomic study in spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) also failed to identify a copy. Hence this study has remedied this and identified the AQP8 cDNA sequence using degenerate PCR. Agarose electrophoresis of degenerate PCR reactions from dogfish tissues showed a strong band from brain cDNA and faint bands of a similar size in gill and liver. 5' and 3' RACE was used to complete the AQP8 cDNA sequence. Primers were then designed for further PCR reactions to determine the distribution of AQP8 mRNA expression in dogfish tissues. This showed that AQP8 is only expressed in dogfish brain and AQP8 therefore clearly can play no role in water, ammonia and urea transport in the gill, kidney or gastrointestinal tract. The role of AQP8 in dogfish brain remains to be determined.

AB  - m-(Tert-butyl) trifluoroacetophenone (TFK), a slow-binding inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a transition state analog of acetylcholine, was investigated as a potential neuroprotectant of central and peripheral AChE against organophosphate paraoxon (PDX) toxicity. Acute toxicity and pharmacological effects of TFK were investigated on mice and rats. Intraperitoneal administered TFK has low acute toxicity in mice (LD50 approximate to 19 mg/kg). Effects on motor function as investigated by mtarod and open field tests showed that TFK up to 5 mg/kg did not alter motor coordination and stereotypical exploration behavior of mice. Passive avoidance test showed that 1 or 5 mg/kg TFK restored memory impairment in scopolamine-induced Alzheimer's disease-like dementia in rats. Pretreatment of mice with 5 mg/kg TFK, 2-3 h before challenge by 2xLD(50) PDX provided a modest and short protection against PDX toxicity. Futhermore, analysis of PDX-induced neuronal degeneration by using fluomjade B staining showed that TFK pretreatment, at the dose 5 mg/kg before PDX challenge, significantly reduced the density of apoptotic cells in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of mice. Thus, TFK is capable of reducing PDX-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background: Although the changes of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the central nervous system (CNS) induced by excessive fluoride has been confirmed by our previous findings, the underlying mechanism(s) of the action remains unclear. Here, we investigate the possibility that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the aspect. Methods: As a model of chronic fluorosis, SD rats received different concentrations of fluoride in their drinking water for 3 or 6 months and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to fluoride. Literature reviews and bioinformatics analyses were used to predict and real-time PCR to measure the expression of 12 miRNAs; an algorithm-based approach was applied to identify multiply potential target-genes and pathways; the dual-luciferase reporter system to detect the association of miR-132-3p with MAPK1; and fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect miR132-3p localization. The miR-132-3p inhibitor or mimics or MAPK1 silencing RNA were transfected into cultured cells. Expression of protein components of the MAPK pathway was assessed by immunofluorescence or Western blotting. Results: In the rat hippocampus exposed with high fluoride, ten miRNAs were down-regulated and two upregulated. Among these, miR-132-3p expression was down-regulated to the greatest extent and MAPK1 level (selected from the 220 genes predicted) was corelated with the alteration of miR-132-3p. Furthermore, miR132-3p level was declined, whereas the protein levels MAPK pathway components were increased in the rat brains and SH-SY5Y cells exposed to high fluoride. MiR-132-3p up-regulated MAPK1 by binding directly to its 3 ' untranslated region. Obviously, miR-132-3p mimics or MAPK1 silencing RNA attenuated the elevated expressions of the proteins components of the MAPK pathway induced by fluorosis in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas an inhibitor of miR-132-3p just played the opposite effect. Conclusion: MiR-132-3p appears to modulate the changes of MAPK signaling pathway in the CNS associated with chronic fluorosis.

AB  - Autism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behavioral syndrome characterized by persistent deficits in social interaction, and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The gene encoding Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is one of a few exceptional genes of established causal effect in ASD. Although genetically engineered mice studies may shed light on how MeCP2 loss affects synaptic activity patterns across the whole brain, such studies are not considered practical in ASD patients due to the overall level of impaimient, and are technically challenging in mice. For the first time, we show that hippocampal MeCP2 knockdown produces behavioral abnormalities associated with autism-like traits in rats, providing a new strategy to investigate the efficacy of therapeutics in ASD. Ketamine, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) blocker, has been proposed as a possible treatment for autism. Using the MeCP2 knockdown rats in conjunction with a rat model of valproic acid (VPA)-induced ASD, we examined gene expression and ASD behaviors upon ketamine treatment We report that the core symptoms of autism in MeCP2 knockdown rats with social impairment recovered dramatically following a single treatment with ketamine.

AB  - SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes, as unique plant transcription factors, play important roles in plant developmental regulation and stress response adaptation. Although mulberry is a commercially valuable tree species, there have been few systematic studies on SPL genes. In this work, we identified 15 full-length SPL genes in the mulberry genome, which were distributed on 4 Morus notabilis chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the SPL genes from five plants (Malus x domestica Borkh, Populus trichocarpa, M. notabilis, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa) into five groups. Two zinc fingers (Zn1 and Zn2) were found in the conserved SBP domain in all of the MnSPLs. Comparative analyses of gene structures and conserved motifs revealed the conservation of MnSPLs within a group, whereas there were significant structure differences among groups. Gene quantitative analysis showed that the expression of MnSPLs had tissue specificity, and MnSPLs had much higher expression levels in older mulberry leaves. Furthermore, transcriptome data showed that the expression levels of MnSPL7 and MnSPL14 were significantly increased under silkworm herbivory. Molecular experiments revealed that MnSPL7 responded to herbivory treatment through promoting the transcription of MnTT2L2 and further upregulating the expression levels of catechin synthesis genes (F3 ' H, DFR, and LAR).

AB  - Birds naturally have blood glucose concentrations that are nearly double levels measured for mammals of similar body size and studies have shown that birds are resistant to insulin-mediated glucose uptake into tissues. While a combination of high blood glucose and insulin resistance is associated with diabetes-related pathologies in mammals, birds do not develop such complications. Moreover, studies have shown that birds are resistant to oxidative stress and protein glycation and in fact, live longer than similar-sized mammals. This review seeks to explore how birds regulate blood glucose as well as various theories that might explain their apparent resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake and adaptations that enable them to thrive in a state of relative hyperglycemia.

AB  - Sarcomas include cancer stem cells, but how these cells contribute to local and metastatic relapse is largely unknown. We previously showed the pro-tumor functions of calpain-6 in sarcoma stem cells. Here, we use an osteosarcoma cell model, osteosarcoma tissues and transcriptomic data from human tumors to study gene patterns associated with calpain-6 expression or suppression. Calpain-6 modulates the expression of Hippo pathway genes and stabilizes the hippo effector YAP. It also modulates the vesicular trafficking of beta-catenin degradation complexes. Calpain-6 expression is associated with genes of the G2M phase of the cell cycle, supports G2M-related YAP activities and up-regulated genes controlling mitosis in sarcoma stem cells and tissues. In mouse models of bone sarcoma, most tumor cells expressed calpain-6 during the early steps of tumor out-growth. YAP inhibition prevented the neoformation of primary tumors and metastases but had no effect on already developed tumors. It could even accelerate lung metastasis associated with large bone tumors by affecting tumor-associated inflammation in the host tissues. Our results highlight a specific mechanism involving YAP transcriptional activity in cancer stem cells that is crucial during the early steps of tumor and metastasis outgrowth and that could be targeted to prevent sarcoma relapse.

AB  - Background: Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a phenomenon that pathological injury of ischemic brain tissue is further aggravated after the restoration of blood supply. The complex pathological mechanism of CIRI has led to the failure of multiple neuroprotective agents in clinical studies. Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is a neuroprotective extract from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge., with significant pharmacological activities in the treatment of brain injury. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms of SAA remain unclear.
   Purpose: To explore the potential protective effect of SAA on CIRI and its mechanism, and to provide experimental basis for the research of new drugs for CIRI.
   Study design: A model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats was used to simulate clinical CIRI, and the neuroprotective effect of SAA on tMCAO rats was investigated within 14 days after reperfusion. The improvement effects of SAA on cognitive impairment of tMCAO rats were investigated by behavioral tests from days 7-14. Finally, the neuroprotective mechanism of SAA was investigated on day 14.
   Methods: The neuroprotective effects and mechanism of SAA were investigated by behavioral tests, HE and TUNEL staining, RNA sequence (RNA-seq) analysis and Western blot in tMCAO rats.
   Results: The brain protective effects of SAA were achieved by alleviating cerebral infarction, cerebral edema, cerebral atrophy and nerve injury in tMCAO rats. Meanwhile, SAA could effectively improve the cognitive impairment and pathological damage of hippocampal tissue, and inhibit cell apoptosis in tMCAO rats. Besides, SAA could provide neuroprotective effects by up-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, inhibiting the activation of Caspase 3, and regulating PKA/CREB/c-Fos signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: SAA can significantly improve brain injury and cognitive impairment in CIRI rats, and this neuroprotective effect may be achieved through the anti-apoptotic effect and the regulation of PKA/CREB/c-Fos signaling pathway.

AB  - We investigated the influence of the so-called bystander effect on metabolic and histopathological changes in the rat brain after fractionated spinal cord irradiation. The study was initiated with adult Wistar male rats (n = 20) at the age of 9 months. The group designated to irradiation (n = 10) and the age-matched control animals (n = 10) were subjected to an initial measurement using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After allowing the animals to survive until 12 months, they received fractionated spinal cord irradiation with a total dose of 24 Gy administered in 3 fractions (8 Gy per fraction) once a week on the same day for 3 consecutive weeks. 1H MRS and MRI of brain metabolites were performed in the hippocampus, corpus striatum, and olfactory bulb (OB) before irradiation (9-month-old rats) and subsequently 48 h (12-month-old) and 2 months (14-month-old) after the completion of irradiation. After the animals were sacrificed at the age of 14 months, brain tissue changes were investigated in two neurogenic regions: the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS). By comparing the group of 9-month-old rats and individuals measured 48 h (at the age of 12 months) after irradiation, we found a significant decrease in the ratio of total N-acetyl aspartate to total creatine (tNAA/tCr) and gamma-aminobutyric acid to tCr (GABA/tCr) in OB and hippocampus. A significant increase in myoinositol to tCr (mIns/tCr) in the OB persisted up to 14 months of age. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based plasma metabolomics showed a significant increase in keto acids and decreased tyrosine and tricarboxylic cycle enzymes. Morphometric analysis of neurogenic regions of 14-month-old rats showed well-preserved stem cells, neuroblasts, and increased neurodegeneration. The radiation-induced bystander effect more significantly affected metabolite concentration than the distribution of selected cell types.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that selenium and polyphenols are two types of the most reported compounds in tumor chemoprevention due to their remarkable antitumor activity and high safety profile. The cross-talk between polyphenols and selenium is a hot research topic, and the combination of polyphenols and selenium is a valuable strategy for fighting cancer. The current work investigated the combination anti-peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) effect of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) and green tea (Camellia sinensis) polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in mice bearing murine hepatocarcinoma 22 (H22) cells. Results showed that SeNPs alone significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and extended the survival time of mice bearing H22 cells. Still, the potential therapeutic efficacy is accompanied by an approximately eighty percent diarrhea rate. When EGCG was combined with SeNPs, EGCG did not affect the tumor proliferation inhibition effect but eliminated diarrhea triggered by SeNPs. In addition, both the intracellular selectively accumulated EGCG without killing effect on cancer cells and the enhanced antioxidant enzyme levels in ascites after EGCG was delivered alone by intraperitoneal injection indicated that H22 cells were insensitive to EGCG. Moreover, EGCG could prevent SeNP-caused systemic oxidative damage by enhancing serum superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase levels in healthy mice. Overall, we found that H22 cells are insensitive to EGCG, but combining EGCG with SeNPs could protect against SeNP-triggered diarrhea without compromising the suppressing efficacy of SeNPs on PC in mice bearing H22 cells and attenuate SeNP-caused systemic toxicity in healthy mice. These results suggest that EGCG could be employed as a promising candidate for preventing the adverse reactions of chemotherapy including chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and systemic toxicity in cancer individuals.

AB  - Simple Summary Since the first report of PCV3 virus infection in 2016, it has been associated with sow mortality, lesions consistent with porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, reproductive failure, and multisystemic inflammation. In this study, a PCV3 infection model was created using SPF pigs, and the inflammatory response and histological alterations were examined. The results showed that after infection with PCV3, the piglets showed reductions in body weight gain and fever. During the study, viremia, nasal shedding, and fecal shedding were all discovered. Pathological abnormalities were visible in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, and spleen, including edema, inflammation, cell aging, necrosis, and bleeding. Additionally, the group that received PCV3 inoculation had considerably more pro-cytokines in their serum. The only organs with a high viral load were the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and lymph nodes. Since the first report of PCV3 virus infection in 2016, it has been linked to multisystemic inflammation, reproductive failure, cardiac pathology, and clinical indications resembling porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). However, the pathogenesis and clinical significance of PCV3 is still unclear. In this study, a PCV3 infection model was created using SPF pigs, and histopathology and fluorescence quantitative PCR were utilized to examine PCV3's pathogenicity. Reductions in body weight gain and fever were observed during this study. However, other clinical signs such as Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome were not observed through the study. Viremia was detected in the PCV3-inoculated group from 17 days post-inoculation (p.i.) until the end of the study. Nasal shedding was detected from 21 to 35 dpi and fecal shedding was detected during 25-33 days and 39 days, respectively. Gross lesions and histological evaluation were detected in various tissues and organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, small intestine, and testis. The heart, lung, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, and spleen showed pathological changes. The pathological features include swelling, inflammation, cell degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhage. The lesions are consistent with multisystemic inflammation. Tissue viral load results showed only heart, lung, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, and spleen was positive by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the pro-inflammation cytokines in serum increased a lot in the PCV3-inoculated group compared to the control group, demonstrating that the induced inflammation response may be the cause of tissue damage in PCV3-infection. This study demonstrated that PCV3 can produce mild pathological damage to multiple organs, especially multisystemic inflammatory cell infiltration and prolonged viremia, viral shedding in nasal secretions. This is the first in vivo characterization of PCV3 infection in the SPF piglets model using isolated PCV3 strain, and this is also the first time to show the gross and pathological lesion with all tissue and organs in the PCV3-inoculated group. Our findings might serve as a starting point for more investigation into PCV3's pathogenic mechanism.

AB  - Anaesthesia exposure causes changes in the developing brain and affects behaviour and memory. This study examined the beneficial effect of pachypodol against isoflurane (ISF)-induced neuronal injury. Seven-day-old rats were treated with 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg intravenous pachypodol 30 min before exposure to ISF (0.75%) for 6 h. Oxidative stress and other biochemical parameters were assessed in the brain tissue and serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay was performed to assess neuronal cell apoptosis in several regions of the hippocampus. Cognitive function and neurological scores were determined in the pachypodol-treated neuron-injured rats. Cytokine levels and oxidative stress were reduced in the pachypodol-treated group compared with the ISF group. In addition, cognitive deterioration was reversed in pachypodol-treated compared with ISF-treated rats. Thus, treatment with pachypodol reduced neuronal apoptosis in neuron-injured rats. Moreover, pachypodol ameliorated changes to the JNK/ERK/Akt pathway in brain-injured rats. In conclusion, pachypodol treatment prevents neuronal apoptosis in ISF-treated rats by regulating the JNK/ERK pathway.

AB  - Our previous findings demonstrated that astrocytic HIF-1 alpha plays a major role in HIV-1 Tat-mediated amyloidosis which can lead to Alzheimer's-like pathology-a comorbidity of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). These amyloids can be shuttled in extracellular vesicles, and we sought to assess whether HIV-1 Tat stimulated astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) containing the toxic amyloids could result in neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo. We thus hypothesized that blocking HIF-1 alpha could likely mitigate HIV-1 Tat-ADEV-mediated neuronal injury. Rat hippocampal neurons when exposed to HIV-1 Tat-ADEVs carrying the toxic amyloids exhibited amyloid accumulation and synaptodendritic injury, leading to functional loss as evidenced by alterations in miniature excitatory post synaptic currents. The silencing of astrocytic HIF-1 alpha not only reduced the biogenesis of ADEVs, as well as amyloid cargos, but also ameliorated neuronal synaptodegeneration. Next, we determined the effect of HIV-1 Tat-ADEVs carrying amyloids in the hippocampus of naive mice brains. Naive mice receiving the HIV-1 Tat-ADEVs, exhibited behavioural changes, and Alzheimer's 's-like pathology accompanied by synaptodegeneration. This impairment(s) was not observed in mice injected with HIF-1 alpha silenced ADEVs. This is the first report demonstrating the role of amyloid-carrying ADEVs in mediating synaptodegeneration leading to behavioural changes associated with HAND and highlights the protective role of HIF-1 alpha.

AB  - We previously reported that prolonged exposure to an enriched environment (EE) enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity, with one of the significant mechanistic pathways being activation of ss(2)-adrenergic receptor (ss(2)-AR) signaling, thereby mitigating the synaptotoxic effects of soluble oligomers of amyloid ss-protein (oA ss). However, the detailed mechanism remained elusive. In this work, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices treated with or without toxic A ss-species. We found that pharmacological activation of ss(2)-AR, but not ss 1-AR, selectively mimicked the effects of EE in enhancing LTP and preventing oA ss-induced synaptic dysfunction. Mechanistic analyses showed that certain histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors mimicked the benefits of EE, but this was not seen in ss(2)-AR knockout mice, suggesting that activating ss(2)-AR prevents oA ss-mediated synaptic dysfunction via changes in histone acetylation. EE or activation of ss-ARs each decreased HDAC2, whereas A ss oligomers increased HDAC2 levels in the hippocampus. Further, oA ss-induced inflammatory effects and neurite degeneration were prevented by either ss(2)-AR agonists or certain specific HDAC inhibitors. These preclinical results suggest that activation of ss(2)-AR is a novel potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate oA ss-mediated features of AD.

AB  - Genomic selection (GS) is a genetic breeding method that uses genome-wide marker information to improve the accuracy of the prediction of complex traits. The single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) model, which integrates pedigree, phenotypic, and genomic data, has improved genomic prediction. However, ssGBLUP assumes that all markers contribute equally to genetic variance, which can limit its predictive accuracy, especially for traits controlled by major genes. To overcome this limitation, we integrate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into an enhanced ssGBLUP framework, termed single-step genome-wide association assisted BLUP (ssGWABLUP). Our approach assigns differential weights to markers on the basis of their GWAS results, thereby increasing the contribution of effective markers while diminishing the influence of ineffective ones during the construction of the genomic relationship matrix. By incorporating pseudo quantitative trait nucleotides (pQTNs) as covariates, we aim to capture the effects of markers closely associated with major causal variants, leading to the development of the ssGWABLUP_pQTNs. Compared with weighted ssGBLUP (WssGBLUP), the ssGWABLUP model demonstrated superior accuracy and dispersion across different genetic architectures. We then compared the performance of our proposed ssGWABLUP_pQTNs model against both ssGBLUP and ssGWABLUP across various genetic scenarios. Our results demonstrate that ssGWABLUP_pQTNs outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy, particularly in scenarios with simpler genetic architectures. Additionally, evaluation using pig dataset confirmed the effectiveness of ssGWABLUP_pQTNs, highlighting its potential for practical breeding applications. The incorporation of pQTNs and a weighted genomic relationship matrix presents a promising and potentially scalable approach to further enhance genomic prediction, with potential implications for improving the accuracy of genomic selection in breeding programs.

AB  - This study evaluated short-term immune responses of dairy ewes supplemented with barley beta-glucan (BG) following an intramammary Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. In the adaptation period, 36 ewes were fed an alfalfa hay diet ad libitum and barley grain cv. Hispanic (3.8% BG). Then, ewes were assigned into three experimental groups: (1) Control (CON), the same previous diet (13.3 g BG/d); (2) high beta-glucans barley (HBG), new barley (cv. Annapurna) containing 10% BG (35 g BG/d); (3) intraperitoneally injected (INP) with a 1.4% BG solution dose (2 g BG/ewe). At d 9, all ewes were infused with an E. coli LPS or saline solution in each udder half. After the challenge, rectal temperature (RT), milk yield and composition, somatic cell count (SCC), and plasma interleukins (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta) were monitored daily. The INP treatment revealed a transitory increase in RT and decreased milk yield by 38%. Milk fat, protein, and SCC increased in LPS-treated udders but not by BG treatment. The IL-1 alpha plasma concentration was similar among groups but INP ewes showed a lower IL-1 beta concentration suggesting a lower inflammatory response. The BG administration appears more effective intraperitoneally than orally, which needs additional study.

AB  - Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has mutated several times into new strains, with an increased infectivity. Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 strains depends on binding affinity of the virus to its host cell receptor. In this paper, we quantified the binding affinity using Gibbs energy of binding and analyzed the competition between SARS-CoV-2 strains as an interference phenomenon. Gibbs energies of binding were calculated for several SARS-SoV-2 strains, including Hu-1 (wild type), B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.36 and B.1.617 (Delta). The least negative Gibbs energy of binding is that of Hu-1 strain, -37.97 kJ/mol. On the other hand, the most negative Gibbs energy of binding is that of the Delta strain, -49.50 kJ/mol. We used the more negative Gibbs energy of binding to explain the increased infectivity of newer SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to the wild type. Gibbs energies of binding was found to decrease chronologically, with appearance of new strains. The ratio of Gibbs energies of binding of mutated strains and wild type was used to define a susceptibility coefficient, which is an indicator of viral interference, where a virus can prevent or partially inhibit infection with another virus.

AB  - Positive experiences, such as social interaction, cognitive training and physical exercise, have been shown to ameliorate some of the harms to cognition associated with ageing. Animal models of positive interventions, commonly known as environmental enrichment, strongly influence neuronal morphology and synaptic function and enhance cognitive performance. While the profound structural and functional benefits of enrichment have been appreciated for decades, little is known as to how the environment influences neurons to respond and adapt to these positive sensory experiences. We show that adult and aged male wild-type mice that underwent a 10-week environmental enrichment protocol demonstrated improved performance in a variety of behavioural tasks, including those testing spatial working and spatial reference memory, and an enhancement in hippocampal LTP. Aged animals in particular benefitted from enrichment, performing spatial memory tasks at levels similar to healthy adult mice. Many of these benefits, including in gene expression, were absent in mice with a mutation in an enzyme, MSK1, which is activated by BDNF, a growth factor implicated in rodent and human cognition. We conclude that enrichment is beneficial across the lifespan and that MSK1 is required for the full extent of these experience-induced improvements of cognitive abilities, synaptic plasticity and gene expression.

AB  - The bioremediation of digestate using microalgae presents a solution to the current eutrophication issue in Northwest Europe, where the use of digestate as soil fertiliser is limited, thus resulting in an excess of digestate. Ammonium is the main nutrient of interest in digestate for microalgal cultivation, and improving its availability and consequent uptake is crucial for optimal bioremediation. This work aimed to determine the influence of pH on ammonium availability in cultures of two green microalgae, additionally screened for their growth performances on three digestates produced from different feedstocks, demonstrating the importance of tailoring a microalgal strain and digestate for bioremediation purposes. Results showed that an acidic pH of 6-6.5 resulted in a better ammonium availability in the digestate media, translated into better growth yields for both S. obliquus (GR: 0.099 +/- 0.001 day(-1); DW: 0.23 +/- 0.02 g L-1) and C. vulgaris (GR: 0.09 +/- 0.001 day(-1); DW: 0.49 +/- 0.012 g L-1). This result was especially true when considering larger-scale applications where ammonium loss via evaporation should be avoided. The results also demonstrated that digestates from different feedstocks resulted in different growth yields and biomass composition, especially fatty acids, for which, a digestate produced from pig manure resulted in acid contents of 6.94 +/- 0.033% DW and 4.91 +/- 0.3% DW in S. obliquus and C. vulgaris, respectively. Finally, this work demonstrated that the acclimation of microalgae to novel nutrient sources should be carefully considered, as it could convey significant advantages in terms of biomass composition, especially fatty acids and carbohydrate, for which, this study also demonstrated the importance of harvesting time.

AB  - Natural visual experience involves a continuous series of related images while the subject is immobile. How does the cortico-hippocampal circuit process a visual episode? The hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory, but most rodent single unit studies require spatial exploration or active engagement. Hence, we investigated neural responses to a silent movie (Allen Brain Observatory) in head-fixed mice without any task or locomotion demands, or rewards. Surprisingly, a third (33%, 3379/10263) of hippocampal -dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1 and subiculum- neurons showed movie-selectivity, with elevated firing in specific movie sub-segments, termed movie-fields, similar to the vast majority of thalamo-cortical (LGN, V1, AM-PM) neurons (97%, 6554/6785). Movie-tuning remained intact in immobile or spontaneously running mice. Visual neurons had >5 movie-fields per cell, but only similar to 2 in hippocampus. The movie-field durations in all brain regions spanned an unprecedented 1000-fold range: from 0.02s to 20s, termed mega-scale coding. Yet, the total duration of all the movie-fields of a cell was comparable across neurons and brain regions. The hippocampal responses thus showed greater continuous-sequence encoding than visual areas, as evidenced by fewer and broader movie-fields than in visual areas. Consistently, repeated presentation of the movie images in a fixed, but scrambled sequence virtually abolished hippocampal but not visual-cortical selectivity. The preference for continuous, compared to scrambled sequence was eight-fold greater in hippocampal than visual areas, further supporting episodic-sequence encoding. Movies could thus provide a unified way to probe neural mechanisms of episodic information processing and memory, even in immobile subjects, across brain regions, and species.

AB  - Egg quality dictates fertility outcomes, and although there is a well-documented decline with advanced reproductive age, how it changes during puberty is less understood. Such knowledge is critical, since advances in Assisted Reproductive Technologies are enabling pre- and peri-pubertal patients to preserve fertility in the medical setting. Therefore, we investigated egg quality parameters in a mouse model of the pubertal transition or juvenescence (postnatal day; PND 11-40). Animal weight, vaginal opening, serum inhibin B levels, oocyte yield, oocyte diameter, and zona pellucida thickness increased with age. After PND 15, there was an age-associated ability of oocytes to resume meiosis and reach metaphase of meiosis II (MII) following in vitro maturation (IVM). However, eggs from the younger cohort (PND 16-20) had significantly more chromosome configuration abnormalities relative to the older cohorts and many were at telophase I instead of MII, indicative of a cell cycle delay. Oocytes from the youngest mouse cohorts originated from the smallest antral follicles with the fewest cumulus layers per oocyte, suggesting a more developmentally immature state. RNA Seq analysis of oocytes from mice at distinct ages revealed that the genes involved in cellular growth signaling pathways (PI3K, mTOR, and Hippo) were consistently repressed with meiotic competence, whereas genes involved in cellular communication were upregulated in oocytes with age. Taken together, these data demonstrate that gametes harvested during the pubertal transition have low meiotic maturation potential and derive from immature follicular origins.

AB  - Lanthanum (La) is a natural rare-earth element that can damage the central nervous system and impair learning and memory. However, its neurotoxic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, adult female rats were divided into 4 groups and given distilled water solution containing 0%, 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5% LaCl3, respectively, and this was done from conception to the end of the location. Their offspring rats were used to establish animal models to investigate LaCl3 neurotoxicity. Primary neurons cultured in vitro were treated with LaCl3 and infected with LKB1 overexpression lentivirus. The results showed that LaCl3 exposure resulted in abnormal axons in the hippocampus and primary cultured neurons. LaCl3 reduced the expression of LKB1, p-LKB1, STRAD and M025 proteins, and directly or indirectly affected the expression of LKB1, leading to decreased activity of LKB1-MARK2 and LKB1-STK25-GM130 pathways. This study indicated that LaCl3 exposure could interfere with the normal effects of LKB1 in the brain and downregulate LKB1-MARK2 and LKB1-STK25-GM130 signaling pathways, resulting in abnormal axon in offspring rats.

AB  - Trophic factors are secreted proteins that can modulate neuronal integrity, structure, and function. Previous preclinical studies have shown synergistic effects on decreasing apoptosis and improving behavioral performance after stroke when combining two such trophic factors, erythropoietin (EPO) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). However, EPO can elevate the hematocrit level, which can be life-threatening for non-anemic individuals. A chemically engineered derivative of EPO, carbamoylated EPO (CEPO), does not impact hematological parameters but retains neurotrophic effects similar to EPO. To obtain insight into CEPO and IGF-1 combination signaling, we examined immediate early gene (IEG) expression after treatment with CEPO, IGF-1, or CEPO + IGF-1 in rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and found that combining CEPO and IGF-1 produced a synergistic increase in IEG expression. An in vivo increase in the protein expression of Npas4 and Nptx2 was also observed in the rat hippocampus. We also examined which kinase signaling pathways might be mediating these effects and found that while AKT inhibition did not alter the pattern of IEG expression, both ERK and JAK2 inhibition significantly decreased IEG expression. These results begin to define the molecular effects of combining CEPO and IGF-1 and indicate the potential for these trophic factors to produce positive, synergistic effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to occur when abnormal amounts of the proteins amyloid beta and tau aggregate in the brain, resulting in a progressive loss of neuronal function. Hippocampal neurons in transgenic mice with amyloidopathy or tauopathy exhibit altered intrinsic excitability properties. We used deep hybrid modeling (DeepHM), a recently developed parameter inference technique that combines deep learning with biophysical modeling, to map experimental data recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons in transgenic AD mice and age-matched wildtype littermate controls to the parameter space of a conductance-based CA1 model. Although mechanistic modeling and machine learning methods are by themselves powerful tools for approximating biological systems and making accurate predictions from data, when used in isolation these approaches suffer from distinct shortcomings: model and parameter uncertainty limit mechanistic modeling, whereas machine learning methods disregard the underlying biophysical mechanisms. DeepHM addresses these shortcomings by using conditional generative adversarial networks to provide an inverse mapping of data to mechanistic models that identifies the distributions of mechanistic modeling parameters coherent to the data. Here, we demonstrated that DeepHM accurately infers parameter distributions of the conductance-based model on several test cases using synthetic data generated with complex underlying parameter structures. We then used DeepHM to estimate parameter distributions corresponding to the experimental data and infer which ion channels are altered in the Alzheimer's mouse models compared to their wildtype controls at 12 and 24 months. We found that the conductances most disrupted by tauopathy, amyloidopathy, and aging are delayed rectifier potassium, transient sodium, and hyperpolarization-activated potassium, respectively.

AB  - Investigating novel mechanisms of neurite outgrowth via cytoskeleton is critical for developing thera-peutic strategies against neural disorders. Rab3A is a vesicle-related protein distributed throughout the nervous system, but the detailed mechanism related to cytoskeleton remains largely unknown. Our previous reports show that spastin serves microtubule to regulate neurite outgrowth. Here, we asked whether Rab3A could function via modulating spastin during neuronal development. The results revealed that Rab3A colocalized with spastin in cultured hippocampal neurons. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Rab3A physically interacted with spastin in rat brain lysates. Rab3A overexpression significantly induced spastin degradation; this effect was reversed by leupeptin-or MG-132- adminis-tration, suggesting the lysosomal and ubiquitin-mediated degradation system. Immunofiuorescence staining further confirmed that Rab3A and spastin immune-colocalized with the lysosome marker lysotracker. In COS7 cells, Rab3A overexpression significantly downregulated spastin expression and abolished the spastin-mediated microtubule severing. Furthermore, overexpression inhibited while ge-netic knockdown of Rab3A promoted neurite outgrowth. However, this inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons could be reversed via co-transfection of spastin, indicating that Rab3A functions via its interaction protein spastin. In general, our data identify an interaction between Rab3A and spastin, and this interaction affects the protein stability of spastin and eliminates its microtubule severing function, thereby modulating neurite outgrowth.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Eosinophil-mediated pathophysiology is tissue destructive and tissue altering with proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and profibrotic effects. The distinctive morphology of an eosinophil reveals a cytoplasm chockfull of unique granules, and the granule proteins have numerous toxic effects on cells, tissues, and organs. Eosinophils are not found in most human tissues, and eosinophil involvement in diseased tissues generally is identified by cell infiltration on histopathologic examination. However, eosinophils characteristically lose their structural integrity and deposit granules and granule proteins at sites of inflammation. Hence, their participation in tissue damage may be underrecognized or entirely overlooked. The eosinophil major basic protein 1 is a toxic granule protein and, when deposited, persists in tissues. Major basic protein 1 deposition can be regarded as a footprint of eosinophil activity. Analyses of numerous eosinophil-related diseases have demonstrated clear-cut evidence of major basic protein 1 deposition in affected tissues where eosinophils were not recognized by hematoxylin and eosin tissue staining and light microscopy. Eosinophil granule protein deposition, as exemplified by localization of major basic protein 1, especially when disproportionately greater than cellular infiltration, emerges as a biomarker of hidden eosinophil-related pathophysiology. Consequently, current assessments of recognized eosinophils may vastly underestimate their role in disease.

AB  - Context Paeoniflorin (PF) and calycosin-7-glucoside (CG, Paeonia lactiflora Pall. extract) have demonstrated protective effects in ischaemic stroke. Objective To investigate the synergistic effects of PF + CG on ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro. Materials and methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). After MCAO/R for 24 h, rats were randomly subdivided into 5 groups: sham, model (MCAO/R), study treatment (PF + CG, 40 + 20 mg/kg), LY294002 (20 mg/kg), and study treatment + LY294002. Males were given via intragastric administration; the duration of the in vivo experiment was 8 days. Neurologic deficits, cerebral infarction, brain edoema, and protein levels were assessed in vivo. Hippocampal neurons (HT22) were refreshed with glucose-free DMEM and placed in an anaerobic chamber for 8 h. Subsequently, HT22 cells were reoxygenated in a 37 degrees C incubator with 5% CO2 for 6 h. SOD, MDA, ROS, LDH and protein levels were measured in vitro. Results PF + CG significantly reduced neurobehavioral outcomes (21%), cerebral infarct volume (44%), brain edoema (1.6%) compared with the MCAO/R group. Moreover, PF + CG increased p-PI3K/PI3K (4.69%, 7.4%), p-AKT/AKT (6.25%, 60.6%) and Bcl-2/BAX (33%, 49%) expression in vivo and in vitro, and reduced GSK-3 beta (10.5%, 9.6%) expression. In vitro, PF + CG suppressed apoptosis in HT22 cells and decreased ROS and MDA levels (20%, 50%, respectively). Conclusions PF + CG showed a synergistic protective effect against ischaemic brain injury, potentially being a future treatment for ischaemic stroke.

AB  - The cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) plays a key role in blood transfusion therapy. Traditional cryoprotectants (CPAs) are mostly organic solvents and may cause side effects to RBCs, such as hemolysis and membrane damage. Therefore, it is necessary to find CPAs with a better performance and lower toxicity. Herein, we report for the first time that N-[Tri(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine (tricine) showed a great potential in the cryopreservation of sheep RBCs. The addition of tricine significantly increased the thawed RBCs' recovery from 19.5 +/- 1.8% to 81.2 +/- 8.5%. The properties of thawed RBCs were also maintained normally. Through mathematical modeling analysis, tricine showed a great efficiency in cryopreservation. We found that tricine had a good osmotic regulation capacity, which could mitigate the dehydration of RBCs during cryopreservation. In addition, tricine inhibited ice recrystallization, thereby decreasing the mechanical damage from ice. Tricine could also reduce oxidative damage during freezing and thawing by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. This work is expected to open up a new path for the study of novel CPAs and promote the development of cryopreservation of RBCs.

AB  - Camels (Camelus dromedarius) are seasonal short-day breeders, regulated by photoperiod and melatonin secretion. However, no studies have explored melatonin levels in camel seminal plasma or their relationship with testosterone, age, or climatic factors, nor is it known whether melatonin receptors exist in camel spermatozoa to respond to seminal melatonin. This study aimed to analyze melatonin levels in camel seminal plasma and its specific receptors in spermatozoa. Semen samples were obtained from November to March (breeding season). Testosterone and melatonin levels were measured in seminal plasma by ELISA. Melatonin receptors were localized in spermatozoa using immunofluorescence, and their presence was confirmed by Western Blot. Melatonin levels were higher from November to January and decreased in February and March. No correlation between testosterone and melatonin levels was found, but both hormones were negatively correlated with daylength (p = 0.0089 and p = 0.0688, respectively). Testosterone, but not melatonin, levels were affected by age. Two melatonin receptors (MT1, MT2) were detected on camel spermatozoa, with several immunotypes labeled mainly in the tail and post-acrosome region, but also in the acrosome and neck. Western Blot analysis confirmed the presence of these receptors, showing a 39 kDa band for MT1 and a 36 kDa band for MT2. Understanding melatonin's effects on sperm could help ejaculates' processing procedures, semen handling, and infertility issues in camels.

TI  - Differentiating between urban flood risk as a unitary problem and as a strand in a braided problem set: Implications for administrative coordination

AB  - Flood protection is a leading priority for urban water sustainability. Making cities more resilient to flooding has become urgent as the climate changes and as cities increasingly become the loci of human population and resources. Reducing the risk of future flooding in cities often necessitates different jurisdictions working together. They may do so because they confront a shared problem. This was the case in the City of Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, when partnering agencies shared a single focus on reducing flood risk from Beal Slough to the Nebraska State Penitentiary. In contrast, entities may band together to confront braided problems, intertwined problems that cannot be resolved independently. The Antelope Valley Project, also in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA, combined addressing three problems, for which individual solutions had not been achieved: reducing flood risk from Antelope Creek, improving road transportation safety and capacity, and revitalizing neighborhoods with deteriorating physical structures. Such a scenario is becoming more frequent as cities increasingly face multiple demands on the same location. As this comparative case study demonstrates, there are implications for administrative coordination for whether flood risk reduction can be achieved as a sole focus of a project and when it cannot. The Antelope Valley Project necessitated an innovative management structure and governance process that the Beal Slough Project did not. In the Antelope Valley Project three different, stand-alone entities operating in dissimilar, substantive domains redirected their independent policies to harmonize their problem solving. Collaborative learning among policy actors in the Antelope Valley was more extensive and across policy domains than was required in the Beal Slough Project. Yet, both projects were triggered by policy-oriented learning from the remapping of their respective subwatersheds. The study contributes to understanding interdependency among policy problems and to reducing urban flood risk through administrative coordination.

AB  - The present study evaluated the effect of adding 0% (control), 30%, 40% and 50% SPMs (small-peptide chelating trace minerals) to replace ITMs (inorganic trace minerals) in the diets of Litopenaeus vannamei; 720 shrimp were randomly assigned to four treatments (six replicates per group, 30 shrimp per replicate) in a 42-day feeding trial. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the control, 40% SPM and 50% SPM groups in terms of the survival rate, weight gain rate, specific growth rate, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, or protein efficiency ratio; however, protein efficiency ratio was reduced in the 30% SPM group (p < 0.05). Glucose, triglyceride, and aspartate aminotransferase levels in the hemolymph of the 30% SPM group were significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the glucose and aspartate aminotransferase levels were also significantly increased in the 40% SPM group (p < 0.05). In the 50% SPM group, the glucose and triglyceride levels were also significantly increased (p < 0.05). Hepatopancreatic alkaline phosphatase activity was elevated at 40% SPM, and alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity activities were significantly increased in the 50% SPM group (p < 0.05). The moisture content and drip loss were reduced in both the 40% and 50% SPM groups (p < 0.05). Therefore, replacing 40-50% ITMs with SPMs can maintain growth performance while enhancing physiological functions. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the incorporation of 30-50% SPMs into one's diet constitutes a viable alternative to 100% ITMs.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is a highly pathogenic small ruminant animal that causes considerable incidence rate and mortality in animal species worldwide. Because its symptoms are not easy to be detected, it has brought a certain impact on the world economy. Since the first generation of anthelmintic drugs benzimidazoles was used in the market in the 1960s, different kinds of drugs have been gradually used in the treatment of parasitic infections. Due to the drug resistance of parasitic nematodes, it has a negative impact on the development of animal husbandry. In this paper, we reviewed the anthelmintic and its mechanism of action and the latest research progress, hoping to help ranchers find effective anthelmintic drugs and provide assistance for the development of new anthelmintic drugs.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha Syn), often co-existing with amyloid beta (A beta) pathology. Current treatments are largely symptomatic, highlighting a critical need for disease-modifying therapies. Evidence suggests that alpha Syn aggregates contribute to neuronal death in DLB, particularly when exacerbated by A beta. Given the role of autophagy in clearing misfolded proteins, exploring agents that promote this pathway is essential for developing effective treatments. Ambroxol (AMBX), a mucolytic drug, has demonstrated potential in activating glucocerebrosidase (GCase), an enzyme that enhances lysosomal function and facilitates the autophagic clearance of toxic protein aggregates, including alpha Syn. This study aims to evaluate AMBX's neuroprotective effects in a cellular model of DLB, with the goal of identifying new therapeutic agents that target the underlying pathology of DLB. In this study, HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells were exposed to alpha Syn and A beta, followed by AMBX treatment. Our results showed that AMBX significantly improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis in cells co-treated with alpha Syn and A beta. Additionally, AMBX restored GCase activity, promoted autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress, which in turn mitigated alpha Syn aggregation and phosphorylation. These findings suggest that by activating GCase and enhancing autophagy, AMBX may help alleviate DLB-associated neurodegeneration. This study underscores the potential of AMBX as a therapeutic agent for DLB and supports further investigation in animal models and clinical trials to validate its efficacy in neurodegenerative disease contexts.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.) Havil., popularly known as Kratom (KT), is a medicinal plant used for pain suppression in Southeast Asia. It has been claimed to assist drug users withdraw from methamphetamine (METH) dependence. However, its use was controversial and not approved yet. Aim of the study: This study was conducted to characterize local field potential (LFP) patterns in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the hippocampus (HP) in mice with METH conditioned place preference (CPP) that were treated with KT alkaloid extract. Materials and methods: Male Swiss albino ICR mice were implanted with intracraneal electrodes into the NAc and HP. To induce METH CPP, animals were injected intraperitoneally once a day with METH (1 mg/kg) and saline (0.9% w/v) alternately and put into METH/saline compartments to experience the associations between drug/ saline injection and the unique environmental contexts for 10 sessions. Control group received saline injection paired with both saline/saline compartments. On post-conditioning day, effects of 40 (KT40), 80 (KT80) mg/kg KT alkaloid extract and 20 mg/kg bupropion (BP) on CPP scores and LFP powers and NAc-HP coherence were tested. Results: Two-way ANOVA revealed significant induction of CPP by METH sessions (P < 0.01). Multiple comparisons indicated that METH CPP was completely abolished by KT80 (P < 0.001). NAc gamma I (30.0-44.9 Hz) and HP delta (1.0-3.9 Hz) powers were significantly increased in mice with METH CPP (P < 0.01). The elevated NAc gamma I was significantly suppressed by KT80 (P < 0.05) and the increased HP delta was significantly reversed by KT40 (P < 0.01) and KT80 (P < 0.001). In addition, NAc-HP coherence was also significantly increased in gamma I (30.0-44.9 Hz) frequency range (P < 0.05) but it was reversed by KT80 (P < 0.05). Treatment with BP did not produce significant effect on these parameters. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that KT alkaloid extract significantly reversed CPP scores and LFP patterns induced by METH administration. The ameliorative effects of the extract might be beneficial for treatment of METH craving and addiction.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The traditional Huoermai therapy is a treatment for insomnia used by the Tibetan people living on the Tibetan plateau in China. This therapy involves the use of Myristica fragrans Houtt. and Carum carvi L., along with fomentation and massage, and has shown significant clinical effects. However, the mechanism of how Huoermai therapy treats plateau insomnia needs further clarification. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of action of Huoermai essential oil (HEO) in treating plateau insomnia, focusing on the cAMP/CREB/BDNF/GABAergic pathway. Methods: The major components of Huoermai essential oil were identified by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for subsequent network pharmacology analysis. Proteomics techniques were employed to pinpoint disparities in brain tissue protein expression in a mouse model of plateau insomnia following Huoermai therapy administration, in conjunction with network pharmacology to forecast pathways related to hypoxia and insomnia. Plateau insomnia mouse model was established and the therapeutic impact of Huoermai essential oil was evaluated. Hematoxylin & Eosin staining(HE) was conducted to observe pathological damage to the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus structures. Changes in serotonin (5-HT), melatonin (MT), adenosine (AD), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in mouse brain tissue were gauged through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess sleep status and oxidative stress levels in mice. Molecular docking was employed to anticipate the target binding energy of Huoermai essential oil constituents. ELISA and Western Blot (WB) were used to ascertain the expression of cAMP/CREB/BDNF/GABAergic pathway. Results: The results indicated that HEO positively impacted intermittent hypobaric hypoxia-induced plateau insomnia in mice. Histological examination results showed that HEO ameliorated neuronal damage in specific regions of the brain affected by plateau insomnia, such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Through GC-MS analysis, 56 volatile oil components were identified. Subsequently, a combined network pharmacology and proteomics analyses led to selecting the cAMP/CREB/BDNF/GABAergic pathway for further study. ELISA experiments demonstrated that HEO treatment increased GABA and MT levels while significantly reducing 5-HT and adenosine levels in brain tissue of mice with plateau insomnia. WB results revealed that HEO ameliorated plateau insomnia by suppressing the hyperactivation of the cAMP pathway, increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) expression, and alleviating hypoxia-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, molecular docking results showed strong binding affinity of all pharmacological components to their targets and proteins in the brain. Conclusion: These results indicate that HEO significantly prolongs sleep duration in plateau insomniac mice and treats plateau insomnia by modulating levels of sleep-related regulators, modulating the cAMP pathway, increasing GABA receptor expression, and improving neuronal survival and anti-apoptosis.

AB  - This study advances biomass utilization by focusing on Camellia oleifera seed oil residues, specifically the shell (COS) and cake (COC). Three routes were designed to optimize resource usage: (1) raw biomass directly produced 217 g kg-1 biochar from COS; (2) green acidic pretreatment and pyrolysis resulted in 252.6-269.2 g kg-1 sugar and 175.6-208 g kg-1 biochar, respectively; and (3) combining pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and pyrolysis generated 355.6-422.2 g kg-1 sugar and 138.6-148 g kg-1 biochar. This process not only enhances biomass economics through high sugar production, but also creates excellent porous carbon materials, attained without supplementary treatments. Through systematic characterization, analysis, and interpretation, the study delved into the unique properties of the biochar materials. These in-depth investigations revealed critical insights into their structure and functionality. Consequently, the study envisions a wide range of potential applications for these biochars, including energy production, agricultural enhancement, wastewater purification, and carbon sequestration. The designed process exemplifies its adherence to green chemistry principles, stemming from its straightforward methodology and high resource efficiency, resulting in substantial waste reduction and minimized reagent consumption.

AB  - Proper skin barrier function is paramount for our survival, and, suffering injury, there is an acute need to restore the lost barrier and prevent development of a chronic wound. We hypothesize that rapid wound closure is more important than immediate perfection of the barrier, whereas specific treatment may facilitate perfection. The aim of the current project was therefore to evaluate the quality of restored tissue down to the molecular level. We used Gottingen minipigs with a multi-technique approach correlating wound healing progression in vivo over three weeks, monitored by classical methods (e.g., histology, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), pH) and subsequent physicochemical characterization of barrier recovery (i.e., small and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (SWAXD), polarization transfer solid-state NMR (PTssNMR), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)), providing a unique insight into molecular aspects of healing. We conclude that although acute wounds sealed within two weeks as expected, molecular investigation of stratum corneum (SC) revealed a poorly developed keratin organization and deviations in lipid lamellae formation. A higher lipid fluidity was also observed in regenerated tissue. This may have been due to incomplete lipid conversion during barrier recovery as glycosphingolipids, normally not present in SC, were indicated by infrared FTIR spectroscopy. Evidently, a molecular approach to skin barrier recovery could be a valuable tool in future development of products targeting wound healing.

AB  - This article summarizes a Symposium on 'Radiation risks of the central nervous system' held virtually at the 67th Annual Meeting of the Radiation Research Society, 3-6 October 2021. Repeated low-dose radiation exposure over a certain period could lead to reduced neuronal proliferation, altered neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and various neurological complications, including psychological consequences, necessitating further research in these areas. Four speakers from radiation biology, genetics and epidemiology presented the latest data from their studies seeking insights into this important topic. This symposium highlighted new and important directions for further research on mental health disorders, neurodegenerative conditions and cognitive impairment. Future studies will examine risks of mental and behavioral disorders and neurodegenerative diseases following protracted radiation exposures to better understand risks of occupational exposures as well as provide insights into risks from exposures to galactic cosmic rays.
   The Million Person Study of Low-Dose Health Effects (MPS) is evaluating the risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia following intakes of radionuclides and after low-LET external radiation in the workplace. A recent study of Mayak workers in Russia suggested a link with Parkinson's disease following low-LET radiation. High-LET radiation from galactic cosmic ray simulations have reported the potential to accelerate the development of Alzheimer's disease, dementia and anxiety disorders in experimental studies. To date, seven MPS cohorts have evaluated Parkinson's disease at the level of mortality among 515,857 workers and veterans. The excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy dose to brain was estimated for nuclear power plant workers (NPP), industrial radiographers (IR), medical radiation workers (MRW), nuclear weapons test participants and former DOE workers at Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, Mound facility in Ohio, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. There was a general tendency for the risk of Parkinson's disease to increase with increasing estimates of radiation dose to brain. The pooled ERR per 100 mGy for the combined NPP + IR + MRW cohorts was 0.30 (95% CI 0.08, 0.56). Confirmation of these associations are being sought from ongoing studies of an additional 300,000 workers and from linkages within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) databases for incidence data on Parkinson's disease for 600,000 workers. Further, a wide range of nonfatal conditions related to dementia and depression are being identified, as are cognitive impairment scores among 600,000 cohort workers alive in 1999 when the CMS data systems became available.
   Neuroinflammation and synaptic loss have been implicated in cognitive dysfunction seen after brain radiation exposure. Based on evidence that elements of the complement cascade are critical for synaptic pruning by microglia during development and are upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases and aging where synapse density is reduced, we previously demonstrated that deletion of complement receptor 3 (CR3), which is expressed on microglia, protected male mice from dendritic spine loss in the molecular layer of the hippocampus after radiation exposure. Using Thy1-eYFP mice with or without the CR3 receptor, we also found a clear correlation between microglial activation, spine loss and cognitive dysfunction 30 d after 10 Gy cranial irradiation, only in male mice, that is dependent on CR3 expression. Moreover, treatment with leukadherin-1 (LA1), which engages the CR3 receptor, prevents spine loss and cognitive dysfunction due to radiation exposure. To guide application of potential therapeutic interventions, we carried out time course analyses of synaptic density, microglial activation and complement deposition and found that these processes are initiated in the first few days following radiation exposure, suggesting a relatively acute response with long-lasting consequences.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been growing interest in the fortification of dairy products with antioxidants and phenolics derived from plant byproducts and herbs. The present study focused on the analysis of dairy products, including kefir, cream cheese, yogurt, and vegan yogurt, enhanced with aqueous extracts of plant byproducts (Citrus aurantium peel, Citrus limon peel and Rosa canina seed) and herbs (Sideritis spp., Hypericum perforatum, Origanum dictamnus, Mentha pulegium L., Melissa oficinallis, Mentha spicata L. and Lavandula angustifolia) to characterize their antioxidant content, phenolic profile, and organoleptic characteristics. Antioxidant and phenolic content were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays and presented values up to 46.61 +/- 7.22 mmol Fe2+/L and 82.97 +/- 4.29 mg gallic acid (GAE)/g, respectively for the aqueous extracts, as well as up to 0.68 +/- 0.06 mmol Fe2+/L and 2.82 +/- 0.36 mg GAE/g for the fortified dairy products. The bioavailability of antioxidants and phenolics in fortified foods was determined after in vitro digestion and ranged between 4 and 68%. The phytochemical profile of the aqueous extracts was determined by mass spectrometry, and 162 phytochemicals were determined, from which 128 belong to the polyphenol family including flavonoids and phenolic acids. Furthermore, most of the identified compounds have been recorded to possess enhanced antioxidant capacity in correlation to the in vitro findings. Finally, organoleptic evaluation showed an overall acceptability around 3.0 +/- 1.0 on a 5-point scale. In conclusion, the studied plants and herbal extracts can be used for the fortification of a variety of dairy products with potential positive effects on human health.

AB  - Cultures have usually been studied as a purely human phenomenon. Recent research challenges this single-focused perspective on exclusively human agency in the formation and sustainability of cultures and offers a more inclusive format for exploring cultural processes, specifically the role that human and animal co-existence plays in them. Owing to its close historically rooted ties with such animals as camels, Bedouin culture in Oman has been selected as a fertile ground for researching how cultures are constructed through human-camel relations. Camel racing events have been chosen as a highly appropriate context for observing human-camel interactions owing to their abundance and cultural significance. The primary research method used was informal conversations with 13 adult racing-camel owners and keepers, together with 10 child camel owners, conducted between 2017 and 2021. The themes of the conversations about camels were centered on the cameleers' interpretations of racing-camel behavior in relation to humans. The collected narratives revealed the interviewees' perceptions of and thoughts on camels' resemblance to humans justified by their observations and perceptions of camels experiencing emotions and feelings, such as sense of ego/personality, sense of pride, sense of shame, the ability to enact revenge, and feelings of sorrow or sadness. The findings confirm that camels are wrapped up in the identity and culture of Omani Bedouins and actively contribute to the creation of that culture by co-shaping the emotional and cognitive landscape of their shared reality with humans.

AB  - Background: Samhwangsasim-tang (SST) is a traditional medicine used to treat hypertension and arteriosclerosis. Additionally, due to the effects of its constituent herbs, SST is considered effective for memory-related disorders. Purpose: We investigated the effects of SST on neuronal survival and memory in glutamate-induced hippocampal cells and in a mouse model of scopolamine-induced memory impairment.Methods: SST components were identified using 3D-ultra performance liquid chromatography (3D-UPLC). In vitro, we induced glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in HT22 cells after SST pretreatment. We used a cell counting kit-8 and cell cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting to test the protective effects of SST on neuronal death. In vivo, C57BL/6J mice were administered with 150 and 300 mg/kg SST once daily for 7 days and then intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg/kg scopolamine for 7 days to induce cognitive impairment. We then measured cognitive behavior using a novel object recognition test (NORT) and passive avoidance test (PAT) and analyzed the histological and protein changes.Results: Our results showed that treatment with 50 and 100 mu g/ml SST provided significant protection against glutamate-induced cell death. Flow cytometry and western blotting results suggested that 100 mu g/ml SST treatment reduced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. SST treatment also increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor, TrkB receptor, and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) activation while reducing the P75NTR and JNK signaling activation. Our in vivo results showed that SST administration improved cognitive impairment, similar to donepezil treatment (as a positive control), in NORT and PAT. SST and donepezil decreased neuronal cell death and apoptosis, and acetylcholine levels were increased in the scopolamine-treated hippocampus. Additionally, SST promoted CREB phosphorylation and BDNF maturation while reducing JNK and P75NTR activation; in contrast, donepezil did not alter levels of these proteins in the scopolamine-treated mouse hippocampus. Conclusion: Our results suggest that SST has neuroprotective effects to attenuate neuronal cell death and oxidative stress through CREB/JNK signaling via BDNF activation. SST may regulate endogenous survival factors in the hippocampus, which may be a safe and potential clinical treatment for cognitive impairment in AD.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zerumbone (ZER) is a humulane sesquiterpenoid isolated from Syringa pinnati-folia Hemsl. (SP), its content accounts for 64.7% of volatile oil and 0.86% of total ethanol extract (TEE), rep-resenting one of characteristic ingredient of SP. As a representative Mongolian medicine with anti-"Khii", anti -asthma, and clearing-heat effects, SP has been used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, upset, insomnia, and other symptoms.Aim of study: Previous results showed that TEE has sedative effect, but the pharmacological substances and its sedative mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether ZER, as one of major and charac-teristic sesquiterpenoids of SP, contributes to the sedative effect of SP and its underlying mechanism.Materials and methods: Locomotor activity and threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium sleep experiments were used to evaluate the sedative effects in mice. ELISA assay was used to examine the level of GABA/Glu ratio in rats hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus tissue. The binding ability of ZER with glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and Gephyrin protein were predicted by molecular docking. Western blot and Immunohistochemistry assay were used to determine the expression of GABAergic nerve system related proteins (GAD67, Gephyrin) in rat's hypothalamus. ZER was co-administrated with flumazenil and bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) to determine whether it acts on GABAA receptor. Furthermore, MQAE assay was used to test the effect of ZER on the chloride ion concentration in cerebellar granule cells.Results: Current data demonstrated that ZER dose-dependently (5-20 mg/kg) reduces the locomotor activity and sleep latency of mice, and extend sleeping time of mice. The results of ELISA showed that ZER increases the level of GABA/Glu in rats brain tissue, in particular in hypothalamus. Molecular docking results revealed that ZER has a strong affinity to GAD67 and Gephyrin protein. The Western blot and Immunohistochemistry data indicated that ZER up-regulates the expression of GAD67 and Gephyrin protein in rat's hypothalamus. Antagonism test results demonstrated that flumazenil and bicuculline reverse the effect of ZER on threshold dose of pentobarbital sodium sleep experiments. In addition, ZER also could dose-dependently (5-20 mu M) increase the chloride ion concentration in cerebellar granule cell, suggesting that ZER induces the opening of chloride channel, exerts central inhibitory effect.Conclusion: ZER has a significant sedative effect in mice and rat, and the effect is associated with GABAergic nervous system. The present results suggest that ZER, as one of the major bioactive ingredients of SP, contributes to the sedative effect and provide substantial evidence for its traditional use of anti-"Khii" in clinic of Syringa pinnatifolia.

AB  - Background: Depression is a mental disorder that seriously affects global health, and its pathogenesis involves multiple factors, including changes in neuroplasticity. The neuroplasticity hypothesis suggests that there may be functional and structural abnormalities in synaptic plasticity, neuronal generation and maturation, neural circuits and related signaling pathways in patients with depression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as a traditional treatment method, has attracted increasing attention in the field of neuropharmacology in recent years due to its high efficiency and low toxicity. Purpose: This article will systematically review the neuroplasticity changes in key brain regions and related mechanisms of depression, with a focus on the recent research progress in traditional Chinese herbal medicine intervention on neuroplasticity, to provide new ideas and strategies for the treatment of depression. Methods: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of Chinese herbal medicine's antidepressant actions through promoting neuroplasticity, data were collected from CNKI, Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect through November 2024. In addition, a classification and summary of Chinese herbal medicine to restore neuroplasticity was performed. Results: Brain regions such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala are closely associated with neuroplasticity in depression. Moreover, the glutamatergic system, neurotrophic factors, monoamine neurotransmitters, and neuroinflammation are the main mechanisms that regulate neuroplasticity. The benefits o extracts, active ingredients, and formulas of Chinese herbal medicine on neuroplasticity through multiple pathways have been widely reported. Conclusion: The enhancement of neuroplasticity and regulation of its endogenous molecular pathways offer novel therapeutic paradigms for employing botanical interventions in depression management. Future investigations should prioritize mechanistic exploration through integrated preclinical-clinical approaches to elucidate how Chinese herbal formulations modulate neuroplasticity, which decipher the multi-target pharmacological actions underlying botanical antidepressants' therapeutic efficacy.f

AB  - Dermatan sulfate is one of the major glycosaminoglycan (GAG) present in the animal hides, which is a waste/ byproduct from meat industry. Efficient utilization of these meat industry wastes is garnering attention because these wastes render a possibility for their conversion into useful products. With the increased concerns over health, various initiatives have been developed to permit more efficient utilization of these by-products and thereby directly impacting environmental sustainability. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an efficient and environmentally safe ionic liquid-assisted enzymatic process for the extraction of dermatan sulfate from buffalo hides. Dermatan sulfate has been extracted, separated, and purified from the GAG mixture using ILassisted enzymatic digestions and chromatographic separations. NMR, FT-IR, and ESI-MS measurements showed typical characteristic peaks for dermatan sulfate. The advantages of this eco-friendly process adopted include i) use of fewer chemicals, ii) elimination of harsh chemicals, iii) elimination of various steps and substeps, iv) reduction in process time (12 h), and v) increase in extraction yield by 75% when compared to conventional enzymatic process (57%). Thus, the use of ionic liquids alongside enzymes will serve as an efficient methodology for the futuristic development of these derived GAGs for their potential applications.

AB  - Introduction: In a previous retrospective study using postmortem human brain tissues, we demonstrated that loss of Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) in the temporal cortex of a subset of Alzheimer's patients was associated with poor survival, whereas similar loss in the hippocampus showed no such association. Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies Alzheimer's pathogenesis. Therefore, to investigate the mechanistic basis of our findings, we evaluated cortical mitochondrial phenotypes in Chrm1 knockout (Chrm1(-/-)) mice. Cortical Chrm1 loss resulted in reduced respiration, reduced supramolecular assembly of respiratory protein complexes, and caused mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities. These mouse-based findings mechanistically linked cortical CHRM1 loss with poor survival of Alzheimer's patients. However, evaluation of the effect of Chrm1 loss on mouse hippocampal mitochondrial characteristics is necessary to fully understand our retrospective human tissue-based observations. This is the objective of this study.
   Methods: Enriched hippocampal and cortical mitochondrial fractions (EHMFs/ECMFs, respectively) derived from wild-type and Chrm1(-/-) mice were used to measure respiration by quantifying real-time oxygen consumption, supramolecular assembly of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-associated proteins by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, post-translational modifications (PTMs) by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and mitochondrial ultrastructure by electron microscopy.
   Results: In contrast to our previous observations in Chrm1(-/-) ECMFs, EHMFs of Chrm1(-/-) mice significantly increased respiration with a concomitant increase in the supramolecular assembly of OXPHOS-associated proteins, specifically Atp5a and Uqcrc2, with no mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations. IEF of ECMFs and EHMFs from Chrm1(-/-) mice showed a decrease and an increase, respectively in a negatively charged (pH similar to 3) fraction of Atp5a relative to the wild-type mice, with a corresponding decrease or increase in the supramolecular assembly of Atp5a and respiration indicating a tissue-specific signaling effect.
   Discussion: Our findings indicate that loss of Chrm1 in the cortex causes structural, and physiological alterations to mitochondria that compromise neuronal function, whereas Chrm1 loss in the hippocampus may benefit neuronal function by enhancing mitochondrial function. This brain region-specific differential effect of Chrm1 deletion on mitochondrial function supports our human brain region-based findings and Chrm1(-/-) mouse behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, our study indicates that Chrm1-mediated brain region-specific differential PTMs of Atp5a may alter complex-V supramolecular assembly which in turn regulates mitochondrial structure-function.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ethyl acetate extract from Coreopsis tinctoria (EACC) on learning and memory impairment in d-galactose-induced aging mice and the underlying molecular mechanism. The composition of EACC was analyzed by UPLC-MS, and the targets and pathways of EACC to improve learning and memory impairment were predicted and analyzed by the network pharmacology method. A mouse aging model was established by subcutaneous injection of d-galactose in mice, and EACC and piracetam were given to the model mice by gavage to observe their behavioral changes and changes in their SOD and GSH-Px activities in MDA contents in their peripheral blood serum and in the contents of Glu and GABA in their brain tissues. Then the hippocampus of the three mice selected from each of the MOD group and EACC-H group was separated for RT-qPCR assay. The results of the animal experiments showed that EACC could improve the learning and memory impairment of model mice by affecting the level of oxidative stress enzymes in serum and the content of neurotransmitters in the brain tissue. The results of network pharmacology analysis showed that the EACC components corresponded to 74 learning and memory-related targets, of which 13 were enriched in the long-term potentiation pathway. The results of RT-qPCR showed that 12 of the 13 detected targets were consistent with the predicted targets, and 9 of them were located in the NMDA receptor-related pathway of the long-term potentiation process and the pathway played an important regulatory role. It is believed that EACC could improve the learning and memory impairment of d-galactose-induced aging mice by acting on the nine targets Grin1, Grin2a, Camk2a, Camk2b, Kras, Raf1, Mapk1, Mapk3 and Creb to affect the NMDA receptor-related pathway of long-term potentiation.

AB  - Our previous study demonstrated that the acute high-dose-rate (3.3 Gy/min) gamma-ray irradiation (gamma-irradiation) of postnatal day-3 (P3) mice with 5 Gy induced depression and drastic neuropathological changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of adult mice. The present study investigated the effects of chronic low-dose-rate (1.2 mGy/h) gamma-irradiation from P3 to P180 with a cumulative dose of 5 Gy on animal behaviour, hippocampal cellular change, and miRNA and mRNA expression in the hippocampus and blood in female mice. The radiation exposure did not significantly affect the animal's body weight, and neuropsychiatric changes such as anxiety and depression were examined by neurobehavioural tests, including open field, light-dark box, elevated plus maze, tail suspension, and forced swim tests. Immunohistochemical staining did not detect any obvious loss of mature and immature neurons (NeuN and DCX) or any inflammatory glial response (IBA1, GFAP, and PDGFR alpha). Nevertheless, gamma H2AX foci in the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus were significantly increased, suggesting the chronic low-dose-rate irradiation induced persistent DNA damage foci in mice. miRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR indicated an increased expression of miR-448-3p and miR-361-5p but decreased expression of miR-193a-3p in the mouse hippocampus. Meanwhile, mRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR showed the changed expression of some genes, including Fli1, Hs3st5, and Eif4ebp2. Database searching by miRDB and TargetScan predicted that Fli1 and Hs3st5 are the targets of miR-448-3p, and Eif4ebp2 is the target of miR-361-5p. miRNA/mRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR results in blood showed the increased expression of miR-6967-3p and the decreased expression of its target S1pr5. The interactions of these miRNAs and mRNAs may be related to the chronic low-dose-rate radiation-induced persistent DNA damage.

TI  - Identification of novel bat coronaviruses sheds light on the evolutionary origins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses
T2  - CELL
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the discovery of animal coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, the evolutionary origins of this virus are elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 bat samples collected from a small geographical region in Yunnan province, China, between May 2019 and November 2020. We identified 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related and three SARS-CoV-related viruses. Rhinolophus pusillus virus RpYN06 was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the genome, although it possessed a more divergent spike gene. The other three SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses carried a genetically distinct spike gene that could weakly bind to the hACE2 receptor in vitro. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species, with the largest contiguous hot-spots extending from South Laos and Vietnam to southern China.

AB  - The plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strain GB03) augments Arabidopsis glucosinolate defenses targeting the generalist herbivore Spodoptera exigua. With the goal to transfer such technology to an agricultural crop, bacterial-defense induction was monitored in the closely related species, Eruca sativa (arugula). Plant growth promotion and leaf protection against the herbivore specialist Plutella xylostella (diamondback-moth) was induced with GB03-seed inoculation. PGPR-induced herbivore protection correlated with greater gene induction encoding for glucosinolate biosynthesis. To monitor rhizosphere-specific GB03 proliferation, PGPR-specific primers were designed for qPCR gene amplification. Rhizosphere colonization was detected with GB03 inoculation for 28 days, while rhizosphere GB03 colonization diminished to below detection level after 21 days for insect-damaged plants. By selectively monitoring GB03 from a complex mix of soil microbes with seed inoculation, rhizosphere PGPR proliferation and foliar glucosinolate transcription for plant protection against the diamondback-moth specialist can be monitored in vivo under authentic field conditions.

AB  - Pregnancy complications adversely impact both mother and/or fetus throughout the lifespan. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs when a fetus fails to reach their intrauterine potential for growth, it is the second highest leading cause of infant mortality, and leads to increased risk of developing non-communicable diseases in later life due 'fetal programming'. Abnormal placental development, growth and/or function underlies approximately 75% of FGR cases and there is currently no treatment save delivery, often prematurely. We previously demonstrated in a murine model of FGR that nanoparticle mediated, intra-placental human IGF-1 gene therapy maintains normal fetal growth. Multiple models of FGR currently exist reflecting the etiologies of human FGR and have been used by us and others to investigate the development of in utero therapeutics as discussed here. In addition to the in vivo models discussed herein, utilizing human models including in vitro (Choriocarcinoma cell lines and primary trophoblasts) and ex vivo (term villous fragments and placenta cotyledon perfusion) we have demonstrated robust nanoparticle uptake, transgene expression, nutrient transporter regulation without transfer to the fetus. For translational gene therapy application in the human placenta, there are multiple avenues that require investigation including syncytial uptake from the maternal circulation, transgene expression, functionality and longevity of treatment, impact of treatment on the mother and developing fetus. The potential impact of treating the placenta during gestation is high, wide-ranging across pregnancy complications, and may offer reduced risk of developing associated cardio-metabolic diseases in later life impacting at both an individual and societal level.

AB  - Escin has effects on inflammation and is useful for the treatment of varicose veins and cancer. Scientific reports on the toxicity profile of escin are not available. Oral acute toxicity in rats was studied. At 2000 mg/kg, escin was lethal to all animals while at 300 mg/kg no signs of toxicity, changes in body weight, food and water consumption were observed within 14 days. A 28-days oral toxicity study was performed at daily doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of escin. Bodyweight, food, and water intake were not altered. There were neither significant changes in biochemical and hematological parameters nor any histopathological changes in organs after treatment with escin for 28 days. Escin was found to be safe at all selected dose levels in a repeated dose toxicity study.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are an important subfamily of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) in plants that play key roles in sensing different biotic and abiotic stress. However, the role of LRR-RLKs in herbivore-induced plant defense remains largely elusive. Here, we found that the expression of a rice gene, OsRLK7-1, was induced by mechanical wounding, but was slightly suppressed by the infestation of gravid females of brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) or white-backed planthopper (WBPH, Sogatella furcifera). Through targeted disruption of OsRLK7-1 (resulting in the ko-rlk lines), we observed an augmentation in transcript levels of BPH-induced OsMPK3, OsWRKY30, OsWRKY33, and OsWRKY45, alongside heightened levels of planthopper-induced jasmonic acid, JA-isoleucine, and abscisic acid in plant tissues. These dynamic changes further facilitated the biosynthesis of multiple phenolamides within the rice plants, culminating in an enhanced resistance to planthopper infestations under both lab and field conditions. In addition, knocking out OsRLK7-1 impaired plant growth and reproduction. These results suggest that OsRLK7-1 plays an important role in regulating rice growth, development, and rice-planthopper interactions.

AB  - Lead-based halide perovskite nanoparticles (Pb-PNPs) are promising alternatives for the next-generation of optoelectronic materials, while their nonnegligible biological behavior after exposure are still an enigma. Here, we clarify the translocation, biotransformation, and biodistribution related neurotoxicity of re-presentative CsPbBr3 PNPs in C57BL/6J mice after intranasal administration through a combination of the feat of advanced synchrotron radiation (SR) and traditional analytical techniques. SR-based microscopic X-ray fluorescence scanning, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and behavioral data demonstrate that CsPbBr3 PNPs can be transported and accumulated in the hippocampus, easily triggering Ca overload, causing severe damage of hippocampus-dependent learning, memory, and cognition behavior. Meanwhile, SR-based X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis also reveals that CsPbBr3 PNPs can transform into soluble and insoluble lead compounds in different physiological environments. The toxicity of CsPbBr3 PNPs is higher than that of soluble Pb(Ac)2 due to the sustained release of Pb ions. The CsPbBr3 PNPs cause nerve cell apoptosis through triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, upregulating reactive oxygen species production, while disordering the mitochondrial membrane potential. Our work provides significant in-sights into the neurological effects and mechanism of Pb-PNPs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the genus Hyles, Euphorbia feeding appears to have evolved twice independently, in H. euphorbiae but also in H. nicaea, a species which had not been studied for its detoxification processes before. Euphorbia is known to contain toxic secondary metabolites, including diterpene esters, preventing most herbivores from feeding on them. We investigated the metabolisation of the standard phorbol ester Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) and the diterpenes contained in Euphorbia cyparissias by the two species Hyles euphorbiae and Hyles nicaea (subspecies nicaea). For the first time, we report (1) The gut disposition of Hyles n. nicaea for this standard phorbol ester, which is commonly used in cancer and tumour research and (2) The disposition of the food plant tiglinaes of Euphorbia cyparissias after gut passage in both species and (3) Tigliane metabolites in the frass of TPA and of E. cyparissias feeding larvae. For both species around 5-25% of the TPA dose was recovered in the frass of the larvae, along with the metabolites phorbol and phorbol-13-acetate in very small amounts and traces. While the amounts of phorbol found did not differ much between the species frass, phorbol-13-acetate could be found in higher amounts in Hyles n. nicaea frass, indicating a difference in metabolisation. Moreover, enzymatic hydrolysis of TPA to phorbol-13-acetate and phorbol are postulated not to be the main metabolisation pathway, seeing that the amounts found only represent a small fraction of the TPA dose consumed.

AB  - Background: Targeting ferroptosis vulnerabilities in tumors has become an increasingly promising therapeutic strategy. While the regulatory effects of natural products on ferroptosis are progressively being elucidated, the role of cardiac glycosides in modulating ferroptosis remains poorly understood. Purpose: This study aims to investigate the ferroptosis-sensitizing effects of periplocymarin (PPM), a cardiac glycoside derived from the traditional plant Periploca sepium, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: The effects of PPM on ferroptosis regulation were comprehensively assessed through functional assays, followed by sequencing analysis to identify associated signaling pathways. Subsequent mechanistic validation experiments were conducted to confirm the upstream and downstream regulatory components involved in this ferroptosis-modulating axis. Results: PPM induced slow and mild apoptosis in gastric cancer cells through the inhibition of glycolysis. However, when combined with ferroptosis inducers, it promoted rapid and robust ferroptosis. In vivo, PPM sensitized gastric cancer xenografts to cisplatin-induced ferroptosis with no observable cardiotoxicity or renal impairment. Mechanistically, PPM targeted the alpha 1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (ATP1A1), leading to the activation of Src, which subsequently induced tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ in a Hippo-independent manner, promoting their nuclear translocation. The YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complex directly bound to the TFRC promoter region between nucleotides 401-409 upstream of the transcription start site, thereby activating TFRC transcription. This resulted in increased iron influx, elevated lipid peroxidation, and heightened sensitivity to ferroptosis. Notably, ATP1A1 was essential for ferroptosis resistance, as its knockdown mimicked the sensitizing effect of PPM on ferroptosis. Moreover, the oncogenic Src-YAP/TAZ-TFRC axis may have represented a ferroptosis vulnerability and a potential biomarker in ferroptosis therapy for cancer. Importantly, other cardiac glycosides targeting Na+/K+-ATPase, such as digitoxin and bufalin, also enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity in gastric cancer cells through activation of YAP/TAZ signaling. Conclusion: Our findings establish the cardiac glycoside PPM as a novel ferroptosis sensitizer that targets ATP1A1 to activate the Src-YAP/TAZ-TFRC axis, providing mechanistic insights for repurposing cardiac glycosides as ferroptosis modulators in precision combinatorial cancer therapy.

AB  - Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, and its outcome remains unsatisfactory. In recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators in cancers. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether and how circRNA_0057209 functioned in thyroid cancer. Initial results revealed that circRNA_0057209 and STK4 were both reduced, while miR-183 was up-regulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cells. Experiments including RNA pull-down and RIP assays further identified that upregulation of circRNA_0057209 augmented the expression of STK4, a target gene of miR-183, by competitively-binding to miR-183. Furthermore, functional experiments provided evidence that overexpression of circRNA_0057209 not only inhibited the proliferative, migratory, and invasive properties of thyroid cancer cells while facilitating their apoptosis but also delayed tumor growth. Conversely, upregulation of miR-183 or silencing of STK4 reversed the changes induced by circRNA_0057209. Meanwhile, mechanistic experimentation demonstrated that circRNA_0057209 promoted STK4 expression by sponging miR-183, while STK4 enhanced YAP phosphorylation to mediate the Hippo pathway, thereby suppressing tumor progression. Altogether, our findings indicated that circRNA_0057209 may serve as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-183 to increase STK4 expression, thus inhibiting the development of thyroid cancer.

AB  - Although 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and its receptors (ERs) are reported to play important roles in regulating oocyte maturation, the specific mechanism remains unclear. First, we performed immunohistochemistry analyses to determine the expression of the ER alpha and ER beta proteins in ovine ovarian tissue. Second, E2 (0.5 ng/mL and 1 mu g/ mL) were added to pre-IVM medium for 0 h, 1 h and 2 h. The effects of E2 (0.5 ng/mL and 1 mu g/mL) on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) and on oocyte meiotic progression were evaluated by ELISA and DAPI staining respectively. Third, the effects of E2 on the gene and protein expression of ER alpha and ER beta in COCs were investigated by Western blotting and real-time PCR. Afterward, ER beta and cAMP regulators were added to the 2-h pretreatment medium with or without E2 (0.5 ng/mL) to explore the possible interactions among E2, cAMP and ER beta. The results showed that both ER alpha and ER beta proteins were expressed in ovine cumulus layers and oocytes. E2 significantly increased intra-COC cAMP levels, maintained oocyte meiotic arrest, and promoted ER beta transcript and protein expression. E2 treatment increased the cAMP concentration, which was enhanced by ER beta agonist treatment and remarkably attenuated by ER beta inhibitor treatment. Forskolin plus IBMX treatment increased ER beta protein expression in COCs (P < 0.05), and this was attenuated by Rp-cAMP treatment. In conclusion, E2 (0.5 ng/mL) increased intra-COC cAMP levels by promoting ER beta expression, thereby maintaining oocyte meiotic arrest. cAMP in COCs has a positive feedback effect on ER beta expression, which provides a novel explanation for the positive role of E2 in regulating ovine follicle development and oocyte maturation.

AB  - Despite recent improvements in semi-captive African elephant habitats and husbandry, night-time behaviour patterns are still not well documented in this species. Hence, this study investigated resting behaviour when lying down, using data recorded nine African elephants maintained in semi-captivity in South Africa. A total of 111 nights were recorded over a 33-month period (2015-2018). Closed circuit television cameras were used to record the elephant's behaviour from 17:00-07:00. Three elephants were individually penned in a boma at night while the rest of the herd could move freely between the boma and an outdoor camp. Time laying down and standing up, location, resting side, head direction, sawdust quality, weather conditions, and number of elephants present in the boma were recorded. Data were analysed using linear mixed model and Chi-square test procedures. On average (+/- SE), the elephants slept laying down for 65.64 +/- 0.79 mins (1-267 mins). They laid down 3.22 +/- 0.05 times per night (0-8), with an average bout length of 69.79 +/- 2.65 min and switching side at a rate of 51.03%. No difference in resting duration when laying down was observed between sex, age category, resting side, head direction, whether they were penned or not, and location (P > 0.05). Elephants rested longer laying down between 01:00 and 04:00 (P < 0.0001), with a peak between 01:00 and 02:00. They also rested longer when the weather was clear as compared to overcast and rainy conditions (P < 0.0001). An intermediate freshness of sawdust also resulted in longer resting duration (P < 0.001). Furthermore, elephants laid down more when they were unpenned (P < 0.05); when the sawdust was at an intermediate freshness (P < 0.001); when the number of elephants in the boma was at an intermediate number of 4 (P < 0.001); when the weather was overcast (P < 0.001), and when the ambient temperature was mild (P < 0.001). They were observed laying down more often between 23:00 and 03:00 (P < 0.001), with mature adults preferring the areas opposite to the main entrance of the boma while the younger elephants preferred areas closer to the main entrance (P < 0.0001). Finally, high individual variations were observed in resting duration, number of bouts and average bout length. Further studies are therefore needed to investigate how preferences, personality traits, life-history and external factors associated with eco-tourism can affect the quality of resting laying down in captive African elephants.

AB  - Bradykinin (BK) is an active component of the kallikrein-kinin system that has been shown to have cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects. We previously showed that BK postconditioning strongly protects rat hippocampal neurons upon restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest. However, the precise mechanism underlying this process remains poorly understood. In this study, we treated a rat model of ROSC after cardiac arrest (induced by asphyxiation) with 150 mu g/kg BK via intraperitoneal injection 48 hours after ROSC following cardiac arrest. We found that BK postconditioning effectively promoted the recovery of rat neurological function after ROSC following cardiac arrest, increased the amount of autophagosomes in the hippocampal tissue, inhibited neuronal cell apoptosis, up-regulated the expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3 and NBR1 and down-regulated p62, inhibited the expression of the brain injury marker S100 beta and apoptosis-related protein caspase-3, and affected the expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway-related proteins. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibitor compound C clearly inhibited BK-mediated activation of autophagy in rats after ROSC following cardiac arrest, which aggravated the injury caused by ROSC. The mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin enhanced the protective effects of BK by stimulating autophagy. Our findings suggest that BK postconditioning protects against injury caused by ROSC through activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/mechanistic target of the rapamycin pathway.

AB  - As one of the most destructive pests, aphids cause significant damage on various agricultural and horticultural crops. Recently, melatonin has been shown to enhance plant resistance to aphids; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, our results showed that melatonin, MeJA, and H2S enhanced aphid resistance of watermelon in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by increases in the defense-related enzyme activities and lignin accumulation. On the plants pretreated with 100 & mu;M melatonin, 100 & mu;M MeJA, and 50 & mu;M NaHS, the numbers of aphids were 86.0%, 59.6%, and 47.9% lower than that on control plants, respectively, after aphid infestation for 7 days. Melatonin application induced MeJA and H2S accumulation in response to aphid infestation, while inhibition of MeJA and H2S accumulation attenuated or abolished melatonin-induced defense response and aphid resistance, suggestive of the involvement of MeJA and H2S in melatonin-induced aphid resistance. MeJA also increased H2S accumulation, but inhibition of MeJA biosynthesis prevented melatonin-enhanced H2S accumulation, suggesting that MeJA mediates melatonin-induced H2S accumulation. Furthermore, inhibition of H2S production attenuated MeJA-induced defense response and aphid resistance. Taken together, the current study reveals a novel mechanism in which MeJA-dependent H2S signaling is involved in melatonin-induced defense response and subsequent aphid resistance. The increasing concern to minimize the use of pesticides and to switch onto sustainable and natural control strategies indicates the great exploitation of such a mechanism in combating aphids.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to investigate whether ischemia/hypoxia conditions induce fatty acid transport from neurons to astrocytes and whether this mechanism is affected by ApoE isoforms.Methods and resultsA neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was established. Excessive accumulation of lipid droplets and upregulation of ApoE expression occurred in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex after hypoxia-ischemia, which implied the occurrence of abnormal fatty acid metabolism. Lipid peroxidation was induced in an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGDR) model of ApoE-/- primary neurons. The number of BODIPY 558/568 C12-positive particles (fatty acid markers) transferred from neurons to astrocytes was significantly increased with the addition of human recombinant ApoE compared with that in the OGDR group, which significantly increased the efficiency of fatty acid transport from neurons to astrocytes and neuronal viability. However, ApoE4 was found to be associated with lower efficiency in fatty acid transport and less protective effects in OGDR-induced neuronal cell death than both ApoE2 and ApoE3. COG133, an ApoE-mimetic peptide, partially compensated for the adverse effects of ApoE4. FABP5 and SOD1 gene and protein expression levels were upregulated in astrocytes treated with BODIPY 558/568 C12 particles.ConclusionsIn conclusion, ApoE plays an important role in mediating the transport of fatty acids from neurons to astrocytes under ischemia/hypoxia conditions, and this transport mechanism is ApoE isoform dependent. ApoE4 has a low transfer efficiency and may be a potential target for the clinical treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

AB  - 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) and leucovorin (LV) are often given in combination to treat colorectal cancer. 5-Fu/LV prevents cell proliferation by inhibiting thymidylate synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate to deoxythymidine monophosphate. While 5-Fu has been shown to cause cognitive impairment, the synergistic effect of 5-Fu with LV has not been fully explored. The present investigation was designed to assess how the combination of 5-Fu and LV affect cognition in a murine model. Six-month-old male mice were used in this study; 15 mice received saline injections and 15 mice received 5-Fu/LV injections. One month after treatment, the elevated plus maze, Y-maze, and Morris water maze behavioral tasks were performed. Brains were then extracted, cryosectioned, and stained for CD68 to assay microglial activation and with tomato lectin to assay the vasculature. All animals were able to locate the visible and hidden platform locations in the water maze. However, a significant impairment in spatial memory retention was observed in the probe trial after the first day of hidden-platform training (first probe trial) in animals that received 5-Fu/LV, but these animals showed spatial memory retention by day 5. There were no significant increases in inflammation as measured by CD68, but 5-Fu/LV treatment did modulate blood vessel morphology. Tandem mass tag proteomics analysis identified 6,049 proteins, 7 of which were differentially expressed with a p-value of 1.5. The present data demonstrate that 5-Fu/LV increases anxiety and significantly impairs spatial memory retention.

AB  - Depression is a common and complex neuropsychiatric disorder affecting people of all ages worldwide, associated with high rates of relapse and disability. Neohesperidin (NEO) is a dietary flavonoid with applications in therapeutics; however, its effects on depressive-like behavior remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the effects of NEO on depressive-like behavior induced by chronic and unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). NEO (25, 50, and 100 mg kg-1) treatment for two weeks dose-dependently improved CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior measured by the sucrose preference, open field, forced swimming, and tail suspension tests. Moreover, NEO effectively blocked the decrease of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity and the increase of malondialdehyde levels, which are markers of oxidative stress. In addition, NEO inhibited microglial activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations showed that NEO has good affinity for NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), suggesting that NEO may play an antidepressant role by regulating the NLRP3 signaling pathway. Western blotting results further revealed that the increased expression level of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, caspase-1, and ASC) in CUMS mice was significantly reversed by NEO treatment. These results suggest that NEO is a candidate for treating depression and should be considered for further clinical development.

AB  - Simple Summary There has been significant scientific progress in skin care and skin damage repair, but the complete understanding of skin homeostasis is still beyond our reach. With an increase in environmental stress factors, the incidence rates of skin cancer and skin disorders are on the rise. Taken together with the incidence of scar- and burn-related morbidities, there is an urgent need to understand interactions between skin cells to develop novel therapies for the regeneration of healthy skin. One of the recurrent stress factors affecting the skin are the harmful free radicals, also referred to as oxidative stress. This study aimed to address the influence of oxidative stress on the interaction between two types of skin cells, keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The study utilized cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) to induce oxidative stress in cells and to assess the interactions between the two cell types. We showed that CAP can stimulate cells to enhance their proliferation and migration. This study provides a further understanding of skin cell regulation under stress conditions. Such knowledge may help in designing treatment therapies for rapid wound healing and skin repair. Although the skin is constantly subjected to endogenous and exogenous stress, it maintains a homeostatic state through wound repair and regeneration pathways. Treatment for skin diseases and injury requires a significant understanding of the various mechanisms and interactions that occur within skin cells. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts interact with each other and act as key players in the repair process. Although fibroblasts and keratinocytes are widely studied in wound healing and skin remodeling under different conditions, the influence of redox stress on keratinocyte-fibroblast crosstalk has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we used cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) to generate and deliver oxidative stress to keratinocytes and fibroblasts and to assess its impact on their interactions. To this end, we used a well-established in vitro 3D co-culture model imitating a realistic scenario. Our study shows that low CAP exposure is biocompatible and does not affect the viability or energetics of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Exposure to low doses of CAP enhanced the proliferation rate of cells and stimulated the expression of key genes (KGF, MMP2, GMCSF, IL-6, and IL-8) in fibroblasts, indicating the activation and initiation of the skin repair process. Additionally, enhanced migration was observed under co-culture conditions under the given redox stress conditions, and expression of the upstream regulator and the effectors of the Hippo pathway (YAP and CYR61, respectively), which are associated with enhanced migration, were elevated. Overall, this study reinforces the application of CAP and redox stress in skin repair physiology.

AB  - The present study investigated the role of endothelial brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in cognition. Male adult mice with a selective knockout of BDNF in endothelial cells (BDNFECKO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to tests for detection of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and impaired recognition memory. Neuronal activity and synaptogenesis were assessed from hippocampal levels of c-fos and synaptophysin, respectively, and cerebral capillary density from forebrain levels of CD31. BDNF/TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase type B) receptor signaling was investigated through hippocampal levels of BDNF and activated TrkB receptors coupled with their immunolabeling by neurons and endothelial cells from both cerebrovascular fractions enriched in capillaries and hippocampal arterioles. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed from the expression of endothelial NO synthase phosphorylated at serine 1177. BDNFECKO mice exhibited anxio-depressive phenotype, impaired memory, and reduced synaptogenesis. Neither neuronal activity, neuronal BDNF/TrkB signaling, nor capillary density differed between BDNFECKO and WT mice. However, endothelial-activated TrkB receptors as well as endothelial NO production and hippocampal BDNF levels were lower in BDNFECKO than those in WT mice. We conclude that endothelial BDNF is involved in cognition through mechanisms independent of neuronal BDNF/TrkB signaling and that endothelial NO might be a driver of the procognitive effect of endothelial BDNF. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The study provides the proof of concept that endothelial brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in postnatal synaptogenesis and development of behavior/memory. It also shows that neuronal tropomyosin-related kinase type B (TrkB) receptors are not a target of endothelium-derived BDNF.

AB  - The present study was conducted to determine exact location where the acrosome reaction of fertilizing spermatozoa begins in the oviduct of the Chinese hamster. Unlike spermatozoa of other rodent species, Chinese hamster spermatozoa did not spontaneously undergo the acrosome reaction in fertilization-supporting media. In naturally mated females, spermatozoa in the uterus had intact acrosomes, whereas those in the lower oviductal isthmus had visibly thin acrosomal caps. The acrosomal cap was lost when spermatozoa passed through the cumulus oophorus. Thus, Chinese hamster spermatozoa begin the acrosome reaction in the lower isthmus and complete it in the cumulus oophorus. The mucosal epithelium of the oviductal isthmus released many "transparent" vesicles into the lumen, was very fragile and readily sloughed off by rough handling or rapid flushing with medium. Globular materials that oozed out of the dissected oviduct were most likely mucosa cells destroyed by rough handling. Although the oviducts of Chinese hamsters may be exceptionally delicate, this observation nevertheless warns us to cautiously handle the oviducts of any species when studying oviduct secretions that could be involved in inducing capacitation and the acrosome reaction of spermatozoa within the female genital tract.

AB  - Terpene synthases (TPSs), key gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of herbivore-induced terpenes, are pivotal in the diversity of terpene chemotypes across and within plant species. Here, we constructed a gene-based pangenome of the Gossypium genus by integrating the genomes of 17 diploid and 10 tetraploid species. Within this pangenome, 208 TPS syntelog groups (SGs) were identified, comprising 2 core SGs (TPS5 and TPS42) present in all 27 analyzed genomes, 6 softcore SGs (TPS11, TPS12, TPS13, TPS35, TPS37, and TPS47) found in 25 to 26 genomes, 131 dispensable SGs identified in 2 to 24 genomes, and 69 private SGs exclusive to a single genome. The mutational load analysis of these identified TPS genes across 216 cotton accessions revealed a great number of splicing variants and complex splicing patterns. The nonsynonymous/synonymous Ka/Ks value for all 52 analyzed TPS SGs was less than one, indicating that these genes were subject to purifying selection. Of 208 TPS SGs encompassing 1795 genes, 362 genes derived from 102 SGs were identified as atypical and truncated. The structural analysis of TPS genes revealed that gene truncation is a major mechanism contributing to the formation of atypical genes. An integrated analysis of three RNA-seq datasets from cotton plants subjected to herbivore infestation highlighted nine upregulated TPSs, which included six previously characterized TPSs in G. hirsutum (AD1_TPS10, AD1_TPS12, AD1_TPS40, AD1_TPS42, AD1_TPS89, and AD1_TPS104), two private TPSs (AD1_TPS100 and AD2_TPS125), and one atypical TPS (AD2_TPS41). Also, a TPS-associated coexpression module of eight genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway was identified in the transcriptomic data of herbivore-infested G. hirsutum. These findings will help us understand the contributions of TPS family members to interspecific terpene chemotypes within Gossypium and offer valuable resources for breeding insect-resistant cotton cultivars.

AB  - Lepidopteran specialist herbivores of the Notodontidae family have adapted to thrive on poplar and willow species (Salicaceae). Previous research showed that Cerura vinula, a member of the Notodontidae family occurring throughout Europe and Asia, uses a unique mechanism to transform salicortinoids, the host plant's defense compounds, into quinic acid-salicylate conjugates. However, how the production of this conjugates relates to the detoxification of salicortinoids and how this transformation proceeds mechanistically have remained unknown. To find the mechanisms, we conducted gut homogenate incubation experiments with C. vinula and re-examined its metabolism by analyzing the constituents of its frass. To estimate the contribution of spontaneous degradation, we examined the chemical stability of salicortinoids and found that salicortinoids were degraded very quickly by midgut homogenates and that spontaneous degradation plays only a marginal role in the metabolism. We learned how salicortinoids are transformed into salicylate after we discovered reductively transformed derivatives, which were revealed to play key roles in the metabolism. Unless they have undergone the process of reduction, salicortinoids produce toxic catechol. We also studied constituents in the frass of the Notodontidae species Cerura erminea, Clostera anachoreta, Furcula furcula, Notodonta ziczac, and Pheosia tremula, and found the same metabolites as those described for C. vinula. We conclude that the process whereby salicortinoids are reductively transformed represents an important adaption of the Notodontidae to their Salicaceae host species.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health challenge, is very difficult to diagnose, and currently has no accepted treatment options. The difficulty in diagnosis is due to the complex pathophysiology of TBI, where the damage mechanisms span multiple spatial and temporal scales and ultimately manifest as diverse cognitive impairments in brain function. The speed and dynamic nature with which the mechanical insults occur in TBI means that computational models are the best candidate to mimic the in vivo event and to investigate the injury progression in detail. A current weakness in TBI computational models is the poor understanding of how material properties within different regions of the brain change after damage. Here, we developed an animal experiment pipeline where a controlled and reproducible mechanical insult can be applied to a sheep brain in vivo followed by ex vivo compression mechanical testing. For each brain, the compression mechanical testing was conducted across the length of the brain to assess baseline regional variations in material properties and how these properties changed after mechanical impact. Using this pipeline, we have characterized locational variations in the brain material properties both pre and post-TBI. Our preliminary results confirm that there exist locational variations in the brain material properties across all regions of cerebrum. The analysis of post-TBI tissues showed that compressive strength was reduced in the area nearest the direct impact.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD) a heterogenous group of brain disorders in which cognitive impairment is attributable to vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. A common phenomenon in VD is a dysfunctional cerebral regulatory mechanism associated with insufficient cerebral blood flow, ischemia and hypoxia. Under hypoxic conditions oxygen supply to the brain results in neuronal death leading to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and VD. In conditions of hypoxia and low oxygen perfusion, expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) increases under conditions of low oxygen and low perfusion associated with upregulation of expression of hypoxia-upregulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR), which promotes anterograde mitochondrial transport by binding with trafficking protein kinesin 2 (TRAK2). Schisandrin B (Sch B) an active component derived from Chinese herb Wuweizi prevented beta-amyloid protein induced morphological alterations and cell death using a SH-SY5Y neuronal cells considered an AD model. It was thus of interest to determine whether Sch B might also alleviate VD using a rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) dementia model. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Sch B in BCAO on cognitive functions such as Morris water maze test and underlying mechanisms involving expression of HIF-1 alpha, TRAK2, and HUMMR levels. The results showed that Sch B improved learning and memory function of rats with VD and exerted a protective effect on the hippocampus by inhibition of protein expression of HIF-1 alpha, TRAK2, and HUMMR factors. Evidence indicates that Sch B may be considered as an alternative in VD treatment.

AB  - The phenomenon of ischemic postconditioning (PostC) is known to be neuroprotective against ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury. One of the key processes in PostC is the opening of the mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium (mito-K-ATP) channel and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, triggering the release of calcium ions from mitochondria through low-conductance opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is known as a highly sensitive transporter for the uptake of Ca2+ present on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The MCU has attracted attention as a new target for treatment in diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and ischemic stroke. We considered that the MCU may be involved in PostC and trigger its mechanisms. This research used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from C57BL mice and measured changes in spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs), intracellular Ca2+ concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents under inhibition of MCU by ruthenium red 265 (Ru265) in PostC. Inhibition of MCU increased the occurrence of sEPSCs (p = 0.014), NMDAR currents (p < 0.001), intracellular Ca2+ concentration (p < 0.001), and dead cells (p < 0.001) significantly after reperfusion, reflecting removal of the neuroprotective effects in PostC. Moreover, mitochondrial depolarization in PostC with Ru265 was weakened, compared to PostC (p = 0.004). These results suggest that MCU affects mitochondrial depolarization in PostC to suppress NMDAR over-activation and prevent elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations against I/R injury.

AB  - Abnormal accumulation of R-loops results in replication stress, genome instability, chromatin alterations and gene silencing. Little research has been done to characterize functional relationships among R-loops, histone marks, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription and gene regulation. We built extremely randomized trees (ETs) models to predict the genome-wide R-loops using RNAPII and multiple histone modifications chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, DNase-seq, Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) and R-loop profiling data. We compared the performance of ET models to multiple machine learning approaches, and the proposed ET models achieved the best and extremely robust performances. Epigenetic profiles are highly predictive of R-loops genome-widely and they are strongly associated with R-loop formation. In addition, the presence of R-loops is significantly correlated with RNAPII transcription activity, H3K4me3 and open chromatin around the transcription start site, and H3K9me1 and H3K9me3 around the transcription termination site. RNAPII pausing defects were correlated with 5'R-loops accumulation, and transcriptional termination defects and read-throughs were correlated with 3'R-loops accumulation. Furthermore, we found driver genes with 5'R-loops and RNAPII pausing defects express significantly higher and genes with 3'R-loops and read-through transcription express significantly lower than genes without R-loops. These driver genes are enriched with chromosomal instability, Hippo-Merlin signaling Dysregulation, DNA damage response and TGF-beta pathways, indicating R-loops accumulating at the 5' end of genes play oncogenic roles, whereas at the 3' end of genes play tumor-suppressive roles in tumorigenesis.

AB  - This study explored the alteration in kisspeptin and reproductive hormones during different superovulation protocols (SOP) in dromedary camel. The kisspeptin and reproductive hormonal profile, ovarian response, and the quality and quantity of embryos in dromedary camel donors were evaluated. A total of thirty donor camels were divided into two groups: the 5dSOP group, which received diluent containing 400 mg pFSH dissolved in 20 ml and administered two times daily for 5 days at decreasing doses (2.5, 2, 1.5, and 1 ml); and the 3dSOP group, which received diluent containing 400 mg pFSH dissolved in 12 ml and administered two times daily for 3 days at decreasing doses (3 ml, 2 ml, and 1 ml). Ultrasonography was used to monitor the ovarian environment, recording daily follicle count and dimensions and the time taken for follicles to mature. On the sixth day after mating, a corpus luteum (CL) count was conducted. On the 8th day after mating, records of the quantity and quality of embryos collected were kept. Blood samples from the jugular vein were collected at the commencement of the superovulation protocol and at 8:00 a.m. for the following 48 h to measure the concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), kisspeptin (KP), and progesterone (P4). The findings indicated that the 3dSOP yielded superior results compared to the 5dSOP in terms of follicle quantity and size, as well as the quantity of CL and embryos. This improvement was attributed to significantly higher concentrations of reproductive hormones, including FSH, LH, E2, kisspeptin, and P4 (P <= 0.05), in the 3dSOP than in the 5dSOP. In conclusion, reducing the duration of superovulation protocols contributed to the proliferation of follicles with improved dimensions and counts, ultimately resulting in a greater quantity of embryos of superior quality. The levels of FSH, LH, E2, KP, and P4 were affected significantly by SOP and time of evaluation.

AB  - Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is among the most prevalent and deadly complications associated with sepsis, but satisfactory treatments and therapeutic agents are lacking. Gelsevirine, an active ingredient derived from Gelsemium elegans Benth., has shown promising effects in animal models of anxiety, ischaemic stroke and osteoarthritis. However, its protective effect against SAE and its mechanism of action are still unknown. Purpose: To elucidate the efficacy of gelsevirine against SAE and the mechanism of its protective effect through the STING signalling-mediated pyroptosis pathway. Methods: We constructed a mouse model of caecum ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and explored the protective effects of gelsevirine in mice with SAE by assessing survival rates and behavioural alterations. To further explore its mechanism of action, we investigated the modulatory effects of gelsevirine on the levels of inflammatory factors, microglial activation and pyroptosis by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry staining and PCR. STING knockout mice were used to verify the protective effect of gelsevirine against SAE through the STING pathway. Results: Gelsevirine increased the survival rate of mice with SAE. The Morris water maze and open field tests revealed that gelsevirine significantly alleviated cognitive dysfunction and increased exploratory behaviour in mice with SAE. Gelsevirine inhibited the activation of microglia and decreased inflammatory factor levels in the hippocampus of mice with SAE. In mice with SAE and in vitro BV2 microglia, gelsevirine reduced levels of inflammatory factors and inhibited STING protein phosphorylation and microglial pyroptosis. However, after STING knockout, the inhibitory effect of gelsevirine on microglial pyroptosis was significantly weakened, and gelsevirine-mediated protective effects were abolished. Conclusions: Gelsevirine increased the survival rate, ameliorated cognitive impairment, inhibited glial cell activation and reduced inflammation in the hippocampi of mice with SAE; the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of STING signalling pathway-mediated pyroptosis in microglia.

AB  - Beauveria bassiana acts as an endophytic fungus that controls herbivorous pests by stimulating plant defenses and inducing systemic resistance. Through multiomics analysis, 325 differential metabolites and 1739 differential expressed genes were observed in tomatoes treated with B. bassiana by root irrigation; meanwhile, 152 differential metabolites and 1002 differential genes were observed in tomatoes treated by local leaf spraying. Among the upregulated metabolites were a-solanine, 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid, clerodendrin A, and peucedanin, which demonstrated anti-insect activity. These differential metabolites were primarily associated with alkaloid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism pathways. Furthermore, the gene silencing of UDP-glucose:sterol glucosyltransferase, a gene involved in a-solanine synthesis, indicated that B. bassiana could inhibit the reproduction of whiteflies by regulating a-solanine. This study highlighted the ability of B. bassiana to modulate plant secondary metabolites and emphasized the significance of understanding and harnessing multitrophic interactions of endophytic B. bassiana for sustainable agriculture.

   In aging societies, age-associated diseases are recognized to diminish people's quality of life. Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker or "Kra-chai-dam" is a medicinal plant that is known to exhibit numerous pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, and sexual-enhancing activity, and has been used as a nerve tonic. Due to its known neuropharmacological activities, we hypothesize that its rhizome extract might possess both neuroprotective and longevity-enhancing properties. We found that the extract protected glutamate-induced cytotoxicity of mouse hippocampal HT-22 neuronal cells, thus reducing apoptotic cell death. Concomitantly, cells had lower levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and changes in the expression of related proteins were found to support the molecular neuroprotection. Furthermore, we found the extract could extend the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Overall, our study proved that the K. parviflora rhizome extract possessed neuroprotective and longevity-enhancing properties.
   Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex Baker (KP) or "Kra-chai-dam" has been shown to exhibit several pharmacological effects including anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, and sexual-enhancing activity. The objectives of this study included an investigation of the effect of KP rhizome extract against glutamate-induced toxicity in mouse hippocampal HT-22 neuronal cells, determination of the underlying mechanism of neuroprotection, and an evaluation of the effect of KP extract on the longevity of Caenorhabditis elegans. HT-22 cells were co-treated with glutamate (5 mM) and KP extract (25, 50, and 75 mu g/mL) for 14 h. Cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and Western blotting were performed. The longevity effect of KP extract on C. elegans was studied by lifespan measurement. In HT-22 cells, co-treatment of glutamate with KP extract significantly inhibited glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity and decreased intracellular ROS production. Additionally, the glutamate-induced apoptosis and apoptotic-inducing factor (AIF) translocation were blocked by KP extract co-treatment. Western blot analysis also demonstrated that KP extract significantly diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation induced by glutamate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was recovered to the control. Moreover, this KP extract treatment prolonged the lifespan of C. elegans. Altogether, this study suggested that KP extract possesses both neuroprotective and longevity-inducing properties, thus serving as a promising candidate for development of innovative health products.

AB  - We have investigated the hippocampal connectivity of the marmoset presubiculum (PreS) and reported that major connections of PreS in the rat were conserved in the marmoset. Moreover, our results indicated the presence of several additional projections that were almost absent in the rat brain, but abundant in the marmoset, such as direct projections from CA1 to PreS. However, little is known about the connectivity between the frontal brain regions and PreS or hippocampal formation. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of cells of the origins and terminals of the presubicular and hippocampal projections in the marmoset frontal brain regions using the retrograde and anterograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit. In cases of tracer injections into all layers of PreS, many neurons and terminals were labeled in the claustrum-endopiriform (Cl-En) complex almost entirely along the rostrocaudal axis. Even in cases where the injection site involved the superficial (not deep) layers of PreS, labeled neurons and terminals were distributed over a wide rostrocaudal range of the Cl-En complex, but their number and density were significantly lower than the whole-layer injection cases. In cases where the injection site was confined to the hippocampal formation, labeled cells and terminals were localized at a restricted portion of the Cl-En complex. Here, we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time the strong, reciprocal connections of the Cl-En complex with PreS and projections from the Cl-En complex to the hippocampal regions (CA1 and the subiculum) in the marmoset. Our findings indicate that the Cl-En complex may exert a strong influence on the cortical and subcortical outputs from PreS and, in turn, the entire memory circuitry in the marmoset brain.

AB  - Introduction: Tick-borne diseases have a significant impact on public and animal health and represent a considerable financial burden on livestock farming. However, in many regions of Latin America, comprehensive epidemiological data, including species identification, geographical distribution and molecular profiling of ticks and their associated pathogens, remain scarce. The aims of the present study were: 1) to establish the distribution of tick species collected from domestic animals and 2) to molecularly characterise the rickettsial bacteria present in ticks from the department of Atl & aacute;ntico, area Caribe, Colombia. Methods: Between January 2021 and March 2022, ticks were collected from 216 cattle and 72 sympatric domestic animals (38 dogs, 31 equids and 3 goats) on 28 farms. Specimens were identified and grouped into 297 pools. Molecular detection and characterisation of the pathogens were carried out by targeting the partial gltA, ompA, ompB and 16S rRNA genes of Rickettsia and the partial 23S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes of Anaplasmataceae. Results: A total of 1541 ticks were collected, and four species belonging to the genera Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor and Amblyomma were identified. A total of 137 out of 288 animals (47.6%) were infested with a mean infection rate of 9.7 +/- SD 6.8 ticks per animal. Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasmataceae DNA were detected in 2.7% (MIR: 0.5%) and 15.5% (MIR: 0.3%) of the tick pools, respectively. The obtained sequences showed high nucleotide identity (99%-100%) with sequences of Candidatus Rickettsia colombiensis, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia minasensis. Conclusion: Our data represent the first description of Dermacentor nitens and Amblyomma patinoi in the Atlantic region of the Colombian Caribbean. Considering the risk that the tick and rickettsial species represent for public and animal health, monitoring and control programmes are necessary to prevent the spread of tick-borne pathogenic bacteria to humans.

AB  - Synthetic pheromones have been used for pest control over several decades. The conventional synthesis of di-unsaturated pheromone compounds is usually complex and costly. Camelina (Camelina sativa) has emerged as an ideal, non-food biotech oilseed platform for production of oils with modified fatty acid compositions. We used Camelina as a plant factory to produce mono- and di-unsaturated C-12 chain length moth sex pheromone precursors, (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid, by introducing a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase FatB gene UcTE from California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) and a bifunctional increment 9 desaturase gene Cpo_CPRQ from the codling moth, Cydia pomonella. Different transgene combinations were investigated for increasing pheromone precursor yield. The most productive Camelina line was engineered with a vector that contained one copy of UcTE and the viral suppressor protein encoding P19 transgenes and three copies of Cpo_CPRQ transgene. The T-2 generation of this line produced 9.4% of (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and 5.5% of (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid of the total fatty acids, and seeds were selected to advance top-performing lines to homozygosity. In the T-4 generation, production levels of (E)-9-dodecenoic acid and (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienoic acid remained stable. The diene acid together with other seed fatty acids were converted into corresponding alcohols, and the bioactivity of the plant-derived codlemone was confirmed by GC-EAD and a flight tunnel assay. Trapping in orchards and home gardens confirmed significant and specific attraction of C. pomonella males to the plant-derived codlemone.

AB  - IntroductionHarmonization of methodological approaches to the analysis of herbal substances containing triterpenoid saponins, considered the largest group of phytochemicals, is essential for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.ObjectivesThis review aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the requirements for the standardization of herbal substances, herbal medicinal products (HMPs), and other herbal materials containing triterpenoid saponins in the pharmacopeial texts of the Russian Federation and the world's leading pharmacopeias.Materials and MethodsThe review covers the data on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of herbal substances containing triterpenoid saponins, as presented in the State Register of Medicinal Products of Russia and the monographs of the world's leading pharmacopeias: the European Pharmacopeia, United States Pharmacopeia, British Pharmacopeia, Japanese Pharmacopeia, and the national pharmacopeias of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) Member States.ResultsThis review compares and discusses the analytical methods used for the standardization of Aesculus hippocastanum L. seeds, Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem roots, Glycyrrhiza spp. roots, Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. leaves, and Polemonium caeruleum L. rhizomes with roots. The most common analytical methods used are (HP)TLC and (U)HPLC. The Russian Pharmacopeia also includes titrimetry and spectrophotometry.ConclusionsThe appropriate selection of a group of biologically active compounds for HMP standardization is still challenging. We believe that a rational approach to the standardization of herbal substances and HMPs should be based on the use of herbal substances with maximum extractability and specific pharmacological activity. The harmonized procedures and reference substances for the identification and assay of active metabolites in HMPs must be implemented at all stages of production control from herbal substances to finished dosage forms.

AB  - Echocardiography illustrates a convenient and noninvasive tool for measuring cardiac output (CO) changes after administration of sedative drugs, but it is unknown in camelids practice. The aim of present study was to investigate echocardiographic effects of intravenous (IV) injection of medetomidine and xylazine in camel calves. Twenty apparently healthy immature male one-humped camel calves (Camelus dromedarious) were divided into four groups (five animals in each treatment). Medetomidine and xylazine were injected into the left jugular vein at two different doses of 10.00 and 20.00 mu g kg(-1) and 0.20 and 0.40 mg kg(-1), respectively. Effects on some selected echocardiographic parameters were recorded at different intervals, before drug administrations (baseline) and after 3, 60 and 120 min. Data were analyzed by repeated measure, ANOVA test, then relevance and significance were taken as p <= 0.05. Significant decrease in fractional shortening percentage (FS%), ejection fraction percentage (EF%), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR) and subsequent CO were noticeable 3 min after drug administration in medetomidine high dose (MH), medetomidine low dose (ML) and xylazine high dose (XH) groups (p <= 0.05), furthermore at this time significant decrease in left ventricular mass (LVmass) and left ventricular systolic time intervals were seen in these groups, however, in xylazine low dose (XL) group, the lowest level of most echocardiographic parameters were detectable after 60 min. High dose IV injection of medetomidine was associated with significant decrease in most echocardiographic parameters without echocardiographic arrhythmia. Although, ML and XH groups had the same effects on echocardiographic indices but the intensity and duration were less than MH group. (C) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The detection of dung odors is a crucial step in the food-searching behavior of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea). Yet, whether certain compounds characteristic of a given dung type contribute to a 'choosy generalism' behavior proposed for this taxonomic group is unknown. To address this, we analyzed the chemical composition of three types of dung (cow, horse, and rabbit) and conducted behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) bioassays on 15 species of dung beetles using 19 volatile organic compounds representing the three dung samples. Chemical analyses revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative differences among dung types. When offered these food options in an olfactometer, 14 species exhibited a feeding preference. Surprisingly, all 19 compounds used in the EAG assays elicited antennal responses, with species displaying different olfactory profiles. The relationship between behavioral preferences and electrophysiological profiles highlighted that species with different food preferences had differences in antennal responses. Moreover, a specific set of EAG-active compounds (nonanal, sabinene, acetophenone, rho-cresol, 2-heptanone, 1H-indole, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) were the strongest drivers in the distinct sensory profiles of the trophic preference groups. Our results point to the importance of the whole bouquet of dung-emanating compounds in driving food-searching behavior, but specific volatiles could aid in determining highly marked trophic preferences in certain species.

AB  - Flavonoids are major plant secondary metabolites that provide defense against several insect pests. Previously, it has been shown that sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) flavonoids are required for providing resistance to fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda), which is an important chewing insect pest on several crops. We demonstrate here the role of FAW oral cues in modulating sorghum flavonoid defenses. While feeding, chewing insects release two kinds of oral cues: oral secretions (OS)/regurgitant and saliva. Our results indicate that FAW OS induced the expression of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and total flavonoids, thereby enhancing sorghum's defense against FAW larvae. Conversely, FAW saliva suppressed the flavonoid-based defenses and promoted FAW caterpillar growth, independent of the FAW salivary component, glucose oxidase (GOX). Thus, we infer that different oral cues in FAW may have contrasting roles in altering sorghum defenses. These findings expand our understanding of the precise modes of action of caterpillar oral cues in modulating plant defenses and help in designing novel pest management strategies against FAW in this vital cereal crop.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its associated pathology have been primarily identified in humans, who have relatively large brains and long lifespans. To expand what is known about aging and neurodegeneration across mammalian species, we characterized amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau lesions in five species of aged felids (n = 9; cheetah, clouded leopard, African lion, serval, Siberian tiger). We performed immunohistochemistry to detect A beta 40 and A beta 42 in plaques and vessels and hyperphosphorylated tau in the temporal lobe gyrus sylvius and in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. We also quantified the densities and morphological types of microglia expressing IBA1. We found that diffuse A beta 42 plaques, but not dense-core plaques, were present more frequently in the temporal cortex and tended to be more common than A beta 40 plaques across species. Conversely, vascular A beta was labeled more consistently with A beta 40 for each species on average. Although all individuals showed some degree of A beta 40 and/or A beta 42 immunoreactivity, only the cheetahs and clouded leopards exhibited intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated tau (i.e., pretangles), which was more common in the hippocampus. Reactive, intermediate microglia were significantly associated with total A beta 40 vessel area and pretangle load in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates the co-occurrence of A beta and tau pathology in two felid species, cheetahs and clouded leopards. Overall, these results provide an initial view of the manifestation of A beta and tau pathology in aged, large-brained felids, which can be compared with markers of neurodegeneration across different taxa, including domestic cats, nonhuman primates, and humans.

AB  - Due to their immediate exhalation after generation at the cellular/microbiome levels, exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may provide real-time information on pathophysiological mechanisms and the host response to infection. In recent years, the metabolic profiling of the most frequent respiratory infections has gained interest as it holds potential for the early, non-invasive detection of pathogens and the monitoring of disease progression and the response to therapy. Using previously unpublished data, randomly selected individuals from a COVID-19 test center were included in the study. Based on multiplex PCR results (non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens), the breath profiles of 479 subjects with the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms were obtained using proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Among 223 individuals, one respiratory pathogen was detected in 171 cases, and more than one pathogen in 52 cases. A total of 256 subjects had negative PCR test results and had no symptoms. The exhaled VOC profiles were affected by the presence of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Rhinovirus. The endogenous ketone, short-chain fatty acid, organosulfur, aldehyde, and terpene concentrations changed, but only a few compounds exhibited concentration changes above inter-individual physiological variations. Based on the VOC origins, the observed concentration changes may be attributed to oxidative stress and antioxidative defense, energy metabolism, systemic microbial immune homeostasis, and inflammation. In contrast to previous studies with pre-selected patient groups, the results of this study demonstrate the broad inter-individual variations in VOC profiles in real-life screening conditions. As no unique infection markers exist, only concentration changes clearly above the mentioned variations can be regarded as indicative of infection or colonization.

AB  - Many studies have investigated how trehalose glycolipid structures can be modified to improve their Macrophage inducible C-type lectin (Mincle)-mediated adjuvanticity. However, in all instances, the ester-linkage of alpha,alpha-trehalose to the lipid of choice remained. We investigated how changing this ester-linkage to an amide influences Mincle signalling and agonist activity and demonstrated that Mincle tolerates this functional group change. In in vivo vaccination studies in murine and ovine model systems, using OVA or Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae as vaccine antigens, respectively, it was demonstrated that a representative trehalose diamide glycolipid was able to enhance antibody-specific immune responses. Notably, IgG titres against M. ovipneumoniae were significantly greater when using trehalose dibehenamide (A-TDB) compared to trehalose dibehenate (TDB). This is particularly important as infection with M. ovipneumoniae predisposes sheep to pneumonia.

AB  - Simple Summary Contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) and footrot (FR), a sub-acute or acute necrotic (decaying) infectious disease involving the hoof and underlying tissues, cause important economic losses all over the world. The aetiological agent for FR is Dichelobacter nodosus while CODD has been associated with pathogenic Treponema phylogroups. In the present work, we applied a set of quantitative polymerase chain reactions to detect in a set of 105 samples from diseased flocks and 15 from apparently healthy herds the following microbiological agents: Dichelobacter nodosus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Treponema spp., and three pathogenic Treponema phylogroups (T. phagedenis, T. medium, and T. pedis). For Treponema spp., all the samples gave a positive result, so we focused our interest on the other agents. D. nodosus and F. necrophorum are the most frequently found bacteria (alone or in combination). Although F. necrophorum is nowadays known to be not the causative agent for FR, it is the only detected agent in 16.2% of the cases, and it is important to carry out analysis to identify it in order to allow veterinarians to apply the correct prevention and treatment procedures. Multiple serogroups of D. nodosus are often (35.1%) found in the pools. This report concludes with comprehensive proposals for diagnosing and preventing hoof ailments in ovine and caprine herds.Abstract Contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) and footrot (FR), a sub-acute or acute necrotic (decaying) infectious disease involving the hoof and underlying tissues, pose economic challenges to herds in Spain and worldwide. The aetiological agent for FR is Dichelobacter nodosus, while CODD is caused by pathogenic Treponema phylogroups. We detail the findings derived from the analysis by qPCR of 105 pooled samples from 100 ovine and five caprine herds in Spain and Portugal, alongside 15 samples from healthy flocks in order to identify Dichelobacter nodosus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Treponema spp., and three pathogenic Treponema phylogroups (T. phagedenis, T. medium, and T. pedis). Treponema spp. were detected in all 120 pools, including samples from the 15 healthy flocks where only one positive result for F. necrophorum was recorded. Mixed infections by agents different from Treponema spp. were identified in 68.57% of samples. Positive results for F. necrophorum and/or D. nodosus, were obtained for 91.4% of the pools, whereas the presence of the three pathogenic Treponema phylogroups was rare: each of them appeared in isolation in a single pool, while they were found in 18 pools in combination with other agents. While F. necrophorum was the sole finding in 16.2% of samples from affected herds, D. nodosus (the footrot causative agent) was only detected in 61% of affected farms. An improved qPCR protocol was implemented to determine the serogroups of D. nodosus in the samples and found all of them (except the G serogroup), often in combined infections (35.1%). This report concludes with comprehensive proposals for diagnosing, preventing, and treating hoof ailments, remarking the interest of the information about D. nodosus serogroups in order to improve the efficiency of immunization by choosing appropriate vaccine protocols.

AB  - Biological pretreatment was investigated to increase ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, like sugarcane bagasse. Enzyme secretion, changes in substrate composition, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanol yield after pretreatment by different basidiomycetes were evaluated. Analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that Pleurotus pulmonarius PS2001 and Trametes villosa 82I6 promoted more extensive selective modifications in the lignin content. Glucose release during enzymatic hydrolysis of samples pretreated with P. pulmonarius PS2001 for 35, 42, and 49 days and with T. villosa 82I6 for 21, 28, and 49 days were higher than the control (48.5 +/- 2.38 mg/g), i.e., 68.4 +/- 0.7, 76.3 +/- 1.6, and 76.5 +/- 2.1 mg/g and 70.9 +/- 8.3, 77.8 +/- 5.8, and 77.6 +/- 4.2 mg/g, respectively. During the fermentation of hydrolysates of samples pretreated with T. villosa 82I6 for 14, 28, and 49 days, a maximum ethanol yield of 17.8 +/- 1.9, 19.1 +/- 2.8, and 20.2 +/- 0.5 mg/g, respectively, was achieved. A positive effect of biological pretreatment on hydrolysis and fermentation was demonstrated.

AB  - hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) frequently induces cognitive impairments. Investigating the role of sevoflurane postconditioning (SPC) in HIBD, we conducted experiments involving HIBD modeling, SPC treatment, and interventions with the PERK inhibitor GSK2656157 or the PERK activator CCT020312, administered 30 min before modeling, followed by SPC treatment. Behavioral testing using the Morris water maze test and Neurological Deficiency Scale (NDS) was conducted. Additionally, Nissl staining assessed hippocampal CA1 area neuronal density, TUNEL staining evaluated hippocampal CA1 area neuronal apoptosis, and Western blot determined hippocampal CA1 area protein levels, including Bax, Bcl-2, p-PERK/PERK, p-eIF2/eIF2, ATF4, CHOP, GRP78, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein levels. Following SPC treatment, HIBD rats exhibited improved spatial learning and memory abilities, reduced neuronal apoptosis, increased neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 area, elevated Bcl-2 protein level, decreased Bax protein levels, and decreased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway related proteins (p-PERK/PERK, p-eIF2/eIF2, ATF4, CHOP and GRP78). Pre-modeling treatment with the PERK inhibitor treatment improved outcomes in HIBD rats. However, pre-modeling treatment with the PERK activator CCT020312 counteracted the protective effects of SPC against HIBD in rats. In conclusion, SPC alleviates neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus CA1 area of HIBD rats by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway PERK/ATF4/CHOP, thereby mitigating HIBD in rats.

AB  - BackgroundPerioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a key complication affecting older individuals after anesthesia and surgery. Failure to translate multiple pharmacological therapies for PND from preclinical studies to clinical settings has necessitated the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) treatment has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases and has the potential to translate basic science into clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of hUC-MSCs on PND in aged mice.MethodshUC-MSCs were isolated from an infant umbilical cord and identified using flow cytometry and differentiation assays. We established PND model by undergoing aseptic laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation in eighteen-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. hUC-MSCs were slowly injected into mice by coccygeal vein before anesthesia. Cognitive function, systemic and neuroinflammatory responses, neuroplasticity, endogenous neurogenesis, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed. To determine the brain mechanisms underlying by which hUC-MSCs mediate their neuroprotective effects in PND, K252a, an antagonist of BDNF receptor, was administered intraperitoneally before surgery. Hippocampal BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway and metabolomic signatures were evaluated.ResultshUC-MSC treatment ameliorated the learning and memory impairment in aged mice with PND. The downstream effects were the suppression of systemic and hippocampal inflammation and restoration of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity dysregulation. Interestingly, the level of mature BDNF, but not that of proBDNF, was increased in the hippocampus after hUC-MSC treatment. Further analysis revealed that the improved cognitive recovery and the restoration of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity dysregulation elicited by exposure to hUC-MSCs were, at least partially, mediated by the activation of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway. Untargeted metabolomic further identified lipid metabolism dysfunction as potential downstream of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in hUC-MSC-mediated neuroprotection for PND.ConclusionsOur study highlights the beneficial effects of hUC-MSC treatment on PND and provides a justification to consider the potential use of hUC-MSCs in the perioperative period.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a prevalent contaminant in feed and food, posing a serious threat to the health of both humans and animals. The pig stands as an ideal subject for the study of DON due to its recognition as the most susceptible animal to DON. In this study, the IPEC-J2 cells were utilized as an in vitro model to explore the potential of SeMet in alleviating the intestinal toxicity and oxidative injury in intestinal epithelial cells when exposed to DON. Cells were treated either with or without 4.0 mu M SeMet, in combination with or without a simultaneous treatment with 0.5 mu g/mL DON, for a duration of 24 h. Then, cells or related samples were analyzed for cell proliferation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, gene expressions, and protein expressions. The results showed that SeMet mitigated the cellular toxicity caused by DON, evidenced by elevated cell proliferation and the reduced LDH release of IPEC-J2 cells in the SeMet + DON group vs. the DON group. Moreover, the SeMet treatment markedly promoted antioxidant functions and decreased the oxidative injury in IPEC-J2 cell, which is indicated by the decreased ROS level and up-regulated mRNA levels of GPX1, TXNRD1, Nrf2, and GCLC in IPEC-J2 cells in the SeMet + DON group vs. the DON group. However, in both the absence and presence of exposure to DON, the SeMet treatment did not affect the protein expression of MAPK (JNK, Erk1/2, and P38) and phosphorylated MAPK (p-JNK, p-Erk1/2, and p-P38) in IPEC-J2 cells. Collectively, SeMet alleviated the DON-induced oxidative injury in porcine intestinal epithelial cells independent of the MAPK pathway regulation.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), which is enriched with flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol, is a representative example of "medicine food homology" targeting several diseases. Major depressive disorders seriously threaten mental health worldwide and may even lead to death. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like symptoms in mice are usually considered as the highest similarity to the situation in humans. Herein, we determined the potential functions of the flavonoid-enriched fraction from Seabuckthorn, which was named SBF, in treating major depressive disorder in mice. In the CUMS-induced mouse model, the intake of SBF reversed their depressive behaviors and relieved the CUMS-disturbed levels of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, stress-related hormones, and inflammation-related cytokines. Additionally, the treatment of depressive mice with SBF showed ability to regulate the gut microbiota, especially in decreasing the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, while increasing the abundance of Lachnospiraceae at the family level. The results suggest the beneficial effects of Seabuckthorn flavonoids in functioning as a health food supplement to treat major depressive disorders.

AB  - Background: Vaccinium bracteatum Thunb. leaves (VBL) are used in traditional herbal medicines to treat various biological diseases. p-coumaric acid (CA), the main active component of VBL, has neuroprotective effects against corticosterone-induced damage in vitro. However, the effects of CA on immobility induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) in a mouse model and 5-HT receptor activity have not been investigated.
   Hypothesis/Purpose: We investigated the antagonistic effects of VBL, NET-D1602, and the three components of Gas protein-coupled 5-HT receptors. Additionally, we identified the effects and mechanism of action of CA, the active component of NET-D1602, in the CRS-exposed model.
   Methods: For in vitro analyses, we used 1321N1 cells stably expressing human 5-HT6 receptors and CHO-K1 expressing human 5-HT4 or 5-HT7 receptors cell lines to study the mechanism of action. For in vivo analyses, CRS-exposed mice were orally administered CA (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg) daily for 21 consecutive days. The effects of CA were analyzed by assessing behavioral changes using a forced swim test (FST), measuring levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones in ntial therapeutic effects as 5-HT6 receptor antagonists for neurodegenerative diseases and depressioserum, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamines, including 5-HT, dopamine, and norepinephrine, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the serotonin transporter (SERT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTORC1 signaling were detected using western blotting.
   Results: CA was confirmed to be an active component in the antagonistic effects of NET-D1602 on 5-HT6 receptor activity through decreases in cAMP and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, CRS-exposed mice treated with CA showed a significantly reduced immobility time in the FST. CA also significantly decreased corticosterone, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. CA enhanced 5-HT, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) but decreased MAO-A and SERT protein levels. Similarly, CA significantly upregulated the ERK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 signaling pathways in both HC and the PFC.
   Conclusion: CA contained in NET-D1602 may play the antidepressant effects against CRS-induced depression-like mechanism and the selective antagonist effect of 5-HT6 receptor.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) is a synergistic effect of many factors. Up to now, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The dopamine pathway in the brain is one of the paths involved in the means of cognitive function. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in dopamine transporters in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly rats. In this study, a mental dysfunction model in elderly rats was established after splenectomy under general anesthesia. Eighty male SD rats, aged 18-20 months, with a body mass of 300-500 g. Randomly divided into eight groups: Normal group (Normal, N) and Sham group (sham, S), Model 3 day group(PND, P3), Model 7 day group(PND, P7), Virus 3 days AAV.DAT.RNAi (AAV3), Virus 7 days AAV.DAT.RNAi (AAV7), Virus control for three days AAV.NC(NC3), Virus control for seven days AAV.NC(NC7). The results show that knockdown of dopamine transporter in the VTA region can significantly improve the cognitive dysfunction of elderly rats after surgery. These results suggest that dopamine transporter in the VTA region is involved in cognitive dysfunction in elderly rats. The effect of DAT changes in the VTA region on postoperative cognitive function in elderly rats may be related to the regulation of alpha-syn and A beta 1-42 protein aggregation in the hippocampus.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is a fundamental prerequisite for cell and organism evolution by natural selection. Whereas the role of stochastic gene expression in phenotypic diversity of genetically identical cells is well studied, not much is known regarding the relationship between stochastic gene expression and individual behavioral variation in animals. We demonstrate that a specific miRNA (miR-466f-3p) is upregulated in the hippocampus of a portion of individual inbred mice upon a Morris water maze task. Significantly, miR466f-3p positively regulates the neuron morphology, function and spatial learning, and memory capability of mice. Mechanistically, miR-466f-3p represses translation of MEF2A, a negative regulator of learning/memory. Finally, we show that varied upregulation of hippocampal miR-466f-3p results from randomized phosphorylation of hippocampal cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding (CREB) in individuals. This finding of modulation of spatial learning and memory via a randomized hippocampal signaling axis upon neuronal stimulation represents a demonstration of how variation in tissue gene expression lead to varied animal behavior.

AB  - ER bodies are endoplasmic reticulum-derived organelles present in plants belonging to the Brassicales order. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ER bodies are ubiquitous in cotyledons and roots and are present only in certain cell types in rosette leaves. However, both wounding and jasmonic acid treatment induce the formation of ER bodies in leaves. Formation of this structure is dependent on the transcription factor NAIL. The main components of the ER bodies are b-glucosidases (BGLUs), enzymes that hydrolyze specialized compounds. In Arabidopsis, PYK10 (BGLU23) and BGLU18 are the most abundant ER body proteins. In this work, we found that ER bodies are downregulated as a consequence of the immune responses induced by bacterial flagellin perception. Arabidopsis mutants defective in ER body formation show enhanced responses upon flagellin perception and enhanced resistance to bacterial infections. Furthermore, the bacterial toxin coronatine induces the formation of de novo ER bodies in leaves and its virulence function is partially dependent on this structure. Finally, we show that performance of the polyphagous beet army worm herbivore Spodoptera exigua increases in plants lacking ER bodies. Altogether, we provide new evidence for the role of the ER bodies in plant immune responses.

AB  - Introduction: Stress impairs cognitive processes and escitalopram affects them in various ways. The present study has compared the protective effects of two escitalopram doses on neural excitability and synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of chronically stressed and non-stressed male rats.
   Methods: Forty-nine rats were randomly allocated into seven groups: Control (Co), stress (St), sham (Sh), escitalopram 10 and 20 mg/kg (Esc10 and Esc20), and stress-escitalopram 10 and 20 mg/kg (St-Esc10 and St-Esc20). Induction of restraint stress (6 h/day) and escitalopram injections were performed for 14 days. The fEPSP slope and amplitude were measured according to input-output functions and after the LTP induction in the hippocampal CA1 region. Also, serum corticosterone levels were evaluated in all experimental groups.
   Results: The fEPSP slope and amplitude decreased significantly in the St group and increased significantly in the Esc10 group compared with the Co group. In non-stressed states, significant increases in slope and amplitude occurred in the Esc10 group compared with the Esc20 group. Notably, these values were also significantly enhanced by both escitalopram doses under stressed conditions. Moreover, serum corticosterone levels significantly elevated in the St group although its levels decreased in both St-Esc groups compared with the St.
   Conclusion: Stress significantly attenuated neural excitability and long-term plasticity in the CA1 area. Only escitalopram 10 mg/kg improved synaptic excitability, as well as LTP induction and maintenance in non-stressed subjects even more than normal levels. However, under stress conditions, both escitalopram doses enhanced neural excitability and memory probably due to reduced serum corticosterone levels.

In the scopolamine-induced mouse model, the results revealed that the fraction <3 kDa and WYPGK enhanced synaptic plasticity and improved learning and memory function. H&E and Nissl staining analysis showed that the damage in hippocampal neurons was decreased. Golgi staining and transmission electron microscopy further revealed that the enhanced synaptic plasticity was associated with increased dendritic spine abundance and synaptic density. In an H2O2-induced PC12 cell model, treatment with mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) inhibitor and inducer molecules confirmed that the <3 kDa fraction and WYPGK activated SIRT3, leading to the decrease in Ace-SOD2 acetylation and increasing the expression of SYP, SYN-1, SNAP25, and PSD95, thus enhancing synaptic plasticity. The in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are major global health burdens. Although SSRIs targeting the serotonergic system are prescribed over 200 million times annually, they have variable therapeutic efficacy and side effects, and mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Here, we comprehensively characterise the molecular landscape of gene regulatory changes associated with fluoxetine, a widely-used SSRI. We performed multimodal analysis of SSRI response in 27 mammalian brain regions using 310 bulk RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets, followed by in-depth characterisation of two hippocampal regions using single-cell RNA-seq (20 datasets). Remarkably, fluoxetine induced profound region-specific shifts in gene expression and chromatin state, including in the nucleus accumbens shell, locus coeruleus and septal areas, as well as in more well-studied regions such as the raphe and hippocampal dentate gyrus. Expression changes were strongly enriched at GWAS loci for depression and antidepressant drug response, stressing the relevance to human phenotypes. We observed differential expression at dozens of signalling receptors and pathways, many of which are previously unknown. Single-cell analysis revealed stark differences in fluoxetine response between the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyri, particularly in oligodendrocytes, mossy cells and inhibitory neurons. Across diverse brain regions, integrative omics analysis consistently suggested increased energy metabolism via oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial changes, which we corroborated in vitro; this may thus constitute a shared mechanism of action of fluoxetine. Similarly, we observed pervasive chromatin remodelling signatures across the brain. Our study reveals unexpected regional and cell type-specific heterogeneity in SSRI action, highlights under-studied brain regions that may play a major role in antidepressant response, and provides a rich resource of candidate cell types, genes, gene regulatory elements and pathways for mechanistic analysis and identifying new therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety.

AB  - Primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway plays a critical role in restricting cell proliferation and determining cell fate during physiological and pathological processes in the liver. Merlin (Moesin-Ezrin-Radixin-like protein) encoded by the NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) gene is an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway. Targeting of Merlin to the plasma membrane seems to be crucial for its major tumor-suppressive functions; this is facilitated by interactions with membrane-associated proteins, including CD44 (cluster of differentiation 44). Mutations within the CD44-binding domain of Merlin have been reported in many human cancers. This study evaluated the relative contribution of CD44- and Merlin-dependent processes to the development and progression of liver tumors. To this end, mice with a liver-specific deletion of the Nf2 gene were crossed with Cd44-knockout mice and subjected to extensive histological, biochemical and molecular analyses. In addition, cells were isolated from mutant livers and analyzed by in vitro assays. Deletion of Nf2 in the liver led to substantial liver enlargement and generation of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (iCCAs), as well as mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinomas. Whilst deletion of Cd44 had no influence on liver size or primary liver tumor development, it significantly inhibited metastasis formation in Nf2-mutant mice. CD44 upregulates expression of integrin beta 2 and promotes transendothelial migration of liver cancer cells, which may facilitate metastatic spreading. Overall, our results suggest that CD44 may be a promising target for intervening with metastatic spreading of liver cancer.

AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention that reduces calorie intake without inducing malnutrition, demonstrating lifespan-extending effects in preclinical studies and some human trials, along with potential benefits in ameliorating age-related ailments. Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) are compounds mimicking CR effects, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for age-related diseases. This study explores the potential protective effects of CR on the brain neocortex (GSE11291) and the identification of CRMs using integrative bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Our findings indicate that long-term CR activates cellular pathways improving mitochondrial function, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and reducing inflammation, potentially providing neuroprotection. The key signaling pathways enriched in our study include PPAR, mTOR, FoxO, AMPK, and Notch signaling pathways, which are crucial regulators of metabolism, cellular stress response, neuroprotection, and longevity. We identify key signaling molecules and molecular mechanisms associated with CR, including transcription factors, kinase regulators, and microRNAs linked to differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, potential CRMs such as rapamycin, replicating CR-related health benefits, are identified. Additionally, machine learning models were developed to classify small molecules based on their CNS activity and anti-inflammatory properties. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated the ischemic neuroprotective effects of two top-ranked candidate reference molecules (CRMs) using the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model, an established in vitro stroke model. However, further investigations are essential to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of these CRMs. In summary, our study suggests that long-term CR entails protective mechanisms preserving and safeguarding neuronal function, potentially impacting the treatment of age-related neurological diseases. Moreover, our findings contribute to the identification of potential genes and regulatory molecules involved in CR, along with potential CRMs, providing a promising foundation for future research in the field of neurological disorder treatment.

AB  - Cholesterol dysregulation, disorder of neuronal membrane lipid packing, and lipid rafts lead to the synthesis and accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (A beta), contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study shows that near-infrared (NIR) transcranial photobiomodulation therapy (tPBMT) can reduce A beta load and restore the properties of neuronal plasma membrane, including A beta production, bilayer order, rafts, lipid content, and Ca2+ channels during AD. Mice in the experiments were exposed to 808-nm LED for 1 h daily over 3 months. In the APOE transgenic model with cholesterol dysregulation, the cholesterol levels increased by 22 times, causing healthy neurons to produce toxic A beta three times faster, increasing its load by five times. Consequently, A beta disrupts the membrane bilayer and prompts the formation of lipid rafts and pores. NIR-tPBMT can nearly half attenuate A beta load, restore membrane lipid order and rigidity, reduce the number of lipid rafts, modulate cholesterol synthesis, normalize Ca2+ influx by activated endocytosis, and reduce neuronal death. The Ca2+ influx induced by light does not cause excitotoxicity but modulates Ca2+/calmodulin signaling involved in AD mechanisms and cell viability. The transcriptome analysis of the brain cortex and hippocampus shows that light can downregulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent AD-risk genes BACE, PSEN, and APP, and normalize cholesterol homeostasis via the HMGCR, DHCR7, and INSIG1 genes. Additionally, light enhances neuron resistance to the endoplasmic reticulum stress via activating transcription factors of the unfolded protein response. Thus, red/NIR light could be promising in combating AD, restoring synaptic plasticity in degenerating neurons and reducing A beta load.

AB  - Different parts of the brain are affected distinctively in various stages of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Identifying the biochemical changes in specific brain regions is key to comprehend the neuropathological mechanisms in early pre-symptomatic phases of AD. Quantitative proteomics profiling of four distinct areas of the brain of young APP/PS1 mouse model of AD was performed followed by biochemical pathway enrichment analysis. Findings revealed fundamental compositional and functional shifts even in the early stages of the disease. This novel study highlights unique proteome and biochemical pathway alterations in specific regions of the brain that underlie the early stages of AD pathology and will provide a framework for future longitudinal studies. The proteomics data were deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via PRIDE with the identifier PXD019192.

AB  - Diabetic cognitive decline has been associated with the gut microbial disorders, but its potential gut-brain axis mechanisms remain unclear. Herein we transplanted the gut microbiota from healthy mice into type 1 diabetic (T1D) mice and then investigated the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on cognitive function and the gut-brain metabolic axis. The results demonstrate that FMT from healthy mice effectively improved the learning and memory abilities in T1D mice, and significantly reduced neuroinflammation and neuron injury in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, FMT partly reversed the gut microbiota and gut-brain metabolic disorders, particularly glutamate metabolism. In vitro study, we found that glutamate notably decreased microglia activation and the expression levels of proinflammatory factor. Hence, our study suggests that glutamate serves as a key signal metabolite connecting the gut to brain and affects cognitive functions.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) on some antioxidant and cytokine levels in the rat hippocampus as well as synaptophysin (SYP) immunoreactivity in the cerebral cortex of the cadmium (Cd) exposed rats. Thirty-two male albino Wistar rats were divided randomly into four equal groups as control (C; n = 8), Cd (n = 8), COS (n = 8), and Cd + COS (CdCOS; n = 8). The rats in the Cd and CdCOS groups received Cd chloride (CdCl2) (2 mg/kg/d) orally by gastric gavage three times a week for 4 weeks. Besides, COS (200 mg/kg/d) was administered to COS and CdCOS groups five times a week for 4 weeks. Then, they were decapitated and hippocampal/cerebral cortex tissue samples were taken for measurement of GSH levels, CAT and SOD activities, MDA values, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 levels as well as SYP immunoreactivity. Although tissue GSH levels were determined the lowest in the Cd group, these values were attenuated with COS treatment in the CdCOS group (p < .01). In addition, TNF-alpha levels were alleviated by COS treatment in the CdCOS group when compared to Cd (p < .01). SYP-positive cells were investigated in the cerebral cortex and found mild in the CdCOS group. COS exhibits potential protective effects on Cd-induced neurotoxicity in rats.

AB  - Larvae of the Salicaceae-adapted Notodontidae have developed a unique mechanism to metabolize the chemical defenses of their Salicaceae host plants. Salicinoids and salicortinoids are enzymatically transformed into salicyloyl, benzoyl and mixed salicyloyl-benzoyl quinates. The source of quinates and benzoates was previously unknown. To elucidate the origin of quinate and benzoate in the metabolic end-products, we fed Cerura vinula caterpillars with C-13-labelled poplar defense compounds. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), such as chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and their methyl esters, were identified as the source of quinates in the caterpillar's metabolism. Benzoyl substituents in the quinate end-products were found to originate from compounds such as tremulacin or trichocarpin. Salicaceae-adapted Notodontidae caterpillars have the ability to overcome their host plant's chemical defense by metabolizing CQAs and salicinoids, both abundant defense compounds in Salicacea plants, by a strategy of transformation and recombination. We believe that our study opens up avenues for understanding salicortinoid biotransformation at the enzymatic level.

AB  - The rising incidence of ischemic stroke poses significant health and healthcare burdens. Given the limitations of current therapeutic options, there is increasing interest in exploring the potential of galangin, a natural flavonoid compound, as a treatment for ischemic stroke. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of galangin in mitigating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in a rat model of permanent cerebral ischemia. Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control; right middle cerebral artery occlusion (Rt.MCAO) with vehicle; Rt.MCAO with piracetam, a synthetic compound known as a cognitive enhancer; and Rt.MCAO with galangin administered at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight. Neurological deficit scores, brain edema, neuronal density, and microglial morphology were assessed along with the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker of inflammation, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Additionally, the expression of key markers for inflammation and apoptosis, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), and caspase-3, was analyzed to elucidate potential mechanisms. The results demonstrated that galangin treatment significantly improved neurological deficit scores, reduced brain edema, enhanced neuronal density, attenuated microglial activation, decreased MPO activity, and increased SOD activity in both the cortex and hippocampus, highlighting its neuroprotective potential. These effects were linked to the modulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Specifically, galangin significantly reduced the expression of IL-6, COX-2, Bax, and caspase-3 while increasing the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL. In conclusion, galangin demonstrates significant promise as a neuroprotective agent for ischemic stroke by suppressing inflammation and apoptosis, thereby improving neurological outcomes. However, clinical trials are required to validate these preclinical findings and confirm galangin's therapeutic efficacy in humans.

AB  - Major depressive disorder involves changes in synaptic structure and function, but the molecular underpinnings of these changes are still not established. In an initial pilot experiment, whole-brain synaptosome screening with quantitative western blotting was performed to identify synaptic proteins that may show concentration changes in a congenital rat learned helplessness model of depression. We found that the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN2A/GluN2B, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and syntaxin-1 showed significant concentration differences between congenitally learned helpless (LH) and nonlearned helpless (NLH) rats. Having identified these three proteins, we then performed more elaborate quantitative immunogold electron microscopic analyses of the proteins in a specific synapse type in the dorsal hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapse in the CA1 region. We expanded the setup to include also unstressed wild-type (WT) rats. The concentrations of the proteins in the LH and NLH groups were compared to WT animals. In this specific synapse, we found that the concentration of NMDARs was increased in postsynaptic spines in both LH and NLH rats. The concentration of Arc was significantly increased in postsynaptic densities in LH animals as well as in presynaptic cytoplasm of NLH rats. The concentration of syntaxin-1 was significantly increased in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines in LH animals, while pre- and postsynaptic syntaxin-1 concentrations were significantly decreased in NLH animals. These protein changes suggest pathways by which synaptic plasticity may be increased in dorsal hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses during depression, corresponding to decreased synaptic stability.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a progressive condition that can lead to blindness if undiagnosed or untreated. Automatic systems for DR prediction using fundus images have been developed, but challenges like variable illumination, overfitting, small datasets, poor feature learning, high computational complexity, and suboptimal feature weighting persist. To address these, a hybrid model called the modular neural network with grasshopper optimization algorithm (MNN-GOA) is proposed. This model integrates neural network capabilities with the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) to enhance feature selection and classification accuracy. It begins with preprocessing to improve image quality, followed by data augmentation and histogram-based segmentation to focus on critical regions. Features are extracted using techniques like histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), color features, and mutual information (MI). GOA optimizes feature weights, balancing exploration and exploitation, while reducing computational complexity. The model integrates features from ground truth and original images to predict DR stages accurately. Achieving performance metrics of accuracy (98.8%), specificity (97.6%), sensitivity (96.8%), precision (96.4%), and F1 score (96.2%), the MNN-GOA model was validated on four datasets like DIARETDB1, DDR, APTOS 2019, and EyePACS and outperformed existing methods, proving to be a robust and efficient solution for DR classification and severity prediction.

AB  - Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) project to the CA2 region of the hippocampus, but it remains unknown how this circuit affects behavioral function. Here, we show that abGC input to the CA2 of adult mice is involved in the retrieval of remote developmental memories of the mother. Ablation of abGCs impaired the ability to discriminate between a caregiving mother and a novel mother, and this ability returned after abGCs were regenerated. Chemogenetic inhibition of projections from abGCs to the CA2 also temporarily prevented the retrieval of remote mother memories. These findings were observed when abGCs were inhibited at 4-6 weeks old, but not when they were inhibited at 10-12 weeks old. We also found that abGCs are necessary for differentiating features of CA2 network activity, including theta-gamma coupling and sharp wave ripples, in response to novel versus familiar social stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest that abGCs are necessary for neuronal oscillations associated with discriminating between social stimuli, thus enabling retrieval of remote developmental memories of the mother by their adult offspring.

AB  - Elevated amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in the choroid plexus suggests an important role for extracellular APP metabolites such as sAPP alpha in cerebrospinal fluid. Despite widespread App brain expression, we hypothesized that specifically targeting choroid plexus expression could alter animal physiology. Through various genetic and viral approaches in the adult mouse, we show that choroid plexus APP levels significantly impact proliferation in both subventricular zone and hippocampus dentate gyrus neurogenic niches. Given the role of A beta peptides in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, we also tested whether favoring the production of A beta in choroid plexus could negatively affect niche functions. After AAV5mediated long-term expression of human mutated APP specifically in the choroid plexus of adult wild-type mice, we observe reduced niche proliferation, reduced hippocampus APP expression, behavioral defects in reversal learning, and deficits in hippocampal longterm potentiation. Our findings highlight the unique role played by the choroid plexus in regulating brain function and suggest that targeting APP in choroid plexus may provide a means to improve hippocampus function and alleviate disease-related burdens.

AB  - The impaired function of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in humans has been linked to a higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, especially as people age. Consuming a "Western diet" (WD), which is high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sugars, can induce metabolic syndrome. Previous research indicated that mice carrying a targeted inactivation of the Sert gene (knockout, KO) and fed a WD display significant metabolic disturbances and behaviors reminiscent of ADHD. These abnormalities might be mediated via a dysfunction in insulin receptor (IR) signaling, which is also associated with adult ADHD. However, the impact of Sert deficiency on IR signaling and systemic metabolic changes has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis of locomotor behavior in wild-type (WT) and KO mice fed a WD or control diet. We investigated changes in the blood metabolome and examined, via PCR, the expression of insulin receptor A and B isoforms and key regulators of their function in the brain. Twelve-month-old KO mice and their WT littermates were fed a WD for three weeks. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of plasma samples showed that KO mice on a WD had higher levels of lipids and lipoproteins and lower levels of glucose, lactate, alanine, valine, and isoleucine compared to other groups. SERT-KO mice on the control diet exhibited increased brain levels of both IR A and B isoforms, accompanied by a modest increase in the negative regulator ENPP. The KO mice also displayed anxiety-like behavior and reduced exploratory activity in an open field test. However, when the KO animals were fed a WD, the aberrant expression levels of IR isoforms in the KO mice and locomotor behavior were ameliorated indicating a complex interaction between genetic and dietary factors that might contribute to ADHD-like symptoms. Overall, our findings suggest that the lack of Sert leads to a unique metabolic phenotype in aged mice, characterized by dysregulated IR-related pathways. These changes are exacerbated by WD in the blood metabolome and are associated with behavioral abnormalities.

AB  - Network oscillations are essential for all cognitive functions. Oscillatory deficits are well established in psychiatric diseases and are recapitulated in animal models. They are significantly and specifically affected by pharmacological interventions using psychoactive compounds. Dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) activation was shown to enhance gamma rhythm in freely moving rats and to specifically affect slow delta and theta oscillations in the urethane-anesthetized rat model. The goal of this study was to test the effect of D4R activation on slow network oscillations at delta and theta frequencies during wake states, potentially supporting enhanced functional connectivity during dopamine-induced attention and cognitive processing. Network activity was recorded in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC) and nucleus reuniens (RE) in control conditions and after injecting the D4R agonist A-412997 (3 and 5 mg/kg; systemic administration). We found that A-412997 elicited a lasting (similar to 40 min) wake state and drastically enhanced narrow-band delta oscillations in the PFC and RE in a dose-dependent manner. It also preferentially enhanced delta synchrony over theta coupling within the PFC-RE-HC circuit, strongly strengthening PFC-RE coupling. Thus, our findings indicate that the D4R may contribute to cognitive processes, at least in part, through acting on wake delta oscillations and that the RE, providing an essential link between the PFC and HC, plays a prominent role in this mechanism.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) actively catalyzes estrogen hydroxylation reactions and maintains the levels of neuroactive steroid estradiol. The widely prescribed first-line anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are considered to be a potent inducer of CYP1A1 and have also been observed to affect serum estradiol and calcium levels in patients with epilepsy. However, the ability of AEDs to interfere with CYP enzyme function and estrogen disposition is a relatively unexplored area. Here we investigate the effect of widely prescribed AEDs (carbamazepine and valproic acid) on CYP1A1 regulation and the levels of estradiol and calcium in cell supernatants of hepatocellular, HepG2, and neuronal, SH-SY5Y cells. We observed that both the AEDs significantly increased CYP1A1 expression and enzyme activity, which was accompanied by a decrease in estradiol and calcium levels in HepG2 cells. This induction of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein was fully prevented by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) knockdown and StemRegenin 1 (SR1) antagonism. Notably, the AEDs did not affect the AHR expression but regulated its nuclear translocation, potentially driving the transcriptional upregulation of CYP1A1. Furthermore, the knockdown of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells elucidated a marked increase in estradiol and calcium levels. Later, this increase subsided upon AED exposure. Lastly, we observed a similar trend in estradiol and calcium alterations in SH-SY5Y cells on AED exposure, speculating the involvement of CYP1A1 induction via AEDs at neuronal sites. This work demonstrates that AEDs mediate the upregulation of CYP1A1 via an AHR-dependent mechanism and influence estrogen and calcium homeostasis.

AB  - Simple Summary Troglophile bats live in colonies, often in sites exploited for agro-pastoral purposes. Determining the composition of the microbiome of bats is an important step in understanding their ecology and biology and can also provide information on the spread of pathogenic bacteria in their populations. This study aimed to determine how epidemiological factors shape the microbiome of troglophile bats and evaluate the occurrence of potentially pathogenic bacterial species. A total of 413 Gram-negative and 183 Gram-positive strains were isolated from 189 individuals of four species of troglophile bats living in Sicilian and Calabrian territory (Italy). Besides few potentially pathogenic bacteria, several strains with a hypothesized symbiotic role were found. Background: The study of bats is of significant interest from a systematic, zoogeographic, ecological, and physiological point of view. The aim of this study is to investigate the culturable aerobic enteric, conjunctival, and oral bacterial flora of bats to determine their physiological microbiome and to investigate the possible occurrence of pathogenic bacteria. Methods: Five hundred and sixty-seven samples were collected from 189 individuals of four species of troglophile bats (Myotis myotis, Myotis capaccinii, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Rhinolophus hipposideros) living in Sicilian and Calabrian territory (Italy). All samples were tested for Gram-negative bacteria; conjunctival and oral swabs were also submitted to bacteriological examination for Gram-positive bacteria. Results: Four hundred thirteen Gram-negative strains were isolated. Of these, 377 belonged to 17 different genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae and 30 to five other families. One hundred eighty-three Gram-positive strains were isolated. Of these, 73 belonged to the Staphylococcaceae family, 72 to the Bacillaceae family and 36 to four other families. Besides some potentially pathogenic strains, several bacterial species have been found that are common to all the bat species studied. These could perhaps play a physiological or nutritional role. Conclusion: A great variety of bacterial species were identified in the cultivable microbiota of southern-Italian troglophile bats, including several potentially pathogenic strains and numerous putatively symbiotic species.

AB  - Biogenic amines dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are among the most significant monoaminergic neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). Separately, the physiological roles of DA and 5-HT have been studied in detail, and progress has been made in understanding their roles in normal and various pathological conditions (Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, addiction, depression, etc.). In this article we showed that knockout of the gene encoding DAT leads not only to a profound dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum but also in the midbrain, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, medulla oblongata and spinal cord. Furthermore, significant changes were observed in the production of mRNA of enzymes of monoamine metabolism, as well as to a notable alteration in the tissue level of serotonin, most clearly manifested in the cerebellum and the spinal cord. The observed region-specific changes in the tissue levels of serotonin and in the expression of dopamine and serotonergic metabolism enzymes in rats with an excess of dopamine can indicate important consequences for the pharmacotherapy of drugs that modulate the dopaminergic system. The drugs that affect the dopaminergic system could potently affect the serotonergic system, and this fact is important to consider when predicting their possible therapeutic or side effects.

AB  - The characteristic maximum lifespan varies enormously across animal species from a few hours to hundreds of years. This argues that maximum lifespan, and the ageing process that itself dictates lifespan, are to a large extent genetically determined. Although controversial, this is supported by firm evidence that semelparous species display evolutionarily programmed ageing in response to reproductive and environmental cues. Parabiosis experiments reveal that ageing is orchestrated systemically through the circulation, accompanied by programmed changes in hormone levels across a lifetime. This implies that, like the circadian and circannual clocks, there is a master 'clock of age' (circavital clock) located in the limbic brain of mammals that modulates systemic changes in growth factor and hormone secretion over the lifespan, as well as systemic alterations in gene expression as revealed by genomic methylation analysis. Studies on accelerated ageing in mice, as well as human longevity genes, converge on evolutionarily conserved fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors, including KLOTHO, as well as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and steroid hormones, as key players mediating the systemic effects of ageing. Age-related changes in these and multiple other factors are inferred to cause a progressive decline in tissue maintenance through failure of stem cell replenishment. This most severely affects the immune system, which requires constant renewal from bone marrow stem cells. Age-related immune decline increases risk of infection whereas lifespan can be extended in germfree animals. This and other evidence suggests that infection is the major cause of death in higher organisms. Immune decline is also associated with age-related diseases. Taking the example of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we assess the evidence that AD is caused by immunosenescence and infection. The signature protein of AD brain, A beta, is now known to be an antimicrobial peptide, and A beta deposits in AD brain may be a response to infection rather than a cause of disease. Because some cognitively normal elderly individuals show extensive neuropathology, we argue that the location of the pathology is crucial - specifically, lesions to limbic brain are likely to accentuate immunosenescence, and could thus underlie a vicious cycle of accelerated immune decline andmicrobial proliferation that culminates in AD. This general model may extend to other age-related diseases, and we propose a general paradigm of organismal senescence in which declining stem cell proliferation leads to programmed immunosenescence and mortality.

AB  - Background: Characterized by (3-amyloid (A(3) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and aberrant neuroinflammation in the brain, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Microglial polarization is a subtle mechanism which maintains immunological homeostasis and has emerged as a putative therapeutic to combat AD. Berberine (BBR) is a natural alkaloid compound with multiple pharmacological effects, and has shown considerable therapeutic potential against inflammatory disorders. However, BBR functions and underlying mechanisms in neuroinflammation remain unclear. Purpose: To examine BBR pharmacological effects and mechanisms in neuroinflammation with a view to treating AD. Methods: BBR effects on cognitive performance in 5 x FAD mice were assessed using open field, Y-maze, and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests. Neuroinflammation-related markers and A(3 pathology were examined in brain sections from mice. Transcriptomic analyses of hippocampus tissues were also conducted. Microglial BV2 cells were also used to verify potential BBR mechanisms in neuroinflammation and microglial polarization. Results: BBR improved cognitive performance, reduced amyloid pathology, and alleviated aberrant neuroinflammation in an AD mouse model. BBR induced microglial polarization to an M2-like phenotype, which was manifested by lowered and elevated proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, respectively, improved microglial uptake and A(3 clearance. Mechanistically, BBR directly interacted with TYROBP and promoted its activation by stabilizing TYROBP oligomerization. TYROBP knockdown aggravated M1-like polarization and pro-inflammatory gene expression in microglial cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+A(3, while blocked microglial M2-like polarization benefited from BBR administration. Conclusions: BBR modulated neuroinflammation by regulating microglial polarization via TYROBP activation. Our study provided new insight into BBR pharmacological actions in regulating microglial homeostasis and combating AD.

AB  - A high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with various adverse health outcomes, including cognitive impairment and an elevated risk of neurodegenerative conditions. This relationship is partially attributed to the influence of an HFD on the gut microbiota. The objective of this research was to evaluate the neuroprotective benefits of co-fermented black barley and quinoa with Lactobacillus (FG) against cognitive impairments triggered by an HFD and to investigate the microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms involved. C57BL/6J mice were randomized into four groups: the normal control group (NC, n = 10), the high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10), the high-fat diet group supplemented with FG (HFG, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10), and the high-fat diet group supplemented with Lactobacillus (HFL, 10 mL per kg BW, n = 10). Our results showed that the FG intervention enhanced the behavioral and locomotor skills of the mice, elevated the levels of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NPI) in brain tissues, and alleviated synaptic ultrastructural damage in the hippocampus. Furthermore, FG intervention was observed to exert a protective effect on both the blood-brain barrier and the colonic barrier, as evidenced by an increase in the mRNA levels of Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), Claudin-4, and Occludin in the hippocampus and colon. These beneficial effects may be attributed to FG's regulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis, which involves the restoration of intestinal flora diversity, reduction of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, and a decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory bacteria such as s_Escherichia coli E and g_Escherichia; moreover, there was an increase in the abundances of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as s_Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and s_Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the FG treatment downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathway and upregulated neurotransmitter biosynthetic pathways. These probiotic effects of FG resulted in reduced production and "leakage" of LPS and decreased mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) in hippocampal and colon tissues. Consequently, a reduction was observed in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum, hippocampus, and colon, along with suppression of the immunoreactivity of microglia and astrocytes. Our results suggest that FG may serve as an intervention strategy for preventing cognitive impairments caused by an HFD.

AB  - Designing diversified multi-cropping systems is critical for making full use of natural resources on the limited cultivated land to achieve more agricultural products in a sustainable way. However, information is still lacking on whether the higher multi-cropping index possibly decreases the use efficiency of resources and the sustain-ability of the cropping system due to more agricultural inputs on limited farmland. Therefore, this study introduced the emergy evaluation and designed two trials to quantitatively compare the efficiency and sus-tainability of different multi-cropping systems in South China, where double-rice was used as a control (CK). Trial 1 included peanut-rice (PRF), peanut-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:1) (PRM1), and peanut-rice/ ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:2) (PRM2). Trial two included maize-rice (MRF), maize-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:1) (MRM1), and maize-rice/ryegrass x milk vetch mixture (1:2) (MRM2). In trial 1, compared to CK, the annual productivity of PRF decreased 15.38%, while both PRM1 and PRM2 increased 10.49%. Results illustrated that the annual productivity of the MRF, MRM1, and MRM2 systems in trial 2 were improved by 53.85%-85.31% compared to the CK. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the maize-based cultivation patterns (MRF, MRM1, and MRM2) to use nonrenewable resources was increased by 23.56%-24.62% compared to the con-ventional double-rice system. Moreover, the emergy sustainability index (ESI) in MRM1, and MRM2 systems were 175.63% and 175.51% higher than the CK, respectively. The ESI of PRF, PRM1, and PRM2 were 12.13%, 118.20% and 118.05% higher than CK, respectively. In general, the MRM1 and MRM2 showed the highest ef-ficiency and sustainability compared to other cropping patterns. The key points to improve the efficiency and sustainability of multi-cropping systems were to optimize the fertilizer and labor inputs. This study provided valuable information for the development of diversified multi-cropping systems in South China. It was also a reference for the development of sustainable agriculture in the subtropical agricultural system in the world.

AB  - Chilotherium represents one of the most characteristic rhinocerotid genera during the late Miocene of Eurasia. In Europe, it is restricted to the eastern parts of the continent (Balkan Peninsula and Peri-Pontic region). In total, eight Chilotherium species have been described from European material, with Samos (Greece) representing the type locality of four of them. Herein, the type material of 'Chilotherium wegneri' is revisited. The type cranium is considered lost for the past half-century, but the associated mandible is still housed in the collections of the Geomuseum Munster (Germany). The 'C. wegneri' type mandible is redescribed and, taking into account the original illustration of the type cranium, compared to other chilotheres from Europe and Asia. Accordingly, the previously proposed synonymy of 'C. wegneri' and Chilotherium schlosseri, which was also initially described from the late Miocene of Samos, is further supported. Lastly, an overview of the late Miocene record of Chilotherium in Europe is provided.

AB  - Carotenoids are essential components in tea quality, contributing to leaf color and aroma. However, little information about carotenoids in different tea cultivars and their biosynthesis regulation mechanism during leaf development is known. Here we analyzed carotenoids by HPLC in the buds and leaves of 113 tea cultivars harvested on the same day. By profile clustering, carotenoids were divided into five groups. Same group cultivars displayed divergence in the total content of carotenoids but a similar molar ratio. To figure out the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we further characterized all functional lycopene cyclases, which are the branch point of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Two 13-lycopene cyclases (CsLCYB1 and CsLCYB2) and one epsilon-lycopene cyclase (CsLCYE1) were cloned. Subcellular localization analysis showed that all cloned CsLCYs were localized in plastids. Enzyme activity assays in E. coli indicated both CsLCYBs catalyzed lycopene into 13 carotene, and CsLCYE1 produced 8-carotene and epsilon-carotene. We found CsLCYB1 and CsLCYE1 predominantly expressed in leaf, while CsLCYB2 was mainly expressed during flowering stages. Suppression by antisense oligonucleotides reduced CsLCYB1 and CsLCYE1 transcripts and led to reduction of both 13,13-branch and 13,epsilon-branch carotenoids in leaf. The expression levels of CsLCYB1 showed a significant positive correlation with 13,13-branch carotenoids in leaf. Our study provides carotenoid profiles of different tea cultivars, which can assist tea producers in selecting cultivars of interest. Meanwhile, we proposed the molecular mechanism of carotenoids reflecting the tenderness of tea plant leaf from a metabolic flux perspective, and suggested lycopene cyclase that could be applied to the breeding of tea varieties with different branch carotenoids.

AB  - Lesions of the articular cartilage are frequent in all age populations and lead to functional impairment. Multiple surgical techniques have failed to provide an effective method for cartilage repair. The aim of our research was to evaluate the effect of two different compression forces on three types of cartilage repair using finite element analysis (FEA). Initially, an in vivo study was performed on sheep. The in vivo study was prepared as following: Case 0-control group, without cartilage lesion; Case 1-cartilage lesion treated with macro-porous collagen implants; Case 2-cartilage lesion treated with collagen implants impregnated with bone marrow concentrate (BMC); Case 3-cartilage lesion treated with collagen implants impregnated with adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). Using the computed tomography (CT) data, virtual femur-cartilage-tibia joints were created for each Case. The study showed better results in bone changes when using porous collagen implants impregnated with BMC or ASC stem cells for the treatment of osseocartilaginous defects compared with untreated macro-porous implant. After 7 months postoperative, the presence of un-resorbed collagen influences the von Mises stress distribution, total deformation, and displacement on the Z axis. The BMC treatment was superior to ASC cells in bone tissue morphology, resembling the biomechanics of the control group in all FEA simulations.

KW  - x-ray imaging
AB  - Background: Nearly all radiation safety courses teach that scatter radiation around the x-ray table falls with the inverse of the distance from the imaging site. Humans, however, are complex x-ray reflectors and the application of the inverse square law to clinical imaging is only assumed. Methods: We measured scatter radiation at two positions where staff commonly stand around the x-ray table. Using an anthropomorphic human phantom, human and pig cadavers, and a glass sphere, we measured scatter radiation levels in each position, and then 2- and 3-fold the distance from the imaging site. We compared the measured scatter radiation to that predicted by the common inverse square law and a more detailed geometric inverse square law. Results: In all but the glass sphere, scatter radiation was much higher below the table (68-74% of all scatter radiation, depending on model and position) than above the table (26-32% of scatter radiation, p < 0.01). Scatter radiation fell with increasing distance from the table, but above the table both inverse square laws significantly over-estimated the benefit of stepping back (19-93% overestimation by geometric inverse square law at 2-fold distance, 14-46% at 3-fold). In addition, a pelvis in the phantom appeared to cause significant scatter radiation field anomalies at the angiographer position. Conclusion: Stepping back from the table does not reduce scatter radiation levels as much as the inverse square law predicts. The geometric inverse square law best predicts the reduction in scatter radiation below the table, but above the table it too overestimates the benefit of stepping back. The irregularity of the scatter radiation field should be taken into account by scatter radiation shielding systems.

AB  - Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (NEDD4-2) encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase that is involved in epileptogenesis with mechanisms needing further investigation. We constructed a novel Nedd4-2(+/-) mouse model with half level of both Nedd4-2 long and short isoforms in the brain. Nedd4-2 haploinsufficiency caused increased susceptibility and severity of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. Of the 3379 proteins identified by the hippocampal proteomic analysis, 55 were considered altered in Nedd4-2(+/-) mice compared with wild-type control, among which the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 was up-regulated by 1.83-fold. Kir4.1 was subsequently confirmed to be less ubiquitinated in response to comprised Nedd4-2 in mouse brains and C6 cells. Kir4.1 associated with Nedd4-2 through the threonine(312)-proline motif in the intracellular domain by target mutagenesis. Adaptor protein 14-3-3 facilitated Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of Kir4.1. Our data consolidate the detailed molecular mechanism of Nedd4-2-mediated Kir4.1 ubiquitination, and provide a possible relationship between increased seizure susceptibility and impaired Kir4.1 ubiquitination in the brain.

AB  - The growing sector of dairy industry in Bulgaria leads to large waste stream formation with high pollution variation, which require specific treatment application. In the present research different fractions and wash waters from the production of kashkaval and white brined cheese, milk curd, strained yoghurt manufactured in three medium-type Bulgarian milk processing plants were studied. The basic indicators for wastewater quality: total solids (TS), total suspended solids (TSS), active reaction, fat, oil and grease (FOG), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), 5 ), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were analysed by standard procedures. The obtained results indicate that kashkaval whey from the sheep's milk processing was the most contaminated effluent, reaching COD more than 68,000 mg O2/dm3 2 /dm 3 and BOD5 5 - up to 37,000 mg O2/dm3. 2 /dm 3 . Such high concentrated wastewaters can be treated only by anaerobic methods. Secondary cheese whey (SCW) has less impurities than cheese whey, but its soluble milk fractions are difficult to biodegrade, resulting in BOD5:COD 5 :COD ratio lower than 0.40. Application of membrane technologies in milk co-product processing remove totally FOG from the SCW, where BOD5 5 and COD values are around 950 and 2.500 mg O2/dm3, 2 /dm 3 , respectively. However, the TN concentration in it is not enough to apply directly aerobic utilization. This method is the most appropriate for washing waters, which occupy both the largest volume and the cleanest fractions of all milk effluents. Future combinations of different dairy wastewaters will show the best utilization protocol for each of the milk processing plant.

AB  - Drought poses a serious threat to oilseed crops by lowering yield and crop failures under prolonged spells. A multi-year field investigation was conducted to enhance the drought tolerance in four genotypes of Camelina and canola by selenium (Se) application. The principal aim of the research was to optimize the crop yield by eliciting the physio-biochemical attributes by alleviating the adverse effects of drought stress. Both crops were cultivated under control (normal irrigation) and drought stress (skipping irrigation at stages i.e., vegetative and reproductive) conditions. Four different treatments of Se viz., seed priming with Se (75 mu M), foliar application of Se (7.06 mu M), foliar application of Se + Seed priming with Se (7.06 mu M and 75 mu M, respectively) and control (without Se), were implemented at the vegetative and reproductive stages of both crops. Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3), an inorganic compound was used as Se sources for both seed priming and foliar application. Data regarding physiochemical, antioxidants, and yield components were recorded as response variables at crop maturity. Results indicated that WP, OP, TP, proline, TSS, TFAA, TPr, TS, total chlorophyll contents, osmoprotectant (GB, anthocyanin, TPC, and flavonoids), antioxidants (APX, SOD, POD, and CAT), and yield components (number of branches per plant, thousand seed weight, seed, and biological yields were significantly improved by foliar Se + priming Se in both crops under drought stress. Moreover, this treatment was also helpful in boosting yield attributes under irrigated (non-stress) conditions. Camelina genotypes responded better to Se application as seed priming and foliar spray than canola for both years. It has concluded that Se application (either foliar or priming) can potentially alleviate adverse effects of drought stress in camelina and canola by eliciting various physio-biochemicals attributes under drought stress. Furthermore, Se application was also helpful for crop health under irrigated condition.

AB  - Trunk-like robots have attracted a lot of attention in the community of researchers interested in the general field of bio-inspired soft robotics, because trunk-like soft arms may offer high dexterity and adaptability very similar to elephants and potentially quite superior to traditional articulated manipulators. In view of the practical applications, the integration of a soft hydrostatic segment with a hard-articulated segment, i.e., a hybrid kinematic structure similar to the elephant's body, is probably the best design framework. It is proposed that this integration should occur at the conceptual/cognitive level before being implemented in specific soft technologies, including the related control paradigms. The proposed modeling approach is based on the passive motion paradigm (PMP), originally conceived for addressing the degrees of freedom problem of highly redundant, articulated structures. It is shown that this approach can be naturally extended from highly redundant to hyper-redundant structures, including hybrid structures that include a hard and a soft component. The PMP model is force-based, not motion-based, and it is characterized by two main computational modules: the Jacobian matrix of the hybrid kinematic chain and a compliance matrix that maps generalized force fields into coordinated gestures of the whole-body model. It is shown how the modulation of the compliance matrix can be used for the synergy formation process, which coordinates the hyper-redundant nature of the hybrid body model and, at the same time, for the preparation of the trunk tip in view of a stable physical interaction of the body with the environment, in agreement with the general impedance-control concept.

AB  - Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which leads to an excessive increase in plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Previous studies have shown that FH is associated with gliosis, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and memory impairment, but the mechanisms associated with these events are still not fully understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of microgliosis in the neurochemical and behavioral changes associated with FH using LDL receptor knockout (LDLr-/-) mice. We noticed that microgliosis was more severe in the hippocampus of middle-aged LDLr-/- mice, which was accompanied by microglial morphological changes and alterations in the immunocontent of synaptic protein markers. At three months of age, the LDLr(-/- )mice already showed increased microgliosis and decreased immunocontent of claudin-5 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Subsequently, 6-month-old male C57BL/6 wild-type and LDLr-/- mice were treated once daily for 30 days with minocycline (a pharmacological inhibitor of microglial cell reactivity) or vehicle (saline). Adult LDLr(-/- )mice displayed significant hippocampal memory impairment, which was ameliorated by minocycline treatment. Non-treated LDLr-/- mice showed increased microglial density in all hippocampal regions analyzed, a process that was not altered by minocycline treatment. Region-specific microglial morphological analysis revealed different effects of genotype or minocycline treatment on microglial morphology, depending on the hippocampal subregion analyzed. Moreover, 6-month-old LDLr-/- mice exhibited a slight but not significant increase in IBA-1 immunoreactivity in the PFC, which was reduced by minocycline treatment without altering microglial morphology. Minocycline treatment also reduced the presence of microglia within the perivascular area in both the PFC and hippocampus of LDLr-/- mice. However, no significant effects of either genotype or minocycline treatment were observed regarding the phagocytic activity of microglia in the PFC and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal microgliosis, microglial morphological changes, and the presence of these glial cells in the perivascular area, but not increased microglial phagocytic activity, are associated with cognitive deficits in a mouse model of FH.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary L-theanine supplementation on skeletal muscle fiber type transition in mice. Our data indicated that dietary 0.15% L-theanine supplementation significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of muscle fiber type related genes (MyHC I, MyHC IIa, PGC-1 alpha, Sirt1, Tnnt1, Tnnc1, Tnni1, MEF2C) and the protein expression levels of MyHC IIa, myoglobin, PGC-1 alpha, Sirt1 and Troponin I-SS, but significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of MyHC IIb. Dietary 0.15% L-theanine supplementation significantly increased the activities of SDH and MDH and decreased the activity of LDH. Furthermore, immunofluorescence demonstrated that dietary 0.15% L-theanine supplementation significantly increased the percentage of type I fibers, and significantly decreased the percentage of type II fibers. In addition, we found that dietary 0.15% L-theanine supplementation increased the fatigue-resistant, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and function in skeletal muscle of mice. Furthermore, di-etary 0.15% L-theanine supplementation significantly increased the mRNA levels of prox1, CaN and NFATc1, the protein levels of prox1, CNA and NFATc1 and the activity of CaN in GAS muscle when compared with the control group. These results indicated that dietary L-theanine supplementation promoted skeletal muscle fiber transition from type II-type I, which might be via activation of CaN and/or NFATc1 signaling pathway.

AB  - Background The skeletal muscle reconstruction occurs thanks to unipotent stem cells, i.e., satellite cells. The satellite cells remain quiescent and localized between myofiber sarcolemma and basal lamina. They are activated in response to muscle injury, proliferate, differentiate into myoblasts, and recreate myofibers. The stem and progenitor cells support skeletal muscle regeneration, which could be disturbed by extensive damage, sarcopenia, cachexia, or genetic diseases like dystrophy. Many lines of evidence showed that the level of oxygen regulates the course of cell proliferation and differentiation. Methods In the present study, we analyzed hypoxia impact on human and pig bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) and mouse myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Moreover, the influence of the transplantation of human bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions on skeletal muscle regeneration was studied. Results We showed that bone marrow-derived MSCs increased VEGF expression and improved myogenesis under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Transplantation of hypoxia preconditioned bone marrow-derived MSCs into injured muscles resulted in the improved cell engraftment and formation of new vessels. Conclusions We suggested that SDF-1 and VEGF secreted by hypoxia preconditioned bone marrow-derived MSCs played an essential role in cell engraftment and angiogenesis. Importantly, hypoxia preconditioned bone marrow-derived MSCs more efficiently engrafted injured muscles; however, they did not undergo myogenic differentiation.

AB  - Methylxanthines, found in the seeds, leaves, and fruits of some plants, are receiving increasing attention as promising treatments for wood-degrading fungi. The aim of the study presented herein was to explore the potential applications of caffeine, four caffeine derivatives (viz. 8-bromo-caffeine, 8-iodo-caffeine, 8-(4-fluorophenoxy)-caffeine, and 8-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroalcoxy)-caffeine), and theophylline as antifungals for Botryosphaeriaceae species associated with grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs). In vitro susceptibility tests were conducted to assess the antimycotic activity of the aforementioned compounds and their conjugated complexes with chitosan oligomers (COS). Caffeine, Br-caffeine, and I-caffeine exhibited higher efficacies than imidazole, the chosen antifungal control. Moreover, a strong synergistic behavior between COS and the methylxanthine derivatives was observed. The COS-I-caffeine complex showed the best overall performance against the phytopathogenic fungi with EC90 values of 471, 640, and 935 mu g mL(-1) for D. seriata, D. viticola, and N. parvum, respectively. In a second step, combinations of the new treatments with imidazole were also explored, resulting in further activity enhancement and EC90 values of 425, 271, and 509 mL(-1) against D. seriata, D. viticola, and N. parvum, respectively, for the COS-I-caffeine-imidazole ternary compound. Given the high in vitro efficacy of these formulations for the control of GTDs, they may deserve further investigation with in vivo and field bioassays as an alternative to conventional fungicides.

AB  - Postoperative complications, such as perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), have become a major issue affecting surgical outcomes. However, the mechanism of PND remains unclear, and stable animal models of middle-aged PND are lacking. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) allosteric activator, can reduce the level of plasma homocysteine and prevent the occurrence of PND. However, the time and resource-intensive process of constructing models of PND in elderly animals have limited progress in PND research and innovative therapy development. The present study aimed to construct a stable PND model in middle-aged CAMKII-Cre:Cbs(fl/fl) mice whose Cbs was specifically knocked out in CAMKII positive neurons. Behavioral tests showed that these middle-aged mice displayed cognitive deficits which were aggravated by exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Compared with typical PND mice which were 18-month-old, these middle-aged mice showed similar cognitive deficits after undergoing exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Though there was no significant difference in the number of neurons in either the hippocampus or the cortex, a significant increase in numbers of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus was observed. These indicate that middle-aged CAMKII-Cre:Cbs(fl/fl )mice can be used as a new PND model for mechanistic studies and therapy development for PND.

AB  - Camellia's ornamental value is constrained by its natural winter-spring flowering period. Although the discovery of Camellia azalea provides important germplasm resources for developing cultivars with year-round flowering, the molecular mechanisms underlying flowering time variation remain unclear. Here, we investigated three germplasms with distinct flowering patterns: winter-spring flowering Camellia japonica 'Tieke Baozhu', summer-autumn flowering Camellia azalea, and their hybrid Camellia 'Lingnan Yuanbao' inheriting the latter's flowering traits. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites (DAMs) were mainly enriched in the pathways related to photoperiod regulation, plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction and flavonoid synthesis. The transcription factor (TF) analysis revealed that the bHLH and MYB TF families were significantly differentially expressed in different Camellia germplasm, suggesting their potential involvement in the regulation of flowering time through the plant hormone signal transduction and photoperiod pathway. Meanwhile, photoperiod regulation related genes, including Cryptochrome circadian regulator (CRY), Timing of CAB expression 1 (TOC1), and phytochrome interacting factor 3 (PIF3), showed significant expression differences, further confirming the photoperiod pathway's crucial regulatory function. In terms of plant hormone levels, there were significant differences in the levels of gibberellin (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA) among Camellia germplasm. The differential expression characteristics of DELLA (Asp-Glu-Leu-Leu-Ala) proteins indicated that the GA signal transduction pathway was one of the key factors regulating flowering time in Camellia. Additionally, metabolomics analyses showed significant differences in flavonoid metabolite content among Camellia germplasm, which was significantly correlated with the different developmental stages of the buds. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the molecular breeding of everblooming Camellia cultivars, advancing the understanding of flowering regulation mechanism in ornamental species.

AB  - Hesperidin is a highly bioactive natural flavonoid whose role in ecological interactions is poorly known. In particular, the effects of hesperidin on herbivores are rarely reported. Flavonoids have been considered as prospective biopesticides; therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of hesperidin on the host plant selection behavior of three aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) species: Acyrthosiphon pisum Harrris, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), and Myzus persicae (Sulz.). The aphid host plants were treated with 0.1% and 0.5% ethanolic solutions of hesperidin. Aphid probing behavior in the no-choice experiment was monitored using electropenetrography and aphid settling on plants in the choice experiment was recorded. The results demonstrated that hesperidin can be applied as a pre-ingestive, ingestive, and post-ingestive deterrent against A. pisum, as an ingestive deterrent against R. padi, and as a post-ingestive deterrent against M. persicae using the relatively low 0.1% concentration. While in A. pisum the deterrent effects of hesperidin were manifested as early as during aphid probing in peripheral plant tissues, in M. persicae, the avoidance of plants was probably the consequence of consuming the hesperidin-containing phloem sap.

AB  - The good preservation of a new specimen allows us to recognize Nilssoniopteris longifolius Chang from the Middle-Late Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation near Daohugou Village, Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia, China. The presence of syndetocheilic stomata suggests that the leaf belongs to Bennettitales. The occurrence of various types of insect feeding damage on a single lamina indicates that the interactions between Bennettitales and insects were more complex than previously assumed.

AB  - The activation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel has anti-fibrotic effects in the lung and intestine. Suburothelial myofibroblasts (subu-MyoFBs), a specialized subset of fibroblasts in the bladder, are known to express TRPA1. However, the role of the TRPA1 in the development of bladder fibrosis remains elusive. In this study, we use the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta) to induce fibrotic changes in subu-MyoFBs and assess the consequences of TRPA1 activation utilizing RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. TGF-beta 1 stimulation increased alpha-SMA, collagen type I alpha 1 chain(col1A1), collagen type III (col III), and fibronectin expression, while simultaneously suppressing TRPA1 in cultured human subu-MyoFBs. The activation of TRPA1, with its specific agonist allylisothiocyanate (AITC), inhibited TGF-beta 1-induced fibrotic changes, and part of these inhibition effects could be reversed by the TRPA1 antagonist, HC030031, or by reducing TRPA1 expression via RNA interference. Furthermore, AITC reduced spinal cord injury-induced fibrotic bladder changes in a rat model. The increased expression of TGF-beta 1, alpha-SMA, col1A1 and col III, and fibronectin, and the downregulation of TRPA1, were also detected in the mucosa of fibrotic human bladders. These findings suggest that TRPA1 plays a pivotal role in bladder fibrosis, and the negative cross talk between TRPA1 and TGF-beta 1 signaling may represent one of the mechanisms underlying fibrotic bladder lesions.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of three chloroplast barcodes (trnL, rbcL, and matK) for identifying 14 co-occurring plant species representing six common families of plants in the Aspen Parkland of Alberta. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis and genetic distancing showed that matK exhibited the highest within-family genetic distance but lacked universal primers. While rbcL was easily amplified, it had lower discriminatory power. In contrast, trnL offered superior within-family species discrimination and possesses a shorter fragment that can be amplified, which lends it suitable for next-generation sequencing of degraded plant DNA in fecal samples of herbivores.

AB  - Preys use their memory - where they sensed a predatory threat and whether a safe shelter is nearby - to dynamically control their survival instinct to avoid harm and reach safety. However, it remains unknown which brain regions are involved, and how such top -down control of innate behavior is implemented at the circuit level. Here, using adult male mice, we show that the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN) is best positioned to control this task as an exclusive target of the hippocampus (HPC) within the medial hypothalamic defense system. Selective optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of hippocampal inputs to the AHN revealed that the HPC -> AHN pathway not only mediates the contextual memory of predator threats but also controls the goal-directed escape by transmitting information about the surrounding environment. These results reveal a new mechanism for experience-dependent, top -down control of innate defensive behaviors.

AB  - The paper presents research on the process of densifying rye-wheat straw for its use in producing mouldable biofuel. The straw used in the research is a waste material from a farm located in Wielkopolska, resulting from the cultivation of triticale for the purpose of producing feed for pig farming. The aim of the study is to determine the utilisation of this material for the production of an agglomerate for energy purposes, such as heating the farm's infrastructure. The research was conducted for two moisture levels of straw: M = 10% and 30%. Before the experiment, the straw was cut into particles of the desired size: S = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mm. The densification process was carried out at temperatures T = 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 degrees C, subjecting the straw to a compaction pressure of 15 MPa. Based on experimental studies, two values of the densification degree were determined: x1-the densification degree under load; and x2-the densification degree after unloading. The densification degree x2 is more relevant from the perspective of storage and transport. ANOVA analysis of the results showed that the most significant factors affecting x1 were particle size S and process temperature T, with higher x1 values obtained for straw moisture of 30%. The ANOVA analysis of the densification degree after unloading (x2) revealed that higher x2 values were achieved for straw with 10% moisture and the smallest particle size of 10 mm. The most significant factors affecting x2 were particle size and moisture content. Studies of the friction coefficient between the straw and the materials of the densification equipment components indicated that the optimal process temperature is 150 degrees C. The conducted research and the obtained results determined the optimal input parameters for the process and also provided a solid support for further studies, including investigation of the influence of other factors, such as binders.

AB  - The pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) leaves were analysed by the means of morphometric methods in the Outstanding Natural Landscape "Kosmaj" in Serbia. The main goals were to determine the level of intraspecific variability of pubescent oak leaves and to link it to local habitat conditions. Morphological analysis of size and shape (MASS) and landmark analyses were used for the investigation of the leaves, and observed differences were correlated to habitat conditions (altitude, slope, aspect) obtained by the digital terrain model. This study showed a clear pattern of intraspecific variability of leaf size and shape at a small spatial scale, and the presence of fluctuating asymmetry, length, and lobation differences as a response to local habitat conditions. The findings suggest that morphological variability can represent a useful tool for detecting changes in the environment, especially in areas where the pubescent oak is considered endangered.

AB  - Subgroup 4 (Sg4) members of the R2R3-MYB are generally known as negative regulators of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants. Our previous research showed that a R2R3-MYB Sg4 member from Camellia sinensis (CsMYB4a) inhibits expression of some genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, but its physiological function in the tea plant remained unknown. Here, CsMYB4a was found to be highly expressed in anther and filaments, and participated in regulating filament growth. Transcriptome analysis and exogenous auxin treatment showed that the target of CsMYB4a might be the auxin signal pathway. Auxin/ indole-3-acetic acid 4 (AUX/IAA4), a repressor in auxin signal transduction, was detected from a yeast two-hybrid screen using CsMYB4a as bait. Gene silencing assays showed that both CsIAA4 and CsMYB4a regulate filament growth. Tobacco plants overexpressing CsIAA4 were insensitive to exogenous a-NAA, consistent with overexpression of CsMYB4a. Protein-protein interaction experiments revealed that CsMYB4a interacts with N -terminal of CsIAA4 to prevent CsIAA4 degradation. Knock out of the endogenous NtIAA4 gene, a CsIAA4 homolog, in tobacco alleviated filament growth inhibition and a- NAA insensitivity in plants overexpressing CsMYB4a. All results strongly suggest that CsMYB4a works synergistically with CsIAA4 and participates in regulation of the auxin pathway in stamen.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The embryos of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine used to treat insomnia, memory decline, and dementia for a long time. However, the underlying material basis and mechanisms of this medicine are still unclear. Isoliensinine (IL) is a major alkaloid derived from lotus embryos. Our previous research has demonstrated that IL can exert strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in vitro. Aim of the study: To reveal the underlying therapeutic effect and mechanism of IL on Alzheimer's disease (AD)- like mice induced by AlCl3 and D-galactose (D-gal) in vivo. Materials and methods: The AD-like mice were modeled by intragastric injection (i.g.) of AlCl3 (20 mg/kg/day) and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of D-gal (120 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. Starting from the third week, AD-like mice were treated with IL (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 6 weeks. Cognitive impairment in AD-like mice was evaluated through some behavioral experiments including nest building, open field, novel object recognition, Y maze, and Morris water maze tests. The cortex and hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3) regions were analyzed as follows: Neuronal pathological changes and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and silver staining, respectively; The production of A beta plaques and the activation of microglia and astrocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry; The levels of Ca2+ levels were determined by the ortho-cresolphtalein complexone method. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta) were analyzed using the ELISA kits. The expression of CaM, p-CaMKII, Calpain, CDK5, p35/p25, p-Tau, ADAM10, BACE1, PSEN1, APP, A beta 1-42, p-I kappa B alpha, and I kappa B alpha were evaluated by western blotting. Results: IL (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) treatment effectively ameliorated cognitive impairment in AD-like model mice. IL inhibited the decrease of brain index and body weight in AD-like mice and alleviated neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampus (DG, CA1, and CA3). IL decreased the levels of Ca2+ and reduce high expression of CaM and Calpain in the cortex and hippocampus of AD-like mice. IL treatment did not affect the expression of CDK5 but inhibited the expression of p-CaMKII and p25/p35, and reduced Tau phosphorylation and NFTs formation. IL also down-regulated the high expression of A beta 1-42 and APP and regulated the expression of APP-cleavage secretase (reducing the expression of BACE1 and PSEN1, while increasing the expression of ADAM10), thereby inhibited the production of A beta plaques in AD-like mouse brain. Moreover, IL inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of I kappa B alpha, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1 beta), and prevented the activation of microglia and astrocytes in AD-like mice. Conclusions: IL has a significant therapeutic effect on pathological alterations and cognitive impairment in AlCl3 and D-gal-induced AD-like mice, indicating that IL may have the potential to treat AD. The anti-AD activity of IL may be associated with its regulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis and downstream signaling molecules such as CaM and Calpain.

AB  - The cardiac Mg2+-sensitive, TRPM6, and TRPM7-like channels remain undefined, especially with the uncertainty regarding TRPM6 expression in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, their contribution to the cardiac action potential (AP) profile is unclear. Immunofluorescence assays showed the expression of the TRPM6 and TRPM7 proteins in isolated pig atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, of which the expression was modulated by incubation in extracellular divalent cation-free conditions. In patch clamp studies of cells dialyzed with solutions containing zero intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+](i)) to activate the Mg2+-sensitive channels, raising extracellular [Mg2+] ([Mg2+](o)) from the 0.9-mM baseline to 7.2 mM prolonged the AP duration (APD). In contrast, no such effect was observed in cells dialyzed with physiological [Mg2+](i). Under voltage clamp, in cells dialyzed with zero [Mg2+](i), depolarizing ramps induced an outward-rectifying current, which was suppressed by raising [Mg2+](o) and was absent in cells dialyzed with physiological [Mg2+](i). In cells dialyzed with physiological [Mg2+](i), raising [Mg2+](o) decreased the L-type Ca2+ current and the total delayed-rectifier current but had no effect on the APD. These results suggest a co-expression of the TRPM6 and TRPM7 proteins in cardiomyocytes, which are therefore the molecular candidates for the native cardiac Mg2+-sensitive channels, and also suggest that the cardiac Mg2+-sensitive current shortens the APD, with potential implications in arrhythmogenesis.

AB  - Unreduced gametes through chromosome doubling play a major role in the process of plant polyploidization. Our previous work con firmed that Camellia oleifera can produce natural 2n pollen, and it is possible to induce the 2n pollen formation by high temperature treatment. This study focused on the optimization of the 2n pollen induction technique and the mechanisms of high temperature-induced 2n pollen formation in C. oleifera. We found that the optimal protocol for inducing 2n pollen via high temperature was to perform 45 degrees C with 4 h at the prophase I stage of the pollen mother cells (PMCs). Meanwhile, high temperature signi ficantly decreased the yield and fertility of 2n pollen. Through the observation of meiosis, abnormal chromosome and cytological behaviour was discovered under high-temperature treatment, and we con firmed that the formation of 2n pollen is caused by abnormal cell plate. Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis, fifteen hub genes related to cell cycle control were identi fied. After male flower buds were exposed to heat shock, polygalacturonase gene (CoPGX3) was signi ficantly upregulated. We inferred that high temperature causes the CoPGX3 gene to be overexpressed and that CoPGX3 is redistributed into the cytosol where it degrades cytoplasmic pectin, which leads to an abnormal cell plate. Furthermore, abnormal cytokinesis resulted in the formation of dyads and triads, and PMCs divided to produce 2n pollen. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of 2n pollen induced by high temperature in a woody plant and lay a foundation for further ploidy breeding of C. oleifera.

AB  - Elephant grass (Cenchrus purpureus) is an important forage crop hindered by high lignin content. Although MYB transcription factors (TFs) regulate lignin biosynthesis, their roles in elephant grass remain unclear. In this study, we identified 247 CpMYB TFs through whole-genome bioinformatic analysis of elephant grass and classified them into 23 phylogenetic subgroups. Among them, 233 were mapped to 14 chromosomes, and 14 to unanchored contigs. Gene structure, conserved motifs, and domain analyses revealed subgroup-specific conservation and CpMYB proteins dominated by random coils and alpha-helices. Gene duplication and selection pressure analyses indicated that segmental duplication predominantly contributed to family expansion. Transcriptome analysis identified 48 CpMYB genes differentially expressed in internodes at least one of three developmental stages, with promoters containing various growth-, phytohormone-, and stress-related cis-elements. Additionally, nine CpMYB genes were consistently differentially expressed across all three stages, and predicted protein-DNA interaction suggested that four of them (CpMYB094, CpMYB131, CpMYB145, and CpMYB148) potentially regulate key lignin biosynthetic genes, including 4-coumarate:CoA ligase 1 (4CL1), hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase 1/7 (CCoAOMT1/7), and reduced epidermal fluorescence 3 (REF3). However, their regulatory functions require further experimental validation. Overall, this study characterizes the CpMYB family in elephant grass and highlights their potential roles in lignin biosynthesis.

AB  - Currently, there is an unmet need for treatments promoting post-stroke functional recovery. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the dose-dependent effect of delayed atomoxetine or fluoxetine therapy (starting on post-stroke day 5), coupled with limited physical exercise (2 hours daily voluntary wheel running; post-stroke days 9 to 42), on motor recovery of adult male mice after photothrombotic stroke. These drugs are selective norepinephrine or serotonin reuptake inhibitors indicated for disorders unrelated to stroke. The predetermined primary end-point for this study was motor function measured in two tasks of spontaneous motor behaviors in grid-walking and cylinder tests. Additionally, we quantified the running distance and speed throughout the study, the number of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the medial agranular cortex and infarct volumes. Both sensorimotor tests revealed that neither limited physical exercise nor a drug treatment alone significantly facilitated motor recovery in mice after stroke. However, combination of physical exercise with either of the drugs promoted restoration of motor function by day 42 post-stroke, with atomoxetine being a more potent drug. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the ipsilateral medial agranular cortex of mice with recovering motor function, while infarct volumes were comparable among experimental groups. If further validated in larger studies, our observations suggest that add-on atomoxetine or fluoxetine therapy coupled with limited, structured physical rehabilitation could offer therapeutic modality for stroke survivors who have difficulty to engage in early, high-intensity physiotherapy. Furthermore, in light of the recently completed Assessment oF FluoxetINe In sTroke recoverY (AFFINITY) and Efficacy oF Fluoxetine-a randomisEd Controlled Trial in Stroke (EFFECTS) trials, our observations call for newly designed studies where fluoxetine or atomoxetine pharmacotherapy is evaluated in combination with structured physical rehabilitation rather than alone. This study was approved by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 16019).

AB  - This study aimed to identify the phytochemical compounds of Matricaria pubescens by LC-MS/MS and evaluate the potential protective effect of its supplementation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adult rats through modulation of oxidative stress and histopathological changes. Twenty-four male rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group served as control and received the standard diet. The second group (HFD) received a high-fat diet only (30 % of sheep fat). The third group's (control+MP) animals received a standard diet supplemented with 5 % M. pubescens (w/w). The fourth group (HFD+MP) received a high-fat diet supplemented with 5 % M. pubescens for 16 weeks. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that M. pubescens contains many phytochemical compounds. It was observed that the ethanolic extract of M. pubescens has a higher phenolic content than the aqueous extract. The supplementation of M. pubescens (5 % w/w) to HFD rats decreased significantly (p<0.01) body weight, liver and epididymal adipose tissue relative weights, glycemia, triglycerides (TG), insulin resistance, liver markers, TNF-alpha, malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) level, and increased reduced glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase activities as well as ameliorated histological alterations through the reduction hepatic lipid deposition and adipocytes hypertrophy compared to the HFD group. We conclude that M. pubescens powder may be effective for correcting hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and liver markers while decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver of high-fat diet-fed rats.

AB  - (1) Background: Screening of medicinal herbs is one of the most powerful approaches to identifying novel therapeutic molecules against many human diseases. To avoid potential harmful effects during medicinal use, toxicity testing is necessary in the early stages of drug discovery. The objective of this study was to identify the cytotoxic mechanisms of jegosaponin A and B from Styrax japonica Siebold et al. Zuccarini; (2) Methods: We screened Japanese medicinal herb extracts using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and found that a methanol extract isolated from the unripe fruit of Styrax japonica Siebold et al. Zuccarini (SJSZ) had an inhibitory effect on cell viability. We further performed fractionation assays with PC-3 cells and identified the bioactive compounds using LC/MS and NMR analysis. We clarified the toxic mechanisms of these compounds using PC-3 cells and zebrafish embryos; (3) Results: We identified two active molecules, jegosaponin A and jegosaponin B, in the inhibitory fractions of the methanol extract. These jegosaponins are toxic to zebrafish embryos during the early developmental stage. Jegosaponin A and B showed strong haemolytic activity in sheep defibrinated blood (EC50 = 2.1 mu M, and 20.2 mu M, respectively) and increased the cell membrane permeability in PC-3 cells and zebrafish embryos, which were identified using a membrane non-permeable DRAQ7, a fluorescent nucleus staining dye; (4) We identified the cytotoxic compounds jegosaponin A and B from SJSZ, which we showed to exhibit cell membrane disruptive properties using cell- and zebrafish-based testing.

In this study, a green and efficient process for the extraction of beta-carotene from sea buckthorn berries through the simultaneous use of ultrasound and microwave, using a novel green solvent, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), is described. For the same extraction time (45 min), the beta-carotene content in the extract was significantly increased (according to ANOVA analysis-p < 0.05) by the simultaneous use of ultrasound and microwave, compared with the separate use of these technologies-an increase of 15 and 89% compared with ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), respectively. The resulting extract can be used directly, without further purification, as a food supplement because the solvent itself is safe for consumption. Furthermore, FAEE contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which add to the health benefits of the extract. When beta-carotene is extracted from the plant matrix, it is subjected to degradation due to oxidation, but the addition of the antioxidant vitamin E (13 mg/mL of extract) to the extract extends its stability to more than 90 days at room temperature even when exposed to light. The addition of vitamin E also enhances the health benefits of the extract.

AB  - Toll-like receptors are involved in the recognition of bacterial toxins, which cause infection in the respiratory system. This study aimed to evaluate microanatomical and histological alterations in the lungs of 24 healthy Akkaraman and Romanov lambs after the administration of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and LTA + LPS and investigate the gene, protein, and immune expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, and TNF-& alpha; molecules, known to have immune functions. Microanatomical examinations showed thickened peribronchial and alveolar walls in the lungs of groups LTA, LPS, and LTA + LPS of both breeds due to immune cell infiltration. TLR4, MyD88, and TNF-& alpha; immunoexpressions were positive to varying degrees in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the bronchial and bronchiolar luminal epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. TLR4 and TNF-& alpha; protein expressions were statistically different in the LPS-treated Romanov lambs, compared to the other groups. Among the Akkaraman lambs, TLR4 gene expression was significantly higher in group LPS, and among the Romanov lambs, TLR4, MyD88, and TNF-& alpha; gene expressions were significantly higher in group LTA + LPS. Therefore, TLR4, MyD88, and TNF-& alpha; molecules, involved in the immune response, were found to be expressed at different levels against LTA and LPS in the lungs of two different sheep breeds.

AB  - Natural compounds identified via the SELFormer pipeline for cognitive enhancement may exert neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke (IS) through both direct actions on the central nervous system and potential modulation of the gut microbiota. However, it remains unclear whether such benefits persist under conditions in which gut-brain neural communication is compromised. We aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of beta-citronellol (BCT), beta-caryophyllene (BCP), and citronellyl acetate (CTA) in an IS model with compromised vagal signaling. Mongolian gerbils received daily oral treatment with dextrin (Control), BCT (100 mg/kg), BCP (20 mg/kg), or CTA (100 mg/kg) for 2 weeks before undergoing subdiaphragmatic vagotomy followed by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion; sham-operated animals treated with dextrin served as Normal-C. During an additional 4 weeks of treatment, we assessed neuronal survival, cognitive function, metabolism, neuroinflammation, and gut microbiota composition and metabolism. BCT demonstrated superior neuroprotection, followed by BCP, with CTA showing modest efficacy compared to the control. BCT and BCP increased hippocampal CA1 neurons and improved memory function. Treatments reduced hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) while enhancing cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism, and lipid profiles. Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased alpha-diversity and restoration of beneficial bacteria, including Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium, particularly with BCT treatment. BCT and BCP increased butyrate-producing bacteria. These improvements occurred despite vagal nerve disruption, indicating alternative neuroprotective mechanisms through enhanced intestinal barrier integrity and microbiota-derived metabolites. In conclusion, these compounds, especially BCT, protect against neuronal death and cognitive impairment in IS conditions through integrated effects on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and non-vagal gut-brain communication pathways. Therefore, BCT and BCP were potential for IS prevention and treatment strategies.

AB  - The management of food and food-related wastes represents a growing global issue, as they are hard to recycle and dispose of. Foremost, waste can serve as an important source of biomasses. Particularly, fat-enriched biomasses are receiving more and more attention for their role in the manufacturing of biofuels. Nonetheless, many biomasses have been set aside over the years. Wool wax, also known as lanolin, has a huge potential for becoming a source of typical and atypical fatty acids. The main aim of this work was to evaluate and assess a protocol for the fractioning of fatty acids from lanolin, a natural by-product of the shearing of sheep, alongside the design of a new and rapid quantitative GC-MS method for the derivatization of free fatty acids in fat mixtures, using MethElute (TM). As the acid portion of lanolin is characterized by the presence of both aliphatic and hydroxylated fatty acids, we also evaluated a procedure for the parting of these two species, by using NMR spectroscopy, benefitting of the different solubilities of the components in organic solvents. At last, we evaluated and quantified the fatty acids and the alpha-hydroxy fatty acids present in each attained portion, employing both analytical and synthetic standards. The performed analyses, both qualitative and quantitative, showed a good performance in the parting of the different acid components, and GC-MS allowed to speculate that the majority of alpha-hydroxylated fatty acids is formed of linear saturated carbon chains, while the totality of properly said fatty acids has a much more complex profile.

AB  - This work aims to clarify the effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake on the adult brain affected by amyloid pathology. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rat and 5xFAD Tg mouse models that represent earlier or later disease stages were employed. The animals were exposed to a control diet (CD) or an HFD based on corn oil, from young (rats) or adult (mice) ages for 24 or 10 weeks, respectively. In rats and mice, the HFD impaired reference memory in wild-type (WT) animals but did not worsen it in Tg, did not cause obesity, and did not increase triglycerides or glucose levels. Conversely, the HFD promoted stronger microglial activation in Tg vs. WT rats but had no effect on cerebral amyloid deposition. IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 plasma levels were increased in Tg rats, regardless of diet, while CXCL1 chemokine levels were increased in HFD-fed mice, regardless of genotype. Hippocampal 3-nitrotyrosine levels tended to increase in HFD-fed Tg rats but not in mice. Overall, an HFD with an elevated omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio as compared to the CD (25:1 vs. 8.4:1) did not aggravate the outcome of AD regardless of the stage of amyloid pathology, suggesting that many neurobiological processes relevant to AD are not directly dependent on PUFA intake.

AB  - Marine top predators such as ringed seals biomagnify environmental contaminants; and with the increasing human activities in the Arctic, ringed seals are exposed to biologically significant concentrations of trace ele-ments resulting in reproductive impairment, immunosuppression, and neurological damages. Little is known about the molecular effects of heavy metals on these vulnerable apex predators suffering from a rapidly changing Arctic with significant loss of sea-ice. In the present study, concentrations of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) were measured in liver of sixteen Greenlandic ringed seals (nine adults and seven subadults) together with molecular biomarkers involved in bio-transformation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption and immune activity in blood and blubber. The concentrations of trace elements increased in the following order: Hg > Se > Cd with levels of mercury and selenium being highest in adults. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) and interleukin - 2 (IL-2) mRNA transcript levels were highest in blubber, while heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and interleukin - 10 (IL-10) were significantly higher in blood. There were no significant correlations between the concentrations of trace elements and mRNA transcript levels suggesting that stressors other than the trace elements investigated are responsible for the changes in gene expression levels. Since Hg seems to increase in Greenlandic ringed seals, there is a need to re-enforce health monitoring of this ringed seal population.

AB  - Stem cuttings are often exploited for asexual propagation of cycad plants, and impaired health of the source plants may reduce success. A reliable procedure that screens potential source plants for predicted success would benefit conservationists. The cut surfaces of Cycas revoluta stem cuttings obtained from source plants that had endured 0-39 weeks of Aulacaspis yasumatsui herbivory were stained with potassium triiodide to determine if this visual test could predict asexual propagation success. The stem cuttings were sorted into three groups based on stain intensity, then specific gravity and starch concentration of pith and cortex tissue were measured. The cuttings were maintained in a propagation nursery for 27 weeks, then root growth was quantified as dry weight. Specific gravity ranged from 1.01 to 1.11 and scaled linearly with starch concentration, which ranged from 16 to 195 mg<middle dot>g(-1). The group of cuttings with the darkest stain intensity exhibited 100% propagation success with 23 g of roots per cutting, and the group with the least stain intensity exhibited 30% success with 2 g of roots per cutting. The group of stems with intermediate stain intensity exhibited intermediate values of every metric. These results indicated that cycad cuttings may be stained with iodine to estimate starch content in the field to provide an accurate instantaneous visual test for selection of the source plants that reliably generate the greatest level of asexual propagation success.

AB  - Erysiphe cruciferarum, a causative agent of powdery mildew disease, has emerged as a serious threat in Brassica juncea and its closely related species. To date, no resistant cultivars have been identified in Brassica species against powdery mildew. Here, we used histopathological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to elucidate the powdery mildew disease progression and host responses in three Brassica cenospecies, namely B. juncea, Camelina sativa, and Sinapis alba. Based on the results of disease progression, S. alba was found to be extremely resistant to powdery mildew infection, whereas B. juncea and C. sativa were highly vulnerable. In addition, the disease spread rate to uninfected parts was comparatively higher in B. juncea and C. sativa. Histopathological results revealed more pathogen-induced cell death in B. juncea and C. sativa compared to S. alba. We also examined the role of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in B. juncea, C. sativa, and S. alba after powdery mildew infection. Based on our findings, the enzyme activity of SOD, POD, and CAT was relatively higher in S. alba then that of B. juncea and C. sativa after powdery mildew infection. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression levels of salicylic acid (SA) signature genes, including pathogenesis-related protein viz., PR1, PR2, and PR5 in B. juncea, C. sativa, and S. alba after E. cruciferarum infection. Based on our findings, the expression levels of SA marker genes PR1, PR2, and PR5 increased in all three species after infection. However, the fold change was relatively higher in S. alba than in B. juncea and C. sativa. In future, further studies are required to identify the potential candidates in S. alba that are involved in powdery mildew disease resistance.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells line the luminal surface to establish the intestinal barrier, where the cells play essential roles in the digestion of food, absorption of nutrients and water, protection from microbial infections, and maintaining symbiotic interactions with the commensal microbial populations. Maintaining and coordinating all these functions requires tight regulatory signaling, which is essential for intestinal homeostasis and organismal health. Dysfunction of intestinal epithelial cells, indeed, is linked to gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and gluten-related enteropathies. Emerging evidence suggests that peroxisome metabolic functions are crucial in maintaining intestinal epithelial cell functions and intestinal epithelium regeneration and, therefore, homeostasis. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which peroxisome metabolism impacts enteric health using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and murine model organisms and clinical samples. We show that peroxisomes control cellular cholesterol, which in turn regulates the conserved yes-associated protein-signaling and contributes to intestinal epithelial structure and epithelial barrier function. Moreover, analysis of intestinal organoid cultures derived from biopsies of patients affected by Crohn's Disease revealed that the dysregulation of peroxisome number, excessive cellular cholesterol, and inhibition of Yap-signaling are markers of disease and could be novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets for treating Crohn's Disease. Our studies provided mechanistic insights on peroxisomal signaling in intestinal epithelial cell functions and identified cholesterol as a novel metabolic regulator of yes-associated protein-signaling in tissue homeostasis.

AB  - IntroductionNeonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI) causes injury to the blood brain barrier (BBB), which in turn is associated with widespread cell loss. Cell therapies are currently being investigated for use in perinatal neuroprotection and umbilical cord blood (UCB) endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs; CD133+) have been previously shown to reduce gross neuropathology associated with HI; however, no study has investigated the effect of EPC treatment on the vulnerable BBB. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of EPC treatment on BBB integrity in a neonatal rat model of HI.MethodsHI brain injury was induced in postnatal day (PND) 7 rat pups via permanent ligation of the left carotid artery, followed by a 180-minute hypoxic challenge at 8% O2. At 24 h post-insult, 2 x 105 EPCs were administered via intraperitoneal injection. At 7 days post-HI, brains and choroid plexuses were collected for immunohistochemistry or molecular analyses.ResultsNeonatal HI resulted in neuropathology, with a significant increase in left hemisphere tissue loss. This was associated with microglial activation, astrogliosis and increased expression of Aquaporin 4 in the somatosensory cortex, and EPC administration significantly reduced these outcomes. Assessment of the BBB revealed GLUT1 and claudin-5 expression were significantly increased in HI animals compared to sham, and treatment with EPCs reduced these to sham control levels.ConclusionEPCs are a promising treatment option for neonatal HI as they modulate BBB changes. However, further studies are needed to understand early effects of EPC treatment and how EPC therapy modulates BBB dysfunction post HI brain injury.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive synaptic dysfunction, deterioration of neuronal transmission, and consequently neuronal death. Although there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant, in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated, resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD. Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128 expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128 expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and function.

AB  - Efficient planning in complex environments requires that uncertainty associated with current inferences and possible consequences of forthcoming actions is represented. Representation of uncertainty has been established in sensory systems during simple perceptual decision making tasks but it remains unclear if complex cognitive computations such as planning and navigation are also supported by probabilistic neural representations. Here, we capitalized on gradually changing uncertainty along planned motion trajectories during hippocampal theta sequences to capture signatures of uncertainty representation in population responses. In contrast with prominent theories, we found no evidence of encoding parameters of probability distributions in the momentary population activity recorded in an open-field navigation task in rats. Instead, uncertainty was encoded sequentially by sampling motion trajectories randomly and efficiently in subsequent theta cycles from the distribution of potential trajectories. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that the hippocampus is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning by representing uncertainty.

AB  - A wide range of techniques in neuroscience involve placing individual probes at precise locations in the brain. However, large-scale measurement and manipulation of the brain using such methods have been severely limited by the inability to miniaturize systems for probe positioning. Here, we present a fundamentally new, remote-controlled micropositioning approach composed of novel phase-change material-filled resistive heater micro-grippers arranged in an inchworm motor configuration. The microscopic dimensions, stability, gentle gripping action, individual electronic control, and high packing density of the grippers allow micrometer-precision independent positioning of many arbitrarily shaped probes using a single piezo actuator. This multi-probe single-actuator design significantly reduces the size and weight and allows for potential automation of microdrives. We demonstrate accurate placement of multiple electrodes into the rat hippocampus in vivo in acute and chronic preparations. Our robotic microdrive technology should therefore enable the scaling up of many types of multi-probe applications in neuroscience and other fields.

AB  - Neurological disorders are devastating conditions affecting both cognitive and motor-related functions in aged people. Yet there is no proper medication to treat these illnesses, and the currently available medications can only provide symptomatic relief to the patients. All neurological disorders share the same etiology, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurochemical deficiency, neuronal loss, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, neuroinflammation, and disease-related protein aggregation. Nowadays, researchers use antioxidant-based strategies to prevent or halt the disease progression. Nerolidol, a strong antioxidant, possesses various biological activities and properties that treat cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and many other diseases. Many recent publications and research studies highlight the beneficial effect of nerolidol on brain disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, nerolidol shows neuroprotection by decreasing amyloid plaque formation, lipid peroxidation, cholinergic neuronal loss, locomotor dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and hippocampal damage via enhancing antioxidant expression. Also, it shows neuroprotection against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting microglial activation. Another study reported that nerolidol shows antiepileptic effects in animal models by suppressing kindling-induced memory impairment by decreasing oxidative stress. It has been found that NRL administration increases the antioxidant levels, decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokine release as well as decreasing the apoptotic protein and cerebral infarct size. In conclusion, nerolidol tends to reverse the harmful effects of disease-related factors, including OS, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and apoptosis, making nerolidol a choiceable drug for the management of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanism of nerolidol in treating various neurological disorders.

AB  - The phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene family in tea plants ( Camellia sinensis L.) encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of the phenylpropane metabolic pathway. The present study aimed to characterize the PAL genes in tea plants, and get better insights on the CsPALs in anthocyanins accumulation. Seven CsPAL genes were identified and characterized in tea plants by bioinformatics analysis. Systematic analysis of CsPALs was conducted for its phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, chromosomal location, and protein conserved motifs based on tea plant genome. The cis-elements of CsPALs were responsive to light, abiotic stress, hormone, and MYB-binding site. Furthermore, tissue specific expression analysis showed that CsPAL4 was expressed preferentially in young leaves and buds. Correlation analysis was performed in purple-leaf tea with anthocyanin components, and it was suggested that CsPAL4 was closely related with different anthocyanin accumulated, especially with cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-O-glucoside. Additionally, the putative upstream regulation factors CsMYBs (CsMYB59, CsARR1, CsSRM1, CsMYB101, and CsMYB52) and CsbHLHs (CsbHLH104, CsbHLH3, CsbIM1, CsTCP14, and CsPIF4) could bind to the promoter of CsPALs, thereby activating its transcription. This study provides a theoretical basis for further research to elucidate the functions of the CsPAL genes.

AB  - The Brassicaceae family is composed of a broad range of species, including the economically important crops from Brassica, Raphanus, Camelina and Sinapis genera. The production of Brassicaceae species, particularly the crop members, is threatened by major diseases. However, the impact of diseases can be minimized or even negated by improving disease resistance. Transmembrane-coiled-coil (TM-CC) genes are a type of resistance gene analogue (RGA) that have been proven to play specific roles in resistance to several diseases. Here, TM-CCs have been predicted in 27 genomes from Brassicaceae genera including Arabidopsis, Arabis, Barbarea, Boechera, Brassica, Camelina, Capsella, Cardamine, Eutrema, Leavenworthia, Lepidium, Raphanus, Sinapis, Sisymbrium, Schrenkiella and Thlaspi. The number of TM-CCs varies throughout the studied genomes, as well as between genera, diploids and polyploids, and Brassica genomes and subgenomes. In total, 6788 TM-CCs were identified, with 708 of them predicted with signalling function, 172 colocalized with previously known disease resistance regions and 70 phylogenetically related to cloned resistance genes, indicating the possible functional involvement of TM-CCs in resistance. This study provides a resource for the identification of functional Brassicaceae TM-CCs along with their clustering and duplication patterns and provides a benchmark for further studies investigating TM-CCs.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is an important beverage consumed worldwide. In Uganda, it is the second-largest and highly prioritized export crop after coffee and provides the much-needed jobs to more than 800,000 people. Despite its importance in the country, the crop has received very limited research attention for its improvement and optimal utilization. This study was aimed at characterizing existing tea germplasm in Uganda to inform future breeding initiatives for market-preferred tea varieties. Fifty-eight advanced tea clones were randomly selected from the tea germplasm conserved at Uganda's Tea Research Center in Rwebitaba and analyzed in the laboratory for eight physicochemical descriptors. Hierarchical cluster analysis performed on the 58 clones using Cluster-R package revealed four main clusters, indicating the existence of variation for physicochemical parameters within tested germplasm. This variation can be exploited to select among and/or improve the studied germplasm genetically for quality. High fermentation rate, which is one of the key indicators for good-quality black teas, revealed 15 fast-fermenter tea clones. Clone "UTR12/12" was identified as the most rapid fermenter, fully fermenting within 30 min, which implies a good clone for black tea. The clone also had the highest polyphenol content (26.7%), higher than the highquality clone "UTR6/8" (control). Other tea clones whose polyphenol content was within the range of the control black tea clone were: "UTR144/10" (20.9%) and 'UTR144/17, (20.66%). The identified promising black tea clones can be advanced to multi-location trials for further evaluation and selection for eventual variety release as commercial black-tea clones.

AB  - Simple Summary The current research evaluated the impact of adding dietary fiber to sows during the transitional phase, specifically examining its effects on constipation, the farrowing process, colostrum production, and the mortality of piglets before weaning within a free-farrowing system. Administering 75 g/day of dietary fiber to sows for 7 days before farrowing, especially in those with larger litters, showed a decrease in constipation rates and a reduction in the time taken for farrowing. Additionally, this fiber supplementation resulted in lower mortality rates in piglets prior to weaning. However, this addition of fiber did not improve the production of colostrum and milk, nor did it increase the consumption of colostrum by piglets. These results suggest that in a free-farrowing system, providing sows with dietary fiber during the transitional period can alleviate constipation and shorten the duration of farrowing. Nevertheless, it is advisable to manage the body condition of sows before farrowing to address issues like constipation effectively and to boost colostrum intake. This study investigated how dietary fiber supplementation during the transition period in sows affects constipation, farrowing duration, colostrum production, milk yield, and pre-weaning piglet mortality in the free-farrowing system. A total of 92 Landrace x Yorkshire sows and their 1272 offspring were included in the study. Sows were divided into two groups by parity: control (n = 41) and treatment (n = 51). The control group was fed a standard lactation diet 7 days before farrowing, whereas the treatment group received the same diet with 75 g/day of a dietary fiber supplement. The dietary fiber content analyses were 4.30% and 5.53% in the control and treatment groups, respectively. Sows were fed with 3.89 +/- 0.92 kg per day with a diet containing 17.8% crude protein, 3732 kcal/kg of metabolizable energy, and 1.1% lysine. Parameters including farrowing duration, litter characteristics, and the fecal condition of sows were measured. Piglet mortality rates were recorded at 3, 7, and 21 days of lactation. Sows had an average farrowing duration of 216 +/- 159 min, with litter sizes of 13.8 +/- 4.2 piglets per litter, and a 7.4% stillbirth rate. The treatment group showed a lower constipation rate compared to the control group (17.6% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.003). Farrowing duration did not significantly differ between groups, but the treatment group experienced a 43.6 min shorter duration. In sows with litter sizes of >= 16 piglets per litter, the farrowing duration for sows in the treatment group tended to be shorter than that of the control groups (202.0 +/- 37.9 vs. 287.5 +/- 41.3 min, p = 0.115). The mean colostrum intake of piglets in the control and treatment groups averaged 424.0 +/- 13.7 g and 421.8 +/- 12.6 g, respectively (p = 0.908). Likewise, the milk production of sows from Days 3 to 10 and from Days 10 to 17 of lactation in the treatment group (7.34 +/- 0.27 and 8.76 +/- 0.43 kg/day, respectively) did not differ from that of the control group (7.85 +/- 0.30 and 9.55 +/- 0.47 kg/day, respectively, p > 0.05). Pre-weaning piglet mortality was slightly lower in the treatment group (13.4% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.085). Across groups, piglet mortality rates within 3, 7, and 21 days were 10.3%, 11.9%, and 15.4%, respectively. Piglets with a <= 200 g colostrum intake had a higher pre-weaning mortality compared to those with a higher intake (p < 0.05), except for the 201-300 g intake (p = 0.472).
   In conclusion, introducing dietary fiber to sows during the transition period reduced constipation and tended to decrease farrowing duration, especially in sows with large litters. Additionally, it lowered pre-weaning piglet mortality by 3.9% in the free-farrowing system. Nonetheless, providing sows with a 75 g/day dietary fiber supplement for only 7 days before farrowing was not enough to enhance colostrum and milk production, nor did it lead to an increase in piglet colostrum consumption.

AB  - Suarez-Jimenez and colleagues use a shock and safe zone experiment with fMRI imaging to examine how pathological anxiety disorders are manifested in the brain. Their findings suggest that safe and dangerous zones within the experiment alter activation in different brain regions.
   Anxiety disorders are characterized by maladaptive defensive responses to distal or uncertain threats. Elucidating neural mechanisms of anxiety is essential to understand the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. In fMRI, patients with pathological anxiety (ANX, n = 23) and healthy controls (HC, n = 28) completed a contextual threat learning paradigm in which they picked flowers in a virtual environment comprising a danger zone in which flowers were paired with shock and a safe zone (no shock). ANX compared with HC showed 1) decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior hippocampus activation during the task, particularly in the safe zone, 2) increased insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation during the task, particularly in the danger zone, and 3) increased amygdala and midbrain/periaqueductal gray activation in the danger zone prior to potential shock delivery. Findings suggest that ANX engage brain areas differently to modulate context-appropriate emotional responses when learning to discriminate cues within an environment.

AB  - Cannabis use during pregnancy has recently become an important concern due to its increasing trend and association with neurodevelopmental alterations of exposed children. Although inhalation is the primary route of cannabis consumption in humans, few studies replicated this route in preclinical models of prenatal exposure. This study aimed to analyze the effects of chronic prenatal exposure to vaporized cannabis (PEVC) on hippocampal neurodevelopment, functionality, and learning and memory processes. Using a commercially available high-potency cannabis strain (THC 14.7%), pregnant rats were exposed to cannabis vapor from gestational day 8 to 21. A combination of primary hippocampal cultures, electrophysiological studies in slices, and behavioral tests was employed to assess the impact of PEVC. We found that PEVC induced presynaptic remodeling of hippocampal neurons in offspring under both basal and activity-dependent conditions by increasing synaptic vGlut1 abundance and the total recycling pool of synaptic vesicles. Chronic PEVC also induced a downregulation of CB1R at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Additionally, an increase in axonal recruitment and synaptic efficacy was observed at hippocampal CA1 synapses of juvenile offspring. Moreover, long-lasting cognitive impairments were identified during adolescence, including deficits in spatial memory in male and female offspring. In summary, these findings demonstrate that exposure to high-potency cannabis vapor during pregnancy leads to significant changes in synaptic remodeling and efficacy, axonal recruitment, and long-term cognitive consequences in offspring.image

AB  - Historically cultivars developed jointly by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and USDA-ARS wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement project tend to be late and better adapted to the northern Great Plains. LCS 'Valiant' (Reg. no. CV-1196, PI 693223; tested as NE10478-1) was released based on the merits of its earliness, agronomic performance, relevant disease resistances, and end-use quality characteristics and its adaptation to the central Great Plains. As such, the line was licensed to Limagrain Cereal Seeds for their ability to market outside of Nebraska. LCS Valiant hard red winter wheat was released in March 2020 by the developing institutions and the licensee. NE10478-1 was a selection in 2011 for uniformity and grain yield from NE10478, which was derived from the cross NI03418/'Camelot'. The pedigree of NI03418 is W91-248/NE95544 (=McVey 78015/NE88521)//'Thunderbird'. The final cross of NE10478 was made in 2004. The F-1 generation was grown in Yuma, AZ, in 2005, and the F-2 to F-3 generations were advanced as bulks at Mead, NE, in 2006-2007 or sent for Hessian fly resistance screening by the USDA. In 2007, single F-3-derived F-4 rows were planted for selection. There was no further selection in NE10478 other than to remove off-types thereafter until 2011 when heads were selected to increase uniformity. LCS Valiant was evaluated in replicated trials thereafter. It has excellent winter survival, acceptable reactions to many of the common diseases in its target area, and good end-use quality for bread making.

AB  - Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) is an essential nutrient for optimal infant growth and brain development. The effects of LA in the brain are thought to be mediated by oxygenated metabolites of LA known as oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), but evidence is lacking to directly support this hypothesis. This study investigated whether OXLAMs modulate key neurodevelopmental processes including axon outgrowth, dendritic arborization, cell viability and synaptic connectivity. Primary cortical neuron-glia co-cultures from postnatal day 0-1 male and female rats were exposed for 48h to the following OXLAMs: 1) 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE); 2) 9-hydroxyoctade-cadienoic acid (9-HODE); 3) 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10-DiHOME); 4) 12(13)-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (12(13)-EpOME); 5) 9,10,13-trihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,10,13-TriHOME); 6) 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-OxoODE); and 7) 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (12,13-DiHOME). Axonal outgrowth, evaluated by Tau-1 immunostaining, was increased by 9-HODE, but decreased by 12,13-DiHOME in male but not female neurons. Dendrite arborization, evaluated by MAP2B-eGFP expression, was affected by 9-HODE, 9-OxoODE, and 12(13)-EpOME in male neurons and, by 12(13)-EpOME in female neurons. Neither cell viability nor synaptic connectivity were significantly altered by OXLAMs. Overall, this study shows select OXLAMs modulate neuron morphology in a sex-dependent manner, with male neurons being more susceptible.

AB  - Backgrounds: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a persistent and advanced pulmonary ailment. The roles of innate immunity and adaptive immunity are pivotal in the evolution of IPF. An ill-adjusted interaction between epithelial cells and immune cells is responsible for initiating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and sustaining chronic inflammation, thereby fostering fibrosis progression. The intricacy of IPF pathogenesis has hindered the availability of efficacious agents. Elephantopus scaber Linn. (ESL) is a canonical Chinese medicine with significant immunoregulatory effects, and its aqueous extract has been proven to attenuate IPF symptoms in bleomycin (BLM)-induced mice. However, the underlying mechanism through which ESL relieves IPF remains unclear. Aim: To validate whether ESL reverses IPF by mediating the immune response and EMT. Methods: : Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) and UPLC were used to identify the components and determine the concentrations of the specific compounds in the ESL. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were applied to predict the potential mechanism underlying the anti-IPF effect of ESL. BLM-induced IPF mice were used to validate the anti-IPF effect of ESL, and lung tissue was collected to test putative pathways involved in inflammation and EMT via immunohistochemistry (ICH), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Results: Sixty-one compounds were identified, and thirteen main ingredients were quantified in the ESL. In silico experiments predicted that the IPF-mediated reversal of adverse effects by ESL would be related to interruption of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-k-gene binding (NF-& kgreen;B) inflammatory pathway and the transforming growth factor-beta l (TGF-81)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a) fibrosis pathway. In vivo experiments showed that ESL alleviates BLM-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis by reducing neutrophil aggregation and fibroblast foci, similar to the effects of the positive control drug pirfenidone (PFD). ESL markedly inhibited the transcription of TNF- alpha, IL-1 beta , and IL-6, which are down- stream genes of the NF- kappa B signaling pathway. Furthermore, the protein levels of TLR4 and p-NF- kappa B were correspondingly inhibited in response to ESL treatment. Additionally, ESL reverses BLM-induced changes in the expression of EMT-related biological characteristic indicators (collagen I [COLIA1], E-cadherin, and alpha smooth muscle actin [ alpha-SMA]) at the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level and markedly inhibits the expression of EMT-related upstream proteins (TGF- beta 1, p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-FOXO3a). Conclusion: Our research suggested that ESL attenuates BLM-induced IPF through mediating the EMT process via the TGF- beta 1/PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway and inhibiting inflammation through the TLR4/NF- kappa B signaling pathway, highlighting that ESL can serve as an immunoregulator for relieving the abnormal immune response and reversing the EMT in IPF.

AB  - In plants, the lysine and histidine transporter (LHT) family represent a class of proteins that mediate the uptake, translocation, and utili-zation of amino acids. The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a perennial evergreen with a relatively high level of amino acids. However, systematic identification and molecular characterization of the LHT gene family has rarely been reported in tea plants. In this study, 22 CsLHTs were identified from the 'Shuchazao' genome and classified into two groups. The modeled three-dimensional structure and the conserved domains presented a high similarity among the LHTs proteins. Moreover, it was predicted that a few genes were conserved through the analysis of the physiochemical characters, structures and cis-elements in promoters. The expression patterns in tea plants revealed that CsLHT7 was mainly expressed in the roots, and CsLHT4 and CsLHT11 exhibited relatively high expression in both the roots and leaves. Moreover, the expression of all three genes could be induced by organic nitrogen. Additionally, heterogeneous expression of CsLHT4, CsLHT7 and CsLHT11 in Arabidopsis thaliana decreased the aerial parts biomass compared with that in WT plants while significantly increased the rosette biomass only for CsLHT11 transgenic plants versus WT plants. Overall, our results provide fundamental information about CsLHTs and potential genes in N utilization for further analysis in tea plants.

AB  - The genus Amorphophallus Blume ex Decne. is a vast and widespread group of aroids belonging to Araceae which is taxonomically and botanically distinct due to the occasional emergence of inflorescences and their relatively short active period of existence. Seven morphotypes of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius which included two cultivated forms-the cultivated elephant foot yam (A. paeoniifolius var. campanulatus) and another cultivar 'Karunaikizhangu', unique due to the presence of small corm and numerous elongate cormels, grown only in Tamil Nadu, in the southmost part of India, also known as A. paeoniifolius var. campanulatus, and five wild types belonging to Amorphophallus paeoniifolius var. paeoniifolius were studied. Elephant foot yam is an important tuber crop and the wild congenerics of the cultivated form possess powerful therapeutic action against piles and gastro-intestinal disorders. Variation in the surface pattern of petiole and spathe is the main difference found within the species. The shape of appendix, the colour and pattern of spathe, scale leaves (bract) subtending the spathe, the male zone, female zone, the pollen morphology as assessed by SEM and pollen fertility showed distinct variation within the species revealing six distinct morphotypes. The inflorescence/floral markers and vegetative morphological descriptors, pollen morphology, karyomorphological analysis which indicated structural variation in chromosomes resulting in varying number of median, sub-median and nearly sub-median chromosomes in the morphotypes and ISSR markers indicated clear distinction between the morphotypes, which lead to the conclusion that the above two cultivated types and accession P19 of A. paeoniifolius var. paeoniifolius, which had heteromorphic pollen can be considered as different botanical varieties.

AB  - Ciborinia camelliae (Sclerotiniaceae) is a host- and organ-specific fungal pathogen that causes rapid browning and flower drop on ornamental plants of the genus Camellia. To determine the nature of its necrotrophic factors, we tested whether proteins secreted by C. camelliae can damage host-plant tissues. Fungal culture filtrate caused necrogenic activity, abolished by heat or protease treatments, thus indicating that the secreted necrogenic agents are probably proteinaceous in nature. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to detect and identify secreted proteins of C. camelliae. Proteins secreted in culture media (in vitro) and in petal apoplast (in planta) had similar functional distributions, and key identified proteins included homologs to known virulence factors of the closely related Sclerotiniaceae fungus Botrytis cinerea, including endopolygalacturonases, cerato-platanin family proteins, and necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptides. The main class of secreted proteins were carbohydrate-active enzymes, a characteristic signature of necrotrophic plant pathogens. Both fungal culture filtrate and apoplastic washes of infected petals induced necrosis when infiltrated into host and nonhost plants. This suggests that while some of the secreted proteins might contribute to virulence of C. camelliae, and can cause necrosis similar to secreted proteins of broad-host Sclerotiniaceae pathogens, they do not have a role in determining its host specificity.

AB  - Purpose Surra is an economically important livestock disease in many low- and middle-income countries, including those of Northern Africa. The disease is caused by the biting fly-transmitted subspecies Trypanosoma brucei evansi, which is very closely related to the tsetse-transmitted subspecies T. b. brucei and the sexually transmitted subspecies T. b. equiperdum. At least two phylogenetically distinct groups of T. b. evansi can be distinguished, called type A and type B. These evolved from T. b. brucei independently. The close relationships between the T. brucei subspecies and the multiple evolutionary origins of T. b. evansi pose diagnostic challenges. Methods Here we use previously established and newly developed PCR assays based on nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers to type the causative agent of recent trypanosome infections of camels in Southern Algeria. Results/conclusion We confirm that these infections have been caused by T. b. evansi type A. We also report a newly designed PCR assay specific for T. b. evansi type A that we expect will be of diagnostic use for the community.

AB  - Circadian rhythms, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are closely related and interacted with each other. We have previously showed circadian disruption aggravated progression of AD in T2DM mice. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is shown to be a potential synchronizer. This study aims to determine whether TRF has a protective effect against the circadian disruption-aggravated progression of AD in T2DM. 6-week-old male diabetic (db/db) mice and wildtype (wt/wt) mice were kept under normal 12:12 light/dark cycles or altered 6:18 light/dark cycles (dark extended to 18 h) with or without TRF (food restricted to 8 h during the active (dark) period). After 8 weeks, three behavioral tests (open field test, novel object recognition test, barnes maze test) were performed and the circadian gene expression, body weight, lipid levels and AD-associated tau phosphorylation were evaluated. We found altered light/dark cycles contributed to disruptive circadian rhythms in the hippocampus of db/db mice, while TRF prevented this effect. TRF also ameliorated circadian disruption-aggravated increased body weight and lipid accumulation in db/db mice. Importantly, the db/db mice under circadian disruption showed impaired cognition accompanied by increased tau phosphorylation, whereas TRF reversed these changes. The altered light/dark cycles only affected circadian rhythms but not other indicators like plasma/liver lipids, cognition and tau phosphorylation in the wt/wt mice. Collectively, TRF has a protective effect against altered light/dark cycles-aggravated AD progression in diabetic mice. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to improve the initial viscosity and stability of Camellia oleifera cake-protein adhesive, Camellia oleifera cake-protein was blended with defatted soybean protein (DSP), soybean protein isolate (SPI), and casein, followed by adhesive preparation through degradation and crosslinking methods. The performance of Camellia oleifera cake-protein adhesive was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopic (SEM), and thermogravimetric (TG) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that DSP, SPI, and casein likely promoted the effective degradation of Camellia oleifera cake-protein, and, thus, more active groups were formed in the system, accompanied by more reactivity sites. The prepared adhesive had a lower curing temperature, and higher initial viscosity and stability, but the storage time was shortened. Moreover, DSP, SPI, and casein, themselves, were degraded into peptide chains with lower molecular weights; thus, improving the overall flexibility of the adhesive, facilitating a better elastic contact and regular array between crosslinking products, and further strengthening the crosslinked structure and density of the products. After curing, a compact and coherent reticular structure was formed in the adhesive layer, with both bonding strength and water resistance being significantly improved. According to the results obtained, the next step will be to study the DSP-modified Camellia oleifera cake-protein adhesive in depth.

AB  - (1) The present study tested in vitro the capacity of a fermented rapeseed meal extract to reduce medicinal ZnO, which will be banned at the EU level from 2023 onwards because of its potential to cause environmental pollution and the development of Zn resistance in gut bacteria. Rapeseed meal could be an important ZnO substitute as it has antioxidant/radical scavenging properties due to its content of bioactive compounds (e.g., polyphenols). (2) Protein array and flow cytometry were used to detect apoptosis, oxidative stress production, and inflammatory and signaling-related molecules in Caco-2 and goblet HT29-MTX co-culture cells challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides and treated with ZnO and FRSM. (3) LPS induced cell death (21.1% vs. 12.7% in control, p < 0.005); apoptosis (16.6%); ROS production; and overexpression of biomarkers related to inflammation (63.15% cytokines and 66.67% chemokines), oxidative stress, and signaling proteins when compared to untreated cells. ZnO was effective in counteracting the effect of LPS, and 73.68% cytokines and 91.67% of chemokines were recovered. FRSM was better at restoring normal protein expression for 78.94% of cytokines, 91.67% of chemokines, and 61.11% of signaling molecules. FRSM was able to mitigate negative effects of LPS and might be an alternative to ZnO in pig diets.

AB  - The northern white rhinoceros is functionally extinct with only two females left. Establishing methods to culture ovarian tissues, follicles, and oocytes to generate eggs will support conservation efforts using in vitro embryo production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the structure and molecular signature of any rhinoceros, more specifically, we describe the neonatal and adult southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) ovary; the closest relation of the northern white rhinoceros. Interestingly, all ovaries contain follicles despite advanced age. Analysis of the neonate reveals a population of cells molecularly characterised as mitotically active, pluripotent with germ cell properties. These results indicate that unusually, the neonatal ovary still contains oogonia in germ cell nests at birth, providing an opportunity for fertility preservation. Therefore, utilising ovaries from stillborn and adult rhinoceros can provide cells for advanced assisted reproductive technologies and investigating the neonatal ovaries of other endangered species is crucial for conservation.
   A comprehensive histological assessment of southern white rhinoceros ovaries from both mature females and a neonate provides insight into follicular development in this species.

AB  - Simple Summary There has been an increase in domestic rabbit ownership in the recent years. The type of dentition of this exotic (non-traditional) animal pet, predisposes it to the development of Acquired Dental Disease (ADD), a disease that affects tooth quality, generates malocclusion, among other dental and non-dental consequences. The aim of this study was to assess the factors that modify the risk for ADD in domestic pet rabbits. For this, 1420 owned rabbits' clinical records from a private practice from 2018 to 2021 were used, recording several variables, including the clinical signs at diagnosis. ADD was detected in 25.4% of the individuals, mostly on their cheek teeth. In addition, age and sex (male) were found to be significant risk factors for ADD. In contrast, a free lifestyle and consuming hay in the diet were protective factors. Understanding the factors that modify the risk of ADD increases the chances of prevention and helps to improve the education of owners and/or guardians of domestic rabbits. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have elodont dentition, a characteristic that predisposes them to the development of Acquired Dental Disease (ADD), which is a multifactorial disease. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for ADD in domestic pet rabbits. To do this, a retrospective analysis of 1420 rabbits treated at a private practice during 2018-2021 was performed. For this, several variables were retrieved from clinical records, in addition to signology at the time of diagnosis. ADD was found on 25.4% of rabbits, mostly on their cheek teeth. In addition, age (OR = 1.029; 95% CI = 1.023-1.035; p < 0.001) and sex (male) (OR = 1.591; 95% CI = 1.226-2.064; p < 0.001) were found to be significant risk factors for ADD. In contrast, a free lifestyle (OR = 0.565; 95% CI = 0.362-0.882; p = 0.012) and consuming hay in the diet (OR = 0.323; 95% CI = 0.220-0.473; p < 0.001) were protective factors. In conclusion, ADD has a high prevalence and is usually underdiagnosed, highlighting the need for an exhaustive evaluation of patients during the clinical examination. This study improves our knowledge of ADD and its prevention.

AB  - Autoimmune encephalitis associated with antibodies (Abs) against alpha 1, beta 3, and gamma 2 subunits of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABA(A)R) represents a severe form of encephalitis with refractory seizures and status epilepticus. Reduction in inhibitory GABAergic synaptic activity is linked to dysfunction of neuronal networks, hyperexcitability, and seizures. The aim in this study was to investigate the direct pathogenic effect of a recombinant GABA(A)R autoantibody (rAb-IP2), derived from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient with autoimmune GABA(A)R encephalitis, on hippocampal CA1 and CA3 networks. Acute brain slices from C57BL/6 mice were incubated with rAb-IP2. The spontaneous synaptic GABAergic transmission was measured using electrophysiological recordings in voltage-clamp mode. The GABA(A)R autoantibody rAb-IP2 reduced inhibitory postsynaptic signaling in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with regard to the number of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) but did not affect their amplitude. In the hippocampal CA3 network, decreased number and amplitude of sIPSCs were detected, leading to decreased GABAergic synaptic transmission. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the rAb-IP2 bound to hippocampal tissue. These findings suggest that GABA(A)R autoantibodies exert direct functional effects on both hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and play a crucial role in seizure generation in GABA(A)R autoimmune encephalitis.

AB  - The effects of second-generation antipsychotics on prenatal neurodevelopment, apoptotic neurodegeneration, and postnatal developmental delays have been poorly investigated. Even at standard doses, the use of quetiapine fumarate (QEPF) in pregnant women might be detrimental to fetal development. We used primary mouse embryonic neurons to evaluate the disruption of morphogenesis and differentiation of ventral midbrain (VM) neurons after exposure to QEPF. The dopaminergic VM neurons were deliberately targeted due to their roles in cognition, motor activity, and behavior. The results revealed that exposure to QEPF during early brain development decreased the effects of the dopaminergic lineage-related genes Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), Dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1), Dopamine transporter (Dat), LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alfa (Lmx1a), and Cell adhesion molecule L1 (Chl1), and the senescent dopaminergic gene Pituitary homeobox 3 (Pitx3). In contrast, Brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and Nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1) expressions were significantly upregulated. Interestingly, QEPF had variable effects on the development of non-dopaminergic neurons in VM. An optimal dose of QEPF (10 mu M) was found to insignificantly affect the viability of neurons isolated from the VM. It also instigated a non-significant reduction in adenosine triphosphate formation in these neuronal populations. Exposure to QEPF during the early stages of brain development could also hinder the formation of VM and their structural phenotypes. These findings could aid therapeutic decision-making when prescribing 2nd generation antipsychotics in pregnant populations.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by several alterations, including disorganized brain cytoarchitecture and excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. We aimed to analyze aspects associated with the inhibitory components in ASD, using bioinformatics to develop notions about embryonic life and tissue analysis for postnatal life. We analyzed microarray and RNAseq datasets of embryos from different ASD models, demonstrating that regions involved in neuronal development are affected. We evaluated the effect of prenatal treatment with resveratrol (RSV) on the neuronal organization and quantity of parvalbumin-positive (PV+), somatostatin-positive (SOM+), and calbindin-positive (CB+) GABAergic interneurons, besides the levels of synaptic proteins and GABA receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) of the ASD model induced by valproic acid (VPA). VPA increased the total number of neurons in the mPFC, while it reduced the number of SOM+ neurons, as well as the proportion of SOM+, PV+, and CB+ neurons (subregion-specific manner), with preventive effects of RSV. In summary, metabolic alterations or gene expression impairments could be induced by VPA, leading to extensive damage in the late developmental stages. By contrast, due to its antioxidant, neuroprotective, and opposite action on histone properties, RSV may avoid damages induced by VPA.

AB  - The development of new technologies and industry increases the number and variety of electromagnetic field (EMF) sources. Researcher are increasingly interested in the effects of EMF on brain health. The brain's function is largely dependent on electrical excitability, so it would be expected to be vulnerable to EMF. We therefore investigated the effects of brain development in the fetus, histopathological changes in female rats and the hippocampal level of MAPK proteins in male rats after exposed to pre and postnatal 2450 MHz continuous wave (CW) radiofrequency radiation (RFR) over four generations. Four groups; sham, irradiated female, irradiated male, irradiated male and female, with each consisting of four rats (one male and three females) were created. Rats in the exposure groups were whole-body exposed to 2450 MHz CW-RFR for 12 h/day during the experiment. Irradiation started one month before fertilization in the experimental group. On the 18th day of the gestational period, one pregnant rat from each group was decapitated under general anesthesia and the fetuses were taken. The remaining two pregnant rats completed the normal gestation period. When the offspring were two months old, four rats, one male and three female, were allocated for the second generation study. Next generation an-imals were also experienced the same processes as the first generation rats. This study were evaluated devel-opment of brain in fetuses and histopathological changes in brain of female rats using haematoxylin eosin staining, and the hippocampal level of MAPK proteins in brain of male rats by Western Bloting. We observed hemorrhagic areas, irregular cellular localization and vascular structures in the brain of fetal and adult female rat of exposed groups in the all generations. pERK, ptau, pJNK and pP38 were increased in the brain of adult male rat of exposed groups in the all generations (p < 0.005). Pre and postnatal 2450 MHz continuous wave radio -frequency radiation exposure may cause changes in the function of the MAPK pathway affecting cognitive processes such as learning and memory and may cause damage to both the fetus and adult brain tissue. Also, EMF may have potential to affect brain of future generations.

AB  - Small and large farm animals are frequently identified using techniques like microchipping or tagging. However, these techniques may have a detrimental impact on animal welfare and may result in theft and fraud. Modern and sophisticated identification procedures using biometrics, including retina, face, and iris recognition, are available and have less of a detrimental effect on animal welfare. Because biometric markers are unchangeable and unaffected, it is feasible to stop situations of theft and fraud. This study uses retina images to identify animals based on each animal ' s different and specific retinal patterns. To the best of our knowledge, there isn ' t a publicly accessible dataset for images of animal retinas. The three main goals of this study are to: 1) produce a novel dataset of Cattle retinal images and make it publicly available; 2) create a successful image processing -based system for retinal identification and recognition; and 3) create a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables querying the database to ascertain whether a specific Cattle retina is present. To accomplish these goals, a dataset comprising 2430 images from the left and right eyes of 300 cattle was produced. After the dataset was created, the animal retinal images were segmented using image processing methods such as scaling, color transformations, image sharpening, contrast enhancements, noise filtering, and histogram equalization. By using the segmented images with the SURF, FAST, BRISK, and HARRIS techniques, distinctive retinal features were found. During the identification phase, the animal whose retinal characteristic matched the sought animal ' s retina the closest was recognized. Within the developed CattNIS system, the SURF approach has the highest accuracy rate of 92.25 percent. The results of this study show that the identification of cattle using retinal vascular patterns is highly successful. The availability of the collected cattle retinal images from this study is expected to significantly contribute to the advancement of future research in this field, both in terms of quantity and quality.

AB  - Bats are the second-most speciose group of mammals, comprising 20% of species diversity today. Their global explosion, representing one of the greatest adaptive radiations in mammalian history, is largely attributed to their ability of laryngeal echolocation and powered flight, which enabled them to conquer the night sky, a vast and hitherto unoccupied ecological niche. While there is consensus that powered flight evolved only once in the lineage, whether laryngeal echolocation has a single origin in bats or evolved multiple times independently remains disputed. Here, we present developmental evidence in support of laryngeal echolocation having multiple origins in bats. This is consistent with a non-echolocating bat ancestor and independent gain of echolocation in Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, as well as the gain of primitive echolocation in the bat ancestor, followed by convergent evolution of laryngeal echolocation in Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with loss of primitive echolocation in pteropodids. Our comparative embryological investigations found that there is no developmental difference in the hearing apparatus between non-laryngeal echolocating bats (pteropodids) and terrestrial non-bat mammals. In contrast, the echolocation system is developed heterotopically and heterochronically in the two phylogenetically distant laryngeal echolocating bats (rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans), providing the first embryological evidence that the echolocation system evolved independently in these bats.

AB  - Using baseline (ages 9-10) and two-year follow-up (ages 11-12) data from monozygotic and dizygotic twins enrolled in the longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development(SM) Study, we investigated the genetic and environmental contributions to microstructure and volume of nine subcortical gray matter regions. Microstructure was assessed using diffusion MRI data analyzed using restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) models. The highest heritability estimates (estimate [95% confidence interval]) for microstructure were found using the RSI model in the pallidum (baseline: 0.859 [0.818, 0.889], follow-up: 0.835 [0.787, 0.871]), putamen (baseline: 0.859 [0.819, 0.889], follow-up: 0.874 [0.838, 0.902]), and thalamus (baseline: 0.855 [0.814, 0.887], follow-up: 0.819 [0.769, 0.857]). For volumes the corresponding regions were the caudate (baseline: 0.831 [0.688, 0.992], follow-up: 0.848 [0.701, 1.011]) and putamen (baseline: 0.906 [0.875, 0.914], follow-up: 0.906 [0.885, 0.923]). The subcortical regions displayed high genetic stability (rA = 0.743-1.000) across time and exhibited unique environmental correlations (rE = 0.194-0.610). Individual differences in both gray matter microstructure and volumes can be largely explained by additive genetic effects in this sample.

AB  - Menopause is a risk factor for depression. Although 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,3-diCQA), a phenolic compound in Arctium lappa (A. lappa) root, has various health benefits, its effects on menopausal depression remain to be determined. Therefore, this study investigates the antidepressant-like effects of 1,3-diCQA from an A. lappa root extract (AE) and the associated molecular mechanisms. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice were orally administered AE for 20 weeks, following which depression-like behaviors were assessed. Although the mice exhibited depression-like behaviors, AE administration mitigated these symptoms by activating the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway and increasing nNOS levels in the hippocampus. Similarly, a significant increase in nNOS-derived NO production and activation of the ERK-CREB-BDNF pathway was observed in the primary hippocampal neurons. Although this stimulatory effect of 1,3-diCQA was not significantly affected by treatment with estrogen receptor agonist or antagonist, it was inhibited by 7-NI, an nNOS inhibitor. Moreover, mice treated with 1,3-diCQA exhibited a marked improvement in their forced swimming test and tail suspension test immobility, while pretreatment with 7-NI reversed the antidepressant-like effects of 1,3-diCQA. Our results suggest that 1,3-diCQA regulates nNOS in an estrogen recepters-independent manner to increase NO production in OVX mice.

AB  - GSTs (Glutathione S-transferases) are known to catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl group of reduced glutathione (GSH) on electrophilic centers of xenobiotic compounds, including insecticides and acaricides. Genome analyses of the polyphagous spider mite herbivore Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mite) revealed the presence of a set of 32 genes that code for secreted proteins belonging to the GST family of enzymes. To better understand the role of these proteins in T. urticae, we have functionally characterized TuGSTd01. Moreover, we have modeled the structure of the enzyme in apo form, as well as in the form with bound inhibitor. We demonstrated that this protein is a glutathione S-transferase that can conjugate glutathione to 1-chloro-2,4dinitrobenzene (CDNB). We have tested TuGSTd01 activity with a range of potential substrates such as cinnamic acid, cumene hydroperoxide, and allyl isothiocyanate; however, the enzyme was unable to process these compounds. Using mutagenesis, we showed that putative active site variants S11A, E66A, S67A, and R68A mutants, which were residues predicted to interact directly with GSH, have no measurable activity, and these residues are required for the enzymatic activity of TuGSTd01. There are several reports that associate some T. urticae acaricide resistance with increased activity of GSTs . However, we found that TuGSTd01 is not able to detoxify abamectin; in fact, the acaricide inhibits the enzyme with Ki = 101 mu M. Therefore, we suggest that the increased GST activity observed in abamectin resistant T. urticae field populations is a part of the compensatory feedback loop. In this case, the increased production of GSTs and relatively high concentration of GSH in cells allow GSTs to maintain physiological functions despite the presence of the acaricide.

AB  - Antenatal brain development during the final trimester of human pregnancy is a time when mature neurons become increasingly complex in morphology, through axonal and dendritic outgrowth, dendritic branching, and synaptogenesis, together with myelin production. Characterizing neuronal morphological development over time is of interest to developmental neuroscience and provides the framework to measure gray matter pathology in pregnancy compromise. Neuronal microstructure can be assessed with Golgi staining, which selectively stains a small percentage (1-3%) of neurons and their entire dendritic arbor. Advanced imaging processing and analysis tools can then be employed to quantitate neuronal cytoarchitecture. Traditional Golgi-staining protocols have been optimized, and commercial kits are readily available offering improved speed and sensitivity of Golgi staining to produce consistent results. Golgi-stained tissue is then visualized under light microscopy and image analysis may be completed with several software programs for morphological analysis of neurons, including freeware and commercial products. Each program requires optimization, whether semiautomated or automated, requiring different levels of investigator intervention and interpretation, which is a critical consideration for unbiased analysis. Detailed protocols for fetal ovine brain tissue are lacking, and therefore, we provide a step-by-step workflow of computer software analysis for morphometric quantification of Golgi-stained neurons. Here, we utilized the commonly applied FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) on ovine fetal brains collected at 127 days (0.85) of gestational age for the analysis of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. We describe the step-by-step protocol to retrieve neuronal morphometrics using Imaris imaging software to provide quantification of apical and basal dendrites for measures of dendrite length (mu m), branch number, branch order, and Sholl analysis (intersections over radius). We also detail software add-ons for data retrieval of dendritic spines including the number of spines, spine density, and spine classification, which are critical indicators of synaptic function. The assessment of neuronal morphology in the developing brain using Rapid-Golgi and Imaris software is labor-intensive, particularly during the optimization period. The methodology described in this step-by-step description is novel, detailed, and aims to provide a reproducible, working protocol to quantify neuronal cytoarchitecture with simple descriptions that will save time for the next users of these commonly used techniques.

AB  - Mass spectrometry has revolutionized cell signaling research by vastly simplifying the analysis of many thousands of phosphorylation sites in the human proteome. Defining the cellular response to perturbations is crucial for further illuminating the functionality of the phosphoproteome. Here we describe mu Phos ('microPhos'), an accessible phosphoproteomics platform that permits phosphopeptide enrichment from 96-well cell culture and small tissue amounts in <8 h total processing time. By greatly minimizing transfer steps and liquid volumes, we demonstrate increased sensitivity, >90% selectivity, and excellent quantitative reproducibility. Employing highly sensitive trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry, we quantify similar to 17,000 Class I phosphosites in a human cancer cell line using 20 mu g starting material, and confidently localize similar to 6200 phosphosites from 1 mu g. This depth covers key signaling pathways, rendering sample-limited applications and perturbation experiments with hundreds of samples viable. We employ mu Phos to study drug- and time-dependent response signatures in a leukemia cell line, and by quantifying 30,000 Class I phosphosites in the mouse brain we reveal distinct spatial kinase activities in subregions of the hippocampal formation.

AB  - High-risk preterm infants are affected by a higher incidence of cognitive developmental deficits due to the unavoidable risk factor of oxygen toxicity. Caffeine is known to have a protective effect in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia associated with improved neurologic outcomes, although very early initiation of therapy is controversial. In this study, we used newborn rats in an oxygen injury model to test the hypothesis that near-birth caffeine administration modulates neuronal maturation and differentiation in the hippocampus of the developing brain. For this purpose, newborn Wistar rats were exposed to 21% or 80% oxygen on the day of birth for 3 or 5 days and treated with vehicle or caffeine (10 mg/kg/48 h). Postnatal exposure to 80% oxygen resulted in a drastic reduction of associated neuronal mediators for radial glia, mitotic/postmitotic neurons, and impaired cell-cycle regulation, predominantly persistent even after recovery to room air until postnatal day 15. Systemic caffeine administration significantly counteracted the effects of oxygen insult on neuronal maturation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, under normoxia, caffeine inhibited the transcription of neuronal mediators of maturing and mature neurons. The early administration of caffeine modulated hyperoxia-induced decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and showed neuroprotective properties in the neonatal rat oxygen toxicity model.

AB  - In this time series study, the temporal sequences of postmortem changes in brains kept at different temperatures were investigated in different areas of mouse brains. Fixation of tissues kept at different storage temperatures (4 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 37 degrees C) was delayed for four time points (24, 120, 168, 336 h). Histological and immunohistochemical investigations were carried out to determine how postmortem autolysis may affect the cellular morphology and the expression of neural cell epitopes. Results showed that the autolytic changes started earlier in brains at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C and in the grey matter compared to the white matter, with the cerebellum and hippocampus showing the earliest postmortem changes. The cellular antigens were differently affected by the autolytic process overtime: NeuN and Olig2 immunoreactivity was gradually lost at the nuclear site and diffused into the cytoplasm; increased background staining was observed with SMI-32; GFAP showed an increase in immunolabeling, whereas 2F11 immunoreactivity decreased. This study suggests that the morphological analysis and immunohistochemical investigation of the brain tissue could be satisfactorily applied to forensic cases, providing useful data for the estimation of the postmortem interval.

AB  - Candida albicans is a human pathogen that is part of the healthy microbiome. However, it is often associated with opportunistic fungal infections. The treatment of these infections is challenging because prolonged exposure to antifungal drugs can culminate in fungal resistance during therapy, and there is a limited number of available drugs. Therefore, this study investigated the antifungal activity of ononin by in silico and in vitro assays, and in Tenebrio molitor as an alternative in vivo model of infection caused by C. albicans. Ononin is an isoflavone glycoside derived from formononetin that has various biological activities. According in silico evaluation, ononin showed the best electron affinity in molecular docking with CaCYP51, with a binding free energy of -10.89 kcal/mol, superior to that of the antifungal drugs fluconazole and posaconazole. The ononin + CaCYP51 complex formed hydrogen bonds with Tyr132, Ser378, Phe380, and Met508, as well as hydrophobic connections with Tyr118, Leu121, Phe126, Leu131, Ile304, and Leu309, and interactions with the heme group. Ononin exerted anti Candida albicans activity, with MIC between 3.9 and 7.8 mu g /mL, and inhibited young and mature biofilms, with a reduction in cell density and metabolic activity of 50 to 80%. The compound was not cytotoxic to sheep red blood cells at concentrations up to 1000 mu g/mL. Larvae of the mealworm T. molitor were used as an alternative in vivo model of C. albicans infection. Ononin was able to prolong larval survival at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg, and was not toxic up to a concentration of 20 mg/kg. Moreover, ononin reduced the fungal charge in treated animals. In conclusion, our results suggest that ononin has anti Candida albicans activity and is a potential candidate for the development of new therapeutic alternatives.

AB  - Severe psychiatric illnesses, for instance schizophrenia, and affective diseases or autism spectrum disorders, have been associated with cognitive impairment and perturbed excitatory-inhibitory balance in the brain. Effects in juvenile mice can elucidate how erythropoietin (EPO) might aid in rectifying hippocampal transcriptional networks and synaptic structures of pyramidal lineages, conceivably explaining mitigation of neuropsychiatric diseases. An imminent conundrum is how EPO restores synapses by involving interneurons. By analyzing similar to 12,000 single-nuclei transcriptomic data, we generated a comprehensive molecular atlas of hippocampal interneurons, resolved into 15 interneuron subtypes. Next, we studied molecular alterations upon recombinant human (rh)EPO and saw that gene expression changes relate to synaptic structure, trans-synaptic signaling and intracellular catabolic pathways. Putative ligand-receptor interactions between pyramidal and inhibitory neurons, regulating synaptogenesis, are altered upon rhEPO. An array of in/ex vivo experiments confirms that specific interneuronal populations exhibit reduced dendritic complexity, synaptic connectivity, and changes in plasticity-related molecules. Metabolism and inhibitory potential of interneuron subgroups are compromised, leading to greater excitability of pyramidal neurons. To conclude, improvement by rhEPO of neuropsychiatric phenotypes may partly owe to restrictive control over interneurons, facilitating re-connectivity and synapse development.

AB  - 19-nortestosterone (19-NT) is recognized as a highly effective anabolic steroid that is banned in animal products because of its negative impact on human health. Despite legal prohibitions, 19-NT is still abused, driven by its commercial benefits. In this study, a gold nanoparticle immunochromatographic assay (GICA) utilizing nanobodies (Nb) has been developed for the efficient, rapid, and sensitive detection of 19-NT. Specifically, anti-19-NT-Nb2F7 coupled gold nanoparticles and optimized a variety of detection conditions for GICA, including pH, concentration of Nb2F7, and amount of probe. Under optimal conditions, the Nb2F7-based GICA could rapidly and sensitively detect 19-NT within 10 min, with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.08 ng/mL. Moreover, this method exhibited good recovery and stability for detecting 19-NT in pig urine and bovine urine, which was correlated well with standard UPLC-MS/MS. Overall, this Nb2F7-based GICA is well-suited for on-site screening of 19-NT in animal urine products, providing a rapid, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative to traditional assay.

AB  - Although muscle development has been widely studied in Drosophila melanogaster, it was a great challenge to apply to developmental processes of other insect muscles. This study was focused on the functional characterization of a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene twist in an herbivorous ladybird Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata. Its transcript (Hvtwist) levels were detected in all developmental stages. RNA interference (RNAi)-aided knockdown of Hvtwist at the penultimate larval instar stage impaired pupation, and caused a deformed adult in the legs. The tarsi were malformed and did not support the bodies in an upright position. The climbing ability was impaired. Moreover, around 50% of the impaired adults had a malformed elytrum. In addition, they consumed less foliage and did not lay eggs. A hematoxylin-eosin staining of the leg demonstrated that the tibial extensor (TE) and the tibial flexor (TF) muscles were originated from the femurs while levator and depressor muscles of the tarsus (TL and TD) were located in the tibia in the control adults, in which tarsal segments were devoid of muscles. RNAi treatment specific to Hvtwist expression markedly impaired TE and TF muscles in the femurs, and prevented the development of TL and TD muscles in the tibia. Therefore, our findings demonstrate Twist plays a vital role in the myogenesis in H. vigintioctopunctata adult legs.

AB  - Simple Summary Memory is a fundamental cognitive function we need for everyday life. Since we process so much information each day, it is believed that our memory system selects only relevant information to encode in order to avoid overload. In this work, we study the molecular mechanism supporting this selective memory encoding. It is believed that memory encoding occurs mainly when we encounter a new unexpected condition: a novel context. In a novel context, the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory function, intensifies a specific rhythmic activity called beta oscillations. While these beta oscillations are believed to support memory encoding, the molecular mechanisms underlying this increase in beta oscillations are not yet understood. We demonstrate that a specific type of membrane ionic channel called transient receptor potential canonical 4 (TRPC4) supports the modulation of beta oscillation in the hippocampus, indicating that TRPC4 channels play a role in novelty-related memory encoding. Hippocampal local field potentials (LFP) are highly related to behavior and memory functions. It has been shown that beta band LFP oscillations are correlated with contextual novelty and mnemonic performance. Evidence suggests that changes in neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine and dopamine, during exploration in a novel environment underlie changes in LFP. However, potential downstream mechanisms through which neuromodulators may alter the beta band oscillation in vivo remain to be fully understood. In this paper, we study the role of the membrane cationic channel TRPC4, which is modulated by various neuromodulators through G-protein-coupled receptors, by combining shRNA-mediated TRPC4 knockdown (KD) with LFP measurements in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in behaving mice. We demonstrate that the increased beta oscillation power seen in the control group mice in a novel environment is absent in the TRPC4 KD group. A similar loss of modulation was also seen in the low-gamma band oscillations in the TRPC4 KD group. These results demonstrate that TRPC4 channels are involved in the novelty-induced modulation of beta and low-gamma oscillations in the CA1 region.

AB  - Chronic brain hypoperfusion is the primary cause of vascular dementia and has been implicated in the development of white matter disease and lacunar infarcts. Cerebral hypoperfusion leads to a chronic state of brain inflammation with immune cell activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta. In the present study, we induced chronic, progressive brain hypoperfusion in mice using ameroid constrictor, arterial stenosis (ACAS) surgery and tested the efficacy of an IL-1 beta antibody on the resulting brain damage. We observed that ACAS surgery causes a reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF) of about 30% and grey and white matter damage in and around the hippocampus. The IL-1 beta antibody treatment did not significantly affect CBF but largely eliminated grey matter damage and reduced white matter damage caused by ACAS surgery. Over the course of hypoperfusion/injury, grip strength, coordination, and memory-related behavior were not significantly affected by ACAS surgery or antibody treatment. We conclude that antibody neutralization of IL-1 beta is protective from the brain damage caused by chronic, progressive brain hypoperfusion.

AB  - Objective As a new type of transcranial magnetic stimulation, the intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has been widely used to explore brain cognitive function and neuroregulation, but its electrophysiological regulation mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, exploring the underlying electrophysiological mechanism and the effect of iTBS on the brain's cognitive functions is of great significance for the treatment of brain diseases and clinical application of magnetic stimulation. Methods In this study, the model rats were treated with iTBS, and the local field potential (LFPs) signals in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal lobe (mPFC) were collected and recorded during the working memory (WM) tasks in rats. The effect of iTBS on neural network coordination and information interaction across brain regions was investigated by using Granger causality network. Results The results suggested that iTBS enhanced the WM ability and the behavioral performance of the rats, reducing the time to complete the WM task by (2.67 +/- 1.63) d (P<0.05). At the same time, iTBS enhanced the self-causal network connections in vHPC and mPFC during WM, and increased the network connection strength, connection density and global efficiency (P<0.05). In addition, iTBS enhanced the cross-brain network connection between vHPC and mPFC, and increased the node degrees and causal flow (P<0.05) from vHPC to mPFC. Conclusion iTBS has a significant positive effect on the behavior of WM and neural network in related brain areas of rats. iTBS can promote the cognitive ability of rats and improve the efficiency of information interaction and transmission of neural network. The neural regulation mechanism of iTBS may be to enhance the WM ability by enhancing the network connection and information interaction between vHPC and mPFC.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells and can be isolated from many tissues of the body. Due to their potentials to treat various diseases and be applied in animal breeding, MSCs have been iso-lated and identified regarding their biological properties. Common hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are a vulnerable species and yet the cryopreservation of their genetic materials is scare. In this study, we successfully established two MSC cultures (UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs) from the umbilical cord and adipose tissue of a neonatal common hippo and comparatively described their features. Both UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs showed fibroblastoid morphology and could be continuously passaged for over 17 passages without dramatic signs of senescence. The cell cultures had normal chromosome composition, say, 17 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of X chromosomes. UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs displayed similar gene expression profiles. They were positive for CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90 and CD105 and negative for HLA-DR. They demonstrated stemness maintenance by expression of classical stem cell markers. UC-MSCs and AT-MSCs manifested different differentiation potentials into other cell lineages. In summary, these two cell cultures demonstrated the essential properties of mesenchymal stem cells and might play a role in the future research.

AB  - Theta rhythms (4-12 Hz) in the hippocampus are thought to be associated with cognitive functions such as memory processing and spatial navigation. Rhythmic oscillations in the neural system can be induced by synchronization of neural populations, while physiological mechanisms for the emergence, modulation, and regulation of such rhythms are not fully understood. Conceptual reduced models are promising in promoting current understandings toward neural synchronization because of high computational efficiency, while they appear less straightforward in biological relevance. In this study, we use a hybrid E-I network as a conceptual model of the hippocampus to investigate the dynamics of synchronous theta oscillations. Specifically, experimentally constrained Izhikevich neurons and preferential connections among neural groups specific to hippocampal CA1 are incorporated to enhance the biological relevance of the model network. Based on such a model, synaptic factors related to the balance of network excitation and inhibition are the main focus of present study. By careful parameter exploration, the distinct role of synaptic connections in theta rhythm generation, facilitation of synchronization, and induction of burst activities are clarified. It is revealed that theta rhythms can be present with AMPA mediated weak E-I couplings, or with strong NMDA current. Moreover, counter-inhibition, namely inhibition of inhibition, is found effective in modulating the degree of network synchronization, while has little effect on regulating network frequency in both regimes. Under pathological considerations where the effect of pyramidal sprouting is simulated, synchronized burst patterns are observed to be induced by elevated recurrent excitation among pyramidal cells. In the final part, we additionally perform a test on the robustness of our results under heterogeneous parameters. Our simulation results may provide insights into understanding how brain rhythms are generated and modulated, and the proposed model may serve as a useful template in probing mechanisms of hippocampal-related dynamics.

AB  - Background Salicylic acid (SA) is a natural phenolic compound in plants with many beneficial effects for humans. The anxiolytic effect of this compound has been reported in animal models, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, by using the fear potentiated plus maze test, we evaluated the effect of salicylic acid on the gene expression of the main form of GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) synthesizing enzyme i.e., the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) which is called GAD1, in the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus, one of the main brain structures, in anxiety circuits. Also, the hypnotic effect of Salicylic acid was evaluated. Methods Animals were divided into the solvent, (SA) and diazepam treated groups (n = 6). For evaluating the anxiolytic effect of Salicylic acid, animals were subjected to 2 h of isolation, before placing them in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Afterward, the ventral part of the hippocampus was removed for evaluating the change in GAD1 gene expression by the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) technique. The hypnotic effect of Salicylic acid was evaluated in the ketamine induced sleeping test. Results Salicylic acid at 10 and 30 (mg/kg) increased time spent and entries to the open arms in the (EPM) (p < 0.05). (RTqPCR) revealed that 30 mg/kg of Salicylic acid increased GAD1 gene expression (p < 0.001). Salicylic acid (30 and 300 mg/kg) also increased the duration of sleep, in ketamine induced sleeping test (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our results showed that Salicylic acid has anxiolytic and hypnotic effects and it exerts its anxiolytic effect partly, via up the regulation of GAD1 in the ventral part of the hippocampus.

AB  - Termites are often exposed to a variety of pathogens during their life cycle, which has led to the development of an innate immune system to resist these pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the innate immune system in insects. However, clear information on AMPs in termites has not been obtained. Therefore, exploring the function of AMPs in the subterranean termite Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) can lead to the development of novel termite control strategies that integrate RNA interference (RNAi) and pathogens. Here we first obtained two Oftermicins from O. formosanus and observed that the expression of these Oftermicin genes was significantly upregulated at the mRNA level after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Serratia marcescens Bizio (SM1). Interestingly, the expression of these Oftermicins increased not only in the donor termites but also in the recipient termites through transmission experiments. Bioassay experiments showed that the mortality of O. formosanus treated with SM1 after RNAi was significantly higher than that of other groups. In summary, dsOftermicins are important immunosuppressants for termite control and Oftermicins are optimal targets for termite control based on the combined use of RNAi and pathogens.

AB  - Forage in the dry tropics constitutes the most sustainable feed source for livestock, contributing the most to improving animal welfare, meat and milk quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of stems, growth, yield and bromatological analysis of Urochloa hybrid cultivar 'Mulato II' by varying the days of cutting and cutting height in the dry and rainy seasons. The variables evaluated were: stem dynamics, growth dynamics, structural characteristics, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), leaving a residual height of 10 and 15 cm in the dry and rainy seasons in an 8-week growth analysis. There were 8 experimental plots corresponding to each day of cutting, each plot measuring 3 x 3 m with 3 replicates distributed in a completely random design based on the slope of the irregular terrain. From the stage of 49 to 56 days, the highest density of stems was recorded, regardless of the season and cutting height, with an average of 360 stems/m(2). The net growth of Mulato II grass leaf blades showed the following trend from highest to lowest: 15 cm rain >15 cm dry >10 cm rain >10 cm dry with 209, 183, 155 and 133 cm/stem, respectively (P <= 0.05). The CP concentration varied from 19.80 to 7.9 %, for harvests at 7 and 63 days, respectively; regardless of the cutting height and time of the year (P<0.05). Mulato II grass should be cut at 35 to 42 days after regrowth and at an intensity of 15 cm.

AB  - The schedule of administering a drug has profound impact on the toxicity and efficacy profiles of the drug through changing its pharmacokinetics (PK). PK is an innate and indispensable component of the dose-schedule optimization. Motivated by this, we propose a Bayesian PK integrated dose-schedule finding (PKIDS) design to identify the optimal dose-schedule regime by integrating PK, toxicity, and efficacy data. Based on the causal pathway that dose and schedule affect PK, which in turn affects efficacy and toxicity, we jointly model the three endpoints by first specifying a Bayesian hierarchical model for the marginal distribution of the longitudinal dose-concentration process. Conditional on the drug concentration in plasma, we jointly model toxicity and efficacy as a function of the concentration. We quantify the risk-benefit of regimes using utility-continuously updating the estimates of PK, toxicity, and efficacy based on interim data-and make adaptive decisions to assign new patients to appropriate dose-schedule regimes via adaptive randomization. The simulation study shows that the PKIDS design has desirable operating characteristics.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta, a causative protein of AD, in the brain. Shati/Nat8l, identified as a psychiatric disease related molecule, is a responsive enzyme of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) synthesis. In the hippocampi of AD patients and model mice, the NAA content and Shati/Nat8l expression were reported to be reduced. Having recently clarified the involvement of Shati/Nat8l in cognitive function, we examined the recovery effect of the hippocampal overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in AD model mice (5XFAD). Shati/Nat8l overexpression suppressed cognitive dysfunction without affecting the A beta burden or number of NeuN-positive neurons. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA was upregulated by Shati/Nat8l overexpression in 5XFAD mice. These results suggest that Shati/Nat8l overexpression prevents cognitive dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, indicating that Shati/Nat8l could be a therapeutic target for AD.

AB  - Asthma is a complex disease caused by genetic and environmental factors. Studies show that wheezing during rhinovirus infection correlates with childhood asthma development. Over 150 non-coding risk variants for asthma have been identified, many affecting gene regulation in T cells, but the effects of most risk variants remain unknown. We hypothesized that airway epithelial cells could also mediate genetic susceptibility to asthma given they are the first line of defense against respiratory viruses and allergens. We integrated genetic data with transcriptomics of airway epithelial cells subject to different stimuli. We demonstrate that rhinovirus infection significantly upregulates childhood-onset asthma-associated genes, particularly in non-ciliated cells. This enrichment is also observed with influenza infection but not with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or cytokine activation. Overall, our results suggest that rhinovirus infection is an environmental factor that interacts with genetic risk factors through non-ciliated airway epithelial cells to drive childhood-onset asthma.

AB  - Studies demonstrate that individuals with diagnoses for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Schizophrenia (SCZ) may exhibit smaller hippocampal gray matter relative to otherwise healthy controls, although the effect sizes vary in each disorder. Existing work suggests that hippocampal abnormalities in each disorder may be attributable to genetic liability and/or environmental variables. The following study uses baseline data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (ABCD Study?) to address three open questions regarding the relationship between genetic risk for each disorder and hippocampal volume reductions: (a) whether polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for MDD, PTSD, and SCZ are related to hippocampal volume; (b) whether PGRS for MDD, PTSD, and SCZ are differentially related to specific hippocampal subregions along the longitudinal axis; and (c) whether the association between PGRS for MDD, PTSD, and SCZ and hippocampal volume is moderated by sex and/or environmental adversity. In short, we did not find associations between PGRS for MDD, PTSD, and SCZ to be significantly related to any hippocampal subregion volumes. Furthermore, neither sex nor enviornmental adversity significantly moderated these associations. Our study provides an important null finding on the relationship genetic risk for MDD, PTSD, and SCZ to measures of hippocampal volume.

AB  - Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, Adcyap1) activation of PAC1 receptors (Adcyap1r1) can significantly increase the excitability of diverse neurons through differential mechanisms. For guinea pig cardiac neurons, the modulation of excitability can be mediated in part by PAC1 receptor plasma membrane G protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase and downstream signaling cascades. By contrast, PAC1 receptor-mediated excitability of hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells appears independent of membrane-delimited AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC signaling. For both neuronal types, there is mechanistic convergence demonstrating that endosomal PAC1 receptor signaling has prominent roles. In these models, neuronal exposure to Pitstop2 to inhibit beta-arrestin/clathrin-mediated PAC1 receptor internalization eliminates PACAP modulation of excitability. beta-arrestin is a scaffold for a number of effectors especially MEK/ERK and notably, paradigms that inhibit PAC1 receptor endosome formation and ERK signaling also blunt the PACAP-induced increase in excitability. Detailed PAC1 receptor internalization and endosomal ERK signaling mechanisms have been confirmed in HEK PAC1R-EGFP cells and shown to be long lasting which appear to recapitulate the sustained electrophysiological responses. Thus, PAC1 receptor internalization/endosomal recruitment efficiently and efficaciously activates MEK/ERK signaling and appears to represent a singular and critical common denominator in regulating neuronal excitability by PACAP.

AB  - Furanocoumarins are a class of chemical compounds with phototoxic properties. For herbivores, efficient detoxification of such defense compounds is the prerequisite to feed successfully on furanocoumarin-containing plants. The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is a very important polyphagous pest in agriculture, but how it copes with toxic furanocoumarins in some of its host plants is not well understood. Given that cytochrome P450s are well known for their capacity in xenobiotic metabolism, this study attempted to explore the potential roles of cytochrome P450s in furanocoumarin transformation in this pest. Our data showed that two linear structures (psoralen and xanthotoxin) could be metabolized by three recombinant CYP9A enzymes, but no detectable depletion was observed for the linear one with the 8-dimethylallyloxy substituent on the coumarin moiety (imperatorin) and the angular furanocoumarin (angelicin). Initial epoxidation of the double bond connecting C2' and C3' of the furano ring following by cleavage of the epoxidated furan ring, leading to the formation of more soluble, less reactive and nonphotosensitizing metabolites, was identified as a common mechanism of linear furanocoumarin metabolism using a quadrupole/time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry interfaced with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Our data demonstrated that multiple P450s were involved in the detoxification of linear furanocoumarins in the cotton bollworm. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the biochemical basis of adaptation to plant defense chemicals in this economically important pest.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages escape most preclinical/clinical neutralizing antibodies in development, suggesting that previously employed antibody screening strategies are not well suited to counteract the rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, there is an urgent need to screen better broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody. In this study, a comprehensive approach to design broad-spectrum inhibitors against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 by leveraging the structural diversity of nanobodies is proposed. This includes the de novo design of a fully human nanobody library and the camel immunization-based nanobody library, both targeting conserved epitopes, as well as the development of multivalent nanobodies that bind nonoverlapping epitopes. The results show that trivale B11-E8-F3, three nanobodies joined tandemly in trivalent form, have the broadest spectrum and efficient neutralization activity, which spans from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is also demonstrated that B11-E8-F3 has a very prominent preventive and some therapeutic effect in animal models of three authentic viruses. Therefore, B11-E8-F3 has an outstanding advantage in preventing SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in immunocompromised populations or elderly people with high-risk comorbidities.

AB  - Abnormally elevated expression of the imprinted PHLDA2 gene has been reported in the placenta of human babies that are growth restricted in utero in several studies. We previously modelled this gene alteration in mice and found that just 2-fold increased expression of Phlda2 resulted in placental endocrine insufficiency. In addition, elevated Phlda2 was found to drive fetal growth restriction (FGR) of transgenic offspring and impaired maternal care by their wildtype mothers. Being born small and being exposed to suboptimal maternal care have both been associated with the increased risk of mental health disorders in human populations. In the current study we probed behavioural consequences of elevated Phlda2 for the offspring. We discovered increased anxiety-like behaviours, deficits in cognition and atypical social behaviours, with the greatest impact on male offspring. Subsequent analysis revealed alterations in the transcriptome of the adult offspring hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala, regions consistent with these behavioural observations. The inclusion of a group of fully wildtype controls raised in a normal maternal environment allowed us to attribute behavioural and molecular alterations to the adverse maternal environment induced by placental endocrine insufficiency rather than the specific gene change of elevated Phlda2. Our work demonstrates that a highly common alteration reported in human FGR is associated with negative behavioural outcomes later in life. Importantly, we also establish the experimental paradigm that placental endocrine insufficiency can program atypical behaviour in offspring highlighting the under-appreciated role of placental endocrine insufficiency in driving disorders of later life behaviour.

AB  - Representation of the environment by hippocampal populations is known to drift even within a familiar environment, which could reflect gradual changes in single-cell activity or result from averaging across discrete switches of single neurons. Disambiguating these possibilities is crucial, as they each imply distinct mechanisms. Leveraging change point detection and model comparison, we find that CA1 population vectors de- correlate gradually within a session. In contrast, individual neurons exhibit predominantly step-like emergence and disappearance of place fields or sustained changes in within-field firing. The changes are not restricted to particular parts of the maze or trials and do not require apparent behavioral changes. The same place fields emerge, disappear, and reappear across days, suggesting that the hippocampus reuses pre-existing assemblies, rather than forming new fields de novo. Our results suggest an internally driven perpetual step-like reorganization of the neuronal assemblies.

AB  - Simple Summary In the present study, the inclusion of micronised camelina, flax, and sunflower seeds in the diets of broiler chickens improved the slaughter parameters, for example, the share of commercial cuts in the carcass (breast, thigh, and drumstick muscle), and reduced the content of abdominal fat. The addition of oilseeds in the diets also modified the calorific value of the breast, thigh, and drumstick muscles as well as some organs by reducing the content of ether extract. In addition, the flax seeds increased the content of Ca, Cu, and Fe in the muscles and organs. At the same time, there were no abnormalities in the health status of the birds. In this study, we included 15% doses of infrared-irradiated camelina, flax, and sunflower seeds in the diets of broiler chickens (grower and finisher) and focused on assessing the effects on the production traits, selected slaughter analysis parameters, nutrients, and minerals in breast and drumstick meat and some organs, i.e., liver, proventriculus, and heart. In total, 200 one-day-old broiler chickens were assigned randomly to four treatments with five replicate cages of 10 broiler chickens per cage (five females and five males). The experiment lasted 6 weeks. In the group of broiler chickens in which diets were supplemented with micronised camelina and flax seeds, there was an increase in (p < 0.05) breast, thigh, and drumstick weight and a decrease (p < 0.05) in the abdominal fat of the carcasses. The oilseed treatments reduced the ether extract content and the calorific value in the breast and drumstick muscles and organs. The flax seeds contributed to an increase in the contents of Ca (breast muscle and liver), Cu (breast muscle and proventriculus), and Fe (drumstick muscle and heart). Likewise, some blood parameters were influenced by supplementation with infrared-irradiated camelina and flax seeds, for example, there was a decrease in the haemoglobin level and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (p < 0.05). The oilseed treatments also modified the contents of Fe and Ca in the blood plasma of broiler chickens (p < 0.05). It may be concluded that infrared-irradiated camelina, flax, and sunflower seeds can be regarded as good diet components exerting positive effects on the dietary value of poultry meat and organs used in dietetics.

AB  - Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) can lead to the formation of aggregates that contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite globally reduced neural activity during AD onset, recent studies have suggested that A beta induces hyperexcitability and seizure-like activity during the early stages of the disease that ultimately exacerbate cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we reveal an A beta-induced elevation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in cultured neurons in vitro and in an in vivo AD model using APP/PS1 mice at 8 weeks of age. Elevation of PSD-95 occurs as a result of reduced ubiquitination caused by Akt-dependent phosphorylation of E3 ubiquitin ligase murine-double-minute 2 (Mdm2). The elevation of PSD-95 is consistent with the facilitation of excitatory synapses and the surface expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors induced by A beta. Inhibition of PSD-95 corrects these A beta-induced synaptic defects and reduces seizure activity in APP/PS1 mice. Our results demonstrate a mechanism underlying elevated seizure activity during early-stage A beta pathology and suggest that PSD-95 could be an early biomarker and novel therapeutic target for AD.
   Neuronal hyperactivity and elevated susceptibility to seizures have been observed in early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation of A beta leads to an elevation of excitatory synapse numbers and seizure susceptibility, which can be ameliorated by inhibition of PSD-95.Post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is elevated in young APP/PS1 mice as well as cultured cortical neurons treated with synthetic A beta peptides. Elevated PSD-95 is caused by its reduced ubiquitination resulting from Akt-dependent phosphorylation of E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Genetically inhibiting PSD-95 reduces A beta-induced elevation of excitatory synapse numbers. Genetically inhibiting PSD-95 ameliorates seizure response in APP/PS1 mice as well as wildtype mice injected with synthetic A beta peptides.

AB  - The pancreatic extracellular matrix (ECM) is an enormously complex construct. Previous studies underline the challenges to identify the optimal combinations and ratios of individual ECM proteins for promoting survival and function of isolated and transplanted islets. This study aimed on assessing the efficiency of solubilized natural ECM extracted from juvenile pigs, an unlimited donor source. Isolated human islets were cultured under a hypoxic atmosphere (2% oxygen) in media supplemented with either solubilized porcine pancreatic ECM (ppECM) or a mixture of human ECM proteins composed of collagen-IV, laminin-521, and nidogen-1 (hEPM). Control islets were cultured under identical conditions without ECM-compounds. Reactive oxygen species production increased three-fold in controls but was reduced by hEPM or ppECM. Early apoptosis remained on preculture levels when islets were treated with hEPM or ppECM. Preculture viability was preserved when hEPM or ppECM was administered. Whilst controls failed to respond to glucose challenge, treatment with hEPM or ppECM preserved the physiological insulin response. In summary, overall survival was significantly highest in ppECM-treated islets. This study presents a new approach to protect human islets from hypoxia-induced damage by supplementing media with ppECM extracted from an unlimited donor source. The findings may also serve as starting point for a novel encapsulation technique to protect isolated human islets.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is common in cancer metastasis, is also observed during developmental processes such as embryo implantation into the maternal endometrium in humans and rodents. However, this process has not been well characterized in the non-invasive type of implantation that occurs in ruminants. To understand whether EMT occurs in ruminant ungulates, ovine conceptuses (embryo plus extraembryonic membranes) from days 15 (P15: pre-attachment), 17 (P17: during attachment), and 21 (P21: post-attachment, day 0 = day of estrus) were evaluated. RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of EMT-related transcripts increased on P21. Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses indicated that levels of transcripts and proteins indicative of mesenchyme-related molecules increased on P21, but a minor expression of epithelium-related molecules remained. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that E-cadherin (CDH1) was localized in the elongated trophectoderm on P15 and P17. On P21, CDH1 was localized to the trophectoderm and on the conceptus cells undergoing differentiation. Vimentin (VIM) was localized in the uterine stroma on P15 and P17, and its expression was observed at the edge of elongating trophoblast on P21. Further, it was found that some bi-nucleated trophoblast cells were present on P17; however, numerous bi- and multi-nucleated trophoblast cells on the uterine epithelium or next to the uterine stroma were found on P21. A minor expression of pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) transcripts was found on P15 and P17, but a definitive expression of PAGs, transcripts, and proteins was found on P21. Although further investigation is required, these observations indicate that bi-nucleated trophoblast cell formation begins on the day conceptus implantation to the maternal endometrium is initiated, followed by EMT in trophoblast cells. These results suggest that these sequential events are required if pregnancy is to be established in ruminants.

AB  - Chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforation increases patient susceptibility to infection, hearing loss, and other side effects. Current clinical treatment, surgical grafting, can result in detrimental side effects including nerve damage, dizziness, or hearing loss. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel therapeutic procedures that can induce or accelerate healing in minimally or noninvasive approaches. Cell-free therapies have safety advantages over stem cells and are logistically favorable for clinical use. The regenerative potential by mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned media (CM) has been promising. In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres with CM encapsulated have been developed as a cell-free alternative regenerative treatment for TM perforation. The results suggest that the PLGA microspheres were capable of encapsulating and releasing CM for up to 21 days. The in vitro scratch wound proliferation assays showed increased wound healing ability of CM-loaded microspheres. In vivo guinea pig models treated with CM drops and CM-loaded microspheres using a thermoresponsive gel carrier demonstrated potential for wound healing in TM perforation. These studies provide a basis for further examination of the delivery of stem cell CM and investigation of time-dependent wound healing, long-term ototoxicity, and hearing restoration.

AB  - Simple Summary Bovine rhinitis virus (BRV) is an important pathogen causing bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and it can be divided into two genotypes-bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV). However, knowledge about the prevalence and molecular information of BRV in China is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRV in beef cattle with BRDC syndrome in China, and the results confirmed the circulation of BRAV and BRBV. The genomic sequences of BRAVs in this study showed an independent evolutionary trend while BRBVs exhibited significant genetic heterogeneity, and the recombination patterns of both types of BRVs were distinct from what was observed in a previous study. The present study reported the presence and prevalence of BRAV in China, providing recommendations for prevention and control of BRDC, and contributed to a better understanding of the evolution of BRV. Bovine rhinitis virus (BRV) is an etiological agent of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and can be divided into two genotypes-bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV). However, knowledge about the prevalence and molecular information of BRV in China is still limited. In this study, 163 deep nasal swabs collected from bovines with BRDC syndrome on 16 farms across nine provinces of China were tested for BRAV and BRBV by a duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. The results showed that 28.22% (46/163) of the samples were BRV-positive, and the positive rates were 22.09% (36/163) for BRAV and 9.2% (15/163) for BRBV. The co-circulation of both BRV genotypes was observed on two farms. Furthermore, five near-complete BRV genomes, including three BRAVs and two BRBVs, were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the three obtained BRAVs were phylogenetically independent, while the two BRBVs exhibited significant genetic heterogeneity. Recombination analysis revealed that three BRAVs and one BRBV strain obtained in this study were recombinants. The present study confirmed the presence and prevalence of BRAV in China, and it found that both types of BRV are circulating in beef cattle, which contributes to a better understanding of the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRV.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) persists in the male genital tract that associates with infertility. However, the presence of HEV in the female genital tract is unreported. Vaginal secretions, cervical smears, and cervix uteri were collected to explore the presence of HEV in the female genital tract. HEV RNA and/or antigens were detected in the vaginal secretions, cervical smears, and the cervix uteri of women. The infectivity of HEV excreted into vaginal secretions was further validated in vitro. In addition, HEV replicates in the female genital tract were identified in HEV-infected animal models by vaginal injection or vaginal mucosal infection to imitate sexual transmission. Serious genital tract damage and inflammatory responses with significantly elevated mucosal innate immunity were observed in women or animals with HEV vaginal infection. Results demonstrated HEV replicates in the female genital tract and causes serious histopathological damage and inflammatory responses.

AB  - Effective treatment of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is still absent so far. Taurine exhibits therapeutic effects towards the autism -like behaviour in ASD model animals. Here, we determined the mechanism of taurine effect on hippocampal neurogenesis in genetically inbred BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) mice, a proposed model of ASD. In this ASD mouse model, we explored the effect of oral taurine supplementation on ASD-like behaviours in an open field test, elevated plus maze, marble burying test, self-grooming test, and three-chamber test. The mice were divided into four groups of normal controls (WT) and models (BTBR), who did or did not receive 6-week taurine supplementation in water (WT, WT+ Taurine, BTBR, and BTBR+Taurine). Neurogenesisrelated effects were determined by Ki67 immunofluorescence staining. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN)/mTOR/AKT pathway-associated proteins. Our results showed that taurine improved the autism -like behaviour, increased the proliferation of hippocampal cells, promoted PTEN expression, and reduced phosphorylation of mTOR and AKT in hippocampal tissue of the BTBR mice. In conclusion, taurine reduced the autism -like behaviour in partially inherited autism model mice, which may be associated with improving the defective neural precursor cell proliferation and enhancing the PTEN-associated pathway in hippocampal tissue.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Euonymus alatus (Thunb.) Siebold. (EA), a traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the treatment of diabetes. Our group has previously found that EA could treat diabetic retinopathy (DR) and stigmast-4-en-3-one (Numbered E6) is the active substance responsible for inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro by EA. However, the effects and mechanisms of E6 in the treatment of DR is still unknown. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of E6 in EA on DR. Additionally, a comparison was made between the effects of E6 and triamcinolone acetonide (TA), as well as the side effects of E6 and dexamethasone. Materials and methods: Ocular affinity assessment and pharmacokinetic parameter prediction were conducted to evaluate the potential of E6 to treat DR. Retinal endothelial cells were used to investigate the in vitro inhibitory effect of E6 on vascular proliferation. Additionally, chicken embryos, zebrafish, and mice were used to investigate the in vivo anti-vascular proliferation effect of E6. Finally, diabetic mice were used to investigate whether E6 improves diabetic retinopathy and to compare its efficacy with that of TA. We then used network pharmacology to study the targets of E6 and performed molecular docking; followed by immunofluorescence experiments, ELISA, Western blot, and tube formation experiments to further investigate its mechanism. Finally, we compared the side effects of E6 with those of dexamethasone. Results: E6 was found to have an affinity for the eye and to inhibit vascular proliferation both in vivo and in vitro . Moreover, E6 was found to be more efficacious than TA in the treatment of DR. Molecular docking experiments predicted that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a potential target of E6, and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that E6 upregulated the expression of the GR in the retina of hyperglycemic mice. In addition, western blotting results and tube formation experiments showed that E6 also attenuated angiogenesis by inhibiting the Hippo and VEGF pathways. Finally, by comparing the effects of E6 and dexamethasone on glucose regulation and osteoporosis, E6 was found to have fewer side effects. Conclusions: E6 is a highly effective drug for the treatment of DR, superior to TA and with fewer side effects than dexamethasone. Its mechanism involves the activation of glucocorticoid receptor and inhibition of Hippo and VEGF pathways to alleviate angiogenesis and inflammation. This study is the first to investigate the role and mechanism of E6 in improving DR. The findings suggest that E6 has unique advantages in the treatment of DR.

AB  - The objective of this work was to test the Fenton reaction on pretreatment of elephant grass aiming the results of cellulose increase and the delignification process. A subsequent study of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated elephant grass and the mathematical modeling of hydrolysis was performed. A Doehlert-type experimental design was used into the pretreatment stage and the best results were obtained at the central point with an average of 53.80% of cellulose and 10.00% of lignin. The enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated grass with Fenton reaction was performed, with a commercial enzyme, where the best yield (17.39%) of reducing sugars was obtained with 20 g L-1 of enzyme in 72 h and higher productivity (2.51 g L-1 h(-1)) observed in 2 h. It was possible to adjust the proposed mathematical model to the hydrolysis process. It was observed that, for higher concentrations of enzyme, the proposed mathematical model adjusts better the experimental results (R-2 = 0.993). It can be observed with these results that there was an increment in the economic profitability of the enzymatic hydrolysis process due to the relation of the operational parameters, so that it can be used in new projects and industrial applications.

AB  - In ancient Olynthus (Greece), an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was utilized to collect both RGB and multispectral (MS) images of the archaeological site. Ground Control Points (GCPs) were used to solve the blocks of images and the production of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthophotomosaics. Check Points (CPs) were employed to verify the spatial accuracy of the products. The innovative image fusion process carried out in this paper, which combined the RGB and MS orthophotomosaics from UAS sensors, led to the creation of a fused image with the best possible spatial resolution (five times better than that of the MS orthophotomosaic). This improvement facilitates the optimal visual and digital (e.g., classification) analysis of the archaeological site. Utilizing the fused image and reviewing the literature, the paper compiles and briefly presents information on the Hippodamian system of the excavated part of the ancient city of Olynthus (regularity, main and secondary streets, organization of building blocks, public and private buildings, types and sizes of dwellings, and internal organization of buildings) as well as information on its socio-economic organization (different social groups based on the characteristics of the buildings, commercial markets, etc.).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Persistent ketamine insults to the central nervous system block NMDA receptors and disrupt putative neurotransmission, oxido-nitrosative, and inflammatory pathways, resulting in schizophrenia-like symptoms in animals. Previously, the ethnomedicinal benefits of Carpolobia lutea against insomnia, migraine headache, and insanity has been documented, but the mechanisms of action remain incomplete. Aim of the study: Presently, we explored the neuro-therapeutic role of Carpolobia lutea ethanol extract (C. lutea) in ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice. Materials and methods: Sixty-four male Swiss (22 +/- 2 g) mice were randomly assigned into eight groups (n = 8/ group) and exposed to a reversal ketamine model of schizophrenia. For 14 days, either distilled water (10 mL/kg; p.o.) or ketamine (20 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered, following possible reversal treatments with C. lutea (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg; p.o.), haloperidol (1 mg/kg, p.o.), or clozapine (5 mg/kg; p.o.) beginning on days 8-14. During the experiment, a battery of behavioral characterizations defining schizophrenia-like symptoms were obtained using ANY-maze software, followed by neurochemical, oxido-inflammatory and histological assessments in the mice brains. Results: A 7-day reversal treatment with C. lutea reversed predictors of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. C. lutea also mitigated ketamine-induced neurochemical derangements as evidenced by modulations of dopamine, glutamate, norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission. Also, the increased acetylcholinesterase activity, malondialdehyde nitrite, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis-factor-alpha concentrations were reversed by C. lutea accompanied with elevated levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione. Furthermore, C. lutea reversed ketamine-induced neuronal alterations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum sections of the brain. Conclusion: These findings suggest that C. lutea reverses the cardinal symptoms of ketamine-induced schizophrenia in a dose-dependent fashion by modulating the oxido-inflammatory and neurotransmitter-related mechanisms.

AB  - Lignans are plant-derived compounds that act as partial estrogen agonists. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) represent one of the major com-ponents of the extracellular matrix. Here we aimed to understand the role of sesamin (SES), a major lignan compound, in the biosynthesis and degradation of CSPGs in the mouse hippocampus because CSPGs play a key role in the regulation of cognitive functions through the promotion of adult neurogenesis. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta was decreased by SES administration in the hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, a model of neuroinflammation-induced cognitive deficits. The expression of genes related to biosynthesis and degradation of CSPGs in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice was both increased and decreased by SES administration. Further, the diffuse extracellular matrix labeling of CSPGs by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice was increased by SES administration. The densities of neural stem cells, late transit-amplifying cells, and newborn-granule cells in the hippocampus of LPS-treated mice were also increased by SES administration. Moreover, SES-induced alterations in gene expression, WFA labeling, and adult neurogenesis in LPS-treated mice were more evident in the dorsal hippocampus (center of cognition) than in the ventral hippocampus (center of emotion). Neither LPS nor SES administration affected locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and depression-related behavior. However, impairments in contextual memory and sensorimotor gating in LPS-treated mice were recovered by SES administration. Our results show that SES can promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis through the upregulation of CSPGs, which may alleviate cognitive deficits induced by neuroinflammation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Apigenin and luteolin are products of the phenylpropanoid pathway, where apigenin serves as a substrate for the synthesis of luteolin. Apigenin and luteolin are highly bioactive flavones; therefore, in search of prospective biopesticides, the receptiveness of the polyphagous green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) to apigenin and luteolin was studied. The flavones were applied as 0.1% ethanolic solutions to the host plant leaf surface, and aphid probing and feeding activities were monitored using the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique. The structural difference between apigenin and luteolin, which was the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule, had an impact on the activity of these flavones. On apigenin-treated plants, the duration of the first probe was three times as short as on the control and five times as short as on the luteolin-treated plants; the duration of the time to the first ingestion phase within the successful probe was shorter than on the control and luteolin-treated plants; the mean duration of xylem sap ingestion bouts and the proportion of xylem phase in all probing activities were the highest; and the duration of salivation before phloem sap ingestion was the longest. Aphids' response to luteolin-treated plants was less distinct as compared to apigenin-treated plants.

AB  - Anxiety disorder is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders, and affects many people's daily activities. Although the pathogenesis and treatments of anxiety disorder have been studied for several decades, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide evidence that olfactory stimuli with inhaled linalool or 2-phenylethanol decreased mouse anxiety-like behaviors and increased the activities of hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs). RNA-sequencing analysis identified retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, which is a critical pathway for mood regulation and neuron activation, is altered in the hippocampus of both linalool- and 2-phenylethanol-exposed mice. Further studies found that selective inhibition of endocannabinoid signaling by injecting rimonabant abolished the activation of DGCs and the anxiolytic effect induced by linalool or 2-phenylethanol. Together, these results uncovered a novel mechanism by which linalool or 2-phenylethanol decreases mouse anxiety-like behaviors and increases DG activity likely through activating hippocampal retrograde endocannabinoid signaling.

AB  - Modern high-resolution volumetric tomography, commonly known as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), is one of the most innovative imaging techniques which can provide views of anatomical structures not attainable by conventional techniques. Magnetic field LED therapy is a physical therapy method, combining the effects of the Extremely Low Frequency-Electromagnetic Field (ELF-EMF) and high-power light radiation emitted by Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). The method has been widely applied in the treatment and rehabilitation of complications of many medical conditions, including in dentistry. The aim of this study was to use CBCT to assess the effectiveness of the simultaneous use of electromagnetic field and LED light in the physical therapy of paranasal sinusitis. Treatments employing the electromagnetic field combined with LED light were administered to a 39-year-old female outpatient of the physiotherapy ward for rehabilitation therapy of paranasal sinusitis. Normal sinus pneumatization was restored almost completely. Reduction in the swelling of the sinus mucosa was so significant that even the pneumatization of the ethmoid bulla was restored. Physical therapy with the simultaneous use of ELF-EMF and LED light was found to be effective in the rehabilitation of the patient with paranasal sinusitis. Positive effects of the treatment were confirmed by CBCT findings.

AB  - Lipid ordering in cell membranes has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in establishing and regulating a large variety of biological functions. Multiple investigations into lipid organization focused on assessing ordering from temperature-induced phase transitions, which are often well outside the physiological range. However, particular stresses elicited by environmental factors, such as hypo-osmotic stress or protein insertion into membranes, with respect to changes in lipid status and ordering at constant temperature are insufficiently described. To fill these gaps in our knowledge, we exploited the well-established ability of environmentally sensitive membrane probes to detect intramembrane changes at the molecular level. Our steady state fluorescence spectroscopy experiments focused on assessing changes in optical responses of Laurdan and diphenylhexatriene upon exposure of red blood cells to hypo-osmotic stress and pore-forming toxins at room temperature. We verified our utilized experimental systems by a direct comparison of the results with prior reports on artificial membranes and cholesterol-depleted membranes undergoing temperature changes. The significant changes observed in the lipid order after exposure to hypo-osmotic stress or pore-forming toxins resembled phase transitions of lipids in membranes, which we explained by considering the short-range interactions between membrane components and the hydrophobic mismatch between membrane thickness and inserted proteins. Our results suggest that measurements of optical responses from the membrane probes constitute an appropriate method for assessing the status of lipids and phase transitions in target membranes exposed to mechanical stresses or upon the insertion of transmembrane proteins.

AB  - Despite the central role of Rho GTPases in neuronal development, their functions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain poorly explored. Here, by using a retrovirus-based loss-of-function approach in vivo, we show that the atypical Rho GTPase Rnd2 is crucial for survival, positioning, somatodendritic morphogenesis, and functional maturation of adult-born dentate granule neurons. Interestingly, most of these functions are specific to granule neurons generated during adulthood since the deletion of Rnd2 in neonatally-born granule neurons only affects dendritogenesis. In addition, suppression of Rnd2 in adult-born dentate granule neurons increases anxiety-like behavior whereas its deletion in pups has no such effect, a finding supporting the adult neurogenesis hypothesis of anxiety disorders. Thus, our results are in line with the view that adult neurogenesis is not a simple continuation of earlier processes from development, and establish a causal relationship between Rnd2 expression and anxiety.

AB  - Discovering the rules of synaptic plasticity is an important step for understanding brain learning. Existing plasticity models are either (1) top-down and interpretable, but not flexible enough to account for experimental data, or (2) bottom-up and biologically realistic, but too intricate to interpret and hard to fit to data. To avoid the shortcomings of these approaches, we present a new plasticity rule based on a geometrical readout mechanism that flexibly maps synaptic enzyme dynamics to predict plasticity outcomes. We apply this readout to a multi-timescale model of hippocampal synaptic plasticity induction that includes electrical dynamics, calcium, CaMKII and calcineurin, and accurate representation of intrinsic noise sources. Using a single set of model parameters, we demonstrate the robustness of this plasticity rule by reproducing nine published ex vivo experiments covering various spike-timing and frequency-dependent plasticity induction protocols, animal ages, and experimental conditions. Our model also predicts that in vivo-like spike timing irregularity strongly shapes plasticity outcome. This geometrical readout modelling approach can be readily applied to other excitatory or inhibitory synapses to discover their synaptic plasticity rules.

AB  - Simple Summary This research assessed the effect of organic iron made by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast iron) on digestion, utilization, antioxidation and caecum microflora in weaned piglets. An amount of 20 piglets which had been weaned after 28 days were divided into 4 groups. The basal diet of these 4 groups contained, respectively, 104 mg/kg iron of ferric sulfate or 84 mg/kg, 104 mg/kg or 124 mg/kg iron of yeast iron. The results suggested that a diet containing 84 mg/kg iron of yeast iron has the same effect as a diet containing 104 mg/kg iron of ferric sulfate, and that a diet containing 104 or 124 mg/kg iron of yeast iron is superior to a diet containing 104 mg/kg iron of ferric sulfate. Organic iron is expected to replace inorganic iron used in diets as an iron source. Organic iron possesses high absorption efficiency and low fecal iron excretion. This study aims to study the effect of organic iron produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast iron) on digestion, utilization, antioxidation and caecum microflora in weaned piglets. In total, 20 piglets that had been weaned after 28 days were divided into 4 groups, each of which followed a different basal diet. The basal diet of each of these 4 groups contained, respectively, 104 mg/kg iron (ferrous sulfate, CON), 84 mg/kg iron (yeast iron, LSC), 104 mg/kg iron (yeast iron, MSC) or 124 mg/kg iron (yeast iron, HSC). This experiment lasted 35 d. The apparent digestibility of iron in LSC, MSC and HMS was higher than that in CON (p < 0.01) and the fecal iron content in LSC, MSC and HMS was lower than that in CON (p < 0.01). Serum iron contents in LSC, MSC and HMS were higher than that in CON (p < 0.01). The iron contents of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney and left gluteus muscle in the MSC and HMS groups were higher than that in CON and LSC (p < 0.05). Serum catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity, superoxide anion, glutathione, hydroxyl free radical scavenging rate, total antioxidant capacity, and liver superoxide anion clearance rate and peroxidase in MSC and HMS were higher than that in CON and LSC (p < 0.05). The contents of nitric oxide and peroxide of the weaned piglets in MSC and HMS were lower than that in CON and LSC (p < 0.05). The abundance of Firmicutes, Blautia and Peptococcus in LSC, HSC and MSC was higher than that in CON (p < 0.01). The abundance of Lactobacillus in CON and LSC was higher than that in MSC and HSC (p < 0.01). The abundance of Acinetobacter, Streptococcus and Prevotella in LSC, MSC and HSC was lower than that in CON (p < 0.01). The results suggested that a diet containing 84 mg/kg iron of yeast iron has the same effect as a diet containing 104 mg/kg iron of ferric sulfate, and that a diet containing 104 or 124 mg/kg iron of yeast iron is superior to a diet containing 104 mg/kg iron of ferric sulfate.

AB  - This study was designed to explore the potential mechanisms of electroacupuncture (EA) in treating inflammatory bowel disease- (IBD-) related anxiety and mood disorders. A colitis model was induced in rats with 2, 4, 6-trinitrohydrosulfonic acid (TNBS), followed by ST36 and SP6 targeted therapy by EA or sham EA treatment. The elevated plus maze (EPM) and open-field test (OFT) were performed to assess the state of anxiety and depression-like behavior. Tests were carried out by 16S rDNA amplification sequence, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The analyses detailed metabolic alterations and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway/NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in rats' hippocampal region. Furthermore, the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and gut microbiome was assessed. As a result of treatment, EA significantly improved in the behavioral tests and altered the composition of the gut microbiome through a significant increase in the density of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producers mainly including Ruminococcaceae, Phascolarctobacterium, and Akkermansiaceae. EA upregulated the metabolites of the hippocampus mainly containing l-glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as ZO-1 expression. Whereas the treatment blocked the TLR4/nuclear factor- kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasomes, along with downregulating the interleukin- (IL-) 1 beta level. The hyperactivity of the HPA axis was also diminished. In conclusion, EA at ST36 and SP6 attenuated anxiety and depression-like behavior in colitis model rats through their effects on the gut microbiome by modulating the hippocampal inflammatory response and metabolic disorders, as well as the HPA axis. This study provides evidence for clinical application of EA to serve as an adjunctive treatment for IBD-related anxiety and depression.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders with high rates of prevalence and mortality. MDD is pathophysiologically complex, and treatment options are limited. Blueberries are rich in polyphenols and have neuroprotective potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of blueberry extract on neuroinflammatory and neuroplasticity parameters, as well as Na+/K+-ATPase, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice subject to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We also analyzed the interaction between anthocyanins and indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Male Swiss mice (60-day-old) received vehicle, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), or blueberry extract (100 or 200 mg/kg) intragastrically for 7 days before intraperitoneal LPS (0.83 mg/kg) injection. Twenty-four hours after LPS administration, the mice were subjected to behavioral tests. Both fluoxetine and blueberry extract (200 mg/kg) decreased the immobility time in the forced swim test, without affecting locomotor activity. Fluoxetine attenuated the decrease of Na+/K+-ATPase in the cerebral cortex, while blueberry extract promoted this same effect in the hippocampus. Additionally, fluoxetine and blueberry extract attenuated the decrease in the activity of MAO-A in the hippocampus. Blueberry extract (200 mg/kg) also prevented LPS-induced increase in AChE activity in the hippocampus as well as LPS upregulation of relative mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-10 in the cerebral cortex. Molecular docking analysis revealed binding sites for malvidin 3-galactoside (- 7.8 kcal/mol) and malvidin 3-glucoside (- 7.9 kcal/mol) residues with IDO. Taken together, these results indicate that blueberry extract improved depression-like behavior and attenuated the neurochemical and molecular changes in the brains of mice challenged with LPS.

AB  - We studied 63 woolly rhinoceros skulls from the northeast of Russia (northwestern Chukotka, northeastern Yakutia) housed in the collection of the "Ice Age" Museum-Theatre, Moscow. Both sexual dimorphism and size/shape variability of woolly rhinoceros skulls are explored using univariate and multivariate statistics for the first time. Peculiarities of the variability, which are probably related to gender, are expressed in (1) different sets of skull variables the variability of which does not depend on "general size" variations and (2) differences in skull allometry in males and females. The structure of morphological variability is discussed. Statistically significant morphological heterogeneity is detected within the male and female samples. This is shown to be the consequence of the presence of two size groups that are not related to individual age. Based on published radiocarbon dates, it is hypothesized that there was a decrease in skull size in the woolly rhinoceros is at the end of megainterstadial (MIS) 3 to the early Last Glacial Maximum MIS 2 in northeastern Asia. To test this hypothesis, new radiocarbon dates of the studied specimens are needed.

AB  - FK506-binding protein 2 (FKBP13) is a part of the immunophilin protein family involved in immunoregulation. It is also believed to operate as a factor in membrane cytoskeletal framework and as an ER chaperone. FKBP2 (FKBP13) and FKBP1 (FKBP12), known as immunophilins, are binding proteins for rapamycin and FK506, which are immunosuppressive drugs. It was suggested that immunophilin-like and immunophilin proteins play significant roles in regulating intracellular calcium and protein folding/sorting, acting as molecular chaperones. Within the 15 mammalian FKBPs known, FKBP1 is merely the only one proven to form complexes with rapamycin and FK506 in the cytosol and facilitate their T cells immunosuppressive effects, FKBP2 is a luminal protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is reported to take part in protein folding in the ER. However, little is known about FKBP2 link with apoptosis (either as a pro or anti-apoptotic protein). In this study, FKPB2 protein was co-expressed with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax after a yeast-based human hippocampal cDNA library screening. The yeast strain carrying the Bax gene was transformed with an episomal 2-micron plasmid that encodes the HA-tagged FKBP2 gene. The resultant strain would allow co-expression of Bax and FKBP2 in yeast cells. The results presented here show that a protein involved in protein folding can play a role in protecting yeast cell from Bax-induced apoptosis.

AB  - This study is designed to evaluate the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and divalent calcium ion (Ca2+) supplementation in sows' diets on trace elements in blood and milk to assess whether it is beneficial to pig growth or not. A total of 40 sows of 7 to 8 gestational age with good health and nutritional condition were divided into four groups: control group, low calcium group, 25(OH)D3 group and low calcium with 25(OH)D3 group. The blood and milk from sows and neonatal piglets' blood were collected on the day of parturition. Changes in the content of Cr, Mn, Cu, As, Se and Cd were analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant change in the content of Cr, Mn, Se and Cd in sows' blood by changing calcium content or adding 25(OH)D3 alone, while adding 25(OH)D3 alone can significantly reduce the content of copper in sows' blood. Under the combined action of low calcium and 25(OH)D3, the Cr, Mn and Cd content in piglets' blood were significantly lower than that of control group (P<0.05), and the content of copper was significantly increased compared to control group (P<0.01). Low calcium group and 25(OH)D3 group significantly increase the content of Cr, Cu and Se in sows' milk compared to control group (P<0.05), but has no effect on the content of arsenic. Altogether, our results suggest that addition of 25(OH)D3 to sows' diet is beneficial to maintain the balance of trace elements in sows and their fetuses, so 25(OH)D3 may be helpful for the health of mother and normal development of fetus during pregnancy.

AB  - Simple Summary This study was conducted to further our understanding of the global research outcomes, frontiers, trends, and the most-studied areas in fascioliasis, and it is of specific value for veterinarians, doctors, and researchers. A total of 4165 documents published between 1913 and 2021 from 116 countries were analyzed bibliometrically. The results of the bibliometric analysis indicated that the top 50 institutes publishing research documents regarding fascioliasis are from developed countries. Therefore, it is important that researchers in developing countries seek collaboration with other researchers in developed countries to learn new advancements and effective control strategies for fascioliasis. The researchers in developing countries should seek collaboration mainly with those researchers in the USA, France, England, and Spain who published over 35% of the documents related to fascioliasis. Background: Fascioliasis is a zoonotic neglected tropical disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica. In endemic regions, fascioliasis represents a huge problem in livestock production and significantly threatens public health. The present study was performed to assess the key bibliometric indicators, plot the global research outcome, and strive to find the research frontiers and trends in fascioliasis. Methods: A descriptive bibliometric and visualized study was conducted. The data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The WoSCC was searched using key terms covering a wide range of synonyms related to the causative agent (Fasciola) and the disease (fascioliasis). The database search was performed for the period from the inception of WoSCC until 3 October 2021. The downloaded data were exported into VOSviewer software version 1.6.17 for Windows to construct co-authorship countries, keywords co-occurrence, bibliographic coupling sources, and citation and documents network visualization. Results: A total of 4165 documents were included in this bibliometric analysis. The included documents were published between the years 1913 and 2021 from 116 countries, mainly from the United States of America (USA) (n = 482, 11.6%). The most prolific year was 2018 (n = 108). The journal that attracted the most publications was Veterinary Parasitology (n = 324), while the most productive author in this area was Rondelaud D (n = 156). In terms of total link strength (TLS), the most influential country was Spain (TLS = 236), followed by the USA (TLS = 178). Conclusion: This study is of value for veterinarians, doctors, and researchers to explore insights into research frontiers and trends in research on fascioliasis. The number of publications on fascioliasis has increased over time. Above 35% of publications have been produced by the USA, France, England, and Spain. "Fasciola hepatica" and "cattle" were the most dominant and widely used keywords. Research collaboration should be established among the researchers from developing countries with developed countries to learn new advancements and effective control strategies for fascioliasis.

AB  - Synapse is the fundamental structure for neurons to transmit information between cells. The proper synapse formation is crucial for developing neural circuits and cognitive functions of the brain. The aberrant synapse formation has been proved to cause many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are thought to play a major role in achieving mechanistic cell-cell recognition and initiating synapse formation via trans-synaptic interactions. Due to the diversity of synapses in different brain areas, circuits and neurons, although many synaptic CAMs, such as Neurexins (NRXNs), Neuroligins (NLGNs), Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (SynCAMs), Leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs), and SLIT and NTRK-like protein (SLITRKs) have been identified as synaptogenic molecules, how these molecules determine specific synapse formation and whether other molecules driving synapse formation remain undiscovered are unclear. Here, to provide a tool for synapse labeling and synaptic CAMs screening by artificial synapse formation (ASF) assay, we generated synaptotagmin-1-tdTomato (Syt1-tdTomato) transgenic mice by inserting the tdTomato-fused synaptotagmin-1 coding sequence into the genome of C57BL/6J mice. In the brain of Syt1-tdTomato transgenic mice, the tdTomato-fused synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1-tdTomato) signals were widely observed in different areas and overlapped with synapsin-1, a widely-used synaptic marker. In the olfactory bulb, the SYT1-tdTomato signals are highly enriched in the glomerulus. In the cultured hippocampal neurons, the SYT1-tdTomato signals showed colocalization with several synaptic markers. Compared to the wild-type (WT) mouse neurons, cultured hippocampal neurons from Syt1-tdTomato transgenic mice presented normal synaptic neurotransmission. In ASF assays, neurons from Syt1-tdTomato transgenic mice could form synaptic connections with HEK293T cells expressing NLGN2, LRRTM2, and SLITRK2 without immunostaining. Therefore, our work suggested that the Syt1-tdTomato transgenic mice with the ability to label synapses by tdTomato, and it will be a convenient tool for screening synaptogenic molecules.

AB  - DNA extraction for downstream molecular diagnostic applications can be an expensive, time-consuming process. We devised a method to quickly extract total bacterial DNA from environmental samples based on the sodium hydroxide lysis of cells with or without capture by magnetic beads for subsequent PCR or quantitative PCR. The final DNA extraction method using NaOH is extremely low-cost and can be completed in as little as 10 min at room temperature with dilution, or the DNA can be further purified using silica-coated paramagnetic beads. NaOH extraction was effective for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in samples from air, soil, sewage, food, laboratory surfaces, and chicken cloacal swabs. The NaOH extraction method was comparable to commercial kits for extraction of DNA from pig fecal samples for 16S amplicon sequencing analyses. We demonstrated that an impinger and portable pump can efficiently capture bacteria from the air in poultry facilities for rapid NaOH extraction to quantify total bacteria and for detection of specific species using qPCR. The air sampling and NaOH extraction procedures are well suited for routine, high-throughput screening and for metagenomic analyses for specific pathogens, even in resource-limited situations.

AB  - Neuropathic pain is a persistent and exhausting condition which results from damage to the nervous system and is often accompanied by emotional and cognitive impairments. In this study, we investigated dynamic changes in pain-related behaviors over 8 weeks using a spared nerve injury (SNI) model in male C57Bl/6 mice. We examined behavioral outcomes in conjunction with glial activation, neurogenesis, and glutamatergic signaling in the hippocampus to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cognitive and affective alterations associated with chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that SNI-induced neuropathic pain progressively increases anxiety-like behavior and impairs both working and long-term memory. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by significant activation of microglia and astrocytes, a reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis, and a decrease in the expression of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor subunits and the scaffolding protein PSD-95. Taken together, our results suggest that hippocampal neuroinflammation and associated synaptic dysfunction contribute to the affective and cognitive disturbances observed in chronic pain, providing insight into potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Surveillance of physiological parameters of newborns during delivery triggers medical decision-making, can rescue life and health, and helps avoid unnecessary cesareans. Here, the development of a photonic technology for monitoring perinatal asphyxia is presented and validated in vivo in a preclinical stage. Contrary to state of the art, the technology provides continuous data in real-time in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, the technology does not rely on a single parameter as pH or lactate, instead monitors changes of the entirety of physiological parameters accessible by Raman spectroscopy. By a fiber-coupled Raman probe that is in controlled contact with the skin of the subject, near-infrared Raman spectra are measured and analyzed by machine learning algorithms to develop classification models. As a performance benchmarking, various hybrid and non-hybrid classifiers are tested. In an asphyxia model in newborn pigs, more than 1000 Raman spectra are acquired at three different clinical phases-basal condition, hypoxia-ischemia, and post-hypoxia-ischemia stage. In this preclinical proof-of-concept study, figures of merit reach 90% levels for classifying the clinical phases and demonstrate the power of the technology as an innovative medical tool for diagnosing a perinatal adverse outcome.

AB  - The mechanism by which DNA-damage affects self-renewal and pluripotency remains unclear. DNA damage and repair mechanisms have been largely elucidated in mutated cancer cells or simple eukaryotes, making valid interpretations on early development difficult. Here we show the impact of ionizing irradiation on the maintenance and early differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Our findings demonstrate that irradiation induces the upregulation of the p53 family genes, including p53, p63, and p73, resulting in elevated expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases Itch and Trim32. Consequently, this impairs ESC maintenance by reducing the protein levels of key pluripotency transcription factors in both mouse ESCs and early embryos. Notably, our study reveals that irradiation-induced DNA damage leads to the recruitment of the BAF complex, causing it to dissociate from its binding sites on the target genes associated with the Yap, Wnt, and TGF-beta pathways, thereby increasing signaling and promoting differentiation of ESCs into all three lineages. Importantly, pathway inhibition demonstrates that DNA damage accelerated ESC differentiation relies on Wnt and TGF-beta, and is selectively dependent on p53 or p63/ p73 for mesoderm and endoderm respectively. Finally, our study reveals that p53 family proteins form complexes with effector proteins of key signaling pathways which actively contribute to ESC differentiation. In summary, this study uncovered a mechanism by which multiple differentiation signaling pathways converge on the p53 family genes to promote ESC differentiation and are impacted by exposure to ionizing radiation.

AB  - This study presents the development of a sustainable analytical method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determination and quantification of bioactive compounds in Herbal Dietary Supplements (HDS) solid oral formulations containing green tea (Camellia sinensis). Four compounds [gallic acid, (+)-catechin, caffeine and caffeic acid] were determined in fifteen HDS samples (capsules and tablets) containing green tea marketed in Brazil. After optimizing the extraction process using factorial planning and response surface analysis, it was possible to develop the method. Methanol and acetic acid (0.25%) were components of the mobile phase, showing it as a more sustainable alternative to the use of acetonitrile. The samples evaluated demonstrated a lack of standardization in the concentrations (in mg g(-1)) of the chemical markers studied gallic acid (<LOD to 1.39), (+)-catechin (<LOD to 13.8), caffeine (<LOQ to 22) and caffeic acid (<LOD to 1.7). This concern has driven significant scientific research on the topic. The chromatographic method proved to be effective, sensitive and robust for qualification and quantification of the 4 chemical markers studied. This study found variations in the levels of chemical markers in HDS containing green tea sold in Brazil. Therefore, it can contribute to the regulation and quality control of these solid oral products (capsules and tablets) containing this plant.

AB  - The fact that neuropathic pain (NP) has no effective therapy and is frequently accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities is well established. Aberrant neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of NP. HDAC6 inhibitors have been demonstrated to ameliorate mechanical allodynia brought on by chemotherapy and peripheral nerve damage. However, its pharmacological mechanisms and its effects on NP-related mental disorders have not been fully elucidated. The present study was dedicated to exploring the effects of ACY-1215 (a specific HDAC6 inhibitor) on neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities associated with NP. In this work, spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was performed as an NP model on rats. Mechanical allodynia, cognitive impairment, and depressive-like behavior caused by SNL were attenuated by continuous intraperito-neal injection of ACY-1215. Moreover, ACY-1215 administration suppressed SNL-induced neuroinflammatory responses (including microgliosis, the elevation of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) in ligation of the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn (iSDH), hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Mechanistically, MyD88-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways (MyD88/NF-kappa B and MyD88/ERK) were activated in the iSDH following SNL and were inhibited by ACY-1215. Moreover, ACY-1215 enhanced the acetylation modification of MyD88 and inhibited the SNL-induced elevation of MyD88 without affecting its transcription in the iSDH. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 can ameliorate NP and its psychiatric complications through modulating neuroinflammation, in part by blocking the MyD88-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways. The possible mechanism is that ACY-1215 prevents the elevation of MyD88 reactivity by increasing its acetylation level. Notably, neither SNL nor ACY-1215 significantly altered MyD88 expression in HPC and PFC, indicating differentiated pro-inflammatory mechanisms in the supraspinal neural regions.

AB  - Introduction: The developing epigenome changes rapidly, potentially making it more sensitive to toxicant exposures. DNA modifications, including methylation and hydroxymethylation, are important parts of the epigenome that may be affected by environmental exposures. However, most studies do not differentiate between these two DNA modifications, possibly masking significant effects.
   Methods: To investigate the relationship between DNA hydroxymethylation and developmental exposure to common contaminants, a collaborative, NIEHS-sponsored consortium, TaRGET II, initiated longitudinal mouse studies of developmental exposure to human-relevant levels of the phthalate plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and the metal lead (Pb). Exposures to 25 mg DEHP/kg of food (approximately 5mg DEHP/kg body weight) or 32 ppm Pb-acetate in drinking water were administered to nulliparous adult female mice. Exposure began 2 weeks before breeding and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation, until offspring were 21 days old. At 5 months, perinatally exposed offspring blood and cortex tissue were collected, for a total of 25 male mice and 17 female mice (n = 5-7 per tissue and exposure). DNA was extracted and hydroxymethylation was measured using hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq). Differential peak and pathway analysis was conducted comparing across exposure groups, tissue types, and animal sex, using an FDR cutoff of 0.15.
   Results: DEHP-exposed females had two genomic regions with lower hydroxymethylation in blood and no differences in cortex hydroxymethylation. For DEHP-exposed males, ten regions in blood (six higher and four lower) and 246 regions (242 higher and four lower) and four pathways in cortex were identified.Pb-exposed females had no statistically significant differences in blood or cortex hydroxymethylation compared to controls. Pb-exposed males, however, had 385 regions (all higher) and six pathways altered in cortex, but no differential hydroxymethylation was identified in blood.
   Discussion: Overall, perinatal exposure to human-relevant levels of two common toxicants showed differences in adult DNA hydroxymethylation that was specific to sex, exposure type, and tissue, but male cortex was most susceptible to hydroxymethylation differences by exposure. Future assessments should focus on understanding if these findings indicate potential biomarkers of exposure or are related to functional long-term health effects.

AB  - Imidacloprid (IMI) is a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide that poses risks for developmental neurotoxicity in mammals. The present study investigated the effects of maternal exposure to IMI on behaviors and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rat offspring. Dams were exposed to IMI via diet (83, 250, or 750 ppm in diet) from gestational day 6 until day 21 post-delivery on weaning, and offspring were maintained until adulthood on postnatal day 77. In the neurogenic niche, 750-ppm IMI decreased numbers of late-stage neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and post-mitotic immature granule cells by suppressing NPC proliferation and ERK1/2-FOS-mediated synaptic plasticity of granule cells on weaning. Suppressed reelin signaling might be responsible for the observed reductions of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In adulthood, IMI at >= 250 ppm decreased neural stem cells by suppressing their proliferation and increasing apoptosis, and mature granule cells were reduced due to suppressed NPC differentiation. Behavioral tests revealed increased spontaneous activity in adulthood at 750 ppm. IMI decreased hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity and Chrnb2 transcript levels in the DG on weaning and in adulthood. IMI increased numbers of astrocytes and M1-type microglia in the DG hilus, and upregulated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress-related genes on weaning. In adulthood, IMI increased malondialdehyde level and number of M1-type microglia, and downregulated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress-related genes. These results suggest that IMI persistently affected cholinergic signaling, induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress during exposure, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress after exposure in the hippocampus, causing hyperactivity and progressive suppression of neurogenesis in adulthood. The no- observed-adverse-effect level of IMI for offspring behaviors and hippocampal neurogenesis was determined to be 83 ppm (5.5-14.1 mg/kg body weight/day).

AB  - Embryonic development and cell specification have been viewed as an epigenetically rigid process. Through accumulation of irreversible epigenetic marks, the differentiation process has been considered unidirectional, and once completed cell specification would be permanent and stable. However, somatic cell nuclear transfer that involved the implantation of a somatic nucleus into a previously enucleated oocyte accomplished in amphibians in the 1950s and in mammals in the late 1990s-resulting in the birth of "Dolly the sheep"-clearly showed that "terminal" differentiation is reversible. In parallel, work on lineage-determining factors like MyoD revealed surprising potential to modulate lineage identity in somatic cells. This work culminated in the discovery that a set of four defined factors can reprogram fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which were shown to be molecularly and functionally equivalent to blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells, thus essentially showing that defined factors can induce authentic reprogramming without the need of oocytes. This concept was further extended when it was shown that fibroblasts can be directly converted into neurons, showing induced lineage conversion is possible even between cells representing two different germ layers. These findings suggest that "everything is possible" (i.e., once key lineage reprogramming factors are identified, cells should be able to convert into any desired lineage).

AB  - All tissues in the body are subjected externally to gravity and internally by collagen fibril and cellular retractive forces that create stress and energy equilibrium required for homeostasis. Mechanotransduction involves mechanical work (force through a distance) and energy storage as kinetic and potential energy. This leads to changes in cell mitosis or apoptosis and the synthesis or loss of tissue components. It involves the application of energy directly to cells through integrin-mediated processes, cell-cell connections, stretching of the cell cytoplasm, and activation of the cell nucleus via yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-motif (TAZ). These processes involve numerous complexes, intermediate molecules, and multiple pathways. Several pathways have been identified from research studies on vertebrate cell culture and from studies in invertebrates. These pathways involve mechanosensors and other molecules that activate the pathways. This review discusses the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, Hippo, Hedgehog, and Wingless-related integration site (WNT)/beta catenin signaling pathways. The mediators covered include beta catenin, ion channels, growth factors, hormone receptors, members of the Ras superfamily, and components of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. However, the interrelationship among the different pathways remains to be clarified. Integrin-mediated mechanotransduction involves direct tensile loading and energy applied to the cell membrane via collagen fibril stretching. This energy is transferred between cells by stretching the cell-cell connections involving cadherins and the WNT/beta catenin pathway. These alterations induce changes in intracellular events in the cytoskeleton and nuclear skeleton caused by the release of YAP and TAZ. These coactivators then penetrate through the nuclear pores and influence nuclear cell function. Alteration in the balance of forces and energy applied to cells and tissues is hypothesized to shift the cell-extracellular matrix mechanical equilibrium by modifying mechanotransduction. The shift in equilibrium can lead to either tissue synthesis, genetic modifications, or promote fibrotic diseases, including epithelial cell-derived cancers, depending on the local metabolic conditions.

AB  - The ovine critical-sized defect model provides a robust preclinical model for testing tissue-engineered constructs for use in the treatment of non-union bone fractures and severe trauma. A critical question in cell-based therapies is understanding the optimal therapeutic cell dose. Key to defining the dose and ensuring successful outcomes is understanding the fate of implanted cells, e.g., viability, bio-distribution and exogenous infiltration post-implantation. This study evaluates such parameters in an ovine critical-sized defect model 2 and 7 days post-implantation. The fate of cell dose and behaviour post-implantation when combined with nanomedicine approaches for multi-model tracking and remote control using external magnetic fields is also addressed. Autologous STRO-4 selected mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were labelled with a fluorescent lipophilic dye (CM-Dil), functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and delivered to the site within a naturally derived bone extracellular matrix (ECM) gel. Encapsulated cells were implanted within a critical-sized defect in an ovine medial femoral condyle and exposed to dynamic gradients of external magnetic fields for 1 h per day. Sheep were sacrificed at 2 and 7 days post-initial surgery where ECM was harvested. STRO-4-positive (STRO-4+) stromal cells expressed osteocalcin and survived within the harvested gels at day 2 and day 7 with a 50% loss at day 2 and a further 45% loss at 7 days. CD45-positive leucocytes were also observed in addition to endogenous stromal cells. No elevation in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) or non-haem iron levels was observed following implantation in groups containing MNPs with or without magnetic field gradients. The current study demonstrates how numbers of therapeutic cells reduce substantially after implantation in the repair site. Cell death is accompanied by enhanced leucocyte invasion, but not by inflammatory blood marker levels. Crucially, a proportion of implanted STRO-4+ stromal cells expressed osteocalcin, which is indicative of osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, MNP labelling did not alter cell number or result in a further deleterious impact on stromal cells following implantation.

AB  - Simple Summary Oleander (Nerium oleander) poisoning is diagnosed postmortem based on gross and microscopic changes in the heart combined with the identification of oleandrin in samples from the affected animals. Several studies in multiple mammalian species have identified microscopic lesions in the kidneys as well, although this has only been briefly mentioned in horses. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed several cases of spontaneous oleander poisoning in horses, described gross and microscopic lesions in the kidneys, and assessed the prevalence of such microscopic lesions compared with other causes of death in order to determine if they can be used as a diagnostic marker of oleander poisoning in horses. Microscopic kidney lesions were detected in horses with oleander poisoning and were similar to the changes documented in other mammalian species, although the frequency and severity were generally lower. Similar renal changes could be detected in horses that died spontaneously due to other causes or that were euthanized. We concluded that microscopic kidney lesions occur in horses with oleander poisoning, but these are not a specific diagnostic marker to differentiate it from other disease processes. A presumptive postmortem diagnosis of oleander (Nerium oleander) poisoning is made based on the histological observation of cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis, which is considered to be a reliable diagnostic marker, and can be confirmed via the detection of oleandrin in tissues or fluids. However, cardiac lesions may not be present in every case, and autolysis can often preclude the identification of subtle changes in the cardiomyocytes. Several studies of experimental oleander poisoning have noted the presence of renal lesions in multiple mammalian species, and case studies of accidental exposure have found similar, although more variably severe, renal abnormalities. Kidney pathology in horses with oleander poisoning has been only briefly mentioned. In this study, we reviewed 21 cases of spontaneous oleander poisoning in horses, evaluated the kidneys microscopically, and compared the renal microscopic lesions with those detected in 10 horses that died or were euthanized due to other causes to assess if histological renal changes could serve as an additional diagnostic marker for oleander poisoning in horses. We found that microscopic renal lesions, principally mild to moderate tubular changes such as hyaline cast formation, neutrophilic casts, epithelial attenuation and necrosis, as well as mineralization and congestion, occur in horses with oleander poisoning. Most of these changes match the descriptions of lesions previously noted in other species, although with less frequency and severity. Similar lesions were found in horses that died spontaneously due to different causes or were euthanized. We concluded that microscopic renal lesions may be detected in horses with oleander poisoning but they cannot be used as a diagnostic marker that allows differentiation from other disease processes or causes of death.

AB  - The experience-dependent spatial cognitive process requires sequential organization of hippocampal neural activities by theta rhythm, which develops to represent highly compressed information for rapid learning. However, how the theta sequences were developed in a finer timescale within theta cycles remains unclear. In this study, we found in rats that sweep-ahead structure of theta sequences developing with exploration was predominantly dependent on a relatively large proportion of FG-cells, that is a subset of place cells dominantly phase-locked to fast gamma rhythms. These ensembles integrated compressed spatial information by cells consistently firing at precessing slow gamma phases within the theta cycle. Accordingly, the sweep-ahead structure of FG-cell sequences was positively correlated with the intensity of slow gamma phase precession, in particular during early development of theta sequences. These findings highlight the dynamic network modulation by fast and slow gamma in the development of theta sequences which may further facilitate memory encoding and retrieval.

AB  - The topological cues of fibrous scaffolds (in particular extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic nanofibers) have already proven to be a powerful tool for influencing neuronal morphology and behavior. Remote photothermal optical treatment provides additional opportunities for neuronal activity regulation. A combination of these approaches can provide "smart" 3D scaffolds for efficient axon guidance and neurite growth. In this study we propose two alternative approaches for obtaining biocompatible photothermal scaffolds: surface coating of nylon nanofibers with light-to-heat converting nanoparticles and nanoparticle incorporation inside the fibers. We have determined photoconversion efficiency of fibrous nanomaterials under near infrared (NIR) irradiation, as well as biocompatible photothermal treatment parameters. We also measured photo-induced intracellular heating upon contact of cells with a plasmonic surface. In the absence of NIR stimulation, our fibrous scaffolds with a fiber diameter of 100 nm induced an increase in the proportion of beta 3-tubulin positive cells, while thermal stimulation of neuroblastoma cells on nanoparticles-decorated scaffolds enhanced neurite outgrowth and promoted neuronal maturation. We demonstrate that contact guidance decorated fibers can stimulate directional growth of processes of differentiated neural cells. We studied the impact of nanoparticles on the surface of ECM-mimetic scaffolds on neurite elongation and axonal branching of rat hippocampal neurons, both as topographic cues and as local heat sources. We show that decorating the surface of nanofibers with nanoparticles does not affect the orientation of neurites, but leads to strong branching, an increase in the number of neurites per cell, and neurite elongation, which is independent of NIR stimulation. The effect of photothermal stimulation is most pronounced when cultivating neurons on nanofibers with incorporated nanoparticles, as compared to nanoparticle-coated fibers. The resulting light-to-heat converting 3D materials can be used as tools for controlled photothermal neuromodulation and as "smart" materials for reconstructive neurosurgery.

AB  - The global burden of stroke has increased in the past several decades, and post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a common complication. Contrasted with the advancement in knowledge of stroke pathophysiology, the exact pathogenesis of PSE is unclear. Various animal stroke models have been utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PSE, but the success rate of PSE induction is low. To address this limitation, a novel PSE model was established in the rat by inducing status epilepticus using lithium-pilocarpine one week after photothrombotic stroke. Successful indication of status epilepticus and mortality rate at three days after status epilepticus were the main measurements. Potential usefulness of this model was also illustrated by preliminary results on locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, and anxiety level evaluated using the openfield test, as well as mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the hippocampal dentate granule cells using Zinc transporter 3 immunofluorescence staining at 8 weeks after PSE induction. This novel composite method of PSE induction may facilitate future studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of PSE.

AB  - Heat stress has multiple potential effects on the brain, such as neuroinflammation, neurogenesis defects, and cognitive impairment. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) has been demonstrated to play neuroprotective roles in various models of neurological diseases. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of BHBA in alleviating heat stress-induced impairments of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Mice were exposed to 43 celcius for 15 min for 14 days after administration with saline, BHBA, or minocycline. Here, we showed for the first time that BHBA normalized memory ability in the heat stress-treated mice and attenuated heat stress-impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Consistently, BHBA noticeably improved the synaptic plasticity in the heat stress-treated hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the decrease of synapse-associated proteins and the density of dendritic spines. Moreover, BHBA inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-3 by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the heat stress-treated hippocampus by activating the protein kinase B (Akt)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) pathways. These findings indicate that BHBA is a potential agent for improving cognitive functions in heat stress-treated mice. The action may be mediated by ER stress, and Akt-CREB-BDNF and MeCP2 pathways to improve adult hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MR) contain populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that regulate diverse behavioral functions. However, their whole-brain input-output circuits remain incompletely elucidated. We used viral tracing combined with fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography to generate a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of inputs and outputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DR and MR. We found that these neurons received inputs from similar upstream brain regions. The glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus had divergent projection patterns with differences in critical brain regions. Specifically, MR glutamatergic neurons projected to the lateral habenula through multiple pathways. Correlation and cluster analysis revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus received heterogeneous inputs and sent different collateral projections. This connectivity atlas further elucidates the anatomical architecture of the raphe nuclei, which could facilitate better understanding of their behavioral functions.

AB  - Brain aging is characterized by dysfunctional autophagy and cellular senescence, among other features. While autophagy can either promote or suppress cellular senescence in proliferating cells, in postmitotic cells, such as neurons, autophagy impairment promotes cellular senescence. CRM1 (exportin-1/XPO1) exports hundreds of nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm, including the transcription factors TFEB (the main inducer of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis genes) and STAT3, another autophagy modulator. It appears that CRM1 is a modulator of aging-associated senescence and autophagy, because pharmacological inhibition of CRM1 improved autophagic degradation in flies, by increasing nuclear TFEB levels, and because enhanced CRM1 activity is mechanistically linked to senescence in fibroblasts from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients and old healthy individuals; furthermore, the exogenous overexpression of CRM1 induced senescence in normal fibroblasts. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that impaired autophagic flux during brain aging occurs due to CRM1 accumulation in the brain. We found that CRM1 levels and activity increased in the hippocampus and cortex during physiological aging, which resulted in a decrease of nuclear TFEB and STAT3. Consistent with an autophagic flux impairment, we observed accumulation of the autophagic receptor p62/SQSTM1 in neurons of old mice, which correlated with increased neuronal senescence. Using an in vitro model of neuronal senescence, we demonstrate that CRM1 inhibition improved autophagy flux and reduced SA-beta-gal activity by restoring TFEB nuclear localization. Collectively, our data suggest that enhanced CRM1-mediated export of proteins during brain aging perturbs neuronal homeostasis, contributing to autophagy impairment, and neuronal senescence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's memory, motor functions, behaviour, and thought process. It has been observed that the hippocampus is the first region that gets affected by Alzheimer's. Hence, a study of the hippocampus region can identify genes responsible for the occurrence of the early stage of the disease. Most often, t-test and correlation are used to identify significant genes at the initial level. As the genes are differentially expressed, their classification power is generally high. These genes might appear significant, but their degree of specificity towards the disease might be low, leading to misleading interpretations. Similarly, there may be many false correlations between the genes that can affect the identification of relevant genes. This paper introduces a new framework to reduce the false correlations and find the potential biomarkers for the disease. The framework concerned uses the t-test, correlation, Gene Ontology (GO) categories, and machine learning techniques to find potential genes. The proposed framework detects Alzheimer-related genes and achieves more than 95% classification accuracy in every dataset considered. Some of the identified genes which are directly involved in Alzheimer are APP, GRIN2B, and APLP2. The proposed framework also identifies genes like ZNF621, RTF1, DCH1, and ERBB4, which may play an important role in Alzheimer's. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is also carried out to determine the major GO categories: down-regulated and up-regulated.

AB  - Superficial thrombophlebitis is one of the most significant complications of superficial vein thrombosis. Rapid imaging and mapping with high resolution is particularly important for accurate diagnosis so as to carry out treatment as soon as possible. Ultrasound imaging technology has been used extensively because of the low-cost, minimal invasiveness, and convenient application in clinical practice. And the ultrasonic couplant is an essential component in ultrasound examination. However, when imaging superficial structures, traditional liquid ultrasonic couplants often produce inadequate results. In this study, we investigate whether a hydrogel membrane can be used to improve the imaging of superficial vessels. To this end, we generated a polyacrylamide-bacterial nanocellulose hydrogel membrane (PAM-BC) that efficiently forms at 60 degrees C in only 10 min by redox polymerization. With PAM-BC-2.5, it was possible to acquire high resolution intravascular ultrasound images to assess superficial vessels in humans and the superficial vasculature in rats and miniature pigs using various brands of ultrasound instruments. The PAM-BCs represent a new, solid ultrasonic membrane which is suitable for diagnosing disease in superficial vessels.

AB  - The prevalence of depression is increasing, and geriatric depression, in particular, is difficult to recognize and treat. Depression in older adults is often accompanied by neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation affects the brain's physiological and immune functions through several pathways and induces depressive symptoms. This study investigated the relationship among depression, neuroinflammation, and fish oil supplementation. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in an aging-related depression animal model to simulate geriatric depression. Cognitive function, depressive-like symptoms, peripheral nervous system and CNS inflammation status, and the tryptophan-related metabolic pathway were analyzed. The geriatric depression animal model was associated with depressive-like behaviors and cognitive impairment. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier was compromised, resulting in increased expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and the glial fibrillary acidic protein in the brain, indicating increased neuroinflammation. Tryptophan metabolism was also negatively affected. The geriatric-depressive-like rats had high levels of neurotoxic 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and kynurenine in their hippocampus. Fish oil intake improved depressive-like symptoms and cognitive impairment, reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, activated the brain's glial cells, and increased the interleukin-10 level in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, fish oil intervention could ameliorate abnormal neurobehaviors and neuroinflammation and elevate the serotonin level in the hippocampus.

AB  - Impaired insulin signaling in brain regions such as the hippocampus is thought to contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. We have previously demonstrated a number of adverse effects in rats with hippocampal-specific insulin resistance, including hippocampal structural defects, impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, neuroplasticity deficits, behavioral despair, and anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, we showed that hippocampal-specific insulin resistance decreased the serine phosphorylation of GluA1 and expression of GluN2B. These effects on postsynaptic glutamate receptors were particularly fascinating, due to the proposed theory of the glutamatergic system as a facilitator of hippocampal synaptic transmission. However, the synaptic effects of hippocampal-specific insulin resistance with regard to glutamate neurotransmission had yet to be elucidated. To address this question, we examined hippocampal glutamate neurochemistry and expression of glutamatergic synaptic proteins in rats with hippocampal-specific insulin resistance. We also examined the ability of intranasal insulin to impact glutamatergic synapses. We found decreased synaptic concentrations of glutamate in the hippocampus, likely a result of reduced hippocampal vGluT2 expression. Additionally, hippocampal glutamate efflux was significantly increased in rats with hippocampal-specific insulin resistance in response to a high (12 U), but not a low (0.072 U), dose of intranasal insulin. Our findings indicate that hippocampal-specific insulin resistance elicits synaptic plasticity deficits in glutamatergic synapses, which may be overcome by intranasal insulin administration.image

AB  - General anesthetics may accelerate the neuropathological changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), of which amyloid beta (A beta)-induced toxicity is one of the main causes. However, the interaction of general anesthetics with different A beta-isoforms remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of sevoflurane (0.4 and 1.2 maximal alveolar concentration (MAC)) on four A beta species-induced changes on dendritic spine density (DSD) in hippocampal brain slices of Thy1-eGFP mice and multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10 (MEGF10)-related astrocyte-mediated synaptic engulfment in hippocampal brain slices of C57BL/6 mice. We found that both sevoflurane and A beta downregulated CA1-dendritic spines. Moreover, compared with either sevoflurane or A beta alone, pre-treatment with A beta isoforms followed by sevoflurane application in general further enhanced spine loss. This enhancement was related to MEGF10-related astrocyte-dependent synaptic engulfment, only in A beta pE3 + 1.2 MAC sevoflurane and 3NTyrA beta + 1.2 MAC sevoflurane condition. In addition, removal of sevoflurane alleviated spine loss in A beta + sevoflurane. In summary, these results suggest that both synapses and astrocytes are sensitive targets for sevoflurane; in the presence of 3NTyrA beta, 1.2 MAC sevoflurane alleviated astrocyte-mediated synaptic engulfment and exerted a lasting effect on dendritic spine remodeling.

AB  - Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside enriched in the tissues of many edible plants, including seeds of stone fruits such as cherry (Prunus avium), peach (Prunus persica), and apple (Malus domestica). These plants bio-synthesize amygdalin in defense against herbivore animals, as amygdalin generates poisonous cyanide upon plant tissue destruction.1-4 Poisonous to many animals, amygdalin-derived cyanide is detoxified by potent enzymes commonly found in bacteria and plants but not most animals.5 Here we show that the nematode C. elegans can detoxify amygdalin by a genetic pathway comprising cysl-1, egl-9, hif-1, and cysl-2. A screen of a natural product library for hypoxia-independent regulators of HIF-1 identifies amygdalin as a potent acti-vator of cysl-2, a HIF-1 transcriptional target that encodes a cyanide detoxification enzyme in C. elegans. As a cysl-2 paralog similarly essential for amygdalin resistance, cysl-1 encodes a protein homologous to cysteine biosynthetic enzymes in bacteria and plants but functionally co-opted in C. elegans. We identify exclusively HIF-activating egl-9 mutations in a cysl-1 suppressor screen and show that cysl-1 confers amygdalin resis-tance by regulating HIF-1-dependent cysl-2 transcription to protect against amygdalin toxicity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that cysl-1 and cysl-2 were likely acquired from green algae through horizontal gene trans-fer (HGT) and functionally co-opted in protection against amygdalin. Since acquisition, these two genes evolved division of labor in a cellular circuit to detect and detoxify cyanide. Thus, algae-to-nematode HGT and subsequent gene function co-option events may facilitate host survival and adaptation to adverse envi-ronmental stresses and biogenic toxins.

AB  - Dysregulation in the stress-response system as a result of genetical mutation can provoke the manifestation of affective disorders under stress conditions. Mutations in the human DISC1 gene is one of the main risk factors of affective disorders. It was known that DISC1 regulates a large number of proteins including BMAL1, which is involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid synthesis in the adrenal glands and the sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptor target genes. Male mice with a point mutation Q31L in the Disc1 gene were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), after which the behavioral and physiological stress response assessed. To assess whether there were any changes in BMAL1 in key brain regions involved in the stress response, immunohistochemistry was applied. It was shown that the Q31L mice had an aberrant behavioral response, especially to the 2 weeks of CUS, which was expressed in unchanged motor activity, increased time of social interaction, and alterations in anxiety and fear-related behavior. Q31L males did not show an increase in blood corticosterone levels after CUS and a decrease in body weight. Immunohistochemical analysis in intact Q31L mice revealed a decrease in BMAL1 immunofluorescence in the CA1 hippocampal area and lateral habenula. Thus, the Q31L mutation of the Disc1 gene disrupts behavioral and physiological stress response and the BMAL1 dysregulation may underlie it, so this protein can act as a molecular target for the treatment of affective disorders.

AB  - Raffinose synthetase (RS) is a key enzyme in the process of raffinose (Raf) synthesis and is involved in plant development and stress responses through regulating Raf content. As a sweetener, Raf makes an important contribution to the sweet taste of white tea. However, studies on the identification, analysis and transcriptional regulation of CsRSs (Camellia sinensis RS genes) are still lacking. In this study, nine CsRSs were identified from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) genome database. The CsRSs were classified into five groups in the phylogenetic tree. Expression level analysis showed that the CsRSs varied in different parts of the tea plant. Transcriptome data showed that CsRSs could respond to persistent drought and cold acclimation. Except for CsRS5 and CsRS9, the expression pattern of all CsRSs increased at 12 h and decreased at 30 h during the withering process of white tea, consistent with the change trend of the Raf content. Furthermore, combining yeast one-hybrid assays with expression analysis, we found that CsDBB could potentially regulate the expression of CsRS8. Our results provide a new perspective for further research into the characterization of CsRS genes and the formation of the white tea flavour.

AB  - The high level of progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol ratio (P4/E2) in follicular fluid has been considered as a biomarker of follicular atresia. CYP11A1, the crucial gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for steroid hormone synthesis, has been reported differently expressed in the ovary during follicular atresia. However, the regulation mechanism of CYP11A1 expression during follicular atresia still remains unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that lnc2300, a novel pig ovary-specific highly expressed cis-acting long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from chromosome 7, has the ability to induce the expression of CYP11A1 and inhibit the apoptosis of porcine granulosa cells (GCs). Mechanistically, lnc2300, mainly located in the cytoplasm of porcine GCs, sponges and suppresses the expression of miR-365-3p through acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), which further relieves the inhibitory effects of miR-365-3p on the expression of CYP11A1. Besides, CYP11A1 is validated as a direct functional target of miR-365-3p in porcine GCs. Functionally, lnc2300 is an antiapoptotic lncRNA that reduces porcine GC apoptosis by inhibiting the proapoptotic function of miR-365-3p. In summary, our findings reveal a cis-acting regulation mechanism of CYP11A1 through lncRNA, and define a novel signaling pathway, lnc2300/miR-365-3p/CYP11A1 axis, which is involved in the regulation of GC apoptosis and follicular atresia.

AB  - Recovered from Quaternary deposits in Carneiro Cave (Serra da Mesa, Brazil), associated with a clayey-sandy sedimentary influx older than the overlying calcite layer, which has been dated to 182.8 +/- 1.2 ka, a new extinct species of Rhinophylla is described based on a proximal radio fragment. This discovery represents one of the three oldest occurrences of Chiroptera in the exposed stratigraphic profile. The fossil record of Chiroptera consists of 1,117 bone fragments, distributed across Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary packages. The chronology of this sedimentary sequence is established using dated layers, all of which are fully consistent with their order of deposition. A comparative study of the radioulnar morphology was conducted to determine the taxonomic identity of the new fossil bat. A strict consensus tree for phyllostomids was obtained, surprisingly consistent with recent molecular phylogenies, unequivocally places the new fossil in the subfamily Rhinophyllinae. Biogeographic modelling of Rhinophylla, typically characterised by an ecomorphology of small specialised epiphytic frugivores, suggests that around 200 ka (the fossil's age reference) the genus may have had a broader distribution across Central Brazil than is observed today. This is consistent with the fact that Rhinophylla is currently absent in the surrounding region of the Carneiro Cave.

AB  - Recent studies from the field of interoception have highlighted the link between bodily and neural rhythms during action, perception, and cognition. The mechanisms underlying functional body-brain coupling, however, are poorly understood, as are the ways in which they modulate behavior. We acquired respiration and human magnetoencephalography data from a near-threshold spatial detection task to investigate the trivariate relationship between respiration, neural excitability, and performance. Respiration was found to significantly modulate perceptual sensitivity as well as posterior alpha power (8-13 Hz), a well-established proxy of cortical excitability. In turn, alpha suppression prior to detected versus undetected targets underscored the behavioral benefits of heightened excitability. Notably, respiration-locked excitability changes were maximized at a respiration phase lag of around -30 degrees and thus temporally preceded performance changes. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results suggest that respiration actively aligns sampling of sensory information with transient cycles of heightened excitability to facilitate performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine infection with Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) causes immunosuppression, which is easy to cause concurrent or secondary infection, making the disease complicated and difficult to treat, and causing huge economic losses to the pig industry. Total polysaccharide from the rhizoma of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (PAMK) is outstanding in enhancing non-specific immunity and cellular immunity, and effectively improving the body's disease resistance, indicating its potential role in antiviral immunotherapy. RESULTS: PAMK had the characteristics of compact, polyporous and agglomerated morphology, but does not have triple helix conformation. PCV2 infection led to the increase in LC3-II, degradation of p62 and the increase of viral Cap protein expression and viral copy number. PAMK treatment significantly alleviated PCV2-induced autophagy and inhibited PCV2 replication. Moreover, PAMK treatment significantly attenuated the increase of PINK1 protein expression and the decrease of TOMM20 protein expression caused by PCV2 infection, alleviated Parkin recruitment from cytoplasm to mitochondria and intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, restored mitochondrial membrane charge, alleviated viral Cap protein expression. CONCLUSION: PAMK alleviates PCV2-induced mitophagy to suppress PCV2 replication by inhibiting the Pink 1/Parkin pathway. These findings may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of PCV2. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Comorbidity exists between metabolic disorders and depressive syndrome with unclear mechanisms. To characterize the causal relationship, we adopted a 12-week high-fat diet (HFD) to induce metabolic disorder and depressive phenotypes in mice. Initially, we identified an enhanced glutamatergic input in the nucleus accumbens of HFD mice. Retrograde tracing and chemogenetic inhibition showed that the hyperactive ventral hippocampal glutamatergic afferents to the nucleus accumbens determined the exhibition of depression-like behavior in HFD mice. Using lentiviral knockdown and overexpression approaches, we proved that HFD-induced downregulation of glial glutamate transporters, GLAST and GLT-1, contributed to the observed circuit maladaptations and subsequent depression-like behaviors. Finally, we identified a potential therapeutic agent, riluzole, which could mitigate the HFD-induced behavioral deficits by normalizing the expressions of GLAST and GLT-1 and ventral hippocampal glutamatergic afferents to the nucleus accumbens. Overall, astrocyte-mediated disturbance in glutamatergic transmission underlies the metabolic disorder-related depressive syndrome and represents a therapeutic target for this subtype of depressive mood disorders.

AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri is a probiotic with bacteriostatic effects, which can effectively inhibit the activity of pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of pathogens by L. reuteri in intestinal cells remains unclear. Using the porcine intestinal cell line IPEC-J2 as a model, we combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq methods to delineate the porcine genome-wide changes in biological processes and chromatin accessibility in IPEC-J2 cells stimulated by Salmonella enterica BNCC186354, as well as L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Overall, we found that many porcine transcripts were altered after S. enterica BNCC186354 treatment, while L. reuteri ATCC 53608 treatment partially restored this alteration, such as salmonella infection and PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Combined analysis of these two datasets revealed that 26 genes with similar trends overlapped between gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In addition, we identified potential host functional transcription factors (TFs), such as GATA1, TAL1, TBP, RUNX1, Gmeb1, Gfi1b, RARA, and RXRG, in IPEC-J2 cells that might play a critical role and are targeted by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. Moreover, we verified that PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and apoptosis pathways are potentially regulated by S. enterica BNCC186354 but restored by L. reuteri ATCC 53608. The PI3K/AKT pathway was activated by L. reuteri ATCC 53608, thereby potentially inhibiting S. enterica BNCC186354 infection. In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the expression pattern of functional genes and the epigenetic alterations in IPEC-J2 cells underlying the bacteriostatic action of L. reuteri ATCC 53608.

AB  - Tomato plants are attacked by a variety of herbivore pests and among them, the leafminer Tuta absoluta, which is currently a major threat to global tomato production. Although the commercial tomato is susceptible to T. absoluta attacks, a better understanding of the defensive plant responses to this pest will help in defining plant resistance traits and broaden the range of agronomic levers that can be used for an effective integrated pest management strategy over the crop cycle. In this study, we developed an integrative approach combining untargeted metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to characterize the local and systemic metabolic responses of young tomato plants to T. absoluta larvae herbivory. From metabolomic analyses, the tomato response appeared to be both local and systemic, with a local response in infested leaves being much more intense than in other parts of the plant. The main response was a massive accumulation of phenolamides with great structural diversity, including rare derivatives composed of spermine and dihydrocinnamic acids. The accumulation of this family of specialized metabolites was supported by transcriptomic data, which showed induction of both phenylpropanoid and polyamine precursor pathways. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identified two genes strongly induced by T. absoluta herbivory, that we functionally characterized as putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl transferases. They catalyze the biosynthesis of several phenolamides, among which is caffeoylputrescine. Overall, this study provided new mechanistic clues of the tomato/ T. absoluta interaction.

AB  - Simple Summary The study was conducted to explore effects of xylose with different polymerizations on growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbial composition in weaned piglets. Results showed that dietary supplementation of 1% xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) or 1% arabinoxylan (AX) reduced diarrhea incidence of piglets compared with the control group (CON) but increased intestinal villus height, antioxidase activity, and sIgA contents (p < 0.05). With in vitro fermentation assay, XOS showed a sharper reduction of the pH curve than AX (p < 0.05). XOS increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the ileal digesta (p < 0.05), while AX increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium in the colonic digesta (p < 0.05). In conclusion, both XOS and AX improved the intestinal barrier function and reduced the diarrhea incidence of weaned piglets, and the XOS showed a faster microbial fermentation than the AX due to a lower polymerization and molecular mass. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of xylose with different polymerizations on growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbial composition in weaned piglets. A total of 144 weaned piglets were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design according to their body weight and sex. Dietary treatments included a corn-soybean meal basal diet (CON) and 2 additional diets formulated with 1% arabinoxylan (AX) and 1% xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of XOS or AX reduced diarrhea incidence of weaned piglets compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). XOS or AX increased the ileal villus height and intestinal activity of antioxidases in weaned piglets compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). XOS or AX reduced the ileal and colonic IL-6 content and increased the colonic sIgA and IL-10 concentrations in weaned piglets compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). XOS or AX increased the total organic acids concentrations in the ileum and in vitro fermentation (p < 0.05). XOS increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the ileal digesta (p < 0.05), while AX increased the population of Lactobacillus in the ileal digesta and the abundance of Bifidobacterium in the colonic digesta of weaned piglets (p < 0.05). In conclusion, both XOS and AX reduce diarrhea incidence and improve antioxidant capacity, immune function, and populations of beneficial bacteria, while microbial fermentation of XOS with a lower polymerization and molecular mass can produce more organic acids and an increased abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the upper gut of weaned pigs compared with AX.

AB  - Diaveridine (DVD) has widespread use in food animals due to its antibacterial synergistic effects. This study revealed the metabolism, excretion, and tissue elimination of DVD in swine, chickens, and rats following oral gavage of 10 mg/kg b.w. tritium-labeled DVD using radioactive tracing coupled with liquid chromatography-electron spray ionization-ion trap-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-IT-TOF/MS). The metabolic pathways involved demethylation, alpha-hydroxylation, glucuronidation, and sulfonylation and produced four metabolites in swine (M0, DVD; M1, 3'/4 '-demethyl-DVD; M2, 3'/4 '-demethyl-DVD-O- glucuronide; M4, 2/4-glucuronidated-DVD) and five in chickens (M0 similar to M2; M3, alpha-hydroxy-DVD; M4) and rats (M0 similar to M3; M5, 3'/ 4 '-demethyl-DVD-O-sulfation). M0 was dominant in the excreta of chicken and female and male rats, while M2 was mainly excreted in swine. Among the three species studied, M0 was the most persistent in the kidneys (t1/2 3.15-3.89 d); therefore, M0 kidney levels are residue monitoring targets. This study enabled a thorough comprehension of the metabolism and pharmacokinetic characteristics of DVD in animals.

AB  - Heart failure is a major side effect of doxorubicin (DOX) treatment in patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of DOX-induced heart failure need to be addressed. This study aims to test whether the serine/threonine kinase MST1, a major Hippo pathway component, contributes to the development of DOX-induced myocardial injury. C57BL/6J WT mice and mice with cardiomyocyte-specific dominant-negative MST1 (kinase-dead) overexpression received three weekly injections of DOX, reaching a final cumulative dose of 18 mg/kg. Echocardiographic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed six weeks after the first DOX administration. The effects of MST1 inhibition on DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury were also tested in vitro. MST1 signaling was significantly activated in cardiomyocytes in response to DOX treatment in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type (WT) mice treated with DOX developed cardiac dysfunction and mitochondrial abnormalities. However, these detrimental effects were abolished in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of dominant-negative MST1 (DN-MST1) or treated with XMU-MP-1, a specific MST1 inhibitor, indicating that MST1 inhibition attenuates DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction. DOX treatment led to a significant downregulation of cardiac levels of SIRT3, a deacetylase involved in mitochondrial protection, in WT mice, which was rescued by MST1 inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT3 blunted the protective effects of MST1 inhibition, indicating that SIRT3 downregulation mediates the cytotoxic effects of MST1 activation in response to DOX treatment. Finally, we found a significant upregulation of MST1 and downregulation of SIRT3 levels in human myocardial tissue of cancer patients treated with DOX. In summary, MST1 contributes to DOX-induced cardiomyopathy through SIRT3 downregulation.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of providing Cu and Zn minerals with an organic structure reduced by 25% compared to the recommended (NRC) inorganic value on parameters such as the age at which lambs achieve 50% sperm motility yield, some developmental parameters, testis histology, as well as serum, wool, and fecal mineral levels in lambs. The study involved 12 male lambs in the T1 group (organic minerals) and 11 in the T2 group (inorganic minerals) of the Kivircik breed. Lambs received minerals from mothers during the last month of fetal period and suckling, continuing individual feeding post-weaning. During individual feeding, T1 received 5.25 mg/kg DM copper-chelate and 15.0 mg/kg DM zinc-chelate, while T2 received 7 mg/kg DM copper-sulfate and 20 mg/kg DM zinc-sulfate. The mothers received identical mineral amounts in the last month of pregnancy and lactation. The ewes birthed offspring solely for the supply of experimental groups. Lambs, averaging about 18.5 kg, underwent bi-weekly electroejaculation, concluding the trial for those with 50% semen motility. Statistical analyses were carried out using the GLM method. No differences were observed between groups in the average age at which lambs achieve 50% sperm motility, live weight, scrotum, and testicular measurements at this age (P > 0.05). Histological analyses revealed no difference in tubule area between T1 and T2 groups (P > 0.05), but tubular epithelium height was greater in T1 (P < 0.01). End-of-trial serum copper, as well as weaning day and end-of-trial serum and fleece zinc mean values, did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). However, T1 had higher mean values for serum Cu on the weaning day (P < 0.01), fleece copper on the weaning day (P < 0.05) and at the end of the trial (P < 0.001). Additionally, the T1 group exhibited lower mean levels of fecal copper (P < 0.05) and fecal zinc (P < 0.001). In conclusion, despite organic copper and zinc levels being 25% lower in the examined parameters, comparable or improved results were achieved with inorganic copper and zinc.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of puerarin supplementation on the growth performance and intestinal function of piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88, which provided a theoretical basis for its practical application as a new feed additive. Dietary supplementation with 5 mg/kg puerarin alleviated intestinal injury and improved the intestinal function of piglets challenged with ETEC K88 by increasing the number of Bifidobacterium in the colon and Lactobacillus in the jejunum, cecum and colon; decreasing the number of Escherichia coli in the jejunum and cecum; reducing the hydrogen peroxide content in the jejunum and myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and ileum; and increasing the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase in the jejunum and ileum. These results provide important insights into the development of an effective treatment for ETEC K88 infection and other enteric diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of puerarin supplementation on the growth performance and intestinal function of piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88. Twenty-four ternary crossbred piglets were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: control group, ETEC group (challenged with ETEC K88 on day 8), and ETEC + Puerarin group (supplemented with 5 mg/kg puerarin and challenged with ETEC K88 on day 8). All piglets were orally administered D-xylose (0.1 g/kg body weight) on day 10, and blood samples were collected after 1 h. Subsequently, piglets were killed and intestinal samples were collected for further analysis. The results showed that puerarin supplementation significantly decreased the adverse effects of ETEC K88-challenged piglets; significantly improved growth performance; increased the number of Bifidobacterium in the colon and Lactobacillus in the jejunum, cecum and colon; decreased the number of Escherichia coli in the jejunum and cecum; reduced the hydrogen peroxide content in the jejunum and myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and ileum; and increased the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase in the jejunum and ileum. In addition, puerarin supplementation alleviated ETEC K88-induced intestinal injury in piglets, significantly downregulated the mRNA level of Interleukin-1 & beta; and upregulated the mRNA levels of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, myxovirus resistance protein 1, myxovirus resistance protein 2, and guanylate-binding protein-1 in the small intestine of piglets. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with puerarin could attenuate ETEC K88-induced intestinal injury by increasing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity and the number of beneficial intestinal bacteria in piglets.

AB  - Management of patients with asthma during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a concern, especially since asthma predisposes patients to respiratory problems. Interestingly, asthma characterized by type 2 inflammation, also known as T-helper type 2-high endotype, displays a cellular and molecular profile that may confer protective effects against COVID-19. The results of experimental and clinical studies have established the actions of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in inducing airway hyperreactivity and weakening an interferon-mediated antiviral response following respiratory viral infection. Robust evidence supports the beneficial effect of the anti-IgE biologic treatment omalizumab on reducing respiratory virus-induced asthma exacerbations and reducing the frequency, duration, and severity of respiratory viral illness in patients with asthma. Indeed, accumulating reports of patients with severe asthma treated with omalizumab during the pandemic have reassuringly shown that continuing omalizumab treatment during COVID-19 is safe, and in fact may help prevent the severe course of COVID-19. Accordingly, guidance issued by the Global Initiative for Asthma recommends that all patients with asthma continue taking their prescribed asthma medications, including biologic therapy, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of biologic treatments on patients with asthma and COVID-19 will be better understood as more evidence emerges.

AB  - New remain of a SANU from the lower levels of the Lumbrera Formation is described. It consists of a left dentary fragment with a m3 preserving a partially broken trigonid and a complete talonid. Kyraodus churcalensis gen. et. sp nov. is characterised by the following combination of features: brachydont and bunodont molar; talonid larger than trigonid; distal wall of the metaconid not inflated; hypoconid subequal in height, but more voluminous than the distally placed hypoconulid; small entoconid closer to the hypoconulid; metastylid vestigial; strong cristid obliqua lingually projected and mesially ascending, closing labially the talonid basin, which is a narrow oblique valley labio-lingually opened; hypocristid present without contacting the hypoconulid; postcristid present, contacting the entoconid and closing the small valley between the later and hypoconulid; strong mesio-labial cingulid and reduced disto-labial one. The cladistic analysis performed yields 380 most parsimonious trees (177 steps each). In the strict consensus, Kyraodus is positioned in a clade with Mioclaenidae, Litopterna, Didolodontidae and Phenacodontidae, separated from Notoungulata plus Kollpaniidae. Kyraodus represents the ancient condylarth known from Northwestern Argentina and the accompanying fauna is the first confirmed early Ypresian assemblage of Argentina highlighting the importance of the region for the early radiation of native ungulates. urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:55379E92-AB62-4E9A-9FC8-2F1B6A1B2B39

AB  - Preservation quality of donor hearts is a key determinant of transplant success. Preservation duration beyond 4 hours is associated with primary graft dysfunction (PGD). Given transport time constraints, geographical limi-tations exist for donor-recipient matching, leading to donor heart underutilization. Here, we showed that met-abolic reprogramming through up-regulation of the enzyme immune response gene 1 (IRG1) and its product itaconate improved heart function after prolonged preservation. Irg1 transcript induction was achieved by adding the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) to a histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate sol-ution used for donor heart preservation. VPA increased acetylated H3K27 occupancy at the IRG1 enhancer and IRG1 transcript expression in human donor hearts. IRG1 converts aconitate to itaconate, which has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Accordingly, our studies showed that Irg1 transcript up-regulation by VPA treatment increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in mice, which was accompanied by increased antioxidant protein expression [hemeoxygenase 1 (HO1) and superoxide dis-mutase 1 (SOD1)]. Deletion of Irg1 in mice (Irg1-/-) negated the antioxidant and cardioprotective effects of VPA. Consistent with itaconate's ability to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase, VPA treatment of human hearts increased itaconate availability and reduced succinate accumulation during preservation. VPA similarly in-creased IRG1 expression in pig donor hearts and improved its function in an ex vivo cardiac perfusion system both at the clinical 4-hour preservation threshold and at 10 hours. These results suggest that augmentation of cardioprotective immune-metabolomic pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving donor heart function in transplantation.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of different processing techniques on microbial load and sperm quality in frozen-thawed equine semen to identify alternatives to reduce the preventive use of antibiotics. Semen was obtained and processed under rigorous hygiene measures from ten stallions, using four protocols: Simple Centrifugation with antibiotics (S+) and Simple Centrifugation (S-), Filtration (F-) and Single-Layer Colloidal Centrifugation (C-) in an antibiotic-free extender. Microbial load in different culture media, sperm viability and motility were assessed. Microbial load results were consistent across protocols, except in Columbia 5% Sheep Blood Agar media, where S- exhibited higher microbial load than S+ (p < 0.05). However, F- and C- showed similar microbial loads to S+. No significant differences were observed in progressive motility, average path velocity, straight-line velocity or wobble parameters between protocols. Total motility and viability were significantly higher in S+ compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). Thus, regardless of antibiotics, the proposed methods achieved results similar to the traditional antibiotic-inclusive protocol in terms of microbial load and the most relevant semen quality parameters. These findings suggest that the use of F- and C-, combined with optimized hygiene measures, offers an effective alternative to reduce the prophylactic use of antibiotics in semen extenders.

AB  - Antibacterial substances such as sulfonamides are widely used in veterinary medicine to treat many bacterial diseases. After their administration to animals, up to 90% of the initial dose of the antibiotic is excreted in the feces and/or urine, which can be applied to farmland as natural or organic fertilizers. In this work, an analytical method was developed with the use of HPLC-FLD for the detection and quantification of five sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulamethazine and sulfamethoxazol) in poultry and pig feces, slurry and digestates. The method was validated according to EU requirements (Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and VICH GL49). Linearity, decision limit, detection capability, detection and quantification limits, recovery, precision, and selectivity were determined, and adequate results were obtained. Using the HPLC-FLD method for all analyzed matrices, recoveries were satisfactory (77.00-121.16%), with repeatability and reproducibility in the range of 4.36-17.34% to 7.94-18.55%, respectively. Decision limit (CC alpha) and detection capability (CC beta) were 33.87-67.63 and 53.36-92.00 mu g/kg, respectively, and limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 13.53-23.30 and 26.02-40.38 mu g/kg, respectively, depending on the analyte. The forty-four samples of natural and organic fertilizers were analyzed, and four samples showed sulfamethoxazole in the amount from range 158 to 11,070 mu g/kg. The application of antibiotics including sulfonamides for farming animals is widespread and may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance and other environmental effects.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study was conducted within the Nutritional Engineering in Weaning for Performance, Immunity, and Gut Efficiency (N.E.W. P.I.G.) The project is a plan aimed at developing innovative diets for weaning piglets that are characterized by low protein levels, achievable through the use of seven synthetic amino acids, while testing the elimination of fish meal and blood derivatives. The trial demonstrated that it is possible to improve the efficiency of the gut, avoiding the use of mass antibiotic treatments in weaning, achieving higher performance, reducing the inclusion of proteins in feed by valorizing by-products, and reducing the environmental impact linked to nitrogen excretion. The trial explored innovative low-protein diets for weaning piglets, testing the elimination of fish meal and blood derivatives. The trial compared three treatments, each with two post-weaning feeds: control feed with blood plasma and fishmeal; T1: low-protein feed with seven amino acids, fishmeal, and blood plasma; T2: low-protein feed with seven amino acids without fishmeal and blood plasma. The trial tested 180 weaned piglets, 24 days of age, evenly distributed by weight, age, and litter of origin. At the end of the first phase, T1 and T2 recorded a significantly higher average weight, ADG, and FCR compared with the control feed. At the end of the second phase, the T2 group maintained a significantly better weight, ADG, and FCR than the control group. Considering the entire test period (phase 1 and phase 2), the T2 thesis appears to have a significantly higher average weight, ADG, with a lower FCR compared to the control group. The T2 thesis fixed a significantly (p < 0.01) greater quantity of nitrogen compared to the T1 thesis and control feed (T2 58.71% vs. T1 54.13% and control 54.02%). In conclusion, a low-protein diet without raw materials of animal origin proved more efficient in terms of performance and nitrogen retention.

AB  - Simple Summary: Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is a chronic neurological illness. Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of dementia in senior individuals and the sixth greatest cause of death in the world. Although several medications are used to treat Alzheimer's disease, none of them actually prevent the illness from progressing. The groundbreaking finding of stem cells has given rise to fresh optimism for the creation of Alzheimer's disease-modifying therapies. The therapeutic use of secretase inhibitor (Begacestat) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease significantly lowers the amounts of amyloid proteins. The current study focuses on how secretase inhibitor and mesenchymal stem cells are used to treat Alzheimer's disease in pregnant female rats and how this affects the development of the progeny. According to current research, mesenchymal stem cells or gamma-secretase inhibitors treatment against single amyloid protein 25-35 injection for dams repaired histopathological changes, inhibited microglial cell activity, improved behavioral impairments, reduced neuroinflammatory cytokines, and decreased the protein concentration of p-tau and the amyloid precursor protein by increasing the activity of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, decreasing the expression of NF- kappa B. Therefore, this study proved a possible protection against Alzheimer's disease by mesenchymal stem cells and gamma-secretase inhibitor.
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. AD more commonly occurs in females than in males, so it is necessary to consider new treatments specifically targeting this population. The present study investigated the protective effects of Begacestat (gamma-secretase inhibitor-953, GSI-953) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) during pregnancy on cognitive impairment in rat dams and neurodegeneration in offspring caused by the intracerebroventricular injection of A beta 25-35 before pregnancy. The performances of dams injected with amyloid-beta 25-35 (A beta 25-35) during behavioral tests were significantly impaired. The offspring of A beta 25-35-injected dams treated with BM-MSCs or GSI-953 showed a dramatically reduced number and size of activated microglial cells, enhancement in the processes length, and a decrease in the proinflammatory cytokine levels. Additionally, BM-MSC or GSI-953 therapy reduced A beta 25-35-induced increases in tau phosphorylation and amyloid precursor protein levels in the neonates' hippocampus and elevated the lower levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor; moreover, reversed A beta 25-35-induced alterations in gene expression in the neonatal hippocampus. Finally, the treatments with BM-MSC or GSI-953 are globally beneficial against A beta 25-35-induced brain alterations, particularly by suppressing neural inflammation, inhibiting microglial cell activation, restoring developmental plasticity, and increasing neurotrophic signaling.

AB  - Even brief epileptic seizures can lead to activity-dependent structural remodeling of neural circuitry. Animal models show that the functional plasticity of synapses and changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons can be crucial for epileptogenesis. However, the exact mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis remain unclear. We induced epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices for 15 min using a 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in vitro model and observed hippocampal hyperexcitability for at least 1 h. We tested several possible mechanisms of this hyperexcitability, including changes in intrinsic membrane properties of neurons and presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations. Neither input resistance nor other essential biophysical properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were affected by epileptiform activity. The glutamate release probability also remained unchanged, as the frequency of miniature EPSCs and the paired amplitude ratio of evoked responses did not change after epileptiform activity. However, we found an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio, suggesting alterations in the properties of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors. Thus, the increase in excitability of hippocampal neural networks is realized through postsynaptic mechanisms. In contrast, the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons and the probability of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals are not affected in a 4-AP model.

AB  - The interest in Robertsonian fusion chromosomes (Rb fusions), sometimes referred to as Robertsonian translocations, derives from their impact on mammalian karyotype evolution, as well from their influence on fertility and disease. The formation of a Rb chromosome necessitates the occurrence of double strand breaks in the pericentromeric regions of two chromosomes in the satellite DNA (satDNA) sequences. Here, we report on the fine-scale molecular analysis of the centromeric satDNA families in the Rb(1;29) translocation of domestic cattle and six antelope species of the subfamily Bovinae. We do so from two perspectives: its occurrence as a chromosomal abnormality in cattle and, secondly, as a fixed evolutionarily rearrangement in spiral-horned antelope (Tragelaphini). By analysing the reorganization of satDNAs in the centromeric regions of translocated chromosomes, we show that Rb fusions are multistep, complex rearrangements which entail the precise elimination and reorganization of specific (peri)centromeric satDNA sequences. Importantly, these structural changes do not influence the centromeric activity of the satellite DNAs that provide segregation stability to the translocated chromosome. Our results suggest a common mechanism for Rb fusions in these bovids and, more widely, for mammals in general.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Saiga antelope horn (SAH) is derived from the Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica Linnaeus) of the bovidae family. SAH has been used for the treatment of febrile seizures (FS) in children for thousands of years in China. Due to the biological protection of Saiga antelope and its ethical reasons, the application of SAH has been widely restricted. Unfortunately, the field of artificial manufacturing of SAH is still blank at present. The mechanism of SAH in the treatment of FS is still unclear, which seriously hinders the further development of artificial antelope horns and the search for substitutes for SAH. At present, there is an urgent need to determine the mechanism of SAH in the treatment of FS, so as to provide a theoretical basis for artificial antelope horn and its substitutes.Aim of the study: To explore the anti-FS effect of natural SAH on FS rat model and its possible mechanism, and to provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent manufacture of artificial antelope horns and the search for the best substitutes.Materials and methods: FS was induced by a warm water bath (48 +/- 0.5 degrees C). The latency and seizure grade of FS were observed and recorded. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the functional defect of hippocampal cells. The contents of tryptophan (TRP), serotonin (5-HT), IL-113 and TNF-a in rat brain tissue were determined by ELISA. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of 5-HT synthesis related neurotransmitter receptors, catalytic enzymes and inflammatory factors in hippocampus. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the expression of TPH2 protein in the dorsal raphe nucleus of rat brain. Results: After pretreating rats with SAH, the seizure grade of FS was significantly reduced and the latency was prolonged. SAH can reduce the histological damage of hippocampal tissue induced by FS in rats. Further analysis of ELISA results showed that SAH significantly increased the levels of TRP and 5-HT in the brain of FS rats, and significantly decreased the levels of IL-113 and TNF-a. The results of QPCR showed that SAH could up-regulate the expression of ER-13 and TPH2 mRNA and down-regulate the expression of IL-113 and TNF-alpha mRNA in the hippocampus of rats. In addition, WB and immunofluorescence results showed that SAH could significantly upregulate the expression of ER-13/TPH2/5-HT pathway in the hippocampus of FS rats and the expression of TPH2 protein in the raphe nucleus, but had no significant effect on SERT protein in the hippocampus of FS rats. In addition, ER-13 protein inhibitor PHTPP significantly inhibited the therapeutic effect of SAH on FS rats. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that SAH has a significant anticonvulsant effect on the FS rat model. The mechanism may be related to the increase of TRP content and up-regulation the expression of ER-13/TPH2/5HT signaling pathway in the brain of FS rats, thereby increasing the content of 5-HT in the brain and reducing the content of IL-113 and TNF-a in the brain.

AB  - The recent viral outbreaks and the current pandemic situation urges us to timely address any emerging viral infections by designing therapeutic strategies. Multi-omics and therapeutic data are of great interest to develop early remedial interventions. This work provides a therapeutic data platform (Mammarenavirus (MMV)-db) for pathogenic mammarenaviruses with potential catastrophic effects on human health around the world. The database integrates vaccinomics and RNA-based therapeutics data for seven human pathogenic MMVs associated with severe viral hemorrhagic fever and lethality in humans. Protein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, helper T-cell and interferon-inducing epitopes were mapped using a cluster of immune-omics-based algorithms and tools for the seven human pathogenic viral species. Furthermore, the physiochemical and antigenic properties were also explored to guide protein-specific multi-epitope subunit vaccine for each species. Moreover, highly efficacious RNAs (small Interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA)) after extensive genome-based analysis with therapeutic relevance were explored. All the therapeutic RNAs were further classified and listed on the basis of predicted higher efficacy. The online platform (http://www.mmvdb.dqweilab-sjtu.com/index.php) contains easily accessible data sets and vaccine designs with potential utility in further computational and experimental work. Conclusively, the current study provides a baseline data platform to secure better future therapeutic interventions against the hemorrhagic fever causing mammarenaviruses.

AB  - Alterations in cellular energy metabolism are a hallmark of cancer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes are overexpressed in many cancers regardless of sufficient oxygen and functional mitochondria. Further, L-lactate plays signaling roles in multiple cell types. We evaluated the effect of singlet oxygen and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on pig heart LDH-B, which shares 97% homology with human LDH-B. Singlet oxygen was generated photochemically using methylene blue or the chlorophyll metabolites, pheophorbide A and chlorin e6. Singlet oxygen induced protein crosslinks observed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and inhibited LDH-B activity. Ascorbate, hydrocaffeic acid, glutathione and sodium azide were employed as singlet oxygen scavengers and shown to protect LDH-B. Using fluorescein-modified maleimide, no changes in cysteine availability as a result of singlet oxygen damage were observed. This was in contrast to HOCl, which induced the formation of disulfides between LDH-B subunits, thereby decreasing LDH-B labeling with fluorescein. HOCl oxidation inhibited LDH-B activity; however, disulfide reduction did not restore it. LDH-B cysteines were resistant to millimolar H2O2, chloramines and Angeli's salt. In the absence of pyruvate, LDH-B enhanced NADH oxidation in a chain reaction initiated by singlet oxygen that resulted in H2O2 formation. Once damaged by either singlet oxygen or HOCl, NADH oxidation by LDH-B was impaired.

AB  - Inflammatory activation within the brain is linked to a decrease in cognitive abilities; however, the molecular mechanisms implicated in the development of inflammatory-related cognitive dysfunction and its prevention are poorly understood. This study compared the responses of hippocampal transcriptomes 3 months after the striatal infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 30 mu g), resulting in memory loss, or with dexamethasone (DEX; 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) pretreatment, which abolished the long-term LPS-induced memory impairment. After LPS treatment, a significant elevation in the expression of immunity/inflammatory-linked genes, including chemokines (Cxcl13), cytokines (Il1b and Tnfsf13b), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II members (Cd74, RT1-Ba, RT1-Bb, RT1-Da, and RT1-Db1) was observed. DEX pretreatment did not change the expression of these genes, but significantly affected the expression of genes encoding ion channels, primarily calcium and potassium channels, regulators of glutamate (Slc1a2, Grm5, Grin2a), and GABA (Gabrr2, Gabrb2) neurotransmission, which enriched in such GO biological processes as "Regulation of transmembrane transport", "Cognition", "Learning", "Neurogenesis", and "Nervous system development". Taken together, these data suggest that (1) pretreatment with DEX did not markedly affect LPS-induced prolonged inflammatory response; (2) DEX pretreatment can affect processes associated with glutamatergic signaling and nervous system development, possibly involved in the recovery of memory impairment induced by LPS.

TI  - Blockage of Fibronectin 1 Ameliorates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Association with Activation of AMP-LKB1-AMPK Signaling Pathway

AB  - Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) is closely associated with energy substrate metabolism. Fibronectin 1 (Fn1) was markedly elevated in the heart of I/R pigs and ischemic patients, but its role in myocardial I/RI is controversial and the precise mechanism involved remains elusive. Herein, we tested whether blockage of Fn1 with its inhibitor (fibronectin tetrapeptide, RGDS) would alleviate myocardial I/RI. Wild-type (WT) mice were administered with RGDS once 3 h before I/R operation and once at 24 or 48 h postreperfusion, and sacrificed at 24 or 72 h post-I/R, respectively. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Myocardial infarction size, apoptosis, fibrosis, and inflammation were examined via histological staining. Uptake of glucose and fatty acids were detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and computer tomography (CT) with [F-18]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and [F-18]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid (FTHA), respectively. Our results showed that administration of RGDS to mice remarkably limited the I/R-induced myocardial infarct size, myocyte apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis and improved cardiac contractile dysfunction. These protective effects were associated with upregulation of the AMP/ATP ratio and the activation of LKB1-AMPK signaling, which subsequently increased AS160-GLUT4-mediated glucose and fatty acid uptake, improved mitochondrial dynamic imbalance, and inactivated TGF-beta and NF-kappa B signals in the I/R heart. In conclusion, the current study identified that blocking Fn1 protects against myocardial I/RI likely through activating the LKB1-AMPK-dependent signals and highlights that inhibition of Fn1 may be a novel therapeutic option for treating ischemic heart diseases.

AB  - Background and objective: Epilepsy is a common chronic brain disease. Despite the availability of various anti-seizure drugs, approximately 30 % of patients do not respond to treatment. Recent research suggests that Kalirin plays a role in regulating neurological function. However, the pathogenesis of Kalirin in epileptic seizures remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of Kalirin in epileptogenesis.Materials and methods: An epileptic model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Endogenous Kalirin was inhibited using shRNA. The expression of Kalirin, Rac1, and Cdc42 in the hippocampal CA1 region was measured using Western blotting. Spine and synaptic structures were examined using Golgi staining and electron microscopy. Moreover, the necrotic neurons in CA1 were examined using HE staining.Results: The results indicated that the epileptic score increased in epileptic animals, while inhibition of Kalirin decreased the epileptic scores and increased the latent period of the first seizure attack. Inhibition of Kalirin attenuated the increases in Rac1 expression, dendritic spine density, and synaptic vesicle number in the CA1 region induced by PTZ. However, the increase in Cdc42 expression was not affected by the inhibition of Kalirin.Conclusion: This study suggests that Kalirin is involved in the development of seizures by modulating the activity of Rac1, providing a novel anti-epileptic target.

AB  - Folliculogenesis encompasses many stages as the somatic granulosa and theca cells support oocytes through growth and maturation. A novel follicle stage, between primordial and transitional stages, was identified in mice and defined as "zip." Like all other follicle stages, the "zip" stage is characterized by its granulosa cell morphology. The "wedge" GC morphology in zip follicles is predicted to be the first granulosa cell division, marking the transition from squamous to cuboidal morphology. Here, zip and transitional stages were identified in histological sections of porcine, bovine, rhesus monkey, and human ovaries. Several growth dynamics characterized at these follicle stages were conserved between species. Oocyte diameter and area increased between the primordial and transitional stages in the porcine ovary and between the primordial and primary stages in the rhesus monkey ovary but appeared unchanged in bovine and human ovaries. In all species except for pigs, granulosa cell number and height increased at stages earlier than observed changes in the oocyte. Furthermore, there were differences in the percentage of zip and transitional follicle stages present in the cortical region across species. This implies that there may be species-dependent activation and growth mechanisms that require further study. The parameters defined here for identifying and characterizing the zip and transitional follicle stages across species can act as a tool for measuring factors that perturb or induce primordial follicle activation or effect follicle morphometric parameters in support of future innovations for fertility preservation and restoration.
   Sentence Follicle activation is morphologically identified first in the GCs prior to oocyte growth in bovine, nonhuman primate, and human ovaries, while GC and oocyte growth occur simultaneously in porcine ovaries.

AB  - Cofilactin rod pathology, which can initiate synapse loss, has been extensively studied in rodent neurons, hippocampal slices, and in vivo mouse models of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these systems, rod formation induced by disease-associated factors, such as soluble oligomers of Amyloid-beta (A beta) in AD, utilizes a pathway requiring cellular prion protein (PrP (c)), NADPH oxidase (NOX), and cytokine/chemokine receptors (CCR5 and/or CXCR4). However, rod pathways have not been systematically assessed in a human neuronal model. Here, we characterize glutamatergic neurons differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the formation of rods in response to activators of the PrP (c)-dependent pathway. Optimization of substratum, cell density, and use of glial-conditioned medium yielded a robust system for studying the development of A beta-induced rods in the absence of glia, suggesting a cell-autonomous pathway. Rod induction in younger neurons requires ectopic expression of PrP (c), but this dependency disappears by Day 55. The quantification of proteins within the rod-inducing pathway suggests that increased PrP (c) and CXCR4 expression may be factors in the doubling of the rod response to A beta between Days 35 and 55. FDA-approved antagonists to CXCR4 and CCR5 inhibit the rod response. Rods were predominantly observed in dendrites, although severe cytoskeletal disruptions prevented the assignment of over 40% of the rods to either an axon or dendrite. In the absence of glia, a condition in which rods are more readily observed, neurons mature and fire action potentials but do not form functional synapses. However, PSD95-containing dendritic spines associate with axonal regions of pre-synaptic vesicles containing the glutamate transporter, VGLUT1. Thus, our results identified stem cell-derived neurons as a robust model for studying cofilactin rod formation in a human cellular environment and for developing effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of dementias arising from multiple proteinopathies with different rod initiators.

AB  - Proper localization of receptors for synaptic organizing factors is crucial for synapse formation. Wnt proteins promote synapse assembly through Frizzled (Fz) receptors. In hippocampal neurons, the surface and synaptic localization of Fz5 is regulated by neuronal activity, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we report that all Fz receptors can be post-translationally modified by S-acylation and that Fz5 is S-acylated on three C-terminal cysteines by zDHHC5. S-acylation is essential for Fz5 localization to the cell surface, axons, and presynaptic sites. Notably, S-acylation-deficient Fz5 is internalized faster, affecting its association with signalosome components at the cell surface. S-acylation-deficient Fz5 also fails to activate canonical and divergent canonical Wnt pathways. Fz5 S-acylation levels are regulated by the pattern of neuronal activity. In vivo studies demonstrate that S-acylation-deficient Fz5 expression fails to induce presynaptic assembly. Our studies show that S-acylation of Frizzled receptors is a mechanism controlling their localization and function.

AB  - n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play important roles in the health, development and growth of mammals. However, most mammals, including humans, cannot synthesize n-6 and n-3 PUFAs and can only obtain them from the diet. The fatty acid desaturase 3 (Fad3) gene from flax encodes a fatty acid desaturase that convert n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs through desaturation at Delta 15. The use of transgenic technology to produce Fad3 transgenic cattle may be an effective way for humans to obtain n-3 PUFAs. This study utilized fibroblasts derived from FAD3-transgenic and wild-type (control, CON) Luxi Yellow cattle as a model system. We systematically compared differences between the two cell groups regarding endogenous gene expression, metabolite abundance, fatty acid desaturation capacity, and lipid anabolism/catabolism pathways, aiming to elucidate how endogenous n-3 PUFAs synthesized via FAD3 regulate lipid metabolism. In Fad3 transgenic cattle, the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (Scd5) gene was up-regulated which promote fatty acid desaturation. Endogenously PUFAs down-regulate the expression of lipid synthesis-related genes and the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), up-regulate the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) enzyme, reduce lipid synthesis, increase the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, and thus reduce fat deposition. In summary, the Fad3 transgenic cattle are expected to improve the nutritional value of beef, and can be used as a livestock animal model to study the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs.

AB  - Livestock infections caused by highly toxic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens type D and Clostridium novyi type B, present significant challenges in veterinary medicine. Such infections often require complex and elusive treatment regimens. Developing effective vaccines tailored to combat these specific pathogens remains a pressing need within the field. These bacteria are notorious for their extreme toxicity and the difficulty in culturing them for vaccine production. To address this challenge, we engineered a new potential vaccine candidate capable of neutralizing the virulence of both bacterial strains. Leveraging computational techniques, we identified epitopic regions within C. perfringens Epsilon Toxin (ETX) and C. novyi Alpha Toxin (ATX). Through fusion gene design, we integrated these epitopic regions alongside the PADRE-peptide sequence. The PADRE-peptide serves as a universal adjuvant to induce an immune response. The culmination of our efforts materialized in a Recombinant Fusion Protein D (rFPD), a novel vaccine construct designed to elicit robust and specific immune defenses against both bacterial species. By combining in-silico design and molecular engineering, our study represents a promising stride toward combating the impact of these pathogenic bacteria in livestock.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Medicinal mushrooms belonging to the Lignosus spp., colloquially known as Tiger Milk mushrooms (TMMs), are used as traditional medicine by communities across various regions of China and Southeast Asia to enhance immunity and to treat various diseases. At present, three Lignosus species have been identified in Malaysia: L. rhinocerus, , L. tigris, , and L. cameronensis. . Similarities in their macroscopic morphologies and the nearly indistinguishable appearance of their sclerotia often lead to interchangeability between them. Hence, substantiation of their traditional applications via identification of their individual bioactive properties is imperative in ensuring that they are safe for consumption. L. tigris was first identified in 2013. Thus far, studies on L. tigris cultivar sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) have shown that it possesses significant antioxidant activities and has greater antiproliferative action against selected cancer cells in vitro compared to its sister species, L. rhinocerus TM02 (R). Our previous genomics study also revealed significant genetic dissimilarities between them. Further omics investigations on Ligno TG-K hold immense potential in facilitating the identification of its bioactive compounds and their associated bioactivities. Aim of study: The overall aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression profile of Ligno TG-K via de novo RNA-seq and pathway analysis. We also aimed to identify highly expressed genes encoding compounds that contribute to its cytotoxic and antioxidant properties, as well as perform a comparative transcriptomics analysis between Ligno TG-K and its sister species, L. rhinocerus TM02 (R). Materials and methods: Total RNA from fresh 3-month-old cultivated L. tigris sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) was extracted and analyzed via de novo RNA sequencing. Expressed genes were analyzed using InterPro and NCBI-Nr databases for domain identification and homology search. Functional categorization based on gene functions and pathways was performed using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) databases. Selected genes were subsequently subjected to phylogenetic analysis. Results: Our transcriptomics analysis of Ligno TG-K revealed that 68.06% of its genes are expressed in the sclerotium; 80.38% of these were coding transcripts. Our analysis identified highly expressed transcripts encoding proteins with prospective medicinal properties. These included serine proteases (FPKM = 7356.68), deoxyribonucleases (FPKM = 3777.98), lectins (FPKM = 3690.87), and fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FPKM = 2337.84), all of which have known associations with anticancer activities. Transcripts linked to proteins with antioxidant activities, such as superoxide dismutase (FPKM = 1161.69) and catalase (FPKM = 1905.83), were also highly expressed. Results of our sequence alignments revealed that these genes and their orthologs can be found in other mushrooms. They exhibit significant sequence similarities, suggesting possible parallels in their anticancer and antioxidant bioactivities. Conclusion: This study is the first to provide a reference transcriptome profile of genes expressed in the sclerotia of L. tigris. The current study also presents distinct COG profiles of highly expressed genes in Ligno TG-K and L. rhinocerus TM02 (R), highlighting that any distinctions uncovered may be attributed to their interspecies variations and inherent characteristics that are unique to each species.
   Our findings suggest that Ligno TG-K contains bioactive compounds with prospective medicinal properties that warrant further investigations. Classification: Systems biology and omics

AB  - The Saignon ichnosite, located in the Apt syncline, yielded a high density of footprints with hundreds of mammal tracks preserved. It was discovered and first studied in the 1970s, and never re-examined since. Here we present a new analysis of the ichnosite with updates to ichnotaxonomy. The surface of the limestone bed bearing the prints was digitised by aerial photogrammetry (UAV). Best preserved tracks and trackways were digitised by short-range photogrammetric techniques. 3D data served as the basis for all measurements, including precise depth measurements. Of the hundreds of tracks present, this study focuses on the 20 best-preserved perissodactyl trackways. A review of the large perissodactyl morphotype is provided and Rhinoceripeda voconcense comb. nov. is defined. We also present possible evidence of social behaviour in early rhinocerotids. Based on fewer tracks a second smaller perissodactyl ichnotaxon, Lophiopus isp. is identified. Artiodactyl prints are attributed, when possible, to Bifidipes velox. The Saignon tracksite, dated as early Rupelian (MP21), is at an important faunal turnover, following the Grande Coupure. Its ichnofauna is characteristic of a post-Grande Coupure fauna with the presence of newcomer rhinocerotids that reached Europe from Asia and the persistence of endemic pre-Grande Coupure palaeotheriids.

AB  - Background: Red ginseng (RG) alleviates psychiatric disorders. Fermented red ginseng (fRG) alleviates stress-induced gut inflammation. Gut dysbiosis causes psychiatric disorders with gut inflammation. To understand the gut microbiota-mediated action mechanism of RG and fRG against anxiety/depression (AD), we investigated the effects of RG, fRG, ginsenoside Rd, and 20(S)-b-D-glucopyranosyl proto-panaxadiol (CK) on gut microbiota dysbiosis-induced AD and colitis in mice.Methods: Mice with AD and colitis were prepared by exposing to immobilization stress (IS) or trans-planting the feces of patients with ulcerative colitis and depression (UCDF). AD-like behaviors were measured in the elevated plus maze, light/dark transition, forced swimming, and tail suspension tests. Results: Oral gavage of UCDF increased AD-like behaviors and induced neuroinflammation, gastroin-testinal inflammation, and gut microbiota fluctuation in mice. Oral administration of fRG or RG treatment reduced UCDF-induced AD-like behaviors, hippocampal and hypothalamic IL-6 expression, and blood corticosterone level, whereas UCDF-suppressed hippocampal BDNF thorn NeuN thorn cell population and dopa-mine and hypothalamic serotonin levels increased. Furthermore, their treatments suppressed UCDF-induced colonic inflammation and partially restored UCDF-induced gut microbiota fluctuation. Oral administration of fRG, RG, Rd, or CK also decreased IS-induced AD-like behaviors, blood IL-6 and corti-costerone and colonic IL-6 and TNF-a levels, and gut dysbiosis, while IS-suppressed hypothalamic dopamine and serotonin levels increased. Conclusion: Oral gavage of UCDF caused AD, neuroinflammation, and gastrointestinal inflammation in mice. fRG mitigated AD and colitis in UCDF-exposed mice by the regulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and IS-exposed mice by the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.(c) 2022 The Korean Society of Ginseng.

AB  - While flavonoid accumulation, light radiation, and cold stress are intrinsically connected in tea plants, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The circadian protein CCA1 and CCA1-like MYB transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in coordinating light and temperature signals in plant-environment interactions, their homologs in tea plants have not been addressed. Here we analyzed CsCCA1-like MYB subfamily in tea genome and found one member, a circadian gene CsMYB128 responding to cold stress. Antisense knockdown of CsMYB128 in tea buds rendered cold tolerance in cold tolerance tests. Metabolite profiling, yeast hybrid and promoter trans-activation assays further demonstrated that CsMYB128 negatively regulated flavonol biosynthesis by repressing CsFLS1 in flavonol biosynthesis and CsCBF1 in cold tolerance. Given CsCBF1 also activated CsMYB128 transcription, the negative feedback regulation loop indicates a balance between tea plant growth promoted by CsMYB128 and cold tolerance meanwhile growth inhibition by CsCBF1. Moreover, CsICE1 interacted with and inhibited CsMYB128 repressor activity to promote cold tolerance. CsMYB128 is thus characterized as an early cold-responsive gene negatively regulating tea plant cold response and balancing tea plant growth and cold tolerance. This study provides insights into the roles of CCA1-like subfamily MYB TFs in regulating tea plant growth and interactions with environments.

AB  - Background Prenatal stress exposure irreversibly impairs mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial trafficking and morphology in offspring, leading to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism controlling mitochondrial dynamics in differentiating neurons is crucial to prevent the prenatal stress-induced impairments in behavior. We investigated the interplay between mitochondrial transport and fusion/fission in differentiating neurons exposed to prenatal stress, leading to ensuing behavior impairments, and then tried to identify the primary regulator that modulates both phenomena. Methods We used primary hippocampal neurons of mice exposed to prenatal stress and human induced-pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, for investigating the impact of glucocorticoid on mitochondrial dynamics during differentiation. For constructing mouse models, we used AAV vectors into mouse pups exposed to prenatal stress to regulate protein expressions in hippocampal regions. Results We first observed that prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids induced motility arrest and fragmentation of mitochondria in differentiating neurons derived from mouse fetuses (E18) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Further, glucocorticoid exposure during neurogenesis selectively downregulated Miro1 and increased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). MIRO1 overexpression restored mitochondrial motility and increased intramitochondrial calcium influx through ER-mitochondria contact (ERMC) formation. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminal GTPase domain of Miro1 plays a critical role in ERMC formation, which then decreased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). Similarly, prenatal corticosterone exposure led to impaired neuropsychiatric and cognitive function in the offspring by affecting mitochondrial distribution and synaptogenesis, rescued by Miro1(WT), but not N-terminal GTPase active form Miro1(P26V), expression. Conclusion Prenatal glucocorticoid-mediated Miro1 downregulation contributes to dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics through Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616) in differentiating neurons.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is an important biophysical factor in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) differentiation. Although there is evidence that Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays an important role in ECM elasticity induced osteogenesis, but the regulatory mechanism and signaling pathways have not been distinctly uncovered. In this study, hBMSCs were cultured on collagen-coated poly-dimethylsiloxane hydrogels with stiffness corresponding to Young's moduli of 0.5 kPa and 32 kPa, and gene chip analyses revealed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway was highly correlated with ECM stiffness. Following western blots indicated that AKT phosphorylation was evidently affected in 5th-7th days after ECM stiffness stimulation, while PI3K showed little difference. The AKT activator SC79 and inhibitor MK2206 were utilized to modulate AKT phosphorylation. SC79 and MK2206 caused alteration in the mRNA expression and protein level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) and runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). On 32 kPa substrates, YAP enrichment in nucleus were significantly promoted by SC79 and remarkably decreased by MK2206. Besides, the ratio of YAP/p-YAP is upregulated by SC79 on both 32 kPa and 0.5 kPa substrates. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AKT is involved in the modulation of ECM stiffness induced osteogenesis, and AKT phosphorylation also influences the subcellular localization and activation of YAP.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction, including hyperpermeability of the blood-brain barrier to fibrinogen, glial activation, and neuronal damage, possibly leading to secondary brain damage. However, no known substance can inhibit its pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 inhibitor, as a TBI pathogenesis-inhibiting substance. We induced acute TBI in C57BL/6J mice through a controlled cortical impact (CCI) and evaluated the effects of noggin on fibrinogen leakage into the brain and NVU-constituting cells, including pericytes, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. CCI mice showed increased BMP4 levels and extravascular fibrinogen in the hippocampus. Noggin treatment significantly suppressed fibrinogen leakage four days post-CCI in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that noggin administration did not inhibit the activation of NVU cells such as pericytes, microglia, and astrocytes, which were characterized by increased PDGFR beta, Iba1, and GFAP expression levels, respectively. On postoperative day 4, CCI mice showed neuronal cell and myelinated neuronal fiber loss, which were not significantly affected by noggin administration. In conclusion, noggin administration suppresses fibrinogen leakage into the brain in the acute phase after TBI. However, the suppression of fibrinogen leakage through noggin administration did not alleviate neuronal damage and activation of NVU cells during the acute phase of TBI.

AB  - Ozone pollution is increasingly recognized as a serious environmental threat that exacerbates dementia risks, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Amid rapid industrialization, China faces significant air quality challenges. However, there has been a scarcity of detailed studies assessing the health and economic impacts of ozone pollution on these conditions. This study aims to address this gap by utilizing the BenMap-CE tool and incorporating parameters obtained from systematic reviews of epidemiological studies, official statistics, and weighted averages, to accurately quantify the effects of ozone exposure in China. This research evaluated the health and economic burdens at both national and provincial levels, focusing on the additional impacts attributed to increased ozone levels. The results reveal that in 2023, compared to 2015, ozone pollution contributed to approximately 110,000 new cases (5.6 per 10,000) of AD and 1.6 million new cases (81.7 per 10,000) of MCI, imposing significant economic costs of about US $1200 million for AD and US $18,000 million for MCI, based on 2015 dollar values. Additionally, our projections indicate that reducing the 2023 ozone concentrations to 70 mu g/m3 could significantly curb these conditions, potentially preventing over 210,000 new AD cases (10.7 per 10,000) and 2.9 million (148.1 per 10,000) MCI cases. Such reductions are projected to yield substantial economic benefits, estimated at US $2200 million for AD and US $34,000 million for MCI (2015 dollar values). These findings underscore the profound implications of ozone pollution on public health and the economy in China, highlighting the urgent need for effective ozone management strategies to mitigate these impacts.

AB  - The antibody immune response is essential for the survival of mammals. However, we still lack a systematic understanding of the antibody repertoire. Here, we developed a proteomic strategy to survey, at an unprecedented scale, the landscape of antigen-engaged, circulating camelid heavy-chain antibodies, whose minimal binding fragments are called VHH antibodies or nanobodies. The sensitivity and robustness of this approach were validated with three antigens spanning orders of magnitude in immune responses; thousands of distinct, high-affinity nanobody families were reliably identified and quantified. Using high-throughput structural modeling, cross-linking mass spectrometry, mutagenesis, and deep learning, we mapped and analyzed the epitopes of >100,000 antigen-nanobody complexes. Our results revealed a surprising diversity of ultrahigh-affinity camelid nanobodies for specific antigen binding on various dominant epitope clusters. Nanobodies utilize both shape and charge complementarity to enable highly selective antigen binding. Interestingly, we found that nanobody-antigen binding can mimic conserved intracellular protein-protein interactions.

AB  - Sulfur is an essential element for plant growth, development and resistance to environmental stresses. Glucosinolates (GSLs), a group of sulfur rich secondary metabolites found in Brassicaceae plants, are known for their defensive properties against pathogens and herbivores. Due to their integration of a large proportion of total sulfur, their biosynthesis and degradation are closely linked to sulfur metabolism. It has been demonstrated that GSLs can be broken down to release sulfur and facilitate the production of other thio-metabolites when the plant is under stress. However, the regulation of this process is still not fully understood. In this study, we constructed two broccoli LSU (low sulfur responsive) gene overexpressing lines, 35S::BoLSU1 and 35S::BoLSU2, to detect changes in GSL metabolism after sulfur deficiency treatment. The results showed that BoLSU1 and BoLSU2 inhibit the biosynthesis of aliphatic GSLs, while also promoting their degradation and increasing the content of glutathione (GSH), leading to the reallocation of sulfur from the GSL pool to other thio-metabolites such as GSH. Furthermore, this regulation of GSL metabolism mediated by BoLSU1 and BoLSU2 is found to be dependent on myrosinases BGLU28 and BGLU30. Our study provides insight into the physiological role of LSU proteins and their regulation of sulfur metabolism.

AB  - Depression is a complex mental disorder, affecting approximately 280 million individuals globally. The pathobiology of depression is not fully understood, and the development of new treatments is urgently needed. Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is a natural flavanone, mainly distributed in Ampelopsis grossedentata. DHM has demonstrated a protective role against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver disease, cancer, kidney injury and neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of DHM against depression in a chronic depression mouse model induced by corticosterone (CORT). Animals exposed to CORT displayed depressive-like behaviors; DHM treatment reversed these behaviors. Network pharmacology analyses showed that DHM's function against depression involved a wide range of targets and signaling pathways, among which the inflammation-linked targets and signaling pathways were critical. Western blotting showed that CORT-treated animals had significantly increased levels of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) and receptor of AGE (RAGE) in the hippocampus, implicating activation of the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detected a marked increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in the hippocampus of CORT-treated mice. DHM administration significantly counteracted these CORT-induced changes. These findings suggest that protection against depression by DHM is mediated by suppression of neuroinflammation, predominantly via the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway.

AB  - Malignant melanoma (MM) is characterized by rapid growth, frequent metastasis, and high mortality. Targeted therapy for MM is still a research hotspot due to the increasing understanding of the hippo pathway. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in MM tumorigenesis. Based on the database analysis, we found that the median mRNA expression of TAZ (5.4) was found to be similar to that of YAP (5.5) in 473 human melanoma specimens. However, in 63 MM cell lines, the median expression of TAZ (10.8) was expressed at a higher level than that of YAP (9.5), which was then validated in A375. TAZ down-regulation by siRNA decreased the migration (72%) and invasion (74%) abilities of A375. Furthermore, the down-regulation of TAZ inhibited the proliferation of A375 without affecting apoptosis. We subsequently blocked hippo signaling with verteporfin and found that verteporfin application decreased the number of migrating (63%) and invading (69%) cells, respectively. We further found that Cyr61 declined following TAZ down-regulation. Moreover, TAZ negatively correlates with melanoma patient's overall survival. Our data proved that TAZ contributed to MM metastasis, which might be a potential therapeutic target in the future.

AB  - The Tachinidae is one of the most speciose families in Diptera, and the exclusively parasitoid species play an important role in regulating populations of many herbivorous insects in ecosystems, including many agricultural pests. To better comprehend the characteristics and evolution of the mitochondrial genome for the Tachinidae, we are adding a massive amount of new molecular data by assembling the mitogenomes for 71 genera and 135 species from all four tachinid subfamilies through next-generation sequencing, and we are presenting the most comprehensive mitogenomic phylogenetic analysis of this family so far. Extensive rearrangements observed in the mitogenome of Admontia podomyia (Exoristinae) are unique for the entire suborder Cyclorrhapha. The rearrangement pattern suggests that the process involved a tandem duplication of the complete mitogenome, followed by both random and nonrandom loss of one copy of each gene. Additionally, five minor mitogenome rearrangements are discovered and described in three subfamilies. We present the largest species-level phylogenetic hypothesis for Tachinidae to date, based on mitogenomes of 152 species of Tachinidae, representing all four subfamilies and with five non-tachinid outgroups. Our analyses support the monophyly of the Tachinidae and most tribes and genera were recovered with good support, but the higher-level phylogenetic relationships within Tachinidae were poorly resolved, indicating that mitogenome data alone are not enough to unambiguously resolve the deeper phylogenetic relationships within Tachinidae.

AB  - Asthma has a striking temporal character, in which time-of-day, patient age, and season each influence disease activity. The extent to which rhythms in asthma activity reflect exposure to specific disease triggers remains unclear. In this study, we examined how virus mitigation strategies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic ("lockdown measures") affected rhythms in asthma clinical activity in children. To this end, we retrospectively analyzed asthma clinical presentations in children aged <18 years to our regional academic medical center, comparing 4 years of medical records prior to COVID-19 lockdown measures with the 12 months immediately after the institution of such measures. We correlated these data to positive viral test results, febrile seizures, and allergic clinical surrogates (allergic reaction visits and Emergency Department [ED] antihistamine prescriptions, respectively) over the same time frame. In the 12 months following the institution of the COVID-19 lockdown, positivity rates for common respiratory viruses dropped by 70.2% and ED visits for asthma among children dropped by 62% compared to pre-COVID years. Lockdown suppressed seasonal variation in positive viral tests and asthma ED visits, while diurnal rhythms in asthma visits were unchanged. Asthma seasonality correlated most strongly with rhinovirus positivity both before and after the institution of COVID lockdown measures. Altogether, our data support a causal role for viruses in driving seasonal variability in asthma exacerbations in children.

AB  - Patients affected by diabetes mellitus (DM) show diabetic encephalopathy with an increased risk of cognitive deficits, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms are not fully explored. In the male animal models of DM, the development of cognitive impairment seems to be the result of the concomitance of different processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aberrant synaptogenesis. However, even if diabetic encephalopathy shows some sex-dimorphic features, no observations in female rats have been so far reported on these aspects. Therefore, in an experimental model of type 1 DM (T1DM), we explored the impact of one month of pathology on memory abilities by the novel object recognition test and on neuroinflammation, synaptogenesis and mitochondrial functionality. Moreover, given that steroids are involved in memory and learning, we also analysed their levels and receptors. We reported that memory dysfunction can be associated with different features in the female hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Indeed, in the hippocampus, we observed aberrant synaptogenesis and neuroinflammation but not mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, possibly due to the results of locally increased levels of progesterone metabolites (i.e., dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone). These observations suggest specific brain-area effects of T1DM since different alterations are observed in the cerebral cortex.

AB  - Simple Summary Efficient collection and cryosurvival of semen from threatened wildlife species is key for the success of artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs). The viscous nature of ejaculates often collected from species such as rhinoceros, elephant, hippopotamus and primate, render the majority of spermatozoa collected useless and is therefore wasted. The enzyme papain has been used to reduce the viscosity of camelid semen but has yet to be tested in wildlife species. Therefore, the current study investigated the ability of papain to improve the yield and quality of spermatozoa collected from viscous fractions of the rhinoceros ejaculate during cryopreservation. Papain increased the quantity of useable spermatozoa collected from ejaculates, as well as the motility prior to freezing. It also improved the post-thaw motility, velocity, linearity and straightness of samples compared to spermatozoa frozen from the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate. There was no detrimental effect on membrane characteristics or DNA integrity. These results show that treating rhinoceros ejaculates with papain is able to salvage valuable spermatozoa and improve survival post-thaw, ultimately increasing the success of ARTs and creation of biobanks for the maintenance and survival of threatened species. The preservation of rhinoceros semen is vital for captive breeding programs. While successful collection and cryopreservation of rhinoceros semen has been reported, the volume and quality of semen produced is often low due to the high viscosity associated with ejaculates collected via electroejaculation. Reducing semen viscosity would enable access to previously unusable spermatozoa from viscous fractions and could improve quality post-thaw. The enzyme papain successfully reduced the viscosity of camelid semen but has yet to be tested in wildlife species. This study assessed the influence of papain on the in vitro quality of rhinoceros spermatozoa during cryopreservation using advanced semen assessment. In experiment 1, the motility of spermatozoa from the viscous fraction of an ejaculate, either untreated or treated with papain and its inhibitor E-64 prior to cryopreservation, was assessed post-thaw. In experiment 2, spermatozoa from papain-treated viscous fractions were compared to spermatozoa frozen from untreated sperm-rich fractions pre-freeze, as well as after 0, 1.5 and 3 h of incubation post-thaw (37 degrees C). Papain significantly increased the quantity of spermatozoa collected from ejaculates, as well as the motility prior to freezing. Papain also improved the post-thaw motility, velocity, linearity and straightness of samples compared to sperm-rich samples, with no detriment to sperm viability, lipid membrane disorder, production of ROS or DNA integrity (p < 0.05). Results show the benefit of supplementing rhinoceros spermatozoa with papain prior to cryopreservation on sperm cryosurvival and demonstrates the potential of using papain to improve the success of cryopreservation protocols, not only for the rhinoceros, but also for other wildlife species.

AB  - A therapeutic potential of the TRPA1 channel agonist cinnamaldehyde for use in inflammatory bowel disease is emerging, but the mechanisms are unclear. Semi-quantitative qPCR of various parts of the porcine gastrointestinal tract showed that mRNA for TRPA1 was highest in the colonic mucosa. In Ussing chambers, 1 mmol center dot L-1 cinnamaldehyde induced increases in short circuit current (Delta I-sc) and conductance (Delta G(t)) across the colon that were higher than those across the jejunum or after 1 mmol center dot L-1 thymol. Lidocaine, amiloride or bumetanide did not change the response. The application of 1 mmol center dot L-1 quinidine or the bilateral replacement of 120 Na+, 120 Cl- or 25 HCO3- reduced Delta G(t), while the removal of Ca2+ enhanced Delta G(t) with Delta I-sc numerically higher. Delta I-sc decreased after 0.5 NPPB, 0.01 indometacin and the bilateral replacement of 120 Na+ or 25 HCO3-. The removal of 120 Cl- had no effect. Cinnamaldehyde also activates TRPV3, but comparative measurements involving patch clamp experiments on overexpressing cells demonstrated that much higher concentrations are required. We suggest that cinnamaldehyde stimulates the secretion of HCO3- via apical CFTR and basolateral Na+-HCO3- cotransport, preventing acidosis and damage to the epithelium and the colonic microbiome. Signaling may involve the opening of TRPA1, depolarization of the epithelium and a rise in PGE2 following a lower uptake of prostaglandins via OATP2A1.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal exercise on alterations induced by prenatal stress in markers of the inflammatory process and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the brain and lungs of neonatal mice. Female Balb/c mice were divided into three groups: control, prenatal restraint stress, prenatal restraint stress and physical exercise before and during the gestational period. On day 0 (PND0) and 10 (PND10), mice were euthanized for brain and lung analyses. The gene expression of GR, MR, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF in the brain and lungs and the protein expression of MMP-2 in the lungs were analyzed. Maternal exercise reduced IL-6 and IL-10 gene expression in the brain of PND0 mice. Prenatal stress and maternal exercise decreased GR, MR, IL-6, and TNF gene expression in the lungs of PND0 mice. In the hippocampus of PND10 females, exercise inhibited the effects of prenatal stress on the expression of MR, IL-6, and IL-10. In the lungs of PND10 females, exercise prevented the decrease in GR expression caused by prenatal stress. In the hippocampus and lungs of PND10 males, prenatal stress decreased GR gene expression. Our findings confirm the effects induced by prenatal stress and demonstrate that physical exercise before and during the gestational period may have a protective role on inflammatory changes.

AB  - As a key regulator of the DNA translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, RAD18 is error-prone and contributes to the accumulation of DNA mutations. Our previous study showed that it plays an essential role in the progression of multiple tumors. However, the mechanism through which RAD18 influences triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), especially the interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, remains elusive. In this study, we showed that RAD18 expression is markedly higher in patients with high T stage TNBC and inversely correlated with prognosis. High expression of RAD18 facilitated a highly stem-cell phenotype through the Hippo/YAP pathway, which supports the proliferation of TNBC. In addition, the cytokine byproduct TGF-beta activates macrophages to have an M2-like tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotype. Reciprocally, TGF-beta from TAMs activated RAD18 in TNBC to enhance tumor stemness, forming a positive feedback loop. Inhibition of YAP or TGF-beta breaks this loop and suppresses cancer stemness and proliferation In nude mice, RAD18 promoted subcutaneous transplanted tumor growth and M2-type TAM recruitment. Collectively, the RAD18-YAP-TGF-beta loop is essential for the promotion of the stemness phenotype by TNBC and could be a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.

AB  - Albino tea plants (Camellia sinensis) have been reported to possess highly inhibited metabolism of flavonoids compared to regular green tea leaves, which improves the quality of the tea made from these leaves. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolism of catechins and flavonols in albino tea leaves have not been well elucidated. In this study, we analyzed a time series of leaf samples in the greening process from albino to green in a thermosensitive leaf-color tea mutant using metabolomics and transcriptomics. The total content of polyphenols dramatically decreased, while flavonols (such as rutin) were highly accumulated in albino leaves compared to in green leaves. After treatment with increasing environment temperature, total polyphenols and catechins were increased in albino mutant tea leaves; however, flavonols (especially ortho-dihydroxylated B-rings such as rutin) were decreased. Meanwhile, weighted gene co-expression network analysis of RNA-seq data suggested that the accumulation of flavonols was highly correlated with genes related to reactive oxygen species scavenging. Histochemical localization further demonstrated that this specific accumulation of flavonols might be related to their biological functions in stress tolerance. These findings suggest that the temperature-stimulated accumulation of total polyphenols and catechins in albino mutant tea leaves was highly induced by enhanced photosynthesis and accumulation of its products, while the initial accumulation and temperature inhibition of flavonols in albino mutant tea leaves were associated with metabolism related to oxidative stress. In conclusion, our results indicate that the biosynthesis of flavonoids could be driven by many different factors, including antioxidation and carbon skeleton storage, under favorable and unfavorable circumstances, respectively. This work provides new insights into the drivers of flavonoid biosynthesis in albino tea leaves, which will further help to increase tea quality by improving cultivation measures.

AB  - Calcium dynamics into astrocytes influence the activity of nearby neuronal structures. However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals encode (i.e., statistically reflect) spatial information that could not be explained by visual cue information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals may regulate clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent variations in population coding within brain circuits.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a kind of depression syndrome, and its occurrence is related to deficiencies of the heart and kidney. Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua replenishes Qi and blood and tonifies the five zang organs, so it is widely used in TCM as a prescription for the treatment of depression syndrome. The polysaccharides in P. cyrtonema Hua (PSP) are the main active components of the herb, but the effects of PSP on PTSD and the mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of the study: To investigate the preventive effect of PSP on PTSD-like behaviors and to determine the mechanisms. Methods: We used behavioral tests to evaluate PTSD-like behaviors in mice. Synaptic changes were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to assess pathological changes to the hippocampus, and immunofluorescence staining was used to observe changes in astrocytes. Serum corticosterone (CORT), cytokine, and hippocampal oxidation-related indicator levels were evaluated by ELISA. We detected the expression levels of synaptic, oxidative, and inflammation-related proteins in the hippocampus by western blotting. Results: Single prolonged stress (SPS)-modeled mice exhibited significant PTSD-like phenotypes, including increased fear memory acquisition and anxiety-like behaviors. These behavioral changes were prevented by PSP administration. Compared to controls, SPS modeling increased serum CORT, cytokine, and hippocampal malondialdehyde levels; decreased superoxide dismutase activity; and caused losses in pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, and synapses in the CA1 region. At the molecular level, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, postsynaptic density protein 95, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), phospho-tyrosine kinase receptor B, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, heme oxygenase-1 (HO -1), and GluA1 decreased in SPS mice compared with the control group, while the expression of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), GluN2B, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein increased in SPS mice. Treatment with PSP counteracted these abnormal changes. Importantly, ML385, an Nrf2 inhibitor, blocked PSP's ability to ameliorate PTSD behaviors and abnormal protein expression. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 reduced the PTSD-like behaviors and normalized protein expression in SPS mice. Conclusion: PSP prevents SPS-induced PTSD-like behaviors and synaptic damage by regulating oxidative stress and NLRP3-mediated inflammation, probably in an Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-dependent manner.

AB  - Obesity is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, including memory deficits. This is particularly worrisome when obesity occurs during adolescence, a maturational period for brain structures critical for cognition. In rodent models, we recently reported that memory impairments induced by obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) intake during the periadolescent period can be reversed by chemogenetic manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Here, we used an intersectional viral approach in HFD-fed male mice to chemogenetically inactivate specific vHPC efferent pathways to nucleus accumbens (NAc) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during memory tasks. We first demonstrated that HFD enhanced activation of both pathways after training and that our chemogenetic approach was effective in normalizing this activation. Inactivation of the vHPC-NAc pathway rescued HFD-induced deficits in recognition but not location memory. Conversely, inactivation of the vHPC-mPFC pathway restored location but not recognition memory impairments produced by HFD. Either pathway manipulation did not affect exploration or anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that HFD intake throughout adolescence impairs different types of memory through overactivation of specific hippocampal efferent pathways and that targeting these overactive pathways has therapeutic potential.

AB  - Purpose With technological advancements in radiation therapy for tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), high doses of ionizing radiation can be delivered to the tumors with improved accuracy. Despite the reduction of ionizing radiation-induced toxicity to surrounding tissues of the CNS, a wide array of side effects still occurs, particularly late-delayed changes. These alterations, such as white matter damages and neurocognitive impairments, are often debilitative and untreatable, significantly affecting the quality of life of these patients, especially children. Oligodendrocytes, a major class of glial cells, have been identified to be one of the targets of radiation toxicity and are recognized be involved in late-delayed radiation-induced neuropathological changes. These cells are responsible for forming the myelin sheaths that surround and insulate axons within the CNS. Here, the effects of ionizing radiation on the oligodendrocyte lineage as well as the common clinical manifestations resulting from radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes will be discussed. Potential prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against radiation-induced oligodendrocyte damage will also be considered. Conclusion Oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are radiosensitive cells of the CNS. Here, general responses of these cells to radiation exposure have been outlined. However, several findings have not been consistent across various studies. For instance, cognitive decline in irradiated animals was observed to be accompanied by obvious demyelination or white matter changes in several studies but not in others. Hence, further studies have to be conducted to elucidate the level of contribution of the oligodendrocyte lineage to the development of late-delayed effects of radiation exposure, as well as to classify the dose and brain region-specific responses of the oligodendrocyte lineage to radiation. Several potential therapeutic approaches against late-delayed changes have been discussed, such as the transplantation of OPCs into irradiated regions and implementation of exercise. Many of these approaches show promising results. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved in radiation-induced death of oligodendrocytes and OPCs would certainly aid in the development of novel protective and therapeutic strategies against the late-delayed effects of radiation.

AB  - Dysfunctional autophagy is linked to neuronal damage in ischemia/reperfusion injury. The Ras-related protein 7 (Rab7), a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, appears crucial for the progression of the autophagic flux, and its activity is strictly interconnected with the histone deacetylase Silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) and transcription factor Forkhead box class O1 (FoxO1). The present study assessed the neuroprotective role of melatonin in the modulation of the Sirt1/FoxO1/Rab7 axis in HT22 cells and organotypic hippocampal cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). The results showed that melatonin re-established physiological levels of autophagy and reduced propidium iodide-positive cells, speeding up autophagosome (AP) maturation and increasing lysosomal activity. Our study revealed that melatonin modulates autophagic pathways, increasing the expression of both Rab7 and FoxO1 and restoring the Sirt1 expression affected by OGD/R. In addition, the Sirt1 inhibitor EX-527 significantly reduced Rab7, Sirt1, and FoxO1 expression, as well as autolysosomes formation, and blocked the neuroprotective effect of melatonin. Overall, our findings provide, for the first time, new insights into the neuroprotective role of melatonin against ischemic injury through the activation of the Sirt1/FoxO1/Rab7 axis.

AB  - Endometriosis (EMs) is a disease that adversely affects women's health. Immune imbalance is an important factor contributing to EMs, and exosomes (Exo) play an important role in immunomodulation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from the blood of patients with EMs on macrophage polarization and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Exosomes were isolated from the serum of healthy controls (control exosomes) and patients with EMs (EMs exosomes). Macrophage polarization levels were detected using flow cytometry (FCM), RT-qPCR, and Western blot. Subsequently, we used RNA sequencing to analyze differential microRNAs (miRNA) and associated pathways. Electroporation techniques were used to modify the exosomes. The associated pathways were analyzed by Western blot. Finally, 12Z cells were co-cultured with macrophages of different polarizations, and the viability and metastasis of 12Z cells were calculated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), scratch, and Transwell. EMs exosomes induced M2-type polarization in macrophages. RNA sequencing results showed that miR-196a-5p was dramatically decreased in EMs exosomes, whereas overexpression of miR-196a-5p in EMs exosomes could inhibit the M2-type polarization of macrophages and activate the Hippo pathway. In addition, M2-type macrophages promoted 12Z cell proliferation and metastasis. These findings suggest that serum-derived exosomes encapsulating miR-196a-5p alleviate endometriosis by promoting M1-type macrophage polarization via Hippo pathway activation.

AB  - Background: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is known to affect cognitive functions, with particular concern for its impact on brain metabolic dynamics. Circadian rhythms, as a crucial mechanism for internal time regulation within organisms, significantly influence metabolic processes in the brain. This study aims to explore how HIRI affects hippocampal metabolism and its circadian rhythm differences in mice, and to analyze how these changes are associated with cognitive impairments. Methods: A C57BL/6 male mouse model was used, simulating HIRI through hepatic ischemia-reperfusion surgery, with a sham operation conducted for the control group. Cognitive functions were evaluated using open field tests, Y-maze tests, and novel object recognition tests. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) technology, combined with intravenous injection of [2-13C]-acetate and [1-13C]-glucose, was utilized to analyze metabolic changes in the hippocampus of HIRI mice at different circadian time points (Zeitgeber Time ZT0, 8:00 and ZT12, 20:00). Circadian rhythms regulate behavioral, physiological, and metabolic rhythms through transcriptional feedback loops, with ZT0 at dawn (lights on) and ZT12 at dusk (lights off). Results: HIRI mice exhibited significant cognitive impairments in behavioral tests, particularly in spatial memory and learning abilities. MRSI analysis revealed significant circadian rhythm differences in the concentration of metabolites in the hippocampus, with the enrichment concentrations of lactate, alanine, glutamate, and taurine showing different trends at ZT0 compared to ZT12, highlighting the important influence of circadian rhythms on metabolic dysregulation induced by HIRI. Conclusions: This study highlights the significant impact of HIRI on brain metabolic dynamics in mice, especially in the hippocampal area, and for the first time reveals the differences in these effects within circadian rhythms. These findings not only emphasize the association between HIRI-induced cognitive impairments and changes in brain metabolism but also point out the crucial role of circadian rhythms in this process, offering new metabolic targets and timing considerations for therapeutic strategies against HIRI-related cognitive disorders.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle are widely established to be the major risk factors for the development of long-term chronic conditions, such as type-2 diabetes (T2D). In this framework, where consumer's food choices are even more influenced by an ever-growing awareness on nutritional, environmental, and healthy aspects, the presence and identification of natural bioactive compounds are gaining increasing attention in the scientific community. Pharmacological treatment of T2D is based on the administration of molecules able to inhibit some key enzymes involved in the carbohydrate digestion and insulin secretion. The multiple side-effects of synthetic inhibitors led to an increased demand for natural food-derived anti-diabetic agents. The present work offers a new integrated approach for the identification and selection of new bioactive peptides, able to inhibit the key digestive enzymes implicated in the control of blood glucose level. The novelty lies in the development of a new, quick, and cost-effective integrated methodology supported by confirmed in vitro evidence. In fact, the present work successfully accomplished the identification of two selected candidates with a possible application in the diabetes management. Indeed, the functional and healthy role of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in human nutrition was assessed, highlighting its potential anti-diabetic properties. Inhibition of key metabolic enzymes linked to type-2-diabetes (T2D) by food-derived compounds is a preventive emerging strategy in the management of T2D. Here, the impact of Parmigiano-Reggiano (PR) cheese peptide fractions, at four different ripening times (12, 18, 24, and 30 months), on the enzymatic activity of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) as well as on the formation of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (fAGEs) was assessed. The PR peptide fractions were able to inhibit the selected enzymes and fAGEs formation. The 12-month-ripening PR sample was the most active against the three enzymes and fAGEs. Mass spectrometry analysis enabled the identification of 415 unique peptides, 54.9% of them common to the four PR samples. Forty-nine previously identified bioactive peptides were found, mostly characterized as angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors. The application of an integrated approach that combined peptidomics, in silico analysis, and a structure-activity relationship led to an efficient selection of 6 peptides with potential DPP-IV and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Peptide APFPE was identified as a potent novel DPP-IV inhibitor (IC50 = 49.5 +/- 0.5 mu mol/L).

AB  - Simple Summary MALDI-ToF MS analysis demonstrates major differences between Mycoplasma agalactiae type strain PG2 and strain GM139. Evaluation of the Vpma (variable proteins of M. agalactiae) phenotypic profiles of these two strains reveals that unlike PG2, GM139 expresses a single Vpma, namely VpmaV, and without any visible phase variation. Although the presence of only one Vpma seems to be sufficient for the pathogenesis of the GM139 strain, the absence of phase variation can compromise immune system evasion and spread to other anatomical sites in the host. Although mycoplasmas have a reduced genome and no cell wall, they have important mechanisms for the antigenic variation in surface lipoproteins that modulate their interactions with the host. Mycoplasma agalactiae, the main etiological agent of contagious agalactia, has a multigene family involved in the high-frequency phase variation in surface lipoproteins called variable proteins of M. agalactiae (Vpmas). The Vpma lipoproteins are involved in the immune evasion, colonization, dissemination, and persistence of M. agalactiae in the host. In this paper, we evaluate the Vpma phenotypic profiles of two different strains of M. agalactiae, namely, GM139 and the type strain PG2, to assess possible correlations between Vpma phase variability and the geographic localization, animal origin, and pathogenicity of these two strains. Using monospecific Vpma antibodies against individual Vpmas in immunoblots, we demonstrate that, unlike PG2, which expresses six Vpma proteins with high-frequency phase variation, colonies of GM139 predominantly express VpmaV and do not exhibit any sectoring phenotype for any Vpma. Since VpmaV is one of the most important Vpmas for cell adhesion and invasion, its predominant sole expression in GM139 without high-frequency variation may be the basis of the differential pathogenicity of GM139 and PG2. Additionally, MALDI-ToF MS analysis also demonstrates significant differences between these two strains and their relatedness with other M. agalactiae strains.

AB  - Adversity during early life, a critical period for brain development, increases vulnerability and can have a lasting impact on the brain and behaviour of a child. However, the long-term effects of cumulative early-life stressors on brain and behaviour are not well known. We studied a 2-hit rat model of early-life adversity using maternal separation (MS) and immune activation (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Rat pups underwent MS for 15 (control) or 180 (MS) minutes per day from postnatal day (P)2-14 and were administered saline or LPS (intraperitoneal) on P3. Open-field (OFT) and object-place recognition tests were performed on rat offspring at P33-35 and P42-50, respectively. The pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were removed at the experimental endpoint (P52-55) for mRNA expression. MS induced anxiety-like behaviour in OFT in male and reduced locomotor activity in both male and female offspring. LPS induced a subtle decline in memory in the object-place recognition test in male offspring. MS increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in PFC and ionised calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 expression in male hippocampus. MS and LPS resulted in distinct behavioural phenotypes in a sex-specific manner. The combination of MS and LPS had a synergistic effect on the anxiety-like behaviour, locomotor activity, and GFAP mRNA expression outcomes.

AB  - Regulation of the oxidative stress response is crucial for the management and prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The copper chaperone Antioxidant 1 (Atox1) plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular copper ion balance and impacting the antioxidant capacity of mitochondria, as well as the oxidative stress state of cells. However, it remains unknown whether Atox1 is involved in modulating oxidative stress following TBI. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of Atox1 in oxidative stress on neurons both in vivo and in vitro, and elucidated the underlying mechanism through culturing hippocampal HT -22 cells with Atox1 mutation. The expression of Atox1 was significantly diminished following TBI, while mice with overexpressed Atox1 exhibited a more preserved hippocampal structure and reduced levels of oxidative stress post-TBI. Furthermore, the mice displayed notable impairments in learning and memory functions after TBI, which were ameliorated by the overexpression of Atox1. In the stretch injury model of HT -22 cells, overexpression of Atox1 mitigated oxidative stress by preserving the normal morphology and network connectivity of mitochondria, as well as facilitating the elimination of damaged mitochondria. Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry revealed the binding of Atox1 to DJ -1. Knockdown of DJ -1 in HT -22 cells significantly impaired the antioxidant capacity of Atox1. Mutations in the copper -binding motif or sequestration of free copper led to a substantial decrease in the interaction between Atox1 and DJ -1, with overexpression of DJ -1 failing to restore the antioxidant capacity of Atox1 mutants. The findings suggest that DJ -1 mediates the ability of Atox1 to withstand oxidative stress. And targeting Atox1 could be a potential therapeutic approach for addressing post -traumatic neurological dysfunction.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in epilepsy genes result in a spectrum of clinical severity. One source of phenotypic heterogeneity is modifier genes that affect expressivity of a primary pathogenic variant. Mouse epilepsy models also display varying degrees of clinical severity on different genetic backgrounds. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Scn1a (Scn1a(+/-)) model Dravet syndrome, a severe epilepsy most often caused by SCN1A haploinsufficiency. Scn1a(+/-) mice recapitulate features of Dravet syndrome, including spontaneous seizures, sudden death, and cognitive/behavioral deficits. Scn1a(+/-) mice maintained on the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain have normal lifespan and no spontaneous seizures. In contrast, admixture with C57BL/6J (B6) results in epilepsy and premature lethality. We previously mapped Dravet Survival Modifier loci (Dsm1-Dsm5) responsible for strain-dependent differences in survival. Gabra2, encoding the GABA(A) alpha 2 subunit, was nominated as a candidate modifier at Dsm1. Direct measurement of GABA(A) receptors found lower abundance of alpha 2-containing receptors in hippocampal synapses of B6 mice relative to 129. We also identified a B6-specific single nucleotide deletion within Gabra2 that lowers mRNA and protein by nearly 50%. Repair of this deletion reestablished normal levels of Gabra2 expression. In this study, we used B6 mice with a repaired Gabra2 allele to evaluate Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of severity in Scn1a(+/-) mice. Gabra2 repair restored transcript and protein expression, increased abundance of alpha 2-containing GABA(A) receptors in hippocampal synapses, and rescued epilepsy phenotypes of Scn1a(+/-) mice. These findings validate Gabra2 as a genetic modifier of Dravet syndrome, and support enhancing function of alpha(2)-containing GABA(A) receptors as treatment strategy for Dravet syndrome.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevanc: Pyrolae herba (PH), a kind of Chinese herb, has been identified to have an antiinflammatory effect, while the potential for treating cognitive impairment (CI), as well as the underlying mechanisms, is unclear. Currently, the interaction between neuroinflammation and neural function play a critical role in pathophysiology of CI.Aim of the study: To elucidate therapeutic effect of PH for CI as well as its underlying mechanisms with LPStreated mice model.Methods and materials: In this study, male C57BL6/J mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection for 10 days to establish CI model and were administrated with PH for 14 days. We used piracetam as a positive control. Memory and spatial function was tested by Morris water maze (MWM). The level of inflammation-related cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10, IL-6) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum and western blot in hippocampus. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to measure the levels of ionized calcium binding linker molecule 1 (IBA-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), BrdU, Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) in hippocampus. The mRNA sequencing was used to screen the potential target of PH with therapeutic CI. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the gene alteration of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in hippocampus. We used western blot to determine protein expressions of TREM2 and its related signaling, as well as synaptic proteins in hippocampus.Results: The results revealed that LPS contributed to CI, and PH or piracetam treatment significantly ameliorated CI in MWM test. LPS contributed to increasing expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in serum and hippocampus, which both reversed by PH or piracetam. PH or piracetam could inhibit the activation of glial cells including microglia and astrocyte in the hippocampus in LPS-induced CI model. The mRNA sequencing and RT-PCR results showed that LPS significantly increased the gene expression of TREM2, which was reversed by PH. The alteration of TREM2 expression was the most significant among the 10 genes (TREM2, Slc24a2, Ptch2, Gck, Il1rapl1, Cadps2, Btbd11, Secisbp2l, Tenm3 and Prepl) in hippocampus. Protein results showed that LPS upregulated the expressions of TREM2 and its related proteins including DAP12, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) phosphorylation and ADAM 10, which were all reversed by PH or piracetam in hippocampus. Furthermore, LPS was capable of reducing the expression of BrdU and DCX co-labeled positive cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), which was reversed only by PH. Moreover, PH or piracetam treatment significantly increased the expression of Ki67 and DCX co-labeled positive cells in hippocampal DG. The expression of synapsin1 was obviously decreased by LPS , was significantly reversed by PH or piracetam.Conclusions: PH could alleviate CI by suppressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitigating astrocyte activity by restraining microglia's activation in hippocampus, further facilitating neurogenesis and proliferation, thereby enhancing pre-synaptic protein. This study highlighted on the clinical application of PH, which might promote the use of phytomedicine in CI patients.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) exposure to humans can occur through various routes, including the food chain, drinking water, skin contact, and respiration. NPs are plastics with a diameter of less than 100 nm and have the potential to accumulate in tissues, leading to toxic effects. This study aimed to investigate the neurotoxicity of polystyrene NPs on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rodent model. Toxicity screening of polystyrene NPs based on their charge revealed that cationic amine-modified polystyrene (PS-NH3+) exhibited cytotoxicity, while anionic carboxylate-modified polystyrene (PS-COO-) and neutral NPs (PS) did not. NPCs treated with PS-NH3+ showed a significant reduction in growth rate due to G1 cell cycle arrest. PS-NH3+ increased the expression of cell cycle arrest markers p21 and p27, while decreasing cyclin D expression in NPCs. Interestingly, PS-NH3 +accumulated in mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and energy depletion, which caused G1 cell cycle arrest. Prolonged exposure to PS-NH3+ in C17.2 NPCs increased the expression of p16 and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, indicating cellular senescence. In vivo studies using C57BL/6 mice demonstrated impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and memory retention after 10 days of PS-NH3+ administration. This study suggests that NPs could deplete neural stem cell pools in the brain by mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby adversely affecting hippocampal neurogenesis and neurocognitive functions.

Efforts must be made to explore methods for enhancing the rumen digestibility of wheat straw. The remarkable efficacy, specificity, and gentle operating conditions exhibited by biological enzymes in the processing and utilization of agricultural straws have engendered considerable interest among researchers. Hence, the identification of enzymes that can efficiently enhance the digestion of wheat straw in the rumen is of utmost significance. This study investigated a xylanase called RuXyn, which is a member of the GH 30 family, derived from the rumen metagenome. The findings demonstrate that the utilization of RuXyn can significantly enhance the ruminal digestibility of wheat straw by approximately 10 percentage points. This outcome signifies the emergence of a novel and highly efficient enzyme preparation that holds promise for the effective utilization of wheat straw, a by-product of crop production, in ruminants.Abstract The challenge of wheat straw as a ruminant feed is its low ruminal digestibility. This study investigated the impact of a xylanase called RuXyn, derived from the rumen metagenome of beef cattle, on the in vitro ruminal fermentation of wheat straw. RuXyn encoded 505 amino acids and was categorized within subfamily 8 of the glycosyl hydrolase 30 family. RuXyn was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed its highest level of activity at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. RuXyn primarily hydrolyzed xylan, while it did not show any noticeable activity towards other substrates, including carboxymethylcellulose and Avicel. At concentrations of 5 mM, Mn2+ and dithiothreitol significantly enhanced RuXyn's activity by 73% and 20%, respectively. RuXyn's activity was almost or completely inactivated in the presence of Cu2+, even at low concentrations. The main hydrolysis products of corncob xylan by RuXyn were xylopentose, xylotriose, and xylotetraose. RuXyn hydrolyzed wheat straw and rice straw more effectively than it did other agricultural by-products. A remarkable synergistic effect was observed between RuXyn and a cellulase cocktail on wheat straw hydrolysis. Supplementation with RuXyn increased dry matter digestibility; acetate, propionate, valerate, and total volatile fatty acid yields; NH3-N concentration, and total bacterial number during in vitro fermentation of wheat straw relative to the control. RuXyn's inactivity at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C was remedied by mutating proline 151 to phenylalanine and aspartic acid 204 to leucine, boosting activity to 20.3% and 21.8% of the maximum activity at the respective temperatures. As an exogenous enzyme preparation, RuXyn exhibits considerable potential to improve ruminal digestion and the utilization of wheat straw in ruminants. As far as we know, this is the first study on a GH30 xylanase promoting the ruminal fermentation of agricultural straws. The findings demonstrate that the utilization of RuXyn can significantly enhance the ruminal digestibility of wheat straw by approximately 10 percentage points. This outcome signifies the emergence of a novel and highly efficient enzyme preparation that holds promise for the effective utilization of wheat straw, a by-product of crop production, in ruminants.

AB  - The objective was to compare the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the pregnancy and lambing rate of treated ewes with a short-term progesterone (P4) injection during the breeding season. In Exp 1, non-lactating ewes (n = 158) were used and received P-4, three times every 48 h and received PGF(2 alpha) along with the last dose of P4. Ewe received hCG (n = 79, 3PHCG, IM) or GnRH (n = 79, 3PGnRH, IM) 24 h after the last dose of P4 treatment. In the Exp 2, lactating ewes (n = 62) received P4 and hCG (n = 24, 3PHCG) or GnRH (n = 24, 3PGnRH) similar to Exp 1, or considered as control (n = 14) and received PGF2 alpha 48 h before ram release. Rams were released into the studied ewe's flock 24 h after the hCG or GnRH administration, and pregnancy diagnosis was performed on day 50 after ram release. In Exp 1, all reproductive indices were not significant between groups except twin lambing rate, that was higher in the 3PHCG (11.3%) compared with the 3PGnRH (1.9%) group (p = .05). There were no significant differences in overall pregnancy and lambing rates between 3PHCG (70.9% and 67.1%) and 3PGnRH (69.6% and 68.4%) groups (p > .05). In Exp 2, all reproductive parameters were not significant between 3PHCG and 3PGnRH groups (p > .05). There was significant difference in overall oestrous rate between control (35.7%) and treatment (3PHCG, 70.9% and 3PGnRH, 79.2%) groups. To conclude, administration of GnRH can be a good alternative to hCG injection under field conditions.

AB  - Human rhinoviruses (RV) are among the most frequent human pathogens. As major causative agents of common colds they originate serious socioeconomic problems and huge expenditure every year, and they also exacerbate severe respiratory diseases. No anti-rhinoviral drugs or vaccines are available so far. Antiviral drug design may benefit from an understanding of the role during the infectious cycle of the interactions in the virion between the capsid and the viral nucleic acid. The genomic RNA inside the human RV virion forms a dodecahedral cage made of 30 double-stranded RNA elements that interact with equivalent sites at the capsid inner wall. RNA dodecahedral cages also occur in distantly related insect and plant viruses. However, the functional role(s) of the interactions between any dodecahedral cage and the capsid remained to be established. Here we describe an extensive structure-function mutational analysis of the capsid-RNA dodecahedral cage interface in the RV virion, to dissect the role of the interactions between the capsid and the cage-forming RNA duplexes in: (i) infection by RV; (ii) virus biological fitness; (iii) virion assembly; (iv) virion stability; and (v) viral RNA uncoating. The results reveal that the capsidbound dsRNA dodecahedral cage in the human RV virion is a multifunctional structural element. Two structurally overlapping subsets of RNA duplex-capsid interactions promote virus infectivity and biological fitness by respectively facilitating virion assembly or restraining the untimely, unproductive uncoating of the viral RNA genome. These results provide new insights into virion morphogenesis and genome uncoating, and have implications for antiviral drug design. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - ASCL1 is a neuroendocrine lineage-specific oncogenic driver of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), highly expressed in a significant fraction of tumors. However, similar to 25% of human SCLC are ASCL1-low and associated with low neuroendocrine fate and high MYC expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), we show that alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc in the mouse lung induce an ASCL1+ state of SCLC in multiple cells of origin. Genetic depletion of ASCL1 in MYC-driven SCLC dramatically inhibits tumor initiation and progression to the NEUROD1+ subtype of SCLC. Surprisingly, ASCL1 loss promotes a SOX9+ mesenchymal/neural crest stem-like state and the emergence of osteosarcoma and chondroid tumors, whose propensity is impacted by cell of origin. ASCL1 is critical for expression of key lineage-related transcription factors NKX2-1, FOXA2, and INSM1 and represses genes involved in the Hippo/Wnt/Notch developmental pathways in vivo. Importantly, ASCL1 represses a SOX9/RUNX1/RUNX2 program in vivo and SOX9 expression in human SCLC cells, suggesting a conserved function for ASCL1. Together, in a MYC-driven SCLC model, ASCL1 promotes neuroendocrine fate and represses the emergence of a SOX9+ nonendodermal stem-like fate that resembles neural crest.

AB  - An evaluation of morbidity and mortality in Steller sea lions (SSLs) Eumetopias jubatus under professional care identified a high prevalence of thyroid disease in aged animals. While studies have investigated the effects of age, season, nutrition, stressors, and pollutants on thyroid hormones in pinnipeds, data from individuals with known thyroid disease are lacking. Histopathological reports of adult SSLs in North American aquariums from 1979 to 2022 with banked serum (n = 14) were reviewed. Radioimmunoassays, which have been validated in this species, were used to determine triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine (fT4). A solid-phase chemiluminescent immunometric assay for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) quantification was validated by testing inter- and intra-assay repeatability, recovery, and parallelism. Lesions included follicular cysts (n = 5), adenoma with thyroglossal duct or follicular cysts (n = 2), medullary or follicular C-cell carcinoma with follicular cysts and nodular hyperplasia (n = 1), neuroendocrine carcinoma with follicular cysts (n = 1), and sarcomatoid carcinoma metastasis to the thyroid (n = 1). Significantly lower concentrations of TT3, TT4, and fT4 in SSLs with thyroid disease (n = 10) versus those without (n = 4) were attributed to space-occupying lesions, advanced age, and/or season. TSH was not significantly different between groups. Fifty percent of diseased SSL profiles were within reference ranges, and all individuals with lesions were clinically euthyroid. These data expand the current understanding of thyroid disease in SSLs and underscore the need for additional diagnostics (e.g. cervical ultrasound) concurrently with hormone assays to effectively screen for underlying abnormalities.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric disorder characterized by hyper-response to environmental cues as well as the associated depressive and cognitive dysfunctions. According to the key roles of hippocampus for cognitive and emotional regulation, improving hippocampal functions, particularly hippocampal neural plasticity, is the necessary pathway to attenuate the core symptoms of PTSD. The effects of the alternative therapies such as exercise and natural compounds to reduce PTSD symptoms and promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been widely demonstrated. However, what is the effect of combining the exercise with traditional Chinese medical compounds remains unknown. In current study, we evaluated the effects of catalpol, which showed the pro-neurogenic effects in previous report, in regulating exercise mediated PTSD therapeutic effects. With behavioral tests, we found that catalpol treatment promoted the effects of exercise to reduce the response of mice to dangerous cues, and simultaneously enhanced the antidepressant and cognitive protection effects. Moreover, by immunofluorescence we identified that catalpol promoted exercise-mediated hippocampal neurogenesis by enhancing the neural differentiation and mature neuronal survive. We further found that the promote effects of catalpol to exercise-induced environmental hyper-response, antidepressant effects and cognitive protective effects were all compromised by blocking neurogenesis with temozolomide (TMZ). This result indicates that hippocampal neurogenesis is prerequisite for catalpol to promote exercise-mediated brain functional improvement in PTSD model. In conclusion, our research identified the new function of natural compounds catalpol to promote the exercise mediated brain functional changes in PTSD model, which depend on its effect promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that irisin may act as a potential neurokine. Exercise and L-carnosine supplementation showed neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like conditions. However, the regulation of irisin in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impairment and its relation to insulin signalling remain to be investigated. This study was designed to compare the effect of swimming exercise and L-carnosine intake on serum, CSF and hippocampal irisin in rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ. Rats were recruited in swimming paradigm, received oral carnosine (100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle treated. After 5 weeks, rats were sacrificed after neurobehavioural testing. CSF and serum irisin were determined. Hippocampal tissues were used to assess expression of FNDC5/irisin, BDNF and proteins related to insulin signalling, in addition to beta-amyloid peptide and phosphorylated tau protein levels. We observed decreased hippocampal, but not CSF or serum, irisin in ICV-STZ-injected rats. Exercise and carnosine intake almost normalized hippocampal FNDC5/irisin expression which was associated with reduced soluble beta-amyloid peptide and phosphorylated tau protein, improved BDNF and insulin signalling proteins, with corresponding mitigated cognitive impairments. However, hippocampal FNDC5/irisin was not correlated with serum or CSF irisin levels. Histologically, both interventions ameliorated the hippocampal damage in STZ-injected rats. The current study reveals that carnosine is equivalent to exercise in reversing cognitive decline and Alzheimer's biomarkers. In both interventions, enhancement of hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and insulin signalling may be involved in mediating these neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Background Craving for alcohol, in other words powerful desire to drink after withdrawal, is an important contributor to the development and maintenance of alcoholism. Here, we studied the role of GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) on alcohol-seeking behavior in group-housed female mice. Methods We modeled alcohol-seeking behavior in C57Bl/6J female mice. The behavioral experiments in group-housed female mice were performed in an automated IntelliCage system. We conducted RT-qPCR analysis of Gdnf, Bdnf, Manf and Cdnf expression in different areas of the female mouse brain after alcohol drinking conditioning. We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing human GDNF or BDNF in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) after ten days of alcohol drinking conditioning and assessed alcohol-seeking behavior. Behavioral data were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, and statistically significant effects were followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. The student's t-test was used to analyze qPCR data. Results The RT-qPCR data showed that Gdnf mRNA level in NAc was more than four times higher (p < 0.0001) in the mice from the sweetened alcohol group compared to the water group. Our data showed a more than a two-fold decrease in Manf mRNA (p = 0.04) and Cdnf mRNA (p = 0.02) levels in the hippocampus and Manf mRNA in the VTA (p = 0.04) after alcohol consumption. Two-fold endogenous overexpression of Gdnf mRNA and lack of CDNF did not affect alcohol-seeking behavior. The AVV-GDNF overexpression in nucleus accumbens suppressed alcohol-seeking behavior while overexpression of BDNF did not. Conclusions The effect of increased endogenous Gdnf mRNA level in female mice upon alcohol drinking has remained unknown. Our data suggest that an increase in endogenous GDNF expression upon alcohol drinking occurs in response to the activation of another mesolimbic reward pathway participant.

AB  - Spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus) are terrestrial mammals that evolved unique scar-free regenerative wound-healing properties. Myofibroblasts (MFs) are the major scar-forming cell type in skin. We found that following traumatic injury to ear pinnae, MFs appeared rapidly in both Acomys and mouse yet persisted only in mouse. The timing of MF loss in Acomys correlated with wound closure, blastema differentiation, and nuclear localization of the Hippo pathway target protein Yap. Experiments in vitro revealed an accelerated PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation activity that maintained nuclear Yap in Acomys dermal fibroblasts (DFs) and was not detected in mouse or human DFs. Treatment of Acomys in vivo with the nuclear Yap-TEAD inhibitor verteporfin prolonged MF persistence and converted tissue regeneration to fibrosis. Forced Yap activity prevented and rescued TGF-beta 1-induced human MF formation in vitro. These results suggest that Acomys evolved modifications of Yap activity and MF fate important for scar-free regenerative wound healing in vivo.

AB  - Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a well-documented type 2 helper T (Th2) cell-mediated allergic disease that is accompanied by symptoms such as nasal rubbing, sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. Angelica gigas (AG) is traditional oriental medicine, and its dried root is widely used for the treatment of anemia, as a sedative, and as a blood tonic.
   Purpose: The effects of AG on allergic diseases including AR are currently unclear; therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of AG extract (AG-Ex) in ameliorating AR.
   Study design/methods: The cytotoxicity of AG-Ex was analyzed by EZ-Cytox or MTS assay in splenocytes, differentiated Th2 cells, and human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC). The changes of Th2 cells activation were determined by the secretion levels of cytokines and chemokines using cytometric bead array in splenocytes and differentiated Th2 cells. The expression levels of eotaxin-3 and periostin were analyzed using an ELISA. AR was induced by ovalbumin in BALB/c mice and the ameliorating effects of AG-Ex were assessed by their clinical symptoms.
   Results: The secretion of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 was inhibited by the AG-Ex treatment in the splenocytes and differentiated Th2 cells. The treatment also suppressed allergic responses including the secretion of eotaxin-3 and periostin in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC). Moreover, the administration of AG-Ex to the OVA-induced AR mice improved their clinical symptoms, including behavioral tests, immune cell counts, histopathological analysis, and changes in serum parameters.
   Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that AG-Ex ameliorates AR by inhibiting Th2 cell activation and could thus be utilized as a treatment for Th2-mediated allergic diseases in the future.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cheonwangbosim-dan (CWBSD) as a traditional herbal medicine prescription has been used for cognitive dysfunction in terms of heart blood deficiency, however, there were few researches for cognitive dysfunction and its mode of action. Aim of the study: This study was aimed to examine the effects of CWBSD on hypocholinergic-induced memory impaired mice and unveil its mechanism of action on cognitive function. Materials and methods: The standardized CWBSD was used in the present study. Several behavioral tests, including Y-maze task, the Morris water maze task (MWM), novel object recognition test (NORT) and passive avoidance test (PAT), were employed with administration of CWBSD (150, 500 or 1500 mg/kg) in scopolaminetreated mice. After behavioral tests, the mice were sacrificed and the Western blot analysis and electrophysiological analysis were conducted to investigate the mechanism of CWBSD on ameliorating cognitive function. Results: The administration of CWBSD improved cognitive functions measured by the Y-maze task, MWM, NORT and PAT in scopolamine-induced cognitive impaired mice. This memory improvement effect was associated with the activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKC )/calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) pathway via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B), and the activation of this pathway increased long-term potentiation in the brain of mice. Conclusion: The administration of CWBSD could ameliorate spatial memory, recognition memory and long-term memory, and such ameliorating activities would be derived from the activation of NMDA receptor-associated pathway with increase of LTP in the brain. These results suggests that CWBSD would be a candidate for a new dementia treatment.

AB  - The aging process impacts neural stem cells and causes a significant decline in neurogenesis that contributes to neuronal dysfunction leading to cognitive decline. Blueberries are rich in polyphenols and have been shown to improve cognition and memory in older humans. While our previous studies have shown that blueberry supplementations can increase neurogenesis in aged rodents, it is not clear whether this finding can be extrapolated to humans. We thus investigated the effects of blueberry treatments on adult hippocampal human neural progenitor cells (AHNPs) that are involved in neurogenesis and potentially in memory and other brain functions. Cultured AHNPs were treated with blueberry extract at different concentrations. Their viability, proliferation, and differentiation were evaluated with and without the presence of a cellular oxidative stressor, dopamine, and potential cellular mechanisms were also investigated. Our data showed that blueberry extract can significantly increase the viability and proliferation rates of control hippocampal AHNPs and can also reverse decreases in viability and proliferation induced by the cellular stressor dopamine. These effects may be associated with blueberry's anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and calcium-buffering properties. Polyphenol-rich berry extracts thus confer a neuroprotective effect on human hippocampal progenitor cells in vitro.

AB  - Compared with traditional tedious organic solvent-assisted separation process in natural medicinal chemistry, cytomembrane (CM) fishing technique became a more appealing and greener choice for screening bioactive components from natural products. However, its large-scale practical value was greatly weakened by the easy fall-off of CMs from magnetic supports, rooted in the instability of common Fe3O4 particles and their insufficient interaction with CMs. In this research, a new green biostable platform was developed for drug screening through the integration of hyperbranched quaternized hydrothermal magnetic carbon spheres (HQ-HMCSs) and CMs. The positive-charged HQ-HMCSs were constructed by chitosan-based hydrothermal carbonization onto Fe3O4 nanospheres and subsequent aqueous hyperbranching quaternization with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether and methylamine. The strong interaction between HQ-HMCSs and CMs was formed via electrostatic attraction of HQHMCSs to negative-charged CMs and covalent linkage derived from the epoxy-amine addition reactions. The chemically stable HMCSs and its integration with CMs contributed to dramatically higher stability and recyclability of bionic nanocomposites. With the fishing of osteoblast CMs integrated HQ-HMCSs, two novel potential anti-osteoporosis compounds, narcissoside and beta-ionone, were discovered from Hippophae rhamnoides L. Enhanced osteoblast proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, and mineralization levels proved their positive osteogenesis effects. Preliminary pharmacological investigation demonstrated their potential action on membrane proteins of estrogen receptor alpha and insulin-like growth factor 1. Furthermore, beta-ionone showed apparent therapeutic effects on osteogenic lesions in zebrafish. These results provide a green, stable, cost-efficient, and reliable access to rapid discovery of drug leads, which verifiably benefits the design of nanocarbon-based biocomposites with increasingly advanced functionality.

AB  - The bivariate relationships between brain structure, age, and episodic memory performance are well understood. Advancing age and poorer episodic memory performance are each associated with smaller brain volumes and lower cortical thickness measures, respectively. Advancing age is also known to be associated with poorer episodic memory task scores on average. However, the simultaneous interrelationship between all three factors-brain structure, age, and episodic memory-is not as well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the preservation of episodic memory function would modify the typical trajectory of age-related brain volume loss in regions known to support episodic memory function using linear mixed models in a large adult lifespan sample. We found that the model allowing for age and episodic memory scores to interact predicted the hippocampal volume better than simpler models. Furthermore, we found that a model including a fixed effect for age and episodic memory scores (but without the inclusion of the interaction term) predicted the cortical volumes marginally better than a simpler model in the prefrontal regions and significantly better in the posterior parietal regions. Finally, we observed that a model containing only a fixed effect for age (e.g., without the inclusion of memory scores) predicted the cortical thickness estimates and regional volume in a non-memory control region. Together, our findings provide support for the idea that the preservation of memory function in late life can buffer against typical patterns of age-related brain volume loss in regions known to support episodic memory.

AB  - Intracellular trafficking of AMPA receptors is a tightly regulated process which involves several adaptor proteins, and is crucial for the activity of excitatory synapses both in basal conditions and during synaptic plasticity. We found that, in rat hippocampal neurons, an intracellular pool of the tetraspanin TSPAN5 promotes exocytosis of AMPA receptors without affecting their internalisation. TSPAN5 mediates this function by interacting with the adaptor protein complex AP4 and Stargazin and possibly using recycling endosomes as a delivery route. This work highlights TSPAN5 as a new adaptor regulating AMPA receptor trafficking.

AB  - Object-vector (OV) cells are cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) that track an animal's distance and direction to objects in the environment. Their firing fields are defined by vectorial relationships to free-standing 3-dimensional (3D) objects of a variety of identities and shapes. However, the natural world contains a panorama of objects, ranging from discrete 3D items to flat two-dimensional (2D) surfaces, and it remains unclear what are the most fundamental features of objects that drive vectorial responses. Here we address this question by systematically changing features of experimental objects. Using an algorithm that robustly identifies OV firing fields, we show that the cells respond to a variety of 2D surfaces, with visual contrast as the most basic visual feature to elicit neural responses. The findings suggest that OV cells use plain visual features as vectorial anchoring points, allowing vector-guided navigation to proceed in environments with few free-standing landmarks.
   In order to understand more about which object features are the most influential when driving vectorial responses, Andersson et al. use an algorithm to reliably examine object-vector (OV) cells in mice. Their findings suggest that OV cells use visual features as anchoring points, allowing vector-guided navigation to proceed with reference to a wide range of visual landmarks.

AB  - According to principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the nose is the passage for exogenous evil to invade the body, while essential or volatile oils extracted from herbs have the effects of dispelling melancholy, repelling foulness, and resuscitation with aromatics. Inhalation aromatherapy can target the brain and has a potential therapeutic effect on mood disorders. However, in particular, the mechanism of the effect of inhalation aromatherapy on the olfactory mucosa (OM) of the nasal cavity at the peripheral level, the first step in olfactory detection, where olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) relay information to brain for signal processing, remains unclear. Here, we examined the roles of inhalation aromatherapy with compound essential oils derived from Bergamot, Peppermint and Rosa rugose on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression and explored potential therapeutic targets in the peripheral OM. We found that inhalation aromatherapy effectively ameliorated CUMS-induced depression and olfactory dysfunction in rats. Strikingly, inhalation aromatherapy improved pathological changes, significantly reduced apoptosis levels, and promoted olfactory neurogenesis in the OM, which may contribute to the beneficial effects on the olfactory function of depressed rats. Further, inhalation aromatherapy significantly may reverse inflammation levels in the OM through Sirt1/FKBP5/GR/NF kappa B signaling pathway, and prevented neuroinflammation in other parts of the olfactory system such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which may play a role in the olfactory impairments in rats with depression. Collectively, we have demonstrated that inhalation aromatherapy could efficiently prevent the local inflammatory responses in the OM of CUMS depression model rats. These findings provide new insights into the treatment of depression with aromatherapy, as well as new concept for the identification of novel antidepressant strategies.

AB  - BackgroundThe pathogenesis of epilepsy is complex, and current antiepileptic drugs do not effectively control the seizures. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates neuronal excitability, but its mechanism of action in epilepsy is not clear. In this paper, we investigated the effect of CPEB3 on seizures and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanism.MethodsBioinformatics-based search for genes closely associated with epilepsy. Changes in expression and cellular localization of CPEB3 in epilepsy were verified by western blotting (WB) and Immunofluorescence staining. Subsequently, The adeno-associated virus was employed to overexpress or knockdown in mice. Behavioral experiments verified the effect of CPEB3 on epileptic phenotype, and the molecular mechanism of CPEB3 affecting epileptic phenotype was explored by WB, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP).ResultsThe results were that CPEB3 was downregulated epilepsy in model mice and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and co-expressed with neurons. Behavioral experiments have shown that CPEB3 negatively regulates epilepsy phenotype in mice. In addition, exogenous CPEB3 can also bind to the mRNA of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and inhibit its translation, resulting in lower levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3, reduced nuclear translocation of STAT3, and decreased STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, suppressing the expression of NMDAR subunits, which attenuate the seizure degree and susceptibility of epileptic mice.ConclusionThese findings suggest that CPEB3 may influence excitability and susceptibility in epileptic mice by regulating STAT3 translation and transcriptional activities to promote NMDARs expression. This mechanism could offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for epilepsy.

AB  - Microcin C7 (McC) as a viable immunomodulator peptidecan be apotential solution for pathogenic microbial infection in the post-antibioticera and has gained substantial attention. This study was designedto evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of Microcin C7 in a cyclophosphamide(CTX)-induced immunodeficient mouse model. We show that Microcin C7treatment significantly alleviated the CTX-caused body weight loss,improved the feed and water consumption to improve the state of themice, and elevated the absolute number and proportion of peripheralblood lymphocytes as well as the level of hemoglobulin. We furtheraim to characterize the phenotypes of the immune function and intestinalhealth profiles. The results demonstrate that Microcin C7 treatmentincreased serum levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, interleukin6, and hemolysin, promoted splenic lymphocyte proliferation inducedby concanavalin A and LPS, and enhanced the phagocytosis of peritonealmacrophages immunized by sheep red blood cells. Additionally, MicrocinC7 treatment decreased levels of diamine oxidase and d-lactate,ameliorated CTX-induced intestinal morphological damage, and increasedthe levels of zonula occluden 1, occludin, claudin-1, mucin 2, andsecretary IgA in the jejunum and colon. Moreover, Microcin C7 administrationis sufficient to reverse CTX-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosisby increasing the number of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, decreasing thenumber of Escherichia coli in coloniccontents. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Microcin C7 mayhave protective and immunomodulatory functions and could be a potentialcandidate used in animal feed, functional foods, and immunologicalregimens..

AB  - Background: The objective was to investigate the impact of signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 9 (SLAMF9) on myocardial infarction (MI) and its mechanisms. Methods: SLAMF9 expression in MI rats was firstly measured. SLAMF9 effect on cardiac functions, myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation in MI rats was explored using echocardiography, HE staining, masson staining, wheat germ agglutinin staining, western blot, TUNEL staining and qRT-PCR. Meanwhile, SLAMF9 effect on the viability, apoptosis, and inflammation in H9C2 cells was investigated by CCK-8 assay, TUNEL staining and western blot. Moreover, the potential mechanisms of SLAMF9 were investigated using western blot, ELISA and TUNEL staining after different treatment. Results: SLAMF9 expression was upregulated in MI rats. SLAMF9 knockdown ameliorated heart damage, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammatory response in MI rats. Similarly, SLAMF9 silencing in macrophages attenuated the apoptosis and inflammatory response in H/R-induced H9C2 cells. Moreover, SLAMF9 knockdown inhibited Hippo-Yap pathway in MI in vitro and in vivo. Besides, SLAMF9 knockdown in macrophages suppressed the activation of Hippo-Yap pathway in H9C2 cells by inhibiting TNF-alpha release. Additionally, LATS1 overexpression in H9C2 cells reversed the effect of SLAMF9 silencing on the apoptosis and inflammatory response in H/R-induced H9C2 cells. Meanwhile, PY-60 treatment in H9C2 cells reversed the effect of SLAMF9 overexpression on the apoptosis and inflammatory response in H/R-induced H9C2 cells. Conclusion: The absence of SLAMF9 led to a reduction in TNF-alpha secretion in macrophages, consequently repressing Hippo-Yap pathway in cardiomyocytes, and ultimately ameliorating myocardial damage, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation in MI.

AB  - Simple Summary The main aim of the present study was to ascertain the effect of two feeding schedules (including copepods and Artemia nauplii) on the early development and physiology of seahorse Hippocampus reidi juveniles. For that, we analyzed seahorse performance (growth and survival) and trophic patterns by means of stable isotopes. Our results highlight that the welfare and condition of juveniles were enhanced by extending the period of feeding on copepods up to day 10 after the male's pouch release. The analysis of turnover rates for delta C-13 and delta N-15 revealed that switching copepods to Artemia nauplii at earlier developmental stages would reduce prey assimilation resulting in lower growth rates and survivals. The present study also provides for the diet-tissue discrimination factors for delta C-13 and delta N-15 in seahorse juveniles for the first time. The initial development of seahorse juveniles is characterized by low digestion capabilities. Stable isotope analysis is an effective tool in studies of trophic food webs and animal feeding patterns. The present study provides new insights for the understanding of growth and food assimilation in early developing seahorses following a laboratory diet switch. The study was performed in the early life stages of the seahorse Hippocampus reidi by assessing the influence of diet shift on changes and turnovers in carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope in juveniles. Newborn seahorses were fed for 60 days following two feeding schedules (A6 and A11) based initially on copepods Acartia tonsa and subsequently on Artemia nauplii (since days 6 and 11, respectively). After the prey shift, we determined delta C-13 and delta N-15 turnover rates as functions of change in either body mass (fitting model G) and days of development (fitting model D), contributions of metabolism and growth to those turnover rates, and diet-tissue discrimination factors. Survival, final dry weight, and final standard length for diet A11 were higher compared to diet A6. The shift from copepods to Artemia led to fast initial enrichments in delta C-13 and delta N-15. Afterwards, the enrichment was gradually reduced until the isotopic equilibrium with the diet was reached. In most cases, both fitting models performed similarly. The isotopic analysis revealed that 100% of tissue turnover was attributed to growth in diet A11, whereas 19-25% was linked to metabolism in diet A6. Diet-tissue discrimination factors were estimated for the first time in seahorse juveniles, resulting in higher estimates for diet A11 (2.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand for delta C-13; 2.5 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand for delta N-15) than in diet A6 (1.8 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for delta C-13; 1.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for delta N-15). This study highlights the relevance of feeding on copepods and their effect on isotopic patterns and discrimination factors in seahorse juveniles after a dietary shift. Regarding the application of the results achieved in relation to the feeding schedules in the rearing of H. reidi, a long period of feeding on copepods during the first days of development is highly recommended.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized and functionally compartmentalized cells. Under basal conditions, the biogenesis of autophagic vesicles (AVs) was previously shown to take place in the axon tip. As the sequestration of autophagic cargo occurs during the formation of nascent AVs, this would mean that only axonal proteins can be degraded via macroautophagy/autophagy, unless AV biogenesis can also take place on demand, in other neuronal compartments. Our work shows that indeed, activation of NMDA or group I metabotropic glutamate receptors during long-term synaptic depression (LTD) triggers the biogenesis of AVs locally in dendrites. Under these conditions, nascent dendritic AVs are required for synaptic plasticity, as they sequester postsynaptic proteins, whose removal from the postsynapse is necessary for LTD.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Cynara cardunculus leaf ethanol extract on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex and liver of high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Food intake, body weight, visceral fat weight, and liver weight were also evaluated. Male Swiss mice were divided into control (low-fat purified diet) and obese (high-fat purified diet) groups. After 6 weeks, mice were divided into control + saline, control + C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract, obese + saline, obese + C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract. Cynara cardunculus leaf ethanol extract (1600 mg/kg/day) or saline was administered orally for 4 weeks. Brain structures (hypothalamus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebral cortex) and liver were removed. Treatment with C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract did not affect body weight but did reduce visceral fat. Obesity can cause inflammation and oxidative stress and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes in brain structures. Treatment with ethanolic extract of C. cardunculus leaves partially reversed the changes in inflammatory damage parameters and oxidative damage parameters and attenuated changes in the antioxidant defense. The C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract benefited from the brains of obese animals by partially reversing the changes caused by the consumption of a high-fat diet and the consequent obesity. These results corroborate those of studies indicating that the C. cardunculus leaf ethanol extract can contribute to the treatment of obesity.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer prevalent among adolescents and young adults, notorious for its tendency to metastasize to the lungs. This research delves into the molecular foundations of osteosarcoma by examining the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its interaction with the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Through analysis of transcriptomic data from the TARGET-OS dataset and control samples from GTEx, we identified a set of 131 genes that link high expression profiles in osteosarcoma with the Hippo pathway. A focused examination through univariate Cox regression analysis revealed eight key genes (DLG5, WNT11, TGFB2, DLG4, WNT16, ID2, WNT10B, and WNT10A) with a significant correlation to patient outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of these genes delineated two distinct patient groups with significantly different survival rates, a finding supported by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Further investigation into immune cell infiltration and expression profiles of immunoregulatory factors uncovered a notable pattern of immune evasion in the group with poorer prognosis, marked by reduced effector immune cell activity and lower levels of immunostimulatory factors. Single-cell sequencing highlighted the cellular diversity within osteosarcoma samples and identified markers differentiating malignant from nonmalignant cells, correlating these markers with prognostic risk scores. Our results emphasize the critical prognostic value of Hippo pathway genes and the TME in osteosarcoma, shedding light on new avenues for therapeutic intervention and patient-specific treatment strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia may damage the brain, leading to motor, cognitive, and auditory abnormalities. We recently discovered that bilirubin might act by controlling the genetic developmental program of the cerebellum, a region of the brain well known to be susceptible to bilirubin-induced damage. In this paper, we expand the study of the potential impact of bilirubin in the control of postnatal brain development to brain regions better correlating with human symptoms. The maximal abnormalities of structure and cell shape (histology) were detected 9 days after birth, fully recovering later on. Differently, the analysis of the gene expression revealed transient alterations (early after birth, then recovering) in the hippocampus (memory, learning, and cognition) and inferior colliculi (auditory functions), but permanent (until adulthood) changes in the areas of the brain involved in the control of movements, information confirmed by the abnormal results on the behavioral tests. These new findings are well in agreement with the clinic and open a way for better deciphering the neurotoxic features of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic approaches. Recent findings indicated aberrant epigenetic control of the central nervous system (CNS) development in hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats as an additional cause of cerebellar hypoplasia, the landmark of bilirubin neurotoxicity in rodents. Because the symptoms in severely hyperbilirubinemic human neonates suggest other regions as privileged targets of bilirubin neurotoxicity, we expanded the study of the potential impact of bilirubin on the control of postnatal brain development to regions correlating with human symptoms. Histology, transcriptomic, gene correlation, and behavioral studies were performed. The histology revealed widespread perturbation 9 days after birth, restoring in adulthood. At the genetic level, regional differences were noticed. Bilirubin affected synaptogenesis, repair, differentiation, energy, extracellular matrix development, etc., with transient alterations in the hippocampus (memory, learning, and cognition) and inferior colliculi (auditory functions) but permanent changes in the parietal cortex. Behavioral tests confirmed the presence of a permanent motor disability. The data correlate well both with the clinic description of neonatal bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity, as well as with the neurologic syndromes reported in adults that suffered neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The results pave the way for better deciphering the neurotoxic features of bilirubin and evaluating deeply the efficacy of new therapeutic approaches against the acute and long-lasting sequels of bilirubin neurotoxicity.

AB  - Dendritic spines are essential for synaptic function because they constitute the postsynaptic compartment of the neurons that receives the most excitatory input. The extracellularly shorter variant of the presynaptic cell adhesion molecules neurexins, beta-neurexin, has been implicated in various aspects of synaptic function, including neurotransmitter release. However, its role in developing or stabilizing dendritic spines as fundamental computational units of excitatory synapses has remained unclear. Here, we show through morphological analysis that the deletion of beta-neurexins in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in hippocampal tissue in vivo affects presynaptic dense-core vesicles, as hypothesized earlier, and, unexpectedly, alters the postsynaptic spine structure. Specifically, we observed that the absence of beta-neurexins led to an increase in filopodial-like protrusions in vitro and more mature mushroom-type spines in the CA1 region of adult knockout mice. In addition, the deletion of beta-neurexins caused alterations in the spine head dimension and an increase in spines with perforations of their postsynaptic density but no changes in the overall number of spines or synapses. Our results indicate that presynaptic beta-neurexins play a role across the synaptic cleft, possibly by aligning with postsynaptic binding partners and glutamate receptors via transsynaptic columns.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an unremitting neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebral amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation and gradual decline in cognitive function. Changes in brain energy metabolism arise in the preclinical phase of AD, suggesting an important metabolic component of early AD pathology. Neurons and astrocytes function in close metabolic collaboration, which is essential for the recycling of neurotransmitters in the synapse. However, this crucial metabolic interplay during the early stages of AD development has not been sufficiently investigated. Here, we provide an integrative analysis of cellular metabolism during the early stages of A beta accumulation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Our electrophysiological examination revealed an increase in spontaneous excitatory signaling in the 5xFAD hippocampus. This hyperactive neuronal phenotype coincided with decreased hippocampal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism mapped by stable C-13 isotope tracing. Particularly, reduced astrocyte TCA cycle activity and decreased glutamine synthesis led to hampered neuronal GABA synthesis in the 5xFAD hippocampus. In contrast, the cerebral cortex of 5xFAD mice displayed an elevated capacity for oxidative glucose metabolism, which may suggest a metabolic compensation in this brain region. We found limited changes when we explored the brain proteome and metabolome of the 5xFAD mice, supporting that the functional metabolic disturbances between neurons and astrocytes are early primary events in AD pathology. In addition, synaptic mitochondrial and glycolytic function was selectively impaired in the 5xFAD hippocampus, whereas non-synaptic mitochondrial function was maintained. These findings were supported by ultrastructural analyses demonstrating disruptions in mitochondrial morphology, particularly in the 5xFAD hippocampus. Collectively, our study reveals complex regional and cell-specific metabolic adaptations in the early stages of amyloid pathology, which may be fundamental for the progressing synaptic dysfunctions in AD.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), usually accompanied by metabolic disorders. However, the metabolic changes in diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) patients, especially compared to T2DM groups, are not fully understood. Due to the subtle differences in metabolic alterations between DCD groups and T2DM groups, the comprehensive detection of the untargeted metabolic profiles of hippocampus and urine samples of rats was conducted by LC-MS, considering the different ionization modes and polarities of the examined compounds, and feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) was performed to help identify differential metabolites from a comprehensive perspective in this study. In addition, an association analysis of the differential metabolites in hippocampus and urine was conducted by the O2PLS model. Finally, a total of 71 hippocampal tissue differential metabolites and 179 urine differential metabolites were identified. The pathway enrichment results showed that glutamine and glutamate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, glycerol phospholipid metabolism, TCA cycle, and arginine biosynthesis in the hippocampus of DCD animals were changed. Seven metabolites (AUC > 0.9) in urine appeared as key differential metabolites that might reflect metabolic changes in the target tissue of DCD rats. This study showed that FBMN facilitated the comprehensive identification of differential metabolites in DCD rats. The differential metabolites may suggest an underlying DCD and be considered as potential biomarkers for DCD. Large samples and clinical experiments are needed for the subsequent elucidation of the possible mechanisms leading to these alterations and the verification of potential biomarkers.

AB  - Excess dietary salt reduces resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vascular reactivity, which can limit the fueling of neuronal metabolism. It is hitherto unknown whether metabolic derangements induced by high-salt-diet (HSD) exposure during adulthood are reversed by reducing salt intake. In this study, male and female mice were fed an HSD from 9 to 16 months of age, followed by a normal-salt diet (ND) thereafter until 23 months of age. Controls were continuously fed either ND or HSD. CBF and metabolite profiles were determined longitudinally by arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. HSD reduced cortical and hippocampal CBF, which recovered after dietary salt normalization, and affected hippocampal but not cortical metabolite profiles. Compared to ND, HSD increased hippocampal glutamine and phosphocreatine levels and decreased creatine and choline levels. Dietary reversal only allowed recovery of glutamine levels. Histology analyses revealed that HSD reduced the dendritic arborization and spine density of cortical and hippocampal neurons, which were not recovered after dietary salt normalization. We conclude that sustained HSD exposure throughout adulthood causes permanent structural and metabolic alterations to the mouse brain that are not fully normalized by lowering dietary salt during aging.

AB  - Since its first emergence in December 2019, the world has witnessed the eruption of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have led to increased viral transmissibility and pathogenicity due to sustained local viral transmission. Zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions have further raised concerns as they could result in the emergence of viral variants with a novel antigenicity and transmissibility that could jeopardize the vaccine efficacy. To understand the viral evolution during such transmissions, 1016 whole-genome sequences (deposited in GISAID as of March 7, 2022) (from 18 countries) corresponding to mink, cat, deer, dog, hyena, tiger, lion, gorilla, Syrian hamster, leopard cat, fishing cat, bear cat, coati, ferret, snow leopard and green monkey have been analysed here. Intriguingly, phyloproteome analysis indicate that Nsp2:R218C, Nsp2:D268-(deletion), Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L, Nsp2:A192V, ORF3a protein:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R/L, Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L and N protein:A220V are moderate or high recurring and clade decisive mutations, leading to 6 primary clades during the early stage of pandemic. Most interestingly, the human evolved delta variant having a combination of 26 (clade decisive) mutations defines the seventh clade and transmits to non-human hosts across the globe without exhibiting any country-specific mutation(s). Nonetheless, Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L together with (i)N protein:R203K,N protein:G204R/L,Spike:V70-, Spike:H69-, Nsp12:T739I, and Nsp1:M85-, (ii)Nsp2:A192V, Nsp3:D178Y, (iii)Nsp2:T85I, N protein:P67S and ORF3a protein:Q57H and (iv)Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L, N protein:A220V and Spike:F486I are specific to Denmark, Netherlands, USA and Latvia respectively and, (v)Nsp2:D268- and Nsp13:R292C that are devoid of Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L is specific to Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 variants consisting of these mutations are also seen in the human SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the same country. Independent country-specific SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution further indicates distinct epidemiological dynamics during zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions. Thus, the results presented here indicate the need for the surveillance of viral evolution in non-human hosts also during the future pandemic.

AB  - Understanding the regulatory mechanism by which cardiomyocyte proliferation transitions to endoreplication and cell cycle arrest during the neonatal period is crucial for identifying proproliferative factors and developing regenerative therapies.
   We used a transgenic mouse model based on the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system to isolate and characterize cycling cardiomyocytes at different cell cycle stages at a single-cell resolution. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cycling and noncycling cardiomyocytes was performed at postnatal days 0 (P0) and 7 (P7).
   The FUCCI system proved to be efficient for the identification of cycling cardiomyocytes with the highest mitotic activity at birth, followed by a gradual decline in the number of cycling and mitotic cardiomyocytes during the neonatal period. Cardiomyocytes showed premature cell cycle exit at G1/S shortly after birth and delayed G1/S progression during endoreplication at P7. Single-cell RNA-seq confirmed previously described signaling pathways involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation (Erbb2 and Hippo/YAP), and maturation-related transcriptional changes during postnatal development, including the metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, we generated transcriptional profiles specific to cell division and endoreplication in cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages that may facilitate the identification of genes important for adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.
   In conclusion, the FUCCI mouse provides a valuable system to study cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity at single cell resolution that can help to decipher the switch from cardiomyocyte proliferation to endoreplication, and to revert this process to facilitate endogenous repair.

AB  - Agricultural processing by-product have been used as the feed stock for effluent treatment to promote the utilization of agricultural waste, the development of green sustainable and construct a green ecological circle nowadays. Based on camellia oleifera shells, attapulgite, and ferric chloride, a novel iron oxide loaded biochar/attapulgite composite (Fe-BC/A) was synthesized via a one-step pyrolysis process and as a low-priced and efficient adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution. The structure and composition of Fe-BC/A were characterized by SEM-EDS, FT-IR, XRD, and XPS, which confirmed iron oxide (analogous to alpha-Fe2O3 and beta-FeOOH) and attapulgite clay were successfully incorporated with biochar. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) by Fe-BC/A was 107 mg/g at pH 2.0, which was much higher than the original biochars (BC: 54.38 mg/g) and biochar/attapulgite composites (BC/A: 81.75 mg/g). The adsorption behavior of Fe-BC/A fitted better with pseudo second-order model and Freundlich model, which indicated that multilayer chemisorption might dominate Cr(VI) adsorption. The thermodynamic analysis of Fe-BC/A represented that removal of Cr(VI) was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Batch experiments results demonstrated that Fe-BC/A had great adsorption capability of Cr(VI) in a broad pH extent of 2.0-10.0, whose most favorable elimination for Cr(VI) at pH of 2.0 and the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) was about 80% at pH = 10 (C-0 = 100 mg/L, 30 degrees C). Fe-BC/A exhibited a prominent tolerance to the coexisting ions during Cr(VI) removal and only a slight decrease (8.27%) in elimination efficiency after five adsorption-desorption cycles. Mechanism study revealed that electrostatic attraction, reduction, anion exchange, and complexation were involved in the removal of Cr(VI). This study implied the potential practical application of Fe-BC/A in the future Cr(VI) remediation from wastewater.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bu-Wang San (BWS) is a prominent traditional Chinese medicine known for calming the mind and promoting intelligence. It has been reported to improve learning and memory, enhance memory ability, and promote synaptic plasticity. However, the complexity of the material basis and the diversity of therapeutic targets of BWS on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been elucidated. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic material basis and the mechanism of BWS in AD treatment by comprehensively analyzing multiple GEO datasets of the human hippocampus, network pharmacology, and multi-platform metabolomics validation. Materials and methods: Three GEO datasets of the human hippocampus were utilized to identify AD-associated targets using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential analysis. Network pharmacology analyses were performed to investigate BWS's therapeutic material basis and predict the therapeutic targets of BWS on AD. A rat model was induced through the concurrent administration of AlCl3 and D-galactose to validate BWS's therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in AD. To validate the results of GEO data mining and network pharmacology, a comprehensive metabolomics approach integrating gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was conducted on rat serum samples to uncover potential metabolic alterations and their associated pathways. Results: A total of 6367 genes were selected as AD drug targets through WGCNA analysis and enrichment analysis of disease-associated gene expression profiles in the GEO database. Network pharmacology was performed in this study for the identification of potential interactions between the components of BWS and its targets, TP53, STAT3, EGFR, MAOA, NOS3, PPARG, PRKCA, MAPK8, AChE, ARG1, among others, which were among the top 25 highest probable targets of BWS acting on AD. The multi-platform metabolomics indicated that amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways, and other pathways may be associated with the AD model based on AlCl3 and D-galactose. The comparison of differential metabolites between the AD model group and the BWS intervention group revealed that 66 of the 97 differential metabolites exhibited a pullback trend, indicating a potential therapeutic effect of BWS on these metabolites. Conclusion: This study builds a systematic strategy combining GEO datasets, network pharmacology, and multiplatform metabolomics and provides valuable insights into the pharmacological mechanism of BWS on AD. The results suggest that BWS may exert its therapeutic effects on AD by modulating the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathway and acting on the drug targets of ARG1, MAOA, AChE, XDH, GAD2 et al. This strategy provides a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine in treating AD at a systematic level.

AB  - Alternative splicing is a fundamental mechanism that generates functionally distinct proteins from individual genes, contributing to gene regulation and proteomic diversity. In Drosophila, the bunched (bun) gene, a member of the TSC-22 domain gene family, undergoes alternative splicing, yielding diverse protein isoforms involved in crucial biological processes. Nevertheless, the specific roles and regulatory mechanisms of each isoform remain elusive. Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce targeted deletions within the endogenous locus of the bun gene, resulting in the removal of either long or short isoforms. We discovered that the short isoforms demonstrated a growth-suppressive role, whereas the long isoforms exhibited a growth-promoting effect. Surprisingly, the long isoforms exhibited a remarkable dual functionality, as both deletion and amplification of long isoform expression impede the excess growth induced by Hippo pathway inactivation. Mechanistically, ectopically expressed Bun long isoforms act as the transcriptional suppressor by competitively binding to targets' promoter regions in conjunction with Yorkie/Scalloped (Yki/Sd), thereby inhibiting its transcriptional outputs and ultimately leading to the growth suppression. These findings unveil the intricate interaction between distinct spliced isoforms of Bun and oncogenic outcomes, highlighting Bun long isoforms as the critical transcription suppressor regulating Hippo pathway inactivation-mediated growth and tumorigenesis in Drosophila.

AB  - In a previous study [H. Shintaku et al., Sensors and Actuators A: Physical 158 (2010): 183-192], an artificially developed auditory sensor device showed a frequency selectivity in the range from 6.6 to 19.8 kHz in air and from 1.4 to 4.9 kHz in liquid. Furthermore, the sensor succeeded in obtaining auditory brain-stem responses in deafened guinea pigs [T. Inaoka et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 108 (2011): 18390-18395]. Since then, several research groups have developed piezoelectric auditory devices that have the capability of acoustic/electric conversion. However, the piezoelectric devices are required to be optimally designed with respect to the frequency range in liquids. In the present study, focusing on the trapezoidal shape of the piezoelectric membrane, the vibration characteristics are numerically and experimentally investigated. In the numerical analysis, solving a three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem, resonant frequencies of the trapezoidal membrane are evaluated. Herein, Young's modulus of the membrane, which is made of polyvinylidene difluoride and is different from that of bulk, is properly determined to reproduce the experimental results measured in air. Using the modified elastic modulus for the membrane, the vibration modes and resonant frequencies in liquid are in good agreement with experimental results. It is also found that the resonant characteristics of the artificial basilar membrane for guinea pigs are quantitatively reproduced, considering the fluid-structure interaction. The present numerical method predicts experimental results and is available to improve the frequency selectivity of the piezoelectric membranes for artificial cochlear devices.

AB  - Genetic improvement of quality traits in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) through conventional breeding methods has been limited, because tea quality is a difficult and expensive trait to measure. Genomic selection (GS) is suitable for predicting such complex traits, as it uses genome wide markers to estimate the genetic values of individuals. We compared the prediction accuracies of six genomic prediction models including Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), BayesA, BayesB, BayesC and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces models incorporating the pedigree relationship namely; RKHS-pedigree, RKHS-markers and RKHS markers and pedigree (RKHS-MP) to determine the breeding values for 12 tea quality traits. One hundred and three tea genotypes were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotyped using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in replicated trials. We also compared the effect of trait heritability and training population size on prediction accuracies. The traits with the highest prediction accuracies were; theogallin (0.59), epicatechin gallate (ECG) (0.56) and theobromine (0.61), while the traits with the lowest prediction accuracies were theanine (0.32) and caffeine (0.39). The performance of all the GS models were almost the same, with BRR (0.53), BayesA (0.52), GBLUP (0.50) and RKHS-MP (0.50) performing slightly better than the others. Heritability estimates were moderate to high (0.35-0.92). Prediction accuracies increased with increasing training population size and trait heritability. We conclude that the moderate to high prediction accuracies observed suggests GS is a promising approach in tea improvement and could be implemented in breeding programmes.

AB  - The synaptic expression of glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) type is dynamically controlled by interaction with binding partners and auxiliary proteins. These proteins can be regulated by posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination. In this work, we investigated the regulation of glutamate receptor interacting protein-associated protein 1 (GRASP1) by ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms and its impact on surface expression and activity of synaptic AMPA receptors. Cotransfection of GFP-ubiquitin decreased myc-GRASP1 protein levels in HEK293T cells, and this effect was inhibited upon transfection of an ubiquitin mutant that cannot be ubiquitinated on Lys48. In addition, transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with GFP-ubiquitin reduced the dendritic levels of endogenous GRASP1 and decreased the surface expression of GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits, an effect that was partly reversed by cotransfection with GRASP1. Similarly, transfection of hippocampal neurons with GFP-ubiquitin decreased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by Ca2+-impermeable AMPA receptors, and this effect was abrogated by cotransfection of GRASP1. Together, the results show a role for ubiquitination in the regulation of the postsynaptic protein GRASP1, which has an impact on the surface distribution of AMPA receptors and on their activity at the synapse.

AB  - Background: Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a metabolic disease characterized by the increased blood glucose level, insulin deficiency or ineffectiveness, may cause structural and functional disorders in the brain. L- Theanine (LTN) has the relaxing, psychoactive, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and antinecrotic properties, and regulates the functions of hippocampus (HP) in brain. In the present study, the aim was to identify the effects LTN on the levels of BDNF, insulin and adipocytokines (TNF-a, leptin, adiponectin and resistin) in both HP and serum of diabetic rats. Methods: 32 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n 1/4 8/group): Control, LTN, DM and DM thorn LTN. Diabetes was induced by by nicotinamide/streptozotocin. 200 mg/kg/day LTN treatment was applied for 28 days. The serum and hippocampal levels of the parameters were determined by using commercial ELISA kits. Additionally, HP tissues examined histopathologically. Results: LTN treatment significantly decreased leptin and adiponectin levels in HP tissues in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Although it decreased the insulin level in both serum and HP, this was not statistically sig-nificant. No significant effect on other parameters was observed (p > 0.05). In histopathological analysis, although the damage was reduced by LTN in all sections of HP, this change was significant mainly in CA3 region (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that LTN has the ability to reduce hippocampal degeneration and modu-lates adipocytokines in diabetic rats. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acrolein, an unsaturated aldehyde, is increased in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and identified as a potential inducer of sporadic AD. Synaptic dysfunction, as a typical pathological change occurring in the early stage of AD, is most closely associated with the severity of dementia. However, there remains a lack of clarity on the mechanisms of acrolein inducing AD-like pathology and synaptic impairment. In this study, acrolein-treated primary cultured neurons and mice were applied to investigate the effects of acrolein on cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction and their signaling mechanisms. In vitro, ROCK inhibitors, Fasudil, and Y27632, could attenuate the axon ruptures and synaptic impairment caused by acrolein. Meanwhile, RNA-seq distinct differentially expressed genes in acrolein models and initially linked activated RhoA/Rho-kinase2 (ROCK2) to acrolein-induced synaptic dysfunction, which could regulate neuronal cytoskeleton and neurite. The Morris water maze test and in vivo field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were performed to evaluate spatial memory and long-term potential (LTP), respectively. Acrolein induced cognitive impairment and attenuated LTP. Furthermore, the protein level of Synapsin 1 and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) and dendritic spines density were also decreased in acrolein-exposed mice. These changes were improved by ROCK2 inhibitor Fasudil or in ROCK2(+/-) mice. Together, our findings suggest that RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in acrolein-induced synaptic damage and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting inhibition of ROCK2 should benefit to the early AD.

AB  - Anxiety disorders are common mental health diseases affecting up to 7% of people around the world. Stress is considered one of the major environmental risk factors to promote anxiety disorders through mechanisms involving epigenetic changes. Moreover, alteration in redox balance and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production have been detected in anxiety patients and in stressed-animal models of anxiety. Here we tested if the administration of apocynin, a natural origin antioxidant, may prevent the anxiety-like phenotype and reduction of histone acetylation induced by a subchronic forced swimming stress (FSS) paradigm. We found that apocynin prevented the enhanced latency time in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, and the production of malondialdehyde induced by FSS. Moreover, apocynin was able to block the upregulation of p47phox, a key subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. Finally, apocynin prevented the rise of hippocampal Hdac1, Hdac4 and Hdac5, and the reduction of histone-3 acetylation levels promoted by FSS exposure. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that apocynin reduces the deleterious effect of stress and suggests that oxidative stress may regulate epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Featured Application The results of this paper can be used in the fields related to network measurement, especially in the fields of network traffic sampling, network traffic measurement, and finding top-k elephant flows. Encrypted traffic accounts for 95% of the total traffic in the backbone network environment with Tbps bandwidth. As network traffic becomes more and more encrypted and link rates increase in modern networks, the measurement of encrypted traffic relies more on collecting and analyzing massive network traffic data that can be separated from the support of high-speed network traffic measurement technology. Finding top-k elephant flows is a critical task with many applications in congestion control, anomaly detection, and traffic engineering. Owing to this, designing accurate and fast algorithms for online identification of elephant flows becomes more and more challenging. Existing methods either use large-size counters, i.e., 20 bit, to prevent overflows when recording flow sizes or require significant space overhead to measure the sizes of all flows. Thus, we adopt a novel strategy, called count-with-uth-level-sampling, in this paper, to find top-k elephant flows in limited resource environments. Moreover, the proposed algorithm, called MSLCFinder, incurs lightweight counter and uth-level multi-sampling with small, constant processing for millions of flows. Experimental results show that MSLCFinder can achieve more than 97% precision with an extremely limited hardware resource. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our method realizes the statistics and filtering of millions of data streams with less memory.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells in freely moving rodents display both theta phase precession and procession, which is thought to play important roles in cognition, but the neural mechanism for producing theta phase shift remains largely unknown. Here, we show that firing rate adaptation within a continuous attractor neural network causes the neural activity bump to oscillate around the external input, resembling theta sweeps of decoded position during locomotion. These forward and backward sweeps naturally account for theta phase precession and procession of individual neurons, respectively. By tuning the adaptation strength, our model explains the difference between 'bimodal cells' showing interleaved phase precession and procession, and 'unimodal cells' in which phase precession predominates. Our model also explains the constant cycling of theta sweeps along different arms in a T-maze environment, the speed modulation of place cells' firing frequency, and the continued phase shift after transient silencing of the hippocampus. We hope that this study will aid an understanding of the neural mechanism supporting theta phase coding in the brain.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study examines the impact of preoperative stress on postoperative neuroinflammation and associated cognitive dysfunction, with a focus on aged individuals. The goal is to determine whether managing preoperative stress can enhance postoperative outcomes and lower the risk of cognitive impairment.ResultsIn aged rats, preoperative restraint stress significantly worsened neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits following abdominal surgery. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex two days post-surgery, and these effects persisted for twenty-eight days. In contrast, adult rats did not show significant changes in neuroinflammation or cognitive function due to preoperative restraint stress. An ex vivo analysis indicated that hippocampal microglia from aged rats exhibited an intensified proinflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, further heightened by preoperative restraint stress. These findings suggest that managing preoperative stress could mitigate these adverse effects, leading to better postoperative recovery and cognitive health in elderly patients.

AB  - Complementary studies of wild and zoo-housed animals offer insight into behavioral variation across a range of conditions including the context under which various behaviors evolved in natural settings. This information can be used to improve the sustainability of in-situ and ex-situ populations and enhance the well-being of individuals. Managed ex-situ populations are critical to the long-term existence of Asian elephants, yet relatively little is known about male reproductive behavior compared to females. Male elephants undergo a unique sexual state called "musth" that further complicates in-situ and ex-situ management strategies. The ability to manage musth males to enhance breeding success and overall wellness of elephants is dependent upon better understanding how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence male behavioral variation around musth. Here, we observed 62 freeranging male Asian elephants in Sri Lanka and compared their behavior to observations from 26 elephants managed in facilities around the US. We hypothesized that musth is associated with significant behavioral changes that can be used to define distinct stages in the progression of musth. During observations, we quantified environmental variables and recorded musth status of each focal elephant using visual indicators (temporal gland secretions and urine dribbling). We showed that musth's behavioral correlates (including changes in locomotion, foraging, alertness, and chemosensory behavior) were remarkably similar in wild and zoo-housed elephants. We also found that behavioral variation around musth was also associated with intrinsic (e.g., musth stage, age) and extrinsic factors (e.g., space availability, temperature) in zoo-housed, but not wild, elephants, indicating that musth is potentially plastic in changing environments. As musth progressed, we noted distinct behavioral signatures that define four stages of sexual activity in male elephants: non-musth, early musth, full musth, and postmusth. Finally, although we did not observe significant changes in overall social behavior (including aggression) during musth, we found that elephants increased the frequency with which they displayed certain behaviors associated with communication (e.g., alertness, chemosensory behavior, ear-flapping) in both populations. Together, these results indicate the significant behavioral changes that occur during musth in wild and zoohoused elephants, and that musth progresses in distinct behavioral stages that can be easily distinguished by visual indicators. Studies like these serve to provide wildlife managers with information about a species' unique, evolved behavioral strategies and how these seemingly fixed behaviors may be influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors in predictable ways.

AB  - Pyrazole carboxamide derivatives were initially extensively studied as succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). In the present study, a series of pyrazole/pyrrole carboxamides containing a dinitrogen six-membered heterocyclic were designed based on our reported active skeletons with dual mode of action. Bioactivity results showed that the target compound Q 18 demonstrated superior antifungal efficacy against Colletotrichum camelliae (C. camelliae) with an EC50 value of 6.0 mg/L. The in vivo protective activity of Q 18 was 74.7% at 100 mg/L. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that Q 18 could disrupt the surface morphology of the mycelia and cause lipid peroxidation of cell membrane, which was further verified by the determination of relative conductivity and malondialdehyde contents. Combined with ergosterol content, docking results between Q 18 with SDH and CYP51, and the IC50 value of Q 18 for SDH (9.7 mg/L), it is concluded that Q 18 is a potential SDHI and ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor. Thus, the present study provides fresh insight into the study of derivatives of the amides.

AB  - At present, Camellia oleifera fruit harvesting relies on manual labor with low efficiency, while mechanized harvesting could result in bud damage because flowering and fruiting are synchronized. As a prerequisite, rapid detection and identification are urgently needed for high accuracy and efficiency with simple models to realize selective and intelligent harvesting. In this paper, a lightweight detection algorithm YOLOv5s-Camellia based on YOLOv5s is proposed. First, the network unit of the lightweight network ShuffleNetv2 was used to reconstruct the backbone network, and thereby the number of computations and parameters of the model was reduced to increase the running speed for saving computational costs. Second, to mitigate the impact of the lightweight improvement on model detection accuracy, three efficient channel attention (ECA) modules were introduced into the backbone network to enhance the network's attention to fruit features, and the Concat operation in the neck network was replaced by the Add operation with fewer parameters, which could increase the amount of information under features while maintaining the same number of channels. Third, the Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU) activation function was introduced to improve the nonlinear characterization ability of the network. In addition, to improve the ability of the network to locate objects in the natural environment, the penalty index was redefined to optimize the bounding box loss function, which can improve the convergence speed and regression accuracy. Furthermore, the final experimental results showed that this model possesses 98.8% accuracy, 5.5 G FLOPs computation, and 6.3 MB size, and the detection speed reached 60.98 frame/s. Compared with the original algorithm, the calculation amount, size, and parameters were reduced by 65.18%, 56.55%, and 57.59%, respectively. The results can provide a technical reference for the development of a Camellia oleifera fruit-harvesting robot.

AB  - During brain development, sodium-vitamin C transporter (SVCT2) has been detected primarily in radial glial cells in situ, with low-to-absent expression in cerebral cortex neuroblasts. However, strong SVCT2 expression is observed during the first postnatal days, resulting in increased intracellular concentration of vitamin C. Hippocampal neurons isolated from SVCT2 knockout mice showed shorter neurites and low clustering of glutamate receptors. Other studies have shown that vitamin C-deprived guinea pigs have reduced spatial memory, suggesting that ascorbic acid (AA) and SVCT2 have important roles in postnatal neuronal differentiation and neurite formation. In this study, SVCT2 lentiviral overexpression induced branching and increased synaptic proteins expression in primary cultures of cortical neurons. Analysis in neuroblastoma 2a (Neuro2a) and human subventricular tumor C3 (HSVT-C3) cells showed similar branching results. SVCT2 was mainly observed in the cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum; however, it was not detected in the mitochondria. Cellular branching in neuronal cells and in a previously standardized neurosphere assay is dependent on the recycling of vitamin C or reduction in dehydroascorbic acid (DHA, produced by neurons) by glial cells. The effect of WZB117, a selective glucose/DHA transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor expressed in glial cells, was also studied. By inhibiting GLUT1 glial cells, a loss of branching is observed in vitro, which is reproduced in the cerebral cortex in situ. We concluded that vitamin C recycling between neurons and astrocyte-like cells is fundamental to maintain neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The recycling activity begins at the cerebral postnatal cortex when neurons increase SVCT2 expression and concomitantly, GLUT1 is expressed in glial cells.

AB  - Hippocampal cross-frequency theta-gamma coupling (TGC) is a basic mechanism for information processing, retrieval, and consolidation of long-term and working memory. While the role of entorhinal afferents in the modulation of hippocampal TGC is widely accepted, the influence of other main input to the hippocampus, from the medial septal area (MSA, the pacemaker of the hippocampal theta rhythm) is poorly understood. Optogenetics allows us to explore how different neuronal populations of septohippocampal circuits control neuronal oscillations in vivo. Rhythmic activation of septal glutamatergic neurons has been shown to drive hippocampal theta oscillations, but the role of these neuronal populations in information processing during theta activation has remained unclear. Here we investigated the influence of phasic activation of MSA glutamatergic neurons expressing channelrhodopsin II on theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus. During the experiment, local field potentials of MSA and hippocampus of freely behaving mice were modulated by 470 nm light flashes with theta frequency (2 -10) Hz. It was shown that both the power and the strength of modulation of gamma rhythm nested on hippocampal theta waves depend on the frequency of stimulation. The modulation of the amplitude of slow gamma rhythm (30 -50 Hz) prevailed over modulation of fast gamma (55 -100 Hz) during flash trains and the observed effects were specific for theta stimulation of MSA. We discuss the possibility that phasic depolarization of septal glutamatergic neurons controls theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus and plays a role in memory retrieval and consolidation.

AB  - Energy homeostasis is is determined by food intake and energy expenditure, which are partly regulated by the cross-talk between central and peripheral hormonal signals. Phoenixin (PNX) is a recently discovered pleiotropic neuropeptide with isoforms of 14 (PNX-14) and 20 (PNX-20) amino acids. It is a potent reproductive peptide in vertebrates, regulating the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). It has been identified as a regulator of food intake during light phase when injected intracerebroventricularly in rats. In addition, plasma levels of PNX also increased after food intake in rats, suggesting that it might have possible roles in energy homeostasis. We hypothesized that gut is a source and site of action of PNX in mice. Immunoreactivity for PNX and its putative receptor, super-conserved receptor expressed in brain (SREB3; also known as the G-protein coupled receptor 173/GPR 173) was found in the stomach and intestine of male C57/BL6 J mice, and in MGN3-1 (mouse stomach endocrine) cells and STC-1 (mouse enteroendocrine) cells. In MGN3-1 cells, PNX-20 significantly upregulated ghrelin (10 nM) and ghrelin-O-acyl transferase (GOAT) mRNAs (1000 nM) at 6 h. In STC-1 cells, it significantly suppressed CCK (100 nM) at 2 h. No effects were found on other intestinal hormones tested (glucagon like peptide-1, glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and peptide YY). Together, these results indicate that PNX-20 is produced in the gut, and it could act directly on gut cells to regulate metabolic hormones.

AB  - Objective More than half of patients with depression display eating disorders, such as bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Feeding centers are located in the hypothalamus, and hypothalamic adult neurogenesis has an important role in feeding and energy balance. Antidepressants, which can regulate adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and neocortex, are used for eating disorders, but it is unclear whether antidepressants change hypothalamic adult neurogenesis. In this study, we used immunohistological analysis to assess effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) on hypothalamic adult neurogenesis of adult mice. Results Expressions of the proliferating cell marker, Ki67, and the neural stem cell marker, nestin, were significantly decreased in the hypothalamus by FLX. As regard to postmitotic cells, the number of the neural marker, NeuN, positive cells was significantly upregulated by FLX, but that of the astrocytic marker, S100B, positive cells was significantly reduced by FLX. The number of the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, positive cells was not changed by FLX. Interestingly, FLX treatment did not affect the total number of newly generated cells in the hypothalamus, comparing that in controls. These results suggest that FLX treatment influence hypothalamic adult neurogenesis and shift the balance between the numbers of neurons and astrocytes under studied conditions.

AB  - Background/aim: In recent years, single-domain antibodies, also known as nanobodies, have emerged as an alternative to full immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs), due to their various advantages, including increased solubility, faster clearance, and cheaper production. Nanobodies are generally derived from the variable domain of the camelid heavy-chain-only immunoglobulin Gs (hcIgGs). Due to the high sequence homology between variable heavy chains of camelids (VHHs) and humans (VHs), hcIgGs are ideal candidates for nanobody development. However, further examination is needed to understand the structural differences between VHs and VHHs. This analysis is essential for nanobody engineering to mitigate potential immunogenicity, while preserving stability, functionality, and antigen specificity.Materials and methods: We obtained the VH and VHH sequences of various camelid and non-camelid mammalian antibodies from public databases and used multiple sequence alignment based on the Chothia numbering scheme. Aligned sequences were subjected to diverse analyses encompassing paratope length, binding prediction, motif, disulfide bridge, salt bridge profiling, and physicochemical characteristic distribution. Logistic Regression coupled with the Boruta -Random Forest algorithm facilitated the comprehensive examination of physicochemical properties. Results: Our findings revealed longer, less variable paratope sequences in VHHs, along with specific antigen binding residues with increased binding potential compared to VHs. Although the VHs showed more heterogeneous noncanonical disulfide bond patterns, the VHHs had a higher number of noncanonical disulfide bridges. Intriguingly, a typical salt bridge between the 94th and 101st positions in the VHs had a very low encounter rate in the VHHs. Surprisingly, we also identified notable differences in the physicochemical patterns of mostly conserved frameworks (FWs), especially the FW2 and FW3 regions, between VHs and VHHs.Conclusion: Our findings point to possible key sites in VHHs as candidate residues for nanobody engineering efforts.

AB  - The regulation of cell growth characteristics through physical structures on material surfaces plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of cell behavior. Three-dimensional (3D) microstructures, offering multidimensional growth space and a richer nutrient environment compared to their two-dimensional counterparts, have attracted significant attention from researchers. However, the fabrication of high-precision 3D microstructures, especially those with a high aspect ratio (H-AR), remains challenging. In this study, we employ femtosecond laser to achieve exceptional precision and patterning capabilities in fabricating 3D microstructures. To enhance the manufacturing efficiency of axial 3D structures, we introduce a novel single pulse multi-photon polymerization (SP-MPP) method for efficient fabrication of H-AR micropillar and microtube structures. Our innovative approach involves a dual-aperture optical modulation method that effectively modulates the annular energy distribution, enabling the creation of H-AR microstructures. We can achieve a maximum processing height of up to 130 mu m with an aspect ratio of 16 within single pulse exposure of 217 fs. Compared to the layerby-layer scanning method, our proposed approach enhances the axial manufacturing efficiency of 3D structures by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Through experimentation, we validate the applicability of microtube structures for guiding neuronal orientation by utilizing microtube arrays in hippocampal neuronal cell culture. Our results demonstrate that neurons not only grow along the patterned microtubes but also exhibit preliminary synaptic differentiation. Furthermore, we effectively regulate the 3D patterning of neuronal growth by implementing diverse patterned microtube arrays. This proposed method enables the rapid construction of a large-scale 3D cell growth environment, offering significant advantages in inducing neuronal orientation. Consequently, this technique holds immense potential for diverse applications in biomedicine and tissue engineering, including the establishment of isolated neural networks.

AB  - Osteoporosis (OP) is a chronic disease in the elderly, and China is entering an aging demographic trend. In recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated that probiotics can treat osteoporosis. This study aimed to explore the relevant mechanisms and to validate the beneficial effect on osteoporosis by high-throughput metagenome-wide gene sequencing in humans. In this study, compared with controls, several species had altered abundances, and specific functional pathways were found in the OP group. At the species level, the species that had increased in OP individuals were positively correlated to bone resorption markers and negatively correlated to 25-OH-D3 and bone formation markers, with Streptococcus sanguinis showing the strongest relevance, followed by Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Olsenella unclassified. Additionally, Actinomyces graevenitzii, enriched in the OP group, was positively correlated to inflammation indicators that included white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count (NEC), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.05). Conversely, the levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Butyricimonas synergistic were increased in the control group, which had a negative correlation with bone resorption markers and positive correlation with bone formation markers and 25-OH-D3. Additionally, Bacteroides fragilis had a negative correlation with inflammation indicators (WBC, NEC, and NLR) and the above pathways (p < 0.05). Functional prediction revealed that 106 metabolic pathways, enriched in the OP group, were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). In particular, pathways related to LPS biosynthesis, phytate degradation, lactate acid, and ethanol fermentation were more abundant in the OP group than in the control and were positively related to WBC and NEC. Taken together, several species with altered abundances and specific functional pathways were found in OP individuals. The role of phytases in OP provides novel epidemiological evidence to elucidate the underlying microbiota-relevant mechanisms in bone mineralization and should be explored further.

AB  - Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate towards a goal vestibule from a random start vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial, and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions. They closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, revealing a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every six vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), dichlorvos (DDV), and cypermethrin (CP), as commonly used pesticides, have been implicated in inducing neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression-like behaviors, and locomotor activity impairment. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of these adverse effects, particularly in both sexes and their next-generation effects, remain unclear. In this study, we conducted behavioral analysis, along with cellular assays (monodansylcadaverine staining) and molecular investigations (qRT-PCR and western blotting of mTOR, P62, and Beclin-1) to clear the potential role of autophagy in pesticide-induced behavioral alterations. For this purpose, 42 adult female and 21 male inbred ICR mice (F0) were distributed into seven groups. Maternal mice (F0) and 112 F1 offspring were exposed to 0.5 and 1 ppm of CPF, DDV, and CP through drinking water. F1 male and female animals were studied to assess the sex-specific effects of pesticides on brain tissue. Our findings revealed pronounced anxiogenic effects and impaired locomotor activity in mice. F1 males exposed to CPF (1 ppm) exhibited significantly elevated depression-like behaviors compared to other groups. Moreover, pesticide exposure reduced mTOR and P62 levels, while enhancing the Beclin-1 gene and protein expression. These changes in autophagy signaling pathways, coupled with oxidative and neurogenic damage in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, potentially contribute to heightened locomotor activity, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors following pesticide exposure. This study underscores the substantial impact of pesticides on both physiological and behavioral aspects, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive assessments and regulatory considerations for pesticide use. Additionally, the identification of sex-specific responses presents a crucial dimension for pharmaceutical sciences, highlighting the need for tailored therapeutic interventions and further research in this field.

AB  - Hippocampome.org is a mature open-access knowledge base of the rodent hippocampal formation focusing on neuron types and their properties. Previously, Hippocampome.org v1.0 established a foundational classification system identifying 122 hippocampal neuron types based on their axonal and dendritic morphologies, main neurotransmitter, membrane biophysics, and molecular expression (Wheeler et al., 2015). Releases v1.1 through v1.12 furthered the aggregation of literature-mined data, including among others neuron counts, spiking patterns, synaptic physiology, in vivo firing phases, and connection probabilities. Those additional properties increased the online information content of this public resource over 100-fold, enabling numerous independent discoveries by the scientific community. Hippocampome.org v2.0, introduced here, besides incorporating over 50 new neuron types, now recenters its focus on extending the functionality to build real-scale, biologically detailed, data-driven computational simulations. In all cases, the freely downloadable model parameters are directly linked to the specific peer-reviewed empirical evidence from which they were derived. Possible research applications include quantitative, multiscale analyses of circuit connectivity and spiking neural network simulations of activity dynamics. These advances can help generate precise, experimentally testable hypotheses and shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying associative memory and spatial navigation.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the most devastating diseases affecting the pig industry globally. Due to the emergence of novel strains, no effective vaccines are available for prevention and control. Investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV may provide insights for creating clinical interventions. This study constructed and expressed eukaryotic expression vectors containing PEDV proteins (except NSP11) with a 3' HA tag in Vero cells. The subcellular localization of PEDV proteins was examined using endogenous protein antibodies to investigate their involvement in the viral life cycle, including endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, genome replication, energy metabolism, budding, and release. We systematically analyzed the potential roles of all PEDV viral proteins in the virus life cycle. We found that the endosome sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery may be involved in the replication and budding processes of PEDV. Our study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying PEDV infection. Importance: The global swine industry has suffered immense losses due to the spread of PEDV. Currently, there are no effective vaccines available for clinical protection. Exploring the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV may provide valuable insights for clinical interventions. This study investigated the involvement of viral proteins in various stages of the PEDV lifecycle in the state of viral infection and identified several previously unreported interactions between viral and host proteins. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PEDV infection and may serve as a basis for further research and development of therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The chemical compound 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), or ethylene dichloride, is an industrial very short-lived substance (VSLS) whose major use is as a feedstock in the production chain of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Like other chlorinated VSLSs, transport of DCE (and/or its atmospheric oxidation products) to the stratosphere could contribute to ozone depletion there. However, despite annual production volumes greatly exceeding those of more prominent VSLSs (e.g. dichloromethane), global DCE observations are sparse; thus, the magnitude and distribution of DCE emissions and trends in its atmospheric abundance are poorly known. In this study, we performed an exploratory analysis of the global DCE budget between 2002 and 2020. Combining bottom-up data on annual production and assumptions around fugitive losses during production and feedstock use, we assessed the DCE source strength required to reproduce atmospheric DCE observations. We show that the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT 3-D chemical transport model (CTM) reproduces DCE measurements from various aircraft missions well, including HIPPO (2009-2011), ATom (2016-2018), and KORUS-AQ (2016), along with surface measurements from Southeast Asia, when assuming a regionally varying production emission factor in the range of 0.5 %-1.5 %. Our findings imply substantial fugitive losses of DCE and/or substantial emissive applications (e.g. solvent use) that are poorly reported. We estimate that DCE's global source increased by similar to 45 % between 2002 (349 +/- 61 Ggyr-1) and 2020 (505 +/- 90 Ggyr-1), with its contribution to stratospheric chlorine increasing from 8.2 (+/- 1.5) to similar to 12.9 (+/- 2.4) pptCl (where ppt denotes parts per trillion) over this period. DCE's relatively short overall tropospheric lifetime (similar to 83 d) limits, although does not preclude, its transport to the stratosphere, and we show that its impact on ozone is small at present. Annually averaged, DCE is estimated to have decreased ozone in the lower stratosphere by up to several parts per billion (< 1 %) in 2020, although a larger effect in the springtime Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere is apparent (decreases of up to similar to 1.3 %). Given strong potential for growth in DCE production tied to demand for PVC, ongoing measurements would be of benefit to monitor potential future increases in its atmospheric abundance and its contribution to ozone depletion.

AB  - Yap is the key effector of Hippo signaling; however, its role in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains controversial. Here, we identify two Yap splicing isoforms (Yap472 and Yap488), which show equal expression levels but heterogeneous distribution in ESCs. Knockout (KO) of both isoforms reduces ESC self-renewal, accelerates pluripotency exit but arrests terminal differentiation, while overexpression of each isoform leads to the reverse phenotype. The effect of both Yap isoforms on self-renewal is Teads-dependent and mediated by c-Myc. Nonetheless, different isoforms are found to affect overlapping yet distinct genes, and confer different developmental potential to Yap-KO cells, with Yap472 exerting a more pronounced biological effect and being more essential for neuroectoderm differentiation. Constitutive activation of Yaps, particularly Yap472, dramatically upregulates p53 and Cdx2, inducing trophectoderm trans-differentiation even under self-renewal conditions. These findings reveal the combined roles of different Yap splicing isoforms and mechanisms in regulating self-renewal efficiency and differentiation potential of ESCs.

AB  - Background/Aims. The Yiqi Huoxue (YQHX) recipe has been shown to attenuate liver fibrosis, but precise mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Recently, Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) signaling has been implicated in liver fibrogenesis. This study investigated whether the YAP/TAZ signaling is involved in the therapeutic effect of YQHX on hepatic fibrosis.
   Materials and Methods. Wistar rats were used to generate a model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with liver fibrosis were enrolled and assigned to receive either nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) or NAs plus YQHX. Histology, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and western blotting were conducted to mechanistically assess the therapeutic effects of YQHX on liver fibrosis.
   Results. YQHX markedly alleviated morphological alterations in CCl(4)induced liver fibrosis and decreased markers of hepatic fibrosis in rats. Furthermore, YQHX significantly suppressed CCl4 -meidated activation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling pathway. Notably, CCl4 induced up-regulation of YAP, TAZ, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which were significantly abrogated by YQHX. Consistent with the above major findings in rats, CHB patients treated with NAs plus YQHX had greater improvement in liver fibrosis than those given NAs alone (71.4% vs. 28.6%; P=0.057). In addition, hepatic and plasma levels of YAP were significantly decreased after YQHX treatment in CHB patients with liver fibrosis.
   Conclusion. YAP/TAZ signaling plays a role, at least in part, in the anti-fibrotic activity of YQHX. The findings may help to better understand the mechanisms of YQHX in the treatment of liver fibrosis.

AB  - This study investigates the mechanism underlying an effective complementary therapy, electroacupuncture, in the treatment of chronic pain comorbid depression. The persistent effect of this therapy is confirmed by the finding that depression-like behaviors of mice with chronic neuropathic pain were not evident even 17 days after the termination of the treatment. Such effect is based on its restoration of Tet1 expression, which prevents the hypermethylation of the Prox1 gene, and thus supports the normal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Our present study provides a novel idea for the treatment of chronic pain-induced depression
   Although electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation is a widely used therapy for chronic pain and comorbid psychiatric disorders, its long-term effects on chronic neuropathic pain-induced depression and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we found that EA stimulation was able to restore adult neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus (DG), by both increasing neuronal differentiation and restoring the normal morphology of newborn dendrites, in mice with spared nerve injury surgery. By ablating the Nestin(+) neural stem cells (NSCs) via diphtheria toxin fragment A expression, we further proved that neurogenesis in the ventral DG was crucial to the long-term, but not the immediate antidepressant effect of EA, nor was it associated with nociception. Furthermore, we found that the restoration of neurogenesis was dependent on Tet1-mediated epigenetic modification upon EA treatment. Tet1 could bind to the promoter of the Prox1 gene, thus catalyzing its demethylation and facilitating its expression, which finally contributed to the restoration of neurogenesis and amelioration of depression-like behaviors induced by chronic neuropathic pain. Thus, we conclude that EA stimulation restores inhibited Tet1 expression in hippocampal NSCs of mice with chronic neuropathic pain, and increased Tet1 expression ameliorates hypermethylation of Prox1 and restores normal adult neurogenesis in the ventral DG, which contributes to the long-term antidepressant effect of EA.

AB  - Accumulating evidence has revealed an association between depression and disordered intestinal microecology. The discovery of psychobiotics has provided a promising perspective for studying the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate the antidepressant abilities of Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus zz-1 (LRzz-1) and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The viable bacteria (2 x 109 CFU/day) were orally supplemented to depressed C57BL/6 mice induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and the behavioral, neurophysiological, and intestinal microbial effects were assessed, with fluoxetine used as a positive control. The treatment with LRzz-1 effectively mitigated the depression-like behavioral disorders of depressed mice and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) in the hippocampus. In addition, LRzz-1 treatment also improved tryptophan metabolic disorder in the mouse hippocampus, as well as its peripheral circulation. These benefits are associated with the mediation of microbiome-gut-brain bidirectional communication. CUMS-induced depression impaired the intestinal barrier integrity and microbial homeostasis in mice, neither of which was restored by fluoxetine. LRzz-1 prevented intestinal leakage and significantly ameliorated epithelial barrier permeability by up-regulating tight-junction proteins (including ZO1, occludin, and claudin-1). In particular, LRzz-1 improved the microecological balance by normalizing the threatened bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio), exerting beneficial regulation (e.g., Ruminiclostridium 6 and Alispites), and modifying short-chain fatty acid metabolism. In summary, LRzz-1 showed considerable antidepressant-like effects and exhibited more comprehensive intestinal microecological regulation than other drugs, which offers novel insights that can facilitate the development of depression therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Prior studies suggest a role for sleep in memory consolidation, with specific contributions from slow oscillations and sleep spindles (Rasch & Born, 2013). However, recent studies failed to replicate sleep's superiority over wake in strengthening memory against interference (Cordi & Rasch, 2021). The goal of the current study is to investigate whether sleep protects newly formed memory from unspecific interference induced by daytime experiences over 24 h, as well as to elucidate the sleep features that are involved. 56 healthy adults were randomly assigned to either the Sleep First or Wake First group. The Sleep First group encoded word pairs at night before sleep, while the Wake First group encoded word pairs in the morning before a day of wakefulness. Memory was tested 30 min, 12 h, and 24 h after encoding for both groups. The Sleep First group performed significantly better 12 h after encoding, replicating prior findings that memory is better after a period of sleep compared to wake. However, after 24 h, the two groups performed similarly. The Wake First group showed a positive correlation between overnight memory improvement and the theta and delta band power during slow wave sleep, an effect not found in the Sleep First group. These correlations suggest the possibility that after a day of waking interference, the brain recruits extra sleep resources to rescue memories from further forgetting. Our results are not consistent with prior studies showing a significant role for sleep in stabilizing memory from future interference, but they may suggest that sleep rescues memories after interference has occurred.

AB  - Soybean is a worldwide crop that offers valuable proteins, fatty acids, and phytonutrients to humans but is always damaged by insect pests or pathogens. Plants have captured sophisticated defense mechanisms in resisting the attack of insects and pathogens. How to protect soybean in an environment- or human-friendly way or how to develop plant-based pest control is a hotpot. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles that are released by multiple plant species have been assessed in multi-systems against various insects, of which (E)-beta-ocimene has been reported to show anti-insect function in a variety of plants, including soybean. However, the responsible gene in soybean is unknown, and its mechanism of synthesis and anti-insect properties lacks comprehensive assessment. In this study, (E)-beta-ocimene was confirmed to be induced by Spodoptera litura treatment. A plastidic localized monoterpene synthase gene, designated as GmOCS, was identified to be responsible for the biosynthesis of (E)-beta-ocimene through genome-wide gene family screening and in vitro and in vivo assays. Results from transgenic soybean and tobacco confirmed that (E)-beta-ocimene catalyzed by GmOCS had pivotal roles in repelling a S. litura attack. This study advances the understanding of (E)- beta-ocimene synthesis and its function in crops, as well as provides a good candidate for further anti-insect soybean improvement.

AB  - The population of obese-elderly has increased prominently around the world. Both aging and obesity are major factors of neurodegeneration. The present study hypothesizes that HBOT attenuates metabolic disturbance, cognitive decline, hippocampal pathologies in aging and aging-obese model. Sixty Wistar rats were separated into 2 groups to receive normal-diet (ND) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks. At week 13, ND rats were divided into two subgroups to receive vehicle (0.9 % NSS, s.c) or D-gal (150 mg/kg/d, s.c) for total 10 weeks. HFD rats were injected only D-gal (150 mg/kg/d, s.c; HFDD) for total 10 weeks. At week 20, rats in each subgroup were given sham-treatment (1ATA, 80 L/min, 80 min/day), or HBOT (2ATA, pure O2, 250 L/min, 80 min/day) for 14 days. Novel object location test, metabolic parameters, and hippocampal pathologies were determined after HBOT. D-gal induced insulin resistance, increased oxidative stress, autophagy impairment, microglial hyperactivation, apoptosis, synaptic dysplasticity which resulted in cognitive impairment. D-gal-treated HFD-fed rats had the highest levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis, dendritic spine loss. HBOT attenuated insulin resistance, cognitive impairment, hippocampal aging and pathologies in both models. These findings suggest that HBOT restored insulin sensitivity, hippocampal functions, cognition in aging and aging-obese models.

AB  - Simple Summary Foot and mouth disease (FMD) affects the productivity and health of several animals species, including cattle. In Afghanistan, cattle represent a valuable source of food security and play a vital role in the rural economy. Using a questionnaire-based approach, we evaluated the self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and practices of various stakeholders involved in the cattle industry and veterinary management of animal health in a northern province of Afghanistan. The study pointed to several aspects that could be translated into practical management options to add value to FMD management in the cattle industry in Afghanistan. This study was performed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of farmers, animal traders, and veterinary professionals on FMD in Baghlan province, Afghanistan. Four structured questionnaires were administered to the respondents. Almost half (48.5%) of the farmers had heard of the occurrence of FMD in their neighbourhood or knew the name of the disease. The majority of farmers could recognise the clinical signs of FMD in their animals (salivation, 85.9%; tongue ulcers, 78.8%; gum lesions, 78.2%; hoof lesions, 76.8%). Most farmers stated that the "introduction of new animals" was the primary cause of FMD appearing on their farms and to control the spread of the disease, over half of the farmers (56%) preferred not to buy cattle from unknown or potentially infected sources. Animal traders' knowledge was limited to recognising some clinical signs of the disease such as: salivation, and lesions in the mouth and on the feet. No animals were directly imported by the traders from outside Afghanistan. Over half of the local veterinary professionals (65%) kept record books of the animal diseases seen and/or treatment plans undertaken, and 80% of them reported the occurrence of FMD to the provincial, regional, and central veterinary authorities. No regular vaccination programme against FMD was implemented in the province. Poor import controls and quarantine were considered to be the main barriers to the control of FMD in the study area and the surrounding provinces. It can be concluded that, despite relatively good knowledge about FMD in the study area, there are gaps in farmers' and traders' knowledge that need to be addressed to overcome the burden of the disease in the province. These should focus on strengthening interprovincial quarantine measures and implementation of regular vaccination campaigns against the circulating FMDV within the area.

AB  - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious virus that causes Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED). This enteric disease results in high mortality rates in piglets, leading to significant financial losses in the pig industry. However, vaccines cannot provide sufficient protection against epidemic strains. Spike (S) protein exposed on the surface of virion mediates PEDV entry into cells. Our findings imply that matrine (MT), a naturally occurring alkaloid, inhibits PEDV infection targeting S protein of virions and biological process of cells. The GLY434 residue in the autodocking site of the S protein and MT conserved based on sequence comparison. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of viral attachment, entry, and virucidal effects to investigate how that MT inhibits virus replication. MT inhibits PEDV attachment and entry by targeting S protein. MT was added to cells before, during, or after infection, it exhibits anti-PEDV activities and viricidal effects. Network pharmacology focuses on addressing causal mechanisms rather than just treating symptoms. We identified the key genes and screened the cell apoptosis involved in the inhibition of MT on PEDV infection in network pharmacology. MT significantly promotes cell apoptosis in PEDV-infected cells to inhibit PEDV infection by activating the MAPK signaling pathway. Collectively, we provide the biological foundations for the development of single components of traditional Chinese medicine to inhibit PEDV infection and spread.

AB  - The human brain is the most complex organ in biology. This complexity is due to the number and the intricate connections of brain cells and has so far limited the development of in vitro models for basic and applied brain research. We decided to create a new, reliable, and cost-effective in vitro system based on the Nichoid, a 3D microscaffold microfabricated by two-photon laser polymerization technology. We investigated whether these 3D microscaffold devices can create an environment allowing the manipulation, monitoring, and functional assessment of a mixed population of brain cells in vitro. With this aim, we set up a new model of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes co-cultured in the Nichoid microscaffold to generate brain micro-tissues of 30 mu m thickness. After 21 days in culture, we morphologically characterized the 3D spatial organization of the hippocampal astrocytes and neurons within the microscaffold, and we compared our observations to those made using the classical 2D co-culture system. We found that the co-cultured cells colonized the entire volume of the 3D devices. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that within this period the different cell types had become well-differentiated. This was further elaborated with the use of drebrin, PSD-95, and synaptophysin antibodies that labeled the majority of neurons, both in the 2D as well as in the 3D co-cultures. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that neurons in the 3D co-culture displayed a significantly larger amount of dendritic protrusions compared to neurons in the 2D co-culture. This latter observation indicates that neurons growing in a 3D environment may be more prone to form connections than those co-cultured in a 2D condition. Our results show that the Nichoid can be used as a 3D device to investigate the structure and morphology of neurons and astrocytes in vitro. In the future, this model can be used as a tool to study brain cell interactions in the discovery of important mechanisms governing neuronal plasticity and to determine the factors that form the basis of different human brain diseases. This system may potentially be further used for drug screening in the context of various brain diseases.

AB  - Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) protein is a Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel known for its pain modulation pathway. In a previous study, it was discovered that a triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model (3xTg-AD+/+) has anti-AD effects. The expression of proteins in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) pathway in a 3xTg-AD/TRPV1 transgenic mice model was investigated to better understand the AD regulatory effect of TRPV1 deficiency. The results show that TRPV1 deficiency leads to CREB activation by increasing BDNF levels and promoting phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt), and CREB in the hippocampus. Additionally, TRPV1 deficiency-induced CREB activation increases the antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) gene, which consequently downregulates Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) expression and decreases cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which leads to the prevention of hippocampal apoptosis. In conclusion, TRPV1 deficiency exhibits neuroprotective effects by preventing apoptosis through the BDNF/CREB signal transduction pathway in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice.

AB  - Can a regulated, legal market for wildlife products protect species threatened by poaching? It is one of the most controversial ideas in biodiversity conservation. Perhaps the most convincing reason for legalizing wildlife trade is that trade revenue could fund the protection and conservation of poached species. In this paper, we examine the possible poacher-population dynamic consequences of legal trade funding conservation. The model consists of a manager scavenging carcasses for wildlife product, who then sells the product, and directs a portion of the revenue towards funding anti-poaching law enforcement. Through a global analysis of the model, we derive the critical proportion of product the manager must scavenge, and the critical proportion of trade revenue the manager must allocate towards increased enforcement, in order for legal trade to lead to abundant long-term wildlife populations. We illustrate how the model could inform management with parameter values derived from the African elephant literature, under a hypothetical scenario where a manager scavenges elephant carcasses to sell ivory. We find that there is a large region of parameter space where populations go extinct under legal trade unless a significant portion of trade revenue is directed towards protecting populations from poaching. The model is general and therefore can be used as a starting point for exploring the consequences of funding many conservation programs using wildlife trade revenue. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The accumulation of beta-amyloid oligomers is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, inducing neural and network dysfunction in the early stages of pathology. The hippocampus is affected early in the pathogenesis of AD, however the impact of soluble beta-amyloid on the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the hippocampus and its interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) within this region are not known. Using a localized model of over-expression, we show that beta-amyloid induces early-onset neuronal hyperactivity and hippocampal-dependent memory deficits in mice. Further, we find the DG region to be under potent and sub-type specific nicotinic control in both healthy and pathophysiological conditions, with targeted receptor inhibition leading to a mnemonic rescue against localized amyloidosis. We show that while neurogenesis and synaptic functions are not severely affected in our model, reducing beta 2-containing nAChR function is associated with the promotion of young adult-born neurons within the pathological network, suggesting a possible protective mechanism. Our data thus reveal the DG network level changes which occur in the early-stages of beta-amyloid accumulation and highlight the downstream consequences of targeted nicotinic neuromodulation.

AB  - Neuroinflammation is initiated by activation of the brain's innate immune system in response to an inflammatory challenge. Insufficient control of neuroinflammation leads to enhanced or prolonged pathology in various neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) plays critical roles in cellular energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Our previous study demonstrated that deletion of CD38, which consumes NAD(+), suppressed cuprizone-induced demyelination, neuroinflammation, and glial activation. However, it is still unknown whether CD38 directly affects neuroinflammation through regulating brain NAD(+) level. In this study, we investigated the effect of CD38 deletion and inhibition and supplementation of NAD(+) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mice. Intracerebroventricular injection of LPS significantly increased CD38 expression especially in the hippocampus. Deletion of CD38 decreased LPS-induced inflammatory responses and glial activation. Pre-administration of apigenin, a flavonoid with CD38 inhibitory activity, or nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD(+) precursor, increased NAD(+) level, and significantly suppressed induction of cytokines and chemokines, glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration after LPS administration. In cell culture, LPS-induced inflammatory responses were suppressed by treatment of primary astrocytes or microglia with apigenin, NAD(+), NR or 78c, the latter a specific CD38 inhibitor. Finally, all these compounds suppressed NF-kappa B signaling pathway in microglia. These results suggest that CD38-mediated neuroinflammation is linked to NAD(+) consumption and that boosting NAD(+) by CD38 inhibition and NR supplementation directly suppress neuroinflammation in the brain.

AB  - Child abuse (CA) is a strong predictor of psychopathologies and suicide, altering normal trajectories of brain development in areas closely linked to emotional responses such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Yet, the cellular underpinnings of these enduring effects are unclear. Childhood and adolescence are marked by the protracted formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which orchestrate the closure of developmental windows of cortical plasticity by regulating the functional integration of parvalbumin interneurons into neuronal circuits. Using well-characterized post-mortem brain samples, we show that a history of CA is specifically associated with increased densities and morphological complexity of WFL-labeled PNNs in the ventromedial PFC (BA11/12), possibly suggesting increased recruitment and maturation of PNNs. Through single-nucleus sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of canonical components of PNNs is enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and that they are upregulated in CA victims. These correlational findings suggest that early-life adversity may lead to persistent patterns of maladaptive behaviors by reducing the neuroplasticity of cortical circuits through the enhancement of developmental OPC-mediated PNN formation.

AB  - When it comes to mechanisms of brain functions such as learning and memory mediated by neural networks, existing multichannel electrophysiological detection and regulation technology at the cellular level does not suffice. To address this challenge, a 128-channel microelectrode array (MEA) was fabricated for electrical stimulation (ES) training and electrophysiological recording of the hippocampal neurons in vitro. The PEDOT:PSS/PtNPs-coated microelectrodes dramatically promote the recording and electrical stimulation performance. The MEA exhibited low impedance (10.94 +/- 0.49 kohm), small phase delay (-12.54 +/- 0.51 degrees), high charge storage capacity (14.84 +/- 2.72 mC/cm(2)), and high maximum safe injection charge density (4.37 +/- 0.22 mC/cm(2)), meeting the specific requirements for training neural networks in vitro. A series of ESs at various frequencies was applied to the neuronal cultures in vitro, seeking the optimum training mode that enables the neuron to display the most obvious plasticity, and 1 Hz ES was determined. The network learning process, including three consecutive trainings, affected the original random spontaneous activity. Along with that, the firing pattern gradu ally changed to burst and the correlation and synchrony of the neuronal activity in the network have progressively improved, increasing by 314% and 240%, respectively. The neurons remembered these changes for at least 4 h. Collectively, ES activates the learning and memory functions of neurons, which is manifested in transformations in the discharge pattern and the improvement of network correlation and synchrony. This study offers a high-performance MEA revealing the underlying learning and memory functions of the brain and therefore serves as a useful tool for the development of brain functions in the future.

AB  - Closed-loop stimulation is one of the important development directions of deep brain stimulation (DBS) that is promising for treating various brain disorders. Contrast to the conventional open-loop stimulation with continuous stimulation for long periods of time, the closed-loop stimulation usually utilizes short sequences of high-frequency pulses. However, neuronal responses to the high-frequency stimuli may change substantially in a short period of time because of the transient process at the beginning of stimulation. The change may affect the stimulation efficacy. To investigate the transient process of high-frequency stimuli, antidromic high-frequency stimulation (A-HFS) with different constant pulse frequencies as well as varying frequency was applied at the alveus of rat hippocampal CA1 region. The amplitude of antidromically-evoked population spike (APS) was used as an index to evaluate the neuronal responses to A-IIFS. The results show that at the initial period of A-HFS with a constant pulse frequency of 100, 133 and 200 Hz, the APS decreased rapidly. A higher pulse frequency generated a faster attenuation of the APS. The mean amplitudes of APS decreased by more than half within less than 1 s. The mean half-value time of APS amplitude was similar to 0.96 s with 100 Hz A-HFS and decreased to similar to 0.21 s with the pulse frequency doubled to 200 Hz. With randomly-varying frequencies in the range of 100-200 Hz to tune the pulse interval in real time, the attenuation speed of neuronal responses was significantly slowed down to prolong the maintenance of the stimulation effect. These results provide clues to develop new DBS paradigms for the implementation of short closed-loop stimulations.

AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics result from interspecies transmission events within the avian reservoir and further into mammals including humans. Receptor incompatibility due to differently expressed glycan structures between species has been suggested to limit zoonotic IAV transmission from the wild bird reservoir as well as between different bird species. Using glycoproteomics, we have studied the repertoires of expressed glycan structures with focus on putative sialic acid-containing glycan receptors for IAV in mallard, chicken and tufted duck; three bird species with different roles in the zoonotic ecology of IAV. The methodology used pinpoints specific glycan structures to specific glycosylation sites of identified glycoproteins and was also used to successfully discriminate alpha 2-3- from alpha 2-6-linked terminal sialic acids by careful analysis of oxonium ions released from glycopeptides in tandem MS/MS (MS2), and MS/MS/MS (MS3). Our analysis clearly demonstrated that all three bird species can produce complex N-glycans including alpha 2-3-linked sialyl Lewis structures, as well as both N- and O- glycans terminated with both alpha 2-3- and alpha 2-6-linked Neu5Ac. We also found the recently identified putative IAV receptor structures, Man-6P N-glycopeptides, in all tissues of the three bird species. Furthermore, we found many similarities in the repertoires of expressed receptors both between the bird species investigated and to previously published data from pigs and humans. Our findings of sialylated glycan structures, previously anticipated to be mammalian specific, in all three bird species may have major implications for our understanding of the role of receptor incompatibility in interspecies transmission of IAV.

AB  - Objective: Dravet syndrome is a severe, intractable epilepsy in which 80 % of patients have a de novo mutation in the gene SCN1A. We recently reported that a high seizure burden increased hippocampal concentrations of an array of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins in the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome. This raised the possibility that a high seizure burden might also trigger the accumulation of specialized pro-resolving mediators that facilitate the resolution of neuroinflammation and brain repair. The present study therefore aimed to examine whether a high seizure burden increased hippocampal concentrations of various specialized pro- resolving mediators in the Scn1a+/- mouse model of Dravet syndrome. Methods: Scn1a+/- mice at postnatal day 21 (P21) were primed with a single hyperthermia-induced seizure event to induce a high seizure burden. On P24 primed Scn1a+/- mice with a high seizure burden, unprimed na & iuml;ve Scn1a+/- mice and wild-type (WT) mice were euthanized and hippocampal tissue was collected for analysis of various specialized pro-resolving mediators using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Scn1a+/- mice with a high seizure burden showed increased hippocampal concentrations of the pro- inflammatory leukotrienes B4 and E4. Further, a high seizure burden increased hippocampal concentrations of various special pro-resolving mediators, including the maresins (maresin1), D-series resolvins (RVD1 and RVD4), and protectin (PCTR1). To further characterize these changes, we determined the mRNA expression of lipoxygenase genes, as these synthetic enzymes are common across classes of specialized pro-resolving mediators. However, hippocampal expression of Alox5, Alox12 and Alox15 were not influenced by a high seizure burden. Significance: We report for the first time that a high seizure burden increases the hippocampal concentrations of various specialized pro-resolving mediators in Scn1a+/- mice. This provides a platform for future studies to examine whether modulation of these mediators might be exploited to reduce seizures and facilitate brain repair in intractable epilepsy syndromes.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of the in vivo bone response of two innovative titanium surfaces ytterbium laser active fiber obtained (L1-L2) compared to a sandblasted and acid etched (SBAE) during early phase of osseointegration. Material and Methods: Three implant groups with the same macroscopic features were obtained (L1-L2-SBAE) to promote specific surface characteristics. Scanning electron microscopy, profilometric evaluation, X-ray spectrometry, and diffraction analysis were performed. For each group, six implants were placed in the tibiae of three Peli Buey sheep, and histologic, histomorphometric analysis, bone to implant contact (BIC), and the Dynamic Osseointegration index (DOI) were performed. Results: During the early phases of osseointegration, the histological and histomorphometric results showed significant differences between L1-L2-SBAE implants. At 15 and 30 days, histological analysis detected a newly bone formation around all specimens with an higher vital bone in L2 compared to L1 and SBAE both in cortical and in poor-quality marrow bone. At same time, histomorphometric analysis showed significantly higher BIC values in L2 (42.1 +/- 2.6 and 82.4 +/- 2.2) compared to L1 (5.2 +/- 3.1 and 56.2 +/- 1.3) and SBAE (23.3 +/- 3.9 and 77.3 +/- 0.4). DOI medium value showed a higher rate in L2 (2.83) compared to SBAE (2.60) and L1 (1.91). Conclusions: With the limitations of this pilot study, it is possible to assess that the titanium surface characteristics, and not the technologies used to obtain the modification, played a crucial role during the osseointegration process. Histological, histomorphometric, BIC, and DOI evaluation showed a significantly higher rate in L2 specimens compared to others, confirming that the implant surface could increase the bone response in cortical or marrow poor quality bone during the initial phases of osseointegration.

AB  - Thomas's Flying Squirrel (Aeromys thomasi) is a rarely observed, large, nocturnal species of Flying Squirrel, confined to the island of Borneo. Very little is known about the ecology, behaviour, and natural history of the species. Fruit is the only diet item recorded so far. I report for the first time feeding on bark and on young leaf shoots by the species. These observations match the results of an examination of the species' dentition, which had suggested a mixed diet including leaves.

AB  - We provide the first data on the diet of Butler's Rice Frog (Microhyla butleri) and Heymon's Rice Frog (M. heymonsi) based on the stomach content analysis of 105 frog individuals (57 M. butleri; 48 M. heymonsi) from three sites in Son La Province, Vietnam. We found 11 distinct prey categories in the stomachs of M. butleri and nine in the stomachs of M. heymonsi. The diet composition of the two species was similar to each other with a trophic niche overlap of 0.97. Formicidae and Rhinotermitidae were the most important prey types for both species (Index of Relative Importance for these two taxa totaled 76% for M. butleri and 90% for M. heymonsi). The physical dimensions for the diet of M. butleri differed significantly from that for M. heymonsi by greater average food volume of each individual (36.62 +/- [standard deviation] 72.98 mm(3) and 34.17 +/- 98.92 mm(3), respectively), greater average volume of each food item (4.08 +/- 19.14 mm(3) and 2.51 +/- 2.89 mm(3), respectively), larger mean length of food item (2.61 +/- 1.49 mm and 2.06 +/- 0.88 mm, respectively), and smaller mean width of food item (1.17 +/- 0.61 mm and 1.29 +/- 0.51 mm, respectively). Frog mouth width was significantly positively correlated with prey length, width, and volume for M. butleri, and with prey length and volume for M. heymonsi. This is consistent with the gape limitation hypothesis that gape size limits prey size.

AB  - For this study, we examined a large sample of museum specimens to ascertain the reproductive ecology of Rhinophrynus dorsalis (Mexican Burrowing Toad) in Mexico. Seasonal aboveground activity was highest during May to August, which tracks monthly rainfall patterns across the region. Contrary to previous assertions, mean body sizes were similar between males and females but females attained larger maximum sizes. Male testis size was largest in May, tadpoles appeared in June, and juveniles were present in July, indicating that most breeding begins in May following the first heavy rains of the year. Few specimens possessed food in their stomachs suggesting that aboveground activity may be more devoted to reproduction than to foraging. The timing of reproduction was variable because most gravid females were encountered during May to August, but some were also present in October and January. Clutch size was estimated to range from 630 to 7,700 eggs, which was positively correlated with female body size. Size to sexual maturity in both males and females was reached in 8-9 mo after metamorphosis and at much smaller minimum and average sizes than previously reported. Adult body size was negatively related to latitude, such that the largest specimens were from the most southern latitudes, especially for males. The reproductive ecology of R. dorsalis resembles distantly related burrowing anurans more so than their close aquatic relatives in Pipidae.

AB  - Orexigenic neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus are activated in response to dynamic variations in the metabolic state, including exercise. We previously observed that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1A), a rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, is a key factor in AgRP neurons, modulating whole-body energy balance and fluid homeostasis. However, the effect of CPT1A in AgRP neurons in aged mice and during exercise has not been explored yet. We have evaluated the physical and cognitive capacity of adult and aged mutant male mice lacking Cpt1a in AgRP neurons (Cpt1a KO). Adult Cpt1a KO male mice exhibited enhanced endurance performance, motor coordination, locomotion, and exploration compared with control mice. No changes were observed in anxiety-related behavior, cognition, and muscle strength. Adult Cpt1a KO mice showed a reduction in gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscle mass. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of these muscles were smaller than those of control mice displaying a myofiber remodeling from type II to type I fibers. In aged mice, changes in myofiber remodeling were maintained in Cpt1a KO mice, avoiding loss of physical capacity during aging progression. Additionally, aged Cpt1a KO mice revealed better cognitive skills, reduced inflammation, and oxidative stress in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. In conclusion, CPT1A in AgRP neurons appears to modulate health and protects against aging. Future studies are required to clarify whether CPT1A is a potential antiaging candidate for treating diseases affecting memory and physical activity.

AB  - Beyond a few obvious examples (e.g., gut length, amylase activity), digestive and metabolic specializations towards diet remain elusive in fishes. Thus, we compared gut length, delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of the liver, and expressed genes in the intestine and liver of wild-caught individuals of four closely-related, sympatric prickleback species (family Stichaeidae) with different diets: Xiphister mucosus (herbivore), its sister taxon X. atropurpureus (omnivore), Phytichthys chirus (omnivore) and the carnivorous Anoplarchus purpurescens. We also measured the same parameters after feeding them carnivore or omnivore diets in the laboratory for 4 weeks. Growth and isotopic signatures showed assimilation of the laboratory diets, and gut length was significantly longer in X. mucosus in comparison to the other fishes, whether in the wild, or in the lab consuming the different diets. Dozens of genes relating to digestion and metabolism were observed to be under selection in the various species, but P. chirus stood out with some genes in the liver showing strong positive selection, and these genes correlating with differing isotopic incorporation of the laboratory carnivore diet in this species. Although the intestine showed variation in the expression of hundreds of genes in response to the laboratory diets, the liver exhibited species-specific gene expression patterns that changed very little (generally <40 genes changing expression, with P. chirus providing an exception). Overall, our results suggest that the intestine is plastic in function, but the liver may be where specialization manifests since this tissue shows species-specific gene expression patterns that match with natural diet.

AB  - Ischemic stroke accounts for the majority of stroke cases. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is being increasingly used as a treatment for this condition, but its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely elucidated. This study examined hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) effects on sodium channels in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and whole-cell patch-clamp technology, voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) currents were measured at varying HBOT time points and treatment durations. Results showed that with a longer CIRI duration, the maximum current density (MCD) of sodium current (INa) decreased, while more HBOT sessions increased the MCD of INa. Notably, in the MCAO 6H group, 12 treatments of HBOT induced a leftward shift in the INa activation curve. Early HBOT intervention provided greater neuroprotection for sodium channels, and increased treatment sessions enhanced functional recovery. These findings suggest HBO's therapeutic potential in mitigating CIRI-related neuronal damage.

AB  - Simple Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common breathing-related sleep disorders. The processes that take place in specific areas of the brain during distinct sleep stages and specific respiratory events are suspected to be impaired in OSA patients. These brain processes may be described in complex (mathematical) terms. Using one of these descriptions (phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling), we demonstrated in electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of OSA patients that the process sequences in certain areas of the brain are altered in distinct sleep stages of OSA patients compared to patients who do not suffer from clinically relevant OSA. In addition, we were able to find a physiological marker that assesses the severity of daytime sleepiness, one of the main symptoms of OSA. This study supports the hypothesis that OSA is a neuronal/neuromuscular disorder. Thus, it contributes to a better understanding of the so-far-unexplained cause for the development of OSA and opens new possibilities for the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with sleep-stage- and respiratory-event-specific sensorimotor cortico-muscular disconnection. The modulation of phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PACFC) may influence information processing throughout the brain. We investigated whether sleep-stage-specific PACFC is impaired at the sensorimotor areas in OSA patients. C3 and C4 electrode EEG polysomnography recordings of 170 participants were evaluated. Different frequency band combinations were used to compute CFC modulation index (MI) to assess if MI differs between OSA and non-significant OSA patients in distinct sleep stages. We tested if the CFC-MI could predict daytime sleepiness in OSA. Theta-gamma CFC-MI at cortical sensorimotor areas was significantly reduced during all sleep stages; the delta-alpha CFC-MI was significantly reduced during REM and N1 while increasing during N2 in patients with respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 15/h compared to those with RDI <= 15/h. A sleep stage classification using MI values was achieved in both patient groups. Theta-gamma MI during N2 and N3 could predict RDI and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, while delta-alpha MI during REM predicted RDI. This increase in disconnection at the cortical sensorimotor areas with increasing respiratory distress during sleep supports a cortical motor dysfunction in OSA patients. The MI provides an objective marker to quantify subjective sleepiness and respiratory distress in OSA.

AB  - In memory experiences, events do not exist independently but are linked with each other via structure-based organization. Structure context largely influences memory behavior, but how it is implemented in the brain remains unknown. Here, we combined magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings, computational modeling, and impulse-response approaches to probe the latent states when subjects held a list of items in working memory (WM). We demonstrate that sequence context reorganizes WM items into distinct latent states, that is, being reactivated at different latencies during WM retention, and the reactivation profiles further correlate with recency behavior. In contrast, memorizing the same list of items without sequence task requirements weakens the recency effect and elicits comparable neural reactivations. Computational modeling further reveals a dominant function of sequence context, instead of passive memory decaying, in characterizing recency effect. Taken together, sequence structure context shapes the way WM items are stored in the human brain and essentially influences memory behavior.

AB  - Background: Ginseng Radix (Panax ginseng Meyer, Araliaceae) has been used medicinally to treat the brain and nervous system problems worldwide. Recent studies have revealed physiological effects that could potentially benefit cognitive performance or mood. The present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of Korean red ginseng water extract (KGE) and its active component in an unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced animal model and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Methods: The antidepressant potential of the UCMS model was evaluated using the sucrose preference test and open field tests. The behavioral findings were further corroborated by the assessment of neurotransmitters and their metabolites from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. Three doses of KGE (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) were orally administered during the experiment. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the antidepressant-like action of KGE was examined by measuring the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/CREB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) proteins in the prefrontal cortex of UCMS-exposed rats.Results: KGE treatment normalized UCMS-induced depression-related behaviors. Neurotransmitter studies conducted after completing behavioral experiments demonstrated that KGE caused a reduction in the ratio of serotonin and dopamine, indicating a decrease in serotonin and dopamine turnover. Moreover, the expression of BDNF, Nrf2, Keap1 and AKT were markedly increased by KGE in the prefrontal cortex of depressed rats.Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that KGE and its constituents exert antidepressant effects that mediate the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and expression of BDNF protein in an animal model.& COPY; 2023 The Korean Society of Ginseng.

AB  - Animals use signals to communicate effectively with each other during various stages of their life. In turtles, the production and recognition of signals are of decisive importance during the breeding season, influencing successful mate selection. We studied behavioral responses used by male Furrowed Wood Turtles (Rhinoclemmys areolata) to recognize different stimuli related to conspecific females. Across four experiments, we exposed 17 males to four stimuli: (1) a concave cup; (2) a female-scented plate; (3) an empty carapace; and (4) a live female. We divided the observation area into quadrants to analyze displacements and temporal proximity of turtles to stimuli. Comprehensive documentation of male behaviors enabled classification into categories of searching or interaction. Our findings revealed that males exhibited minimal interest in the concave cup stimulus, with no discernible increase in time spent or frequency of entries in the corresponding quadrant. Conversely, males spent more time in the quadrant with scent, carapace, or a female. Specifically, searching behaviors were more frequent in the presence of a live female. In contrast, interaction behaviors were pronounced with the carapace and live female stimuli, minimally occurring with the cup or scent. Our work suggests that male turtles are multisensory organisms able to use sight or odors to detect females at short distances. Furthermore, interaction behaviors appear to occur specifically with live females, demonstrating the ability of males of this species to recognize them through different types of stimuli. These findings contribute to comprehend sensory dynamics of reproductive behaviors in turtles.

AB  - Osteoglossomorpha, the bony tongue fishes, show great variation in morphology, behavioural strategies, reproductive biology and gamete ultrastructure. The order Osteoglossiformes is the only vertebrate taxon, in which four types of sperm (monoflagellate, biflagellate and aflagellate aquasperm and the complex introsperm) have been described. It is also the only vertebrate lineage in which aflagellate spermatozoa exist. The aim of this study was to analyse the structure of the testis and the process of spermiogenesis in the mormyrid Campylomormyrus compressirostris during the breeding season using light and electron microscopy (transmission and scanning). Males of this species have a single testis of the anastomosing tubular type. The tubules of the anterior part of the testis contain cysts with developing germ cells, and this region is much wider than the posterior part, which consists of efferent ducts filled with sperm cells. The cysts are filled with single or mitotic spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes and early spermatids. At the stage of spermatids with fine granular chromatin, the cysts rupture and successive stages of spermatid differentiation take place in the testicular lumen; we therefore characterise this process as 'extracystic spermiogenesis '. Sperm development in C. compressirostris is extremely simple and involves chromatin condensation in the central region of the nucleus, a slight decrease in nuclear volume, the appearance of numerous vesicles in the cytoplasm that form a tubular-vesicular system at the base of the nucleus. Both centrioles and mitochondria are translocated to the peripheral region of the midpiece, which forms the opposite pole to the nucleus. There are many differences between the types of spermiogenesis described so far in teleosts and that found in C. compressirostris, including the loss of flagellum formation. This unique type of spermiogenesis is restricted to species of the families Mormyridae and Gymnarchidae, all of which possess aflagellate spermatozoa. Our data demonstrate that the spermatid differentiation and existence of the aflagellate spermatozoon are a unique phenomena not only among teleosts but also in the whole vertebrate lineage.

AB  - Eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) migrate between breeding roosts and overwintering roosts each year. This project describes microbat exit count patterns across different seasons at a disused oil shale adit (i.e. horizontal mine passage) near Mudgee in New South Wales. We also document adit occupation seasonality for Miniopterus orianae oceanensis and the eastern horseshoe-bat (Rhinolophus megaphyllus). This information can be used to guide survey effort and timing for adit microbat investigations. The majority of bats exited within 50 min of the first exit, which typically occurs between 9 and 27 min after sunset.

AB  - In caridean shrimps, sexual systems vary from gonochorism to various forms of hermaphroditism. The shrimp Salmoneus carvachoi has been reported to exhibit both male (appendix masculina) and female (brooding embryos) anatomical characteristics simultaneously. Our aim was to examine the sexual system of S. carvachoi and to test the hypothesis of protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism (PSH) in this species. We analysed internal and external features using microscopy and histology techniques. Our analyses support the hypothesis of PSH in S. carvachoi and enabled the identification of male-phase and hermaphroditic individuals. All individuals exhibit a well-developed appendix masculina on the endopods of the second pleopods; however, small male-phase individuals possess only male gonopores, whereas larger hermaphroditic individuals possess both female and male gonopores. Hermaphrodites exhibit both male and female germinative cells in various stages of development, as well as an androgenic gland. Our study describes a novel sexual system for alpheids and provides a detailed description of anatomical traits in S. carvachoi. Studies that describe sexual systems in Alpheidae may shed light on the evolutionary history of gender expression in carideans and how environmental conditions favour sex allocation in decapods and other invertebrates.

AB  - The neogastropod family Vasidae comprises a small group of Late Eocene to Recent neogastropods with large, often ornate shells. A new, shell -based morphological classification of the family is proposed, in which ten genera are recognized: Altivasum Hedley, 1914, Aristovasum gen. nov. (type species: Turbinella cassiforme Kiener, 1840), Florivasum gen. nov. (type species: Turbinella tubifera Anton, 1838), Globivasum Abbott, 1950 (type species: Turbinella nuttingi Henderson, 1919, but expanded here), Hystrivasum Olsson & Petit, 1964 (type species: Vasum horridum Heilprin, 1887), Rhinovasum gen. nov. (type species: Voluta rhinoceros Gmelin, 1791), Siphovasum Rehder & Abbott, 1951, Tudivasum Rosenberg & Petit, 1987, Vasum Roding, 1798 (here restricted to a reef -associated group of three species typified by Murex turbinellus Linnaeus, 1758), and Volutella Perry, 1810 (here resurrected from synonymy with Vasum, type species Voluta muricata Born, 1778). Biogeographically the Vasidae exhibit a deep divergence between the Atlantic -East Pacific and Indo-West Pacific realms dating to the Early Miocene.

Thus, there are confusions over how to correctly identify closely related and sympatric species, especially in female odonates. One such example is in the genus Rhinocypha. Consequently, the present study focuses on taxonomic work, employing multiapproaches in the form of morphological (morphological diagnostics, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and geometric morphometric analysis), applying the molecular technique. Seventeen morphological characteristics were created to differentiate between the females of Rhinocypha spp. A FESEM was used on the female's ovipositor to focus on the anal appendages and sheathing valve (V3). Also, the phylogenetic patterns expressed by COI and 16S rRNA genes, and canonical variate analysis for the wing geometric morphometric revealed three clusters that supported the distinction of the Rhinocypha group. In summary, this study effectively developed an integrated approach of classic morphological and trendy molecular, combined with FESEM microscopy techniques, which provided corroborative evidence and resolved taxonomic uncertainties.

AB  - Multimodal communication in animals is common, and is particularly well studied in signals that include both visual and auditory components. Multimodal signals that combine acoustic and olfactory components are less well known. Multimodal communication plays a crucial role in agonistic interactions in many mammals, but relatively little is known about this type of communication in nocturnal mammals. Here, we used male Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats Hipposideros armiger to investigate multimodal signal function in acoustic and olfactory aggressive displays. We monitored the physiological responses (heart rate [HR]) when H. armiger was presented with 1 of 3 stimuli: territorial calls, forehead gland odors, and bimodal signals (calls + odors). Results showed that H. armiger rapidly increased their HR when exposed to any of the 3 stimuli. However, the duration of elevated HR and magnitude of change in HR increased significantly more when acoustic stimuli were presented alone compared with the presentation of olfactory stimuli alone. In contrast, the duration of elevated HR and magnitude of change in HR were significantly higher with bimodal stimuli than with olfactory stimuli alone, but no significant differences were found between the HR response to acoustic and bimodal stimuli. Our previous work showed that acoustic and chemical signals provided different types of information; here we describe experiments investigating the responses to those signals. These results suggest that olfactory and acoustic signals are non-redundant signal components, and that the acoustic component is the dominant modality in male H. armiger, at least as it related to HR. This study provides the first evidence that acoustic signals dominate over olfactory signals during agonistic interactions in a nocturnal mammal.

AB  - Brivaracetam (BRV) is recognized as a novel third-generation antiepileptic drug approved for the treatment of epilepsy. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that it has potentially better efficacy and tolerability than its analog, Levetiracetam (LEV). This, however, cannot be explained by their common synaptic vesicle-binding mechanism. Whether BRV can affect different ionic currents and concert these effects to alter neuronal excitability remains unclear. With the aid of patch clamp technology, we found that BRV concentration dependently inhibited the depolarization-induced M-type K+ current (I-K(M)), decreased the delayed-rectifier K+ current (I-K(DR)), and decreased the hyperpolarization-activated cation current in GH3 neurons. However, it had a concentration-dependent inhibition on voltage-gated Na+ current (I-Na). Under an inside-out patch configuration, a bath application of BRV increased the open probability of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Furthermore, in mHippoE-14 hippocampal neurons, the whole-cell I-Na was effectively depressed by BRV. In simulated modeling of hippocampal neurons, BRV was observed to reduce the firing of the action potentials (APs) concurrently with decreases in the AP amplitude. In animal models, BRV ameliorated acute seizures in both OD-1 and lithium-pilocarpine epilepsy models. However, LEV had effects in the latter only. Collectively, our study demonstrated BRV's multiple ionic mechanism in electrically excitable cells and a potential concerted effect on neuronal excitability and hyperexcitability disorders.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising antibacterial agents in the fight against multidrug resistant pathogens. However, their application to skin infections is limited by the absence of a realizable topical delivery strategy. Herein, a hybrid hierarchical delivery system for topical delivery of AMPs is accomplished through the incorporation of AMPs into dendritic nanogels (DNGs) and their subsequent embedding into poloxamer gel. The high level of control over the crosslink density and the number of chosen functionalities makes DNGs ideal capsules with tunable loading capacity for DPK-060, a human kininogen-derived AMP. Once embedded into the poloxamer gel, DPK-060 encapsulated in DNGs displays a slower release rate compared to those entrapped directly in the gels. In vitro EpiDerm Skin Irritation Tests show good biocompatibility, while MIC and time-kill curves reveal the potency of the peptide toward Staphylococcus aureus. Anti-infection tests on ex vivo pig skin and in vivo mouse infection models demonstrate that formulations with 0.5% and 1% AMPs significantly inhibit the growth of S. aureus. Similar outcomes are observed for an in vivo mouse surgical site infection model. Importantly, when normalizing the bacteria inhibition to released/free DPK-060 at the wound site, all formulations display superior efficacy compared to DPK-060 in solution.

AB  - The spoon-tipped (ST) setae coverage and their abundance on the second maxillipeds as well as the morphology of the urocardiac and zygocardiac ossicles from the gastric mills of the four ocypodid species, viz., Austruca annulipes (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), Gelasimus vocans (Linnaeus), 1758, two typical deposit-feeding fiddler crabs, Petruca panamensis (Stimpson, 1859), an atypical herbivorous-cum-'sediment swallower' fiddler crab, and Ocypode ceratophthalmus (Pallas, 1772), an omnivorous ghost crab, were described and compared in relation to their respective trophic habits. In the three fiddler crabs, ST setae coverage and abundance generally correlated with their habitats' sediment grain size characteristics-more ST setae in A. annulipes ('sandy-habitat crab') and less in G. vocans ('muddy-habitat crab'). ST setae were absent in O. ceratophthalmus, which suggests that these setae were not needed for food processing. In the two deposit-feeding fiddler crabs, the median tooth of the urocardiac ossicle had tooth-like transverse ridges to grind against the dentition of the lateral teeth of the zygocardiac ossicles. The median tooth in P. panamensis, however, had transverse ridges that resemble that of a vascular plant eater as well as some posterior tooth-like transverse ridges, typically found in deposit feeders; and twice the number of incisors than the other three ocypodids, for cutting up ingested algal pieces. The omnivorous O. ceratopthalmus had four raised transverse ridges on the round blunt median tooth as well as large premolars and molars on the zygocardiac lateral teeth for maceration of animal tissue. Hence, ST setae abundance as well as the grinding surfaces and dentition of the two gastric mill ossicles are indicative of the habitat adaptations and trophic habits respectively.

FX  - This paper is dedicated to our dear friend, Ngan Kee, with the fondest of memories as she introduced us to the fascinating topic of gastric mill morphology 13 years ago. Due to our individual busy schedules, it was unfortunate that we did not have the opportunity to deepen our collaboration in this area of research, save for a conference presentation based on some preliminary work on gastric mills of the local Singapore ocypodids, at the ICC7 in Qingdao, China in 2010. We are deeply appreciative of the editors of this Memorial Volume for extending the invitation to two non-taxonomists to be part of this meaningful tribute to Ngan Kee. Comments from two anonymous reviewers contributed to the improvement of the manuscript substantially. Dr John Christy's great hospitality at his laboratory in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Panama, is gratefully acknowledged. The Authoridad de Recursos Acuaticos de Panama (ARAP) granted us the ARAP Collection Permit for the collection of P. panamensis from Punta Culebra.

AB  - We examined external characters and internal anatomy, after dorsal dissection, of 11 species of Oligochaeta from the Peruvian Amazonia Loreto department. Four new species of families Glossoscolecidae and Rhinodrilidae and genera Righiodrilus and Martiodrilus are described here. Righiodrilus omagua, sp. nov., differs from other Righiodrilus by the presence of tubercula pubertatis in segments 1/215, 15-1/218, 18; male pores located in intersegment 16/17; large seminal vesicles in segment 12 that extend until segment 24. Martiodrilus (Maipure) yurimaguensis, sp. nov., has a saddle -shaped clitellum in 14-1/4 25 and tubercula pubertatis between segments 1/318 -1/2 25. Martiodrilus (Maipure) tapiai, sp. nov., is differentiated from the others by the position of the tubercula pubertatis in 19-24, and the shape and size of spermathecae, common setae, ornamentation of genital setae and the location of male pores in intersegment 18/19. Martiodrilus (Martiodrilus) alegrei sp. nov., differs from other species of the genus by extension of tubercula pubertatis from 21 to 26, the number and shape of spermathecae. It is the only species of the genus that presents a single pair of spermathecae in segment 6. Additional records for the Peruvian Republic and the Amazonian region are also reported for Martiodrilus (Maipure) pano, Periscolex yuya, Pontoscolex (Pontoscolex) corethrurus, Rhinodrilus lavellei, Rhinodrilus pahanasii, Dichogaster (Diplothecodrilus) modiglianii and Ocnerodrilus occidentalis. With these new records, the earthworm fauna of Peru recorded so far increases to 36 species (21 native and 15 exotic), including eight native from Peruvian Amazonia Region. Many more species are still expected to be found.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in the evolutionary cytogenetics of squamates, chromosomal data are lacking for most taxa. We performed a preliminary molecular taxonomic analysis and a comparative cytogenetic study on Hemorrhois hippocrepis and Malpolon monspessulanus. We used a combination of standard karyotyping, Chromomycin A(3)/Methyl green staining, C-banding, Ag-NOR staining and NOR-FISH to provide the first karyotype description of H. hippocrepis and a re-description of the karyotype of M. monspessulanus, including chromosome markers, heterochromatin patterns and sex chromosome systems. Our results show that H. hippocrepis has 2 n = 36 chromosomes, with 16 macro- and 20 microchromosomes and NORs on the 6(th) pair. The 4(th) pair represents homomorphic (metacentric) ZW sex chromosomes, but the W chromosome is completely heterochromatic. Malpolon monspessulanus has 2 n = 44 chromosomes, with 20 macro- and 24 microchromosomes, NORs on the 6(th) telocentric pair. The 4(th) pair represents the sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW), with a W chromosome smaller than the Z and completely heterochromatic. Comparing our cytogenetic data to those available from the literature, we note the occurrence and distribution of primitive and derived chromosomal characteristics and discuss the chromosome diversification in two snake clades belonging to Colubridae and Psammophiidae, respectively. We highlight that these two families followed different chromosome diversification pathways, characterised by a highly conserved karyotype structure in Colubridae and a higher chromosome variability in Psammophiidae, mostly driven by a progressive reduction of the chromosome number by means of chromosome fusions. We also provide cytotaxonomic insights supporting the distinction between M. monspessulanus and M. insignitus.

AB  - Type material of 12 mammal taxa originally proposed as species or subspecies are housed in the former Macleay Museum (now Macleay Collections, Chau Chak Wing Museum), University of Sydney and consist of seven holotypes and 12 syntypes. These were published from 1875 to 1887, five by N.N. Miklouho-Maclay and seven by E.P. Ramsay, of which six are currently considered valid taxa. Six type specimens are identified in the Collection for the first time. This includes rediscovery of the holotype skull of the New Guinean forest wallaby Dorcopsis chalmersii Miklouho-Maclay not reported since its description in 1884, a likely syntype of the bandicoot Perameles macroura torosa Ramsay, and three additional syntypes of the flying fox Pteropus (Epomops?) epularius Ramsay. The holotype of the dasyurid Antechinus (Podabrus) froggatti Ramsay, housed at the Australian Museum since before 1959, is also discussed. Limited specimen data currently prevents validation of an additional six specimens identified here as suspected syntypes of four further names: the macropodoids Halmaturus mastersii Krefft, Halmaturus crassipes Ramsay and Hypsiprymnodon moschatus Ramsay, and the bandicoot Perameles moresbyensis Ramsay. Individual accounts are given for a total of 21 proposed names. Type material of four of these remain unlocated in world collections and it is not known if they were ever in the Macleay Collections: the bandicoot Brachymelis garagassi Miklouho-Maclay, 1884; the wallaby Macropus tibol Miklouho-Maclay, 1885; the cuscus Cuscus chrysorrhous var. goldiei Ramsay and the giant rat Hapalotis papuanus Ramsay. The nomenclatural status of the possum Phalangista pinnata Ramsay, 1877, a possible nomen nudum, is also discussed. No nomenclatural actions are taken in this paper.

AB  - Multilevel societies, consisting of multiple one-male multi-female units, are relatively rare among primates, but are more widespread in the odd-nosed colobines than other taxa. Multilevel societies are found particularly in snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus)and have been debated in studies of proboscis monkeys (Proboscis). While it has been suggested that douc langurs (Pygathrix) may also form multilevel societies, the limited data available make the details of their social organization unclear. We aimed to establish a more comprehensive picture of the social organization of red-shanked doucs (Pygathrix nemaeus) and to address the question of whether this species forms multilevel societies, specifically collections of multiple distinct one-male units hereafter termed "bands." We collected 259 h of behavioral data at Son Tra Nature Reserve in Vietnam from February 2010 to May 2011. The mean band size was approximately 18 individuals. Bands were comprised of approximately 2.7 units, and each unit contained approximately 6.5 individuals. Units had an average sex ratio of 1.0:1.6. We observed fission and fusion behaviors which were not correlated with phenological or weather measures. Activity budget data showed that fission and fusion behaviors between units were positively correlated with activity. Both vocalizations and vigilance increased when units engaged in fission. Based on this evidence, P. nemaeus at Son Tra Nature Reserve appear to engage in daily fission-fusion activity which does not vary between seasons. Additionally, our data suggest that these primates may form multilevel societies made up of distinct units. However, future data including proximity pattern analyses are necessary for confirmation.

AB  - There is currently a paucity of publications reporting different ways of minimising stress in collared mammals. We describe the construction of a DIY (do-it-yourself; i.e. self-made) radio-collar attachment that can improve the animal welfare outcomes of radio-tracking surveys for small macropods. The flexible collar is light, designed for long-term wear, and can stretch to allow a snagged animal to free itself without choking. We present our findings using capture and radio-collaring data from a population of an endangered macropod. Of 39 DIY radio-collars, 25 remained attached for over four months, 4 fell off naturally after 9-15 weeks, and 10 were unattached by other mechanisms ( e.g. a predation event). Adverse reactions were uncommon, and we present recommendations for future radio-collaring studies.

AB  - White-cheeked macaque Macaca leucogenys is a recently described primate species discovered by camera-trap surveys in the Medog region in 2015. The species was thought to be narrowly distributed in southeastern Tibet. However, knowledge on the distribution and conservation of the species is quite limited. Based on a systematic camera-trapping survey, we report the occurrence of the species in the Gaoligong Mountains, over 350 km southeast of the nearest known population. We recorded 3025 photographs of white-cheeked macaques representing 481 independent records from 59 camera-trap stations with total trapping efforts of 18,437 camera days. Notably, part of the newly discovered locations of the white-cheeked macaque are outside of nature reserves without any formal protection and management. Our survey also confirms the occurrence of ten primate species in the Gaoligong Mountains, accounting for 35.7% of China's primates, including the Skywalker hoolock gibbon Hoolock tianxing and the Myanmar snub-nosed monkey Rhinopithecus strykeri etc. These findings reveal a new distribution record for the white-cheeked macaque and further highlight the conservation values of Gaoligong Mountains for globally threatened primate species. We also provide a preliminary report on the daily activity patterns of this endangered species, which enriches the bio-ecological data of the poorly studied species. We believe the report has significant implications for understanding the ecology of the species and improving conservation planning.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially modulated firing, or place fields, which can remap to encode changes in the environment or other variables. Unique among hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) has two excitatory populations of place cells, granule cells and mossy cells, which are among the least and most active spatially modulated cells in the hippocampus, respectively. Previous studies of remapping in the DG have drawn different conclusions about whether granule cells exhibit global remapping and contribute to the encoding of context specificity. By recording granule cells and mossy cells as mice foraged in different environments, we found that by most measures, both granule cells and mossy cells remapped robustly but through different mechanisms that are consistent with firing properties of each cell type. Our results resolve the ambiguity surrounding remapping in the DG and suggest that most spatially modulated granule cells contribute to orthogonal representations of distinct spatial contexts.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells are thought to constitute a cognitive map of space derived from multimodal sensory inputs. Alteration of allocentric (visual) cues in a fixed environment is known to induce modulations of place cell activity to varying degrees from rate changes to global remapping. To determine how hippocampal ensembles combine multimodal sensory cues, we examine hippocampal CA1 remapping in Mongolian gerbils in a 1D virtual reality experiment, during which self-motion cues (locomotor, vestibular, and optic flow information) and allocentric visual cues are altered. We observe that self-motion cues are over-represented, but responsiveness to allocentric visual cues, although task-irrelevant, elicits both rate and global remapping in the hippocampal ensemble. We propose that remapping can be reconciled by considering global, partial, and rate remapping on a continuous scale on which the graded change of activity in the entire CA1 population can be interpreted as the expectancy about the animal's spatial environment.

AB  - In Japan, three trematode species of the genus Azygia have been recorded: A. gotoi, A. perryii, and A. rhinogobii. Here, we report the first detection of A. hwangtsiyui in Japan, identified from the introduced snakehead Channa argus. This trematode was previously known only from the snakeheads in mainland China. Between 2015 and 2024, we sampled snakeheads and snails in Japan, collecting adult trematodes and rediae. Adult trematodes were identified morphologically as A. hwangtsiyui, a determination corroborated by molecular analyses of the COI and 28S rDNA regions. Rediae extracted from the snail Sinotaia quadrata histrica were also identified molecularly as A. hwangtsiyui, indicating the snail acts as an intermediate host. Juvenile trematodes from the short-spined Japanese trident goby Tridentiger brevispinis were also morphologically identified as A. hwangtsiyui, indicating that this goby acts as a paratenic host. Given the snakehead's introduction to Japan between 1923 and 1924, the absence of records of later introductions, and the presence of both intermediate and paratenic hosts in Japan at that time, A. hwangtsiyui was likely introduced concurrently with the snakehead. As the detection of three COI haplotypes suggests multiple introductions, subsequent introductions via the aquarium trade or other pathways involving the transport of freshwater fish and mollusks from Asia to Japan are also plausible.

AB  - We describe a new species of blind skink of the genus Dibamus Dum & eacute;ril et Bibron, 1839 based on five specimens collected from Bokor National Park, Kampot Province, southern Cambodia. Dibamus elephantinussp. n. can be distinguished from its congeners by the following combination of morphological characters: snout-vent length (SVL) up to 129.3 mm; tail length comprises 17-22% of SVL; rostral suture incomplete; nasal and labial sutures complete; single postocular; three scales at the posteromedial edge of first infralabial; two scales at the posterior edge of second infralabial; the medial sublabial scale enlarged; 19 midbody scale rows; 22 transverse scale rows just posterior to head; 17-19 transverse scale rows just anterior to vent; 178-202 ventral scales; 46-52 subcaudal scales; relative size of frontal to frontonasal (FSW/FNSW) 127-136%; relative size of interparietal to surrounding scales (IPW/NSW) 111-140%; in males hindlimbs longer than head length (HLL/HL 74-78%); the light colored band on the body may be present or absent. We provide an osteological description of the new species based on micro- CT data. Genetically and morphologically Dibamus elephantinussp. n. is most closely related to D. dalaiensisinhabiting the western part of the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia. The new species inhabits montane evergreen forests of Damrei Range (also known as Elephant Mountains) at elevations of ca. 1000 m a. s. l. Our study brings the number of species in the genus Dibamus to 27; Dibamus elephantinussp. n. is the second species of Dibamus to be recorded from Cambodia

AB  - The marsh rat (Holochilus chacarius) is considered a specialist herbivorous rodent. In this study, we report the first predation event of an anuran (Pseudis platensis) by a marsh rat in the Pantanal wetlands, South America. This unprecedent event in a flooded wetland in the municipality of Corumb & aacute;, Mato Grosso do Sul state, southwestern Brazil. Due to the flashlight, the rodent ceased its predatory activity and left, carrying the anuran in its mouth. Our findings contribute to the natural history of the marsh rat, highlighting that this herbivorous rodent can incorporate fresh animal matter into its diet.

AB  - During a nematode survey in Iran, an abundant population of sheathoid, migratory, root-ectoparasitic nematodes was recovered from a tea, Camellia sinensis (L.), Kuntze plantation for the first time. Morphological and molecular characterization identified the Iranian population as Hemicriconemoides kanayaensis. The morphometrics of H. kanayaensis agreed with the original description. Phylogenetic relationships within Hemicriconemoides-based on ITS region, D2 to D3 expansion regions of the 28S rRNA, and the partial 18S rRNA genes along with the partial mitochondrial COI gene-confirmed the occurrence of H. kanayaensis on the tea plantation in Iran. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the high intraspecific and interspecific variabilities among Hemicriconemoides species and between H. kanayaensis populations.

AB  - Herbivory is common in mammals, yet our understanding of detoxification processes used by mammals to biotransform plant secondary compounds (PSCs) is limited. Specialist herbivores are thought to have evolved detoxification mechanisms that rely more heavily on energetically cheap Phase I biotransformation reactions to process high levels of PSCs in their diets. We explored this hypothesis by comparing the urinary metabolite patterns of two specialist herbivores (genus Neotoma). Neotoma stephensi is an obligate specialist on one-seeded juniper (Juniperus monosperma). Neotoma lepida is a generalist forager across its range, yet populations in the Great Basin specialize on Utah juniper (J. osteosperma). While both juniper species have high levels of terpenes, the terpene profiles and quantities differ between the two. Individuals from both woodrat species were fed diets of each juniper in a cross-over design. Urine, collected over a 24-h period, was extracted and analyzed in an untargeted metabolomics approach using both GC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS. The obligate specialist N. stephensi excreted a unique pattern of Phase I metabolites when fed its native juniper, while N. lepida excreted a unique pattern of Phase II metabolites when fed its native juniper. Both woodrat species utilized the Phase II metabolic pathway of glucuronidation more heavily when consuming the more chemically diverse J. osteosperma, and N. stephensi utilized less glucuronidation than N. lepida when consuming J. monosperma. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that obligate specialists may have evolved unique and efficient biotransformation mechanisms for dealing with PSCs in their diet.

TI  - Liquid-liquid phase separation of RBM33 facilitates hippocampus aging by inducing microglial senescence by activating CDKN1A

KW  - Microglial senescence
KW  - Hippocampus aging

KW  - RNA-BINDING-PROTEIN
AB  - Microglia play an important role in hippocampus-dependent memory and cognitive function. Microglial aging contributes to hippocampal aging and influences neurodegenerative diseases, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. RBM33 was highly expressed in the hippocampus of naturally aged mice and senescent microglia. Hippocampus-specific genetic deletion of RBM33 alleviated age-related declines in learning and memory in aged RBM33 knockout (RBM33-/-) mice. In contrast, hippocampus-specific overexpression of RBM33 exacerbated these declines in aged RBM33 overexpression (RBM33Tg) mice, indicating that RBM33 acts as an age-promoting factor in the hippocampus. Mechanistically, RBM33 forms liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in cells. RBM33 LLPS is required for its binding to the CDKN1A (p21cip1) promoter in a non-canonical transcriptional regulatory manner, leading to hippocampus-dependent declines in learning and memory by inducing microglial senescence. This study reveals that the RBM33 LLPS/ p21cip1 axis facilitates brain aging by inducing microglial senescence. Targeting the RBM33 LLPS/ p21cip1 axis may represent a therapeutic strategy to mitigate microglia senescence-mediated brain aging and hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline.

AB  - A new species and two new records of marine gobies from the genus Eviota were discovered in Taiwan between 2017 and 2023. The new species, Eviota rubrostriata n. sp., was found in eastern Taiwan and is more related to the E. zebrina complex, both morphologically and genetically. Bayesian analysis suggests it has a closer phylogenetic relationship to E. pseudozebrina from Fiji. The new species can be easily distinguished from other congeners by the following unique combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin I/8, anal fin I/7, pectoral fin 14; (2) longitudinal scale rows 23-24; (3) typical head canal pattern type 2; (4) fifth pelvic fin rays about 8-10% of fourth pelvic fin rays; (5) mouth large, extending to middle vertical of eye; and (6) specific coloration: ventral profile after anus with 6-7 main blackish brown spots; infraorbital band wide, deep red through posterior upper lip to lower lip; opercle with a horizontal blackish brown triangular stripe; eye with 5 main brown red regions; first dorsal fin with red spots in distal filamentous anterior 2 spinous rays in male; pectoral fin base with an orange band between two snow white bars; caudal fin base with a vertical black line, in front of the line with a pentagon shape of large black spot; and bright yellow above and below the black spot. Two new records of Eviota species from Taiwan are Eviota storthynx (Rofen, 1959) from eastern Taiwan and Eviota rubriguttata Greenfield & Suzuki, 2011 from Penghu, western Taiwan. A brief discussion of the new species with related species is also included.

AB  - Persistent use of the Mayurjharna forest by elephants led to its declaration as "Mayurjharna Elephant Reserve (ER)" in 2002; however, the usage changed over time. We describe the elephant movement pattern and the quality forage availability in the Mayurjharna ER. We collected past and current sightings of elephants from people and records of the Forest Department and constructed the range used from 1950 to 2018. Initially, the range of elephants in the reserve was similar to 80 km(2) in 1950-1959 that increased to similar to 572 km(2) by 1990-1999 but later decreased to similar to 152 km(2) in 2010-2018. The high human settlements, alteration, and overexploitation of the forest might lead the elephants to the rich agricultural lands outside the reserve, making the reserve just a gateway for elephants to move to other parts of the South Bengal landscape.

AB  - Water availability is one of the most important factors for terrestrial life. Terrestrial habitats may periodically become dry, which can be overcome by an organism's capability to undergo anhydrobiosis. In animals, this phenomenon has been reported for invertebrates, with tardigrades being the best-known. However, different tardigrade species appear to significantly differ in their anhydrobiotic abilities. While several studies have addressed this issue, established experimental protocols for tardigrade dehydration differ both within and among species, leading to ambiguous results. Therefore, we apply unified conditions to estimate intra-and interspecies differences in anhydrobiosis ability reflected by the return to active life. We analysed Milnesium inceptum and Ramazzottius subanomalus representing predatory and herbivorous species, respectively, and often co-occur in the same habitat. The results indicated that the carnivorous Mil. inceptum displays better anhydrobiosis survivability than the herbivorous Ram. subanomalus. This tendency to some degree coincides with the time of "waking up" since Mil. inceptum showed first movements and full activity of any first individual later than Ram. subanomalus. The movements of all individuals were however observed to be faster for Mil. inceptum. Differences between the experimental groups varying in anhydrobiosis length were also observed: the longer tun state duration, the more time was necessary to return to activity.

AB  - Three new species of gobiid fish of Luciogobius Gill, 1859 have been recently discovered in Taiwan. Luciogobius chiaojinensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from Keelung, northern Taiwan. It can be distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin rays: I/10 and anal fin rays I/11; (2) pectoral fin rays modally 13 and with one upper, short free soft ray; (3) vertebral count: 20 + 21 = 41; and (4) specific coloration: head and body with small tiny blackish brown spots. Head with densely-set small blackish brown spots in male; second dorsal fin brown and darker on lower half; pectoral fin base on upper 1/2 region with round melanophores; and pectoral fin membrane mostly spotless. Luciogobius huatungensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from Hualien and Taitung Counties in eastern Taiwan. It can be well distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin modally I/15 and anal fin I/15; (2) pectoral fin rays 14 and with 4 upper, free soft rays and 1 lower free rays; (3) vertebral count: 17 + 22 = 39; and (4) specific coloration: body brown with minute creamy yellow round spots; head and body with small brown spots; belly creamy yellow with fewer brown spots; second dorsal fin with tiny white marks; and pectoral fin with several round melanophores, most membrane with brown marks. Luciogobius newtaipeiensis sp. nov. is found and collected mainly from New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. It can be well distinguished from other congeneric species by the following combination of features: (1) second dorsal fin rays: I/11 and anal fin rays I/12; (2) pectoral fin rays modally 18 and with 1 upper free soft ray; (3) vertebral count: 16 + 20 = 36; (4) a dermal projection on posterior part of eye; and (5) specific coloration: head and body with small tiny brownish black spots; second dorsal rays light brown; and pectoral fin base with many small melanophores, fin membrane with melanophores on basal region. A diagnostic key for all six nominal species of Taiwan and the Matsu Islands will be provided in this paper.

AB  - Published studies and ten new unpublished records included herein reveal that approximately 174 species of endoparasites (helminths and protozoans) are known from 65 of 163 species of rodents that occupy the subterranean ecotope globally. Of those, 94 endoparasite species were originally described from these rodents. A total of 282 host-parasite associations are summarized from four major zoogeographic regions including Ethiopian, Palearctic/Oriental, Nearctic, and Neotropical. Thirty-four parasite records from the literature have been identified to only the level of the genus. In this summary, ten new records have been added, and the most current taxonomic status of each parasite species is noted. Interestingly, there are no data on endoparasites from more than 68% of described subterranean rodents, which indicates that discovery and documentation are at an early stage and must continue.

AB  - Although the mammalian cerebral cortex is most often described as a hexalaminar structure, there are cortical areas (primary motor cortex) and species (elephants, cetaceans, and hippopotami), where a cytoarchitecturally indistinct, or absent, layer 4 is noted. Thalamocortical projections from the core, or first order, thalamic system terminate primarily in layers 4/inner 3. We explored the termination sites of core thalamocortical projections in cortical areas and in species where there is no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 using the immunolocalization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2, a known marker of core thalamocortical axon terminals, in 31 mammal species spanning the eutherian radiation. Several variations from the canonical cortical column outline of layer 4 and core thalamocortical inputs were noted. In shrews/microchiropterans, layer 4 was present, but many core thalamocortical projections terminated in layer 1 in addition to layers 4 and inner 3. In primate primary visual cortex, the sublaminated layer 4 was associated with a specialized core thalamocortical projection pattern. In primate primary motor cortex, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was evident and the core thalamocortical projections terminated throughout layer 3. In the African elephant, cetaceans, and river hippopotamus, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was observed and core thalamocortical projections terminated primarily in inner layer 3 and less densely in outer layer 3. These findings are contextualized in terms of cortical processing, perception, and the evolutionary trajectory leading to an indistinct or absent cortical layer 4.
   Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the "core" thalamocortical projection to the neocortex in the African elephant. In the elephant and other mammals with unusual skin (such as pachydermatous skin), layer 4 is cytoarchitecturally indistinct, possibly absent, and the thalamocortical input terminates primarily on the neurons forming the inner sublamina of layer 3.

AB  - Stressed hepatocytes promote liver fibrosis through communications with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during chronic liver injury. However, intra-hepatocyte players that facilitate such cell-to-cell communications are largely undefined. It is previously reported that hepatocyte E4BP4 is potently induced by ER stress and hepatocyte deletion of E4bp4 protects mice from high-fat diet-induced liver steatosis. Here how hepatocyte E4bp4 deficiency impacts the activation of HSCs and the progression toward MASH-associated liver fibrosis is examined. Hepatic E4BP4 is increased in mouse models of NASH diet- or CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Hepatocyte-specific E4bp4 deletion protected mice against NASH diet-induced liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis without impacting liver steatosis. Hepatocyte E4BP4 overexpression activated HSCs in a medium transfer experiment, whereas hepatocyte E4bp4 depletion did the opposite. RNA-Seq analysis identified the pro-fibrogenic factor OPN as a critical target of E4BP4 within hepatocytes. Antibody neutralization or shRNA depletion of Opn abrogated hepatocyte E4BP4-induced HSC activation. E4BP4 interacted with and stabilized YAP, an established activator of OPN. Loss of hepatic Yap blocked OPN induction in the liver of Ad-E4bp4-injected mice. Hepatocyte E4BP4 induces OPN via YAP to activate HSCs and promote liver fibrosis during diet-induced MASH. Inhibition of the hepatocyte E4BP4-OPN pathway could offer a novel therapeutic avenue for treating MASLD/MASH.

AB  - Latent learning is a process that enables the brain to transform experiences into "cognitive maps,"a form of implicit memory, without requiring reinforced training. To investigate its neural mechanisms, we record from hippocampal neurons in mice during latent learning of spatial maps and observe that the high-dimensional neural state space gradually transforms into a low-dimensional manifold that closely resembles the physical environment. This transformation process is associated with the neural reactivation of navigational experiences during sleep. Additionally, we identify a subset of hippocampal neurons that, rather than forming place fields in a novel environment, maintain weak spatial tuning but gradually develop correlated activity with other neurons. The elevated correlation introduces redundancy into the ensemble code, transforming the neural state space into a low-dimensional manifold that effectively links discrete place fields of place cells into a map-like structure. These results suggest a potential mechanism for latent learning of spatial maps in the hippocampus.

AB  - There is little information on movement and foraging patterns of the Pilbara diamond-faced bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia), which is formally recognised as a major research priority for the species. An automated VHF radio telemetry system was used to track bat movement in the central Hamersley Ranges over 21 days during the dry season. Individuals were confirmed travelling an average of 4.88 km (+/- 6.96) from their roost each night and a cumulative average distance of 7.02 km (+/- 8.70). Notably, a female was recorded traveling similar to 40 km between two isolated ranges on two consecutive nights, demonstrating the long-range abilities of the species.

AB  - The digenetic trematode family Gorgocephalidae comprises just a few species, and the literature devoted to the lineage consists of only a handful of reports. With one exception, all reports have been based on material collected in the Indo-West Pacific, an expansive marine ecoregion stretching from the east coast of Africa to Easter Island, Hawaii and French Polynesia. We collected adult and intramolluscan gorgocephalids from kyphosid fishes and littorinid gastropods from several Australian localities, and from South Africa and French Polynesia. Specimens of Gorgocephalus kyphosi and G. yaaji were collected from, or near, their type-localities, providing new morphological and molecular (COI, ITS2 and 28S) data needed for a revised understanding of species boundaries in the family. Two new species are recognized: Gorgocephalus euryaleae sp. nov. and Gorgocephalus graboides sp. nov. New definitive host records are provided for described species and three new intermediate hosts are identified. These new records are all associated with Kyphosus fishes and littorinid gastropods, reaffirming the restriction of gorgocephalids to these hosts. Most significantly, we provide evidence that G. yaaji is distributed from South Africa to French Polynesia, spanning the breadth of the Indo-West Pacific. Our findings have significant relevance regarding digenean species delineation over geographic range.

AB  - A recent study investigated the impact of glutathione (GSH) on the transfer of zinc (Zn) from proteome to apo-carbonic anhydrase. Here, we probed the requirement of glutathione for zinc trafficking in LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial cells. Depletion of GSH by at least 95% left cells viable and able to divide and synthesize Zn-proteins at the control rate over a 48-h period. Loss of GSH stimulated the accumulation of 2.5x the normal concentration of cellular Zn. According to gel filtration chromatography, differential centrifugal filtration, and spectrofluorimetry with TSQ, the extra Zn was distributed between the proteome and metallothionein (MT). To test the functionality of proteome and/or MT as sources of Zn for the constitution of Zn-proteins, GSH-deficient cells were incubated with CaEDTA to isolate them from their normal source of nutrient Zn. Control cells plus CaEDTA stopped dividing; GSH-depleted cells plus CaEDTA continued to divide at similar to 40% the rate of GSH deficient cells. Evidently, proteome and/or MT served as a functional source of Zn for generating Zn-proteins. In vitro insertion of Zn bound to proteome into apo-carbonic anhydrase occurred faster at larger concentrations of Zn bound to proteome. These results support the hypothesis that enhanced transport of Zn into cells drives the conversion of apo-Zn-proteins to Zn-proteins by mass action. Similar results were also obtained with human Jurkat T lymphocyte epithelial cells. This study reveals a powerful new model for studying the chemistry of Zn trafficking, including transport processes, involvement of intermediate binding sites, and constitution of Zn-proteins.

AB  - Alkaloids and methoxypyrazines play a crucial role in the defence strategies of ladybirds against both arthropod and vertebrate predators. We investigated the response of the black garden ant (Lasius niger) to extracts from various ladybird species mixed with honey solution at decreasing concentrations. The tested ladybird species included Adalia bipunctata, Hippodamia undecimnotata, Coccinella septempunctata, Harmonia axyridis, Halyzia sedecimguttata, and Tytthaspis sedecimpunctata, with the lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus) serving as a control. The acceptance rate of the mixtures by ants decreased almost linearly with increasing concentrations of ladybird extract, while the acceptance of the control mealworm extract remained constant. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the degree of deterrence and the body size, conspicuousness of aposematic coloration, or feeding specialization of the tested ladybirds. The degree of deterrence exhibited significant statistical differences among the ladybird species, with the concentration required to deter 50% of ants ranging from 3 to 7% of crude extract in a 4% honey solution. However, these differences were small and variable, suggesting limited biological significance. The degree of deterrence of individual species of ladybirds to ants that we found should be compared with their deterrence to other predators.

AB  - Proprioception can be seen as a somatic sense stimulated by the action of the body itself. It is perceived through proprioceptors and is tightly linked to the animal body, as it is influenced by the biomechanical properties of the structures in which it is embedded. A specific class of these receptors, the muscle proprioceptors, project at several levels of the nervous system and provide information about limb position, whether in the presence or absence of movement, as well as muscle length, the sense of effort, and the sense of balance. In skeletal systems, proprioception is involved in postural maintenance, reflex actions, and rhythmic behaviors, but also in higher functions such as action planning and prediction. Proprioception can also be found in structures that are capable of movement without any real skeleton and are therefore called hydrostatic skeletons, both in humans and other animals. Hydrostatic bodies, including cephalopod limbs, the elephant trunk, and the human tongue, use muscle contractile forces to generate hydrostatic pressure, which acts as a skeleton to stabilize the structure and create motion. To provide online motion control of these bodies, the animal nervous system must cope with a huge amount of information coming from variables (such as length, angle, stiffness, and orientation) that continuously change throughout the entire structure. To limit this central burden, these structures may benefit from the presence of a muscle proprioceptive system used locally to control muscle contraction. Based on the current knowledge, many of the basic components of the proprioceptive system of soft-bodied and skeletal animals are essentially the same. Here, we aim to provide a forward-looking perspective on the role of muscle proprioception in motion, with a special focus on proprioception in muscular hydrostats. We wish to highlight the relevance of this topic across several fields of investigation, from human sensorimotor pathologies to soft robotics, where a high degree of autonomy in soft structures, combined with a reduced control demand, remains an unmet need. To address these gaps, we emphasize the need for improved knowledge and methodological assessment of this "sixth sense."

AB  - Hippopotamus pentlandi, although lacking a comprehensive description, is regarded as one of the best known dwarfed hippopotamid species within the Mediterranean region. This study provides a detailed analysis of a hippopotamus mandible from Amoroso Cave (Palermo, Sicily). Morphological and morphometric comparisons with insular and continental species reveal a significant similarity between the Amoroso mandible and some specimens from San Ciro Cave (Palermo, Sicily), as well as with Hippopotamus amphibius. Conversely, material from Cannita Cave (Palermo, Sicily) attributed to H. pentlandi is less robust, more elongated and smaller. 3D geometric morphometric analysis performed on the symphyseal sagittal cross-section further support a closer morphological affinity of the Amoroso mandible to San Ciro Cave specimens and H. amphibius, suggesting an attribution to the latter. Our research reveals the presence of at least two different, potentially coeval, taxa in the Pleistocene of Sicily: the dwarfed Hippopotamus pentlandi primarily known from Cannita Cave, and H. amphibius. While Cannita Cave material has been thoroughly studied over the years, abundant remains from other localities, e.g. San Ciro Cave, require re-evaluation. A thorough analysis of Sicilian hippopotamids is crucial to improve our understanding of their systematics and to provide new insights into the palaeobiogeography, palaeobiology, and palaeoenvironment of Sicily during the Pleistocene.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and distinct neuropathological features, including amyloid-(3 plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive astrogliosis. Developing effective diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies for AD necessitates the establishment of animal models that accurately recapitulate the pathophysiological processes of the disease. Existing transgenic mouse models have significantly contributed to understanding AD pathology but often fail to replicate the complexity of human AD. Additionally, these models are limited in their ability to elucidate the interplay among amyloid-(3 plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and reactive astrogliosis due to the absence of spatially and temporally specific genetic manipulation. In this study, we introduce a novel AD mouse model (APP/PS1-TauP301L-Adeno mice) designed to rapidly induce pathological symptoms and enhance understanding of AD mechanisms. Neurofibrillary tangles and severe reactive astrogliosis were induced by injecting AAVDJ-EF1a-hTauP301L-EGFP and Adeno-GFAP-GFP viruses into the hippocampi of 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Three months post-injection, these mice exhibited pronounced astrogliosis, substantial amyloid-(3 plaque accumulation, extensive neurofibrillary tangles, accelerated neuronal loss, elevated astrocytic GABA levels, and significant spatial memory deficits. Notably, these pathological features were less severe in AAVTauP301L-expressing APP/PS1 mice without augmented reactive astrogliosis. These findings indicate an exacerbating role of severe reactive astrogliosis in amyloid-(3 plaque and neurofibrillary tangle-associated pathology. The APP/PS1-TauP301L-Adeno mouse model provides a valuable tool for advancing therapeutic research aimed at mitigating the progression of AD.

KW  - HIPPOS
AB  - Using a 3D geometric morphometrics approach, we shed light on the major changes during the ontogenetic development of Hippopotamus amphibius. The main shift in the shape variability of cranial elements in juveniles can probably be related to the interruption of suckling. A less stressed shift in the cranial variability can probably be related to the attainment of sexual maturity. Semilandmarks and landmarks are powerful tools to discriminate between extant species and, therefore, this technique will be particularly useful in the future to study fossil ones as well.

AB  - Acoustic signalling is used by a range of taxa to convey information. Terrestrial marsupials are not considered particularly vocal, however acoustic signalling in this group may be important for predator avoidance and social cohesion. We defined the nocturnal acoustic repertoire of the burrowing bettong, a social macropod that shelters down warrens during the day, using micro audio-recorders on the radio-collars of 19 individuals. Alarm calls were emitted in response to external stimuli just prior to fleeing, whilst aggression and submission calls were generally recorded simultaneously in pairs of individuals, usually in food defence. Submission calls were often made whilst laying and defending with the hind feet. Contact calls were quieter and emitted when one individual slowly approached another. The isolation call was only observed in interactions between adult and juvenile. Bettong call rates were higher at night when bettongs were active (nearly 50/h) than during the day (< 6/h). Males emitted alarm calls more often than females, and smaller females produced higher rates of submission calls than larger females. This study provides a foundation for improved call elicitation analysis in bettongs which could assist with conservation management.

AB  - The Heteromyidae (pocket mice and kangaroo rats) are a group of extant small rodents abundant in western North America, as well as in fossil assemblages over the last 20 million years. Two genera of heteromyids, Chaetodipus and Perognathus, share similar tooth morphology and teeth are the primary fossil remains. Previous genetic studies show these extant sister genera likely diverged in the middle Miocene (similar to 16 million years ago); however, the Chaetodipus fossil record starts in the Pleistocene (similar to 2 million years ago). In this study, we asked whether two-dimensional geometric morphometrics on complete dentition and isolated premolars can accurately identify Chaetodipus and Perognathus specimens at the genus and species level. We landmarked the occlusal surface of the upper and lower tooth rows of modern Chaetodipus (n = 83) and Perognathus specimens (n = 80), including 12 of the 26 extant species across the two genera. We ran a canonical variates analysis to investigate whether principal component variation could predict known taxonomic identifications. The morphospace using complete dentition can identify specimens to genus with 90 - 92% accuracy and to species with more variable accuracy. We found an isolated premolar provides sufficient information for genus-level identification (69 - 84% accuracy), but not for species-level identification (26 - 56% accuracy). This morphospace of modern specimens can be used to identify the skeletal remains of Chaetodipus and Perognathus in museum collections, raptor pellets, or middens, to refine our existing knowledge of heteromyid evolutionary history.

AB  - Signals containing parameter trade-offs are likely to be honest indicators of signaler quality because they are difficult to produce. Signals with a trill-rate/bandwidth trade-off have been described for many songbird species, one mouse, and one non-human primate species. However, there were no reports about whether there is a vocal performance trade-off in social calls of bats. This study investigated (1) a possible vocal performance trade-off in territorial calls of male Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros armiger, recorded from 9 locations in south China, and (2) the relationships between vocal performance (vocal deviation and consistency) and caller's quality (body mass) to determine whether vocal performance honestly indicates a caller's quality. Vocal deviation measures the deviation of a call relative to an extreme call and vocal consistency measures the spectral consistency across a string of syllables. Our results showed a significant negative correlation between syllable repetition rate and frequency bandwidth, suggesting a vocal performance trade-off similar to the one in songbirds. Further, there was a significant negative relationship between body mass and vocal deviation, but no significant correlation between body mass and vocal consistency. This study provides the first empirical evidence for a vocal performance trade-off of social calls in bats, and the potential for the level of performance to indicate caller quality.

AB  - NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a key role in the development of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. However, strategies to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation remain elusive. Herein, we evaluated the impact of a walnut-derived peptide, TWLPLPR (TW-7), on cognitive impairment in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice and explored its underlying mechanisms in high glucose-induced HT-22 cells. In the Morris water maze test, TW-7 alleviated cognitive deficits in mice; this was confirmed at the level of synaptic structure and dendritic spine density in the mouse hippocampus using transmission electron microscopy and Golgi staining. TW-7 increased the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins and suppressed the NEK7/NLRP3 inflammatory pathway, as determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. The mechanism of action of TW-7 was verified in an HT-22 cell model of high glucose-induced insulin resistance. Collectively, TW-7 could regulate T2DM neuroinflammation and synaptic function-induced cognitive impairment by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and improving synaptic plasticity.
   NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a key role in the development of diabetes-induced cognitive impairment.

AB  - Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide critical for the mammalian stress response and social behavior. AVP produced in the hypothalamus regulates water osmolality and vasoconstriction in the body, and in the brain, it regulates social behavior, aggression, and anxiety. However, the circuit mechanisms that link AVP to social behavior, homeostatic function, and disease are not well understood. This study investigates the circuit configurations of AVP-expressing neurons in the rodent hypothalamus and characterizes synaptic input from the entire brain. We targeted the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) using retrograde viral tracing techniques to identify direct afferent synaptic connections made onto AVP-expressing neurons. AVP neurons in the PVN display region-specific anatomical configurations that reflect their unique contributions to homeostatic function, motor behaviors, feeding, and affiliative behavior. The afferent connections identified were similar in both sexes and subsequent molecular investigation of these inputs shows that those local hypothalamic inputs are overwhelmingly nonpeptidergic cells indicating a potential interneuron nexus between hormone cell activation and broader cortical connection. This proposed work reveals new insights into the organization of social behavior circuits in the brain, and how neuropeptides act centrally to modulate social behaviors.

AB  - Dinoceratans or uintatheres are a phylogenetically enigmatic clade of extinct mammalian herbivores that were among the first eutherians to obtain truly massive body size. Uintatheres were reasonably common elements of North American mammal faunas spanning from the late Paleocene (late Tiffanian, Ti-5) through the middle Eocene (Uintan). However, prior records of North American uintatheres have been geographically restricted to the central Rockies, Texas, and California. Here, we report the first occurrence of a uintathere from the Kishenehn Formation in northern Montana, similar to 750 km northwest of their previously known range. The Kishenehn uintathere is currently documented by a single upper molar bearing several characters that may indicate it pertains to a new taxon. Because various lineages of uintatheres are known to have inhabited North America and Asia, additional fossils from higher latitudes of North America could be essential in untangling their evolution, dispersal, and biogeographic history.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of depression disorder by activating microglia cells, increasing proinflammatory cytokines, effecting serotonin synthesis and metabolism, and neuronal apoptosis and neurogenesis. Arjunolic acid (ARG) is a triterpenoid derived from the fruits of Akebia trifoliata for treating psychiatric disorders in TCM clinic, which exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, its anti-depressive effect and underlying mechanism are unknown. Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to explore the effect of arjunolic acid on depression and its possible mechanisms. Methods: Intraperitoneal injection of LPS in mice and LPS stimulated-BV2 microglia were utilized to set up in vivo and in vitro models. Behavioral tests, H&E staining and ELISA were employed to evaluate the effect of arjunolic acid on depression. RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, molecular docking and Western blot were performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Results: Arjunolic acid dramatically ameliorated depressive behavior in LPS-induced mice. The levels of BDNF and 5-HT in the hippocampus of the mice were increased, while the number of iNOS + IBA1+ cells in the brain were decreased and Arg1+IBA1+ positive cells were increased after arjunolic acid treatment. In addition, arjunolic acid promoted the polarization of BV2 microglia from M1 to M2 type. Notably, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking technologies identified SIRT1 as the target of arjunolic acid. Moreover, after SIRT1 inhibition by using EX-527, the effects of arjunolic acid on ameliorating LPS-induced depressive behavior in mice and promoting M2 Microglia polarization were blocked. In addition, arjunolic acid activated AMPK and decreased Notch1 expression, however, inhibition of AMPK, the effect of arjunolic acid on the downregulation of Notch1 expression were weaken. Conclusions: This study elucidates that arjunolic acid suppressed neuroinflammation through modulating the SIRT1/AMPK/Notch1 signaling pathway. Our study demonstrates that arjunolic acid might serve as a potiential anti-depressant.

AB  - Background Foraging in group living animals such as social insects, is collectively performed by individuals. However, our understanding on foraging behavior of subterranean termites is extremely limited, as the process of foraging in the field is mostly concealed. Because of this limitation, foraging behaviors of subterranean termites were indirectly investigated in the laboratory through tunnel geometry analysis and observations on tunneling behaviors. In this study, we tracked subsets of foraging workers from juvenile colonies of Coptotermes formosanus (2-yr-old) to describe general foraging behavioral sequences and to find how foraging workers allocate time between the foraging site (food acquisition or processing) and non-foraging site (food transportation). Results Once workers entered into the foraging site, they spent, on average, a significantly longer time at the foraging site than the non-foraging site. Our clustering analysis revealed two different types of foraging workers in the subterranean termite based on the duration of time they spent at the foraging site and their foraging frequency. After entering the foraging site, some workers (cluster 1) immediately initiated masticating wood fragments, which they transferred as food boluses to recipient workers at the foraging site. Conversely, the recipient workers (cluster 2) moved around after entering the foraging site and received food from donating workers. Conclusions This study provides evidence of task specialization within foraging cohorts in subterranean termites.

AB  - Oviraptorosaurians were a theropod dinosaur group that reached high diversity in the Late Cretaceous. Within oviraptorosaurians, the later diverging oviraptorids evolved distinctive crania which were extensively pneumatised, short and tall, and had a robust toothless beak, interpreted as providing a powerful bite for their herbivorous to omnivorous diet. The present study explores the ability of oviraptorid crania to resist large mechanical stresses compared with other theropods and where this adaptation originated within oviraptorosaurians. Digital 3D cranial models were constructed for the earliest diverging oviraptorosaurian, Incisivosaurus gauthieri, and three oviraptorids, Citipati osmolskae, Conchoraptor gracilis, and Khaan mckennai. Finite element analyses indicate oviraptorosaurian crania were stronger than those of other herbivorous theropods (Erlikosaurus and Ornithomimus) and were more comparable to the large, carnivorous Allosaurus. The cranial biomechanics of Incisivosaurus align with oviraptorids, indicating an early establishment of distinctive strengthened cranial biomechanics in Oviraptorosauria, even before the highly modified oviraptorid cranial morphology. Bite modelling, using estimated muscle forces, suggests oviraptorid crania may have functioned closer to structural safety limits. Low mechanical stresses around the beaks of oviraptorids suggest a convergently evolved, functionally distinct rhamphotheca, serving as a cropping/feeding tool rather than for stress reduction, when compared with other herbivorous theropods.

AB  - The nuclear arthropod-specific large DNA viruses comprise different phylogenetically related virus families (Baculoviridae, Nudiviridae, Hytrosaviridae and Nimaviridae) forming the class Naldaviricetes. One common characteristic of their large double-stranded circularly and covalently closed DNA genomes is the size of up to hundreds of kilobase pairs, encoding up to hundreds of open reading frames. Until recently, analyzing such large viral dsDNA genomes was hampered by short read sequencing techniques, requiring bioinformatic assembly strategies to construct a consensus sequence as a descriptor of a population of haplotype sequences. The ideal aim for decoding large dsDNA genomes is an assembly-free method that allows the individual gnomes of a virus population to be sequenced in individual reads without fragmentation. Such full-length genome sequencing of single genome molecules is made possible by Nanopore sequencing, which is increasingly used to decode representatives of the Naldaviricetes. The present study discusses the impact of Nanopore sequencing on the characterization of viral NALDV populations. Full-length genome reads can be found in published sequence data from Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV; family Baculoviridae) and Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family Nudiviridae) isolates, providing insight into the future of deciphering populations of members of the order Lefavirales and class Naldaviricetes. Thirty years after the first sequencing of a baculovirus in 1994, a new era of sequencing of arthropod-infecting large dsDNA viruses has begun, which will allow assembly-free analysis of entire populations of large dsDNA viruses.

AB  - Bamboo nodes are an important component for increasing the hardness and stability of growth. However, little is known about how bamboo nodes affect resistance to biological control agents for industrial use. This study aims to analyze the durability differences between node and internode structures against subterranean termites. Two bamboo species, Giganthochloa scortechinii and Giganthochloa levis were investigated to determine their resistance against Coptotermes curvignathus in laboratory (no-choice and choice) and above-ground experiments. Samples measuring 25 mm x 25 mm x bamboo thickness and 100 mm x 40 mm x bamboo thickness were taken from the three portions (bottom, middle, and top) and each portion was subdivided into two parts: nodes and internodes. Moisture content is also determined for each portion and part. Overall, G. scortechinii is more resistant to C. curvignathus than G. levis, and the node section has greater resistance compared to the internode. The resistance of both bamboo species tested increases towards the top of the node and the internode. The weight loss decreases towards the top in all tests, while the nodes show less weight loss compared to the internodes. The visual determination value for G. scortechinii is 7.4 to 9.0 (choice) and 7.5 to 9.2 (no-choice), while 6.6 to 7.5 (choice) and 6.5 to 7.4 (no-choice) for G. levis. The high resistance of the nodes compared to the internodes is closely related to the anatomical structure of the individual parts and the position in the stem.

AB  - For some years now, fixation devices created with resorbable magnesium alloys for the mandibular head have been clinically available and are beginning to be used. It is thus valuable to evaluate the quality of unions in these cases. The aim of this study was radiological comparison of magnesium versus titanium open reduction and rigid fixations in the mandible condylar head. Thirty-one patients were treated for fractures of the mandibular head with magnesium WE43 alloy headless compression screws (diameter 2.3 mm) and, as a reference group, 29 patients were included with similar construction titanium screws (diameter 1.8 mm). The 12-month results of the treatment were evaluated by the texture analysis of CT. Near similar treatment results were found with magnesium screws in traditional titanium fixation. Magnesium screws result in a higher density of the bone structure in the mandibular head. Conclusions: The quantitative evaluation of bone union after surgical treatment of mandibular head fracture with magnesium compression headless screws indicates that stable consolidation was achieved. Undoubtedly, the resorption process of the screws was found to be incomplete after 12 months, evidenced by a marked densification of the bone structure at the fracture site.

AB  - Marecha camel has good potential for commercial camel farming and it could be the source for future food production especially in arid and semi-arid areas of Pakistan. Research work on production potential of Marecha camel is scanty. In the current study, 10 male Marecha calves (Camelus dromedarius) around 300 +/- 30 days of age were weaned at 9 months age and used in 90 days trial to study their growth rate. Calves were raised in two groups with 5 each under stall-fed conditions (intensive management system, IMS). They were offered roughage+concentrate at the ratio of 60:40. In 60 proportions the ratio between fodder (lucerne) and crop residues (gram crop residues) was 70:30. They were fed two isocaloric diets with different protein levels viz: one group with 18% CP and other group with 22% CP. Daily feeding allowance (@ 3% body weight) was calculated and adjusted according to fortnightly live weights. Water was provided twice a day. Daily weight gain was 953 +/- 50 and 996 +/- 40 g/d with 18% and 22% levels of protein ration, respectively while average DMI of concentrate, fodder and crop residues was 2.93 +/- 0.15, 3.00 +/- 0.16 and 1.31 +/- 0.08; 2.94 +/- 0.07, 3.03 +/- 0.07 and 1.31 +/- 0.03 kg/d, respectively with 18% and 22% levels of protein rations. These findings did not differ significantly (P>0.05). The calves gained 85.8 and 89.6 kg over 90 days with feed efficiency of 7.08 and 6.83 fed 18% and 22% levels of protein ration, respectively. The mean values of body condition scoring (BCS) and back fat layer measurement (BFLM) in five male camel calves of different weights, fed 18% and 22% CP ration were 4.4 +/- 0.9, 4.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.6 +/- 0.5, 4.9 +/- 0.3, respectively. The results indicated that weaning was more economical and resulted in savings of PKR 16,137 and 15,213 in calve groups fed with 18% and 22% levels of protein, respectively.

AB  - Action potentials (APs) in neurons are generated at the axon initial segment (AIS). AP dynamics, including initiation and propagation, are intimately associated with neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release kinetics. Most learning and memory studies at the single-neuron level have relied on the use of animal models, most notably rodents. Here, we studied AP initiation and propagation in cultured hippocampal neurons from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and C57BL/6 (C57) mice with genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI)-based voltage imaging. Our data showed that APs traveled bidirectionally in neurons from both species; forward-propagating APs (fpAPs) had a different speed than backpropagating APs (bpAPs). Additionally, we observed distinct AP propagation characteristics in AISs emerging from the somatic envelope compared to those originating from dendrites. Compared with rat neurons, mouse neurons exhibited higher bpAP speed and lower fpAP speed, more distally located ankyrin G (AnkG) in AISs, and longer Nav1.2 lengths in AISs. Moreover, during AIS plasticity, AnkG and Nav1.2 showed distal shifts in location and shorter lengths of labeled AISs in rat neurons; in mouse neurons, however, they showed a longer AnkG-labeled length and more distal Nav1.2 location. Our findings suggest that hippocampal neurons in SD rats and C57 mice may have different AP propagation speeds, different AnkG and Nav1.2 patterns in the AIS, and different AIS plasticity properties, indicating that comparisons between these species must be carefully considered.

AB  - One of the current threats to the bonobo (Pan paniscus), a highly endangered ape species only found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are anthropozoonoses caused by human respiratory viruses. To date, epidemiological information regarding respiratory viral infections in bonobos is limited. In this study, we examined fecal immunoglobulin A antibodies against human respiratory viruses in bonobos, which may help estimating the viral prevalence. A substantial proportion of bonobos were positive for the antiviral antibodies, including those against parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, and mumps virus. The prevalence of the antibodies was found to depend on the viral species and bonobo populations, suggesting that the bonobos had been exposed to these respiratory viruses. These results may indicate the need for an epidemiological evidence-based action plan for the protection of bonobos from anthropozoonoses.

AB  - Angiotensin IV (Ang IV), a metabolite of Angiotensin II, is a bioactive hexapeptide that inhibits the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). This transmembrane zinc metallopeptidase with many biological functions has in recent years emerged as a new pharmacological target. IRAP is expressed in a variety of tissues and can be found in high density in the hippocampus and neocortex, brain regions associated with cognition. Ang IV is known to improve memory tasks in experimental animals. One of the most potent IRAP inhibitors known today is the macrocyclic compound HA08 that is significantly more stable than the endogenous Ang IV. HA08 combines structural elements from Ang IV and the physiological substrates oxytocin and vasopressin, and binds to the catalytic site of IRAP. In the present study we evaluate whether HA08 can restore cell viability in rat primary cells submitted to hydrogen peroxide damage. After damaging the cells with hydrogen peroxide and subsequently treating them with HA08, the conceivable restoring effects of the IRAP inhibitor were assessed. The cellular viability was determined by measuring mitochondrial activity and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The mitochondrial activity was significantly higher in primary hippocampal cells, whereas the amount of LDH was unaffected. We conclude that the cell viability can be restored in this cell type by blocking IRAP with the potent macrocyclic inhibitor HA08, although the mechanism by which HA08 exerts its effects remains unclear.

AB  - Deficits in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway facilitate intracellular microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) accumulation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Aerobic exercise (AE) has been recommended as a way to delay and treat AD, but the exact effects and mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that AE (8-week treadmill running, 40 min/day, 5 days/week) alleviated autophagy-lysosomal defects and MAPT pathology through the activation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors (beta 2-AR) in MAPT P301L mice. Molecular mechanistic investigations revealed that endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) III subunit charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B), which is essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, was significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of AD patients and the hippocampus of MAPT P301L mice. AE restored the levels of CHMP4B, which reversed autophagy-lysosomal defects and reduced MAPT aggregation. Inhibition of beta 2-AR by propranolol (30 mg/kg, intragastric administration 1 h before each AE session) restrained AE-attenuated MAPT accumulation by inhibiting autophagy-lysosomal flux in MAPT P301L mice. Our findings suggest that AE can alleviate autophagosome-lysosome fusion deficits by promoting the beta 2-AR-RXR alpha-CHMP4B-ESCRT-III pathway, reducing pathological MAPT aggregation, which also reveals a novel theoretical basis for AE attenuating AD progression.

AB  - Chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), a chromium-fog depressant widely utilized as an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate, can transfer from mother to fetus. Recent research has demonstrated that prenatal exposure to F-53B results in synaptic damage in weaning mice. However, the mechanism underpinning F-53B-triggered synaptic damage during fetal development remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway, a crucial signaling mechanism known as "synaptic switch", in the early neurotoxicity of F-53B exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Here, C57BL/6 fetal mice were subjected to exposure to F-53B (0, 4, and 40 mu g/L) from gestation days (GD) 0 to 14 to evaluate nerve injury prior to delivery. HT22 neurons exposed to F-53B (0, 0.016, 0.08, 0.4, 2, and 10 mu mol/L) for 24 h were utilized to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that F-53B significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of Nestin (a neural stem cell marker) in the fetal brain hippocampus (GD14). Subsequently, we found that F-53B downregulated the expression of synaptic plasticity markers (SYP, GAP43, and BDNF) in the fetal brain and HT22 neurons. Further molecular docking analysis revealed that F-53B fits into the ligand-binding pockets of PKA and CREB1. Results showed that F-53B inhibited the translocation of PKA protein from the cytoplasm to the neuronal nuclei and reduced the levels of PKA, CREB1, p-PKA(alpha/beta/gamma)-Thr197, and p-CREB1-S133 in the nucleus. Furthermore, the expression of synaptic plasticity markers altered by F-53B could be reversed by a PKA agonist and was intensified by a PKA antagonist. In summary, our findings suggest that intrauterine exposure to F-53B can weaken the expression of synaptic plasticity markers in the fetal brain, with this neurotoxicity being mediated by the cytoplasmic retention of PKA.

AB  - The camel-spider Galeodes graecus C. L. Koch, 1842, is poorly known and still insufficiently studied in taxonomic, faunistic and ecological aspects. This study represents 59 new records of this species from Bulgaria (57) and North Macedonia (2). The taxonomic characters distinguishing this species from its most similar congeners are discussed and illustrated by digital photographs and drawings. On the basis of 41 observations, the species is active between 4th June and 31th August and mainly between 20:30 h and 1:00 h. A critical review of the geographical distribution of G. graecus is presented. The confirmed geographical distribution of the species includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece (incliding islands), North Macedonia and Turkey. The previously published records from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Italy, Israel, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Tunisia are considered doubtful.

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for economic decision-making. However, how PFC value representations facilitate flexible decisions remains unknown. We reframe economic decision-making as a navigation process through a cognitive map of choice values. We found rhesus macaques represented choices as navigation trajectories in a value space using a grid-like code. This occurred in ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) local field potential theta frequency across two datasets. vmPFC neurons deployed the same grid-like code and encoded chosen value. However, both signals depended on theta phase: occurring on theta troughs but on separate theta cycles. Finally, we found sharp-wave ripples-a key signature of planning and flexible behavior-in vmPFC. Thus, vmPFC utilizes cognitive map-based computations to organize and compare values, suggesting an alternative architecture for economic choice in PFC.

AB  - Echolocating bats emit echolocation calls from the mouth or nose. Bats that emit calls from the nose have oddly developed dome-shaped nasal bones, but variations in the morphology of these bones are poorly understood. This study compared trends in the morphological variations of the cranium focusing on smooth structure such as the nasal swellings and the braincase, and investigated the morphological variability correlated with ultrasound vocalizations. We newly constructed three-dimensional (3-D) skull mesh models of the two Japanese rhinolophid species Rhinolophus nippon and Rhinolophus cornutus from the Korean Peninsula, the Japanese Archipelago, and Jeju Island, and compared the variations in cranium size and shape using 3-D geometric morphometrics. Additionally, we also tested trends in two representative body size indices, forearm length and centroid size. The results indicate that forearm length and log-transformed centroid size represented different trends among local populations. The results of 3-D geometric morphometrics show a significant difference in cranium shape between the two species, and between the Jeju Island population and the Japanese mainland population of R. nippon, indicating variability in the pair of nasal swellings related to nasophonation of the echolocation call. The anterior median swelling varied within the R. nippon populations, and the posterior median swelling varied between R. nippon and R. cornutus. These findings suggest that the variability between the anterior median swelling creates different echolocation peak frequencies in local populations, and that the posterior median swellings are quite similar among local populations because of the strong functional constraint of diet and echolocation.

AB  - Two new species of cestodes were described from the Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii (Muller and Henle) (Rhinopristiformes: Rhinobatidae), from coastal waters off Argentina in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Rhinebothrium quequense n. sp. (Rhinebothriidea) differs from its congeners by a combination of morphological characters, including the total number of loculi, the absence of loculi at the level of bothridial constriction, the number of testes per proglottid, and the number of proglottids per worm. Caulobothrium pieroi n. sp. ("Tetraphyllidea") can be distinguished from the other members of the genus by the following set of morphological features including the presence of stalked bothridia with apical sucker, the number of loculi per bothridium, the number of testes per proglottid, and the number of proglottids per worm. The discovery of R. quequense n. sp. and C. pieroi n. sp. in the Brazilian guitarfish not only increases the number of rhinebothriideans and "tetraphyllideans" in the southwestern Atlantic, but also expands the elasmobranchs list to include P. horkelii for the first time as a new host record for cestodes globally. In addition, this is not only the first report of a species of Rhinebothrium in rhinobatids in the region, but it is also the first Caulobothrium species infecting a rhinopristiform batoid.

AB  - The chiropteran collection that has been recovered from the two chronologically different fossiliferous assemblages of the Loutra Almopias Cave A (Pella, Macedonia, Greece) is studied. The specimens retrieved from the cave's floor sediments (LAC) are of the Late Pleistocene, whereas the specimens retrieved from the elevated chamber LAC Ia are of latest Pleistocene age. The first comprehensive systematic taxonomy and biogeographic analysis of a fossil chiropteran fauna from the Greek region was accomplished, based on the determination of the 9,004 chiropteran specimens. This resulted in the identification of 17 species from LAC and 20 from LAC Ia from three families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Miniopteridae) and nine genera (Rhinolophus, Myotis, Nyctalus, Pipistrellus, Vespertilio, Eptesicus, Plecotus, Barbastella, Miniopterus). Seven bat species described from the Loutra Almopias Cave A are the first known records in Greece and one species is the first Late Pleistocene record from the Balkan Peninsula. Eighteen species refer to the southernmost appearance of the Late Pleistocene of the Balkan Peninsula. Loutra Almopias Cave A served primarily as a nursery roost for many bats, and secondarily as a warm refuge during colder periods. Almost all of the chiropteran species described in this paper are now permanently resident in the region adjacent to the cave. Almost all bat species found in the Loutra Almopias Cave A are also present in the records of several localities from the Balkan Peninsula as Similarity analysis between the chiropteran faunas is indicative of an equivalent distribution in the region during the Late Pleistocene. In conclusion, the Late Pleistocene bat fauna from the Loutra Almopias Cave A is, up to date, the richest and most diverse not only from the Greek region, but also from the Balkan Peninsula.

AB  - Neurons in sensory cortex exhibit a remarkable capacity to maintain stable firing rates despite large fluctuations in afferent activity levels. However, sudden peripheral deafferentation in adulthood can trigger an excessive, non-homeostatic cortical compensatory response that may underlie perceptual disorders including sensory hypersensitivity, phantom limb pain, and tinnitus. Here, we show that mice with noise-induced damage of the high-frequency cochlear base were behaviorally hypersensitive to spared mid-frequency tones and to direct optogenetic stimulation of auditory thalamocortical neurons. Chronic two-photon calcium imaging from ACtx pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) revealed an initial stage of spatially diffuse hyperactivity, hyper-correlation, and auditory hyperresponsivity that consolidated around deafferented map regions three or more days after acoustic trauma. Deafferented PyrN ensembles also displayed hypersensitive decoding of spared mid-frequency tones that mirrored behavioral hypersensitivity, suggesting that non-homeostatic regulation of cortical sound intensity coding following sensorineural loss may be an underlying source of auditory hypersensitivity. Excess cortical response gain after acoustic trauma was expressed heterogeneously among individual PyrNs, yet 40% of this variability could be accounted for by each cell's baseline response properties prior to acoustic trauma. PyrNs with initially high spontaneous activity and gradual monotonic intensity growth functions were more likely to exhibit non-homeostatic excess gain after acoustic trauma. This suggests that while cortical gain changes are triggered by reduced bottom-up afferent input, their subsequent stabilization is also shaped by their local circuit milieu, where indicators of reduced inhibition can presage pathological hyperactivity following sensorineural hearing loss.

AB  - We used light-sensitive drugs to identify the brain region-specific role of mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in the control of pain. Optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, normally inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices and thalamus inhibited neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Systemic treatment of alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, and the effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. This demonstrates that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus is both sufficient and necessary for the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, when the light was delivered in the basolateral amygdala, local activation of systemic JF-NP-26 reduced pain thresholds, whereas inactivation of alloswitch-1 enhanced analgesia. Electrophysiological analysis showed that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of presumed BLA input, and decreased BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons. Both effects were reversed by optical silencing and reinstated by optical reactivation of alloswitch-1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the action of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis is not homogenous, and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the BLA may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. This could explain the suboptimal effect of mGlu5 NAMs on pain in human studies and validate photopharmacology as an important tool to determine ideal target sites for systemic drugs.

AB  - Mimic species vary widely in how faithfully they resemble their models. On coral reefs, several species of the family Blenniidae mimic the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus (Labridae), which removes ectoparasites from other fishes, enabling the mimics to approach and bite parts of fish bodies undetected. The false cleanerfish, Aspidontus taeniatus, and bluestriped fangblenny, Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos, are well-known blennies that feed on fins, scales, and mucus of other fishes while exhibiting aggressive mimicry of the cleaner wrasse. The former (a perfect mimic) exhibits elaborate mimetic features throughout its life history, whereas the latter (an imperfect mimic) shows mimetic traits only facultatively. We conducted three-dimensional (3D) video recordings of their predatory foraging behaviors in the wild using an underwater stereo video system. Our study focused on three blenniid species, including the piano fangblenny, P. tapeinosoma, a non-mimic blenny with similar feeding habits. Our results showed that the false cleanerfish (perfect mimic) employed a "sneaky" tactic, slowly approaching small target fish and biting their caudal fins from a short distance. By contrast, the piano fangblenny (non-mimic) employed a "hit-and-run" tactic, approaching swiftly from a long distance and ripping off scales or mucus directed at the lateral body of large target fish. The bluestriped fangblenny, which exhibits lower mimetic fidelity (imperfect mimic), employed an intermediate tactic, approaching from a moderate distance between that of a perfect mimic and a non-mimic and ripping off scales or mucus of medium-sized fish. These findings suggest that differences in predatory tactics may have corresponded to the evolution of mimetic fidelity in aggressive mimic blennies.

AB  - Morphological analyses are critical to quantify phenotypic variation, identify taxa, inform phylogenetic relationships, and shed light on evolutionary patterns. This work is particularly important in groups that display great morphological disparity. Such is the case in geomyoid rodents, a group that includes 2 of the most species-rich families of rodents in North America: the Geomyidae (pocket gophers) and the Heteromyidae (kangaroo rats, pocket mice, and their relatives). We assessed variation in skull morphology (including both shape and size) among geomyoids to test the hypothesis that there are statistically significant differences in skull measurements at the family, genus, and species levels. Our sample includes 886 specimens representing all geomyoid genera and 39 species. We used the geometric mean to compare size across taxa. We used 14 measurements of the cranium and lower jaw normalized for size to compare shape among and within taxa. Our results show that skull measurements enable the distinction of geomyoids at the family, genus, and species levels. There is a larger amount of size variation within Geomyidae than within Heteromyidae. Our phylomorphospace analysis shows that the skull shape of the common ancestor of all geomyoids was more similar to the common ancestor of heteromyids than that of geomyids. Geomyid skulls display negative allometry whereas heteromyid skulls display positive allometry. Within heteromyids, dipodomyines, and non-dipodomyines show significantly different allometric patterns. Future analyses including fossils will be necessary to test our evolutionary hypotheses.

AB  - Background: Although liver fibrosis is a key pathologic process in many liver diseases, therapeutic approaches for inhibiting liver fibrosis are still very limited. N-Acetyl-L-tryptophan (L-NAT) has a hepatoprotective effect via inhibiting the destruction of liver cells, enhancing cell viability and reducing the inflammation. However, the effect of L-NAT on liver fibrosis is not determined.
   Purpose: The present study investigated the effect of L-NAT on liver fibrosis and explored it potential molecular mechanism.
   Methods: To address this concern, this study was carried out via fibrotic mice model induced by CCl(4 )and many approaches such as various histological staining methods, western blot assay, etc.
   Result: L-NAT decreased the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in fibrotic mice model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histological staining showed that L-NAT ameliorated liver injury and fibrosis, and reduced the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and Collagen I protein. L-NAT also attenuated apoptosis by down-regulating the level of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and up-regulating that of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreover, L-NAT inhibited the expressions of TGF-beta 1/SMAD and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) proteins, and reversed the expression of YAP1 protein in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis.
   Conclusion: These results clearly demonstrated that L-NAT attenuated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in mice, and this protective mechanism might relate to TGF-beta 1/SMAD and Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway. Thus, this study provided data basis for the prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis.

AB  - The large production volume combined with the high lignocellulose content makes elephant dung an attractive and underutilized biomass resource, but also presents waste management problems for elephant orphanages. This study explored the conversion of elephant dung into biochars by slow pyrolysis at 500 degrees C for the recovery of phosphate. The unmodified biochar (BC500) had a specific surface area (S-BET) of 62.5 m(2).g(-1) with point of zem charge (pH(PZC)) of 7.7. Biochar modification with MgCl2 (MgBC500) and FeCl3 (FeBC500) by pre-pyrolysis treatment affected the S-BET (48.7 m(2).g(-1) and 259.4 m(2).g(-1), respectively) and pH(PZC) (8.7 and 3.3, respectively). In FeBC500, Fe was present as magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Instead of adsorption, both BC500 and Mg BC 500 released phosphate at pH 3-6. Phosphate adsorption onto FeBC500 reached equilibrium within 24 h and followed pseudo-second order kinetics. The adsorption isotherm was best described with the Langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption capacity of 0.744 mg-P.g(-1). The phosphate adsorption behavior was related to the pH(PZC) and metal content of the biochar. Conversion of elephant dung into biochar presents an environmentally friendly waste management solution that may find further applications in the adsorption of other nutrients or pollutants.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a clinical event associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of I/R-induced brain injury and cognitive decline. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) can exert strong neuroprotection in experimental intracerebral hemorrhage. However, whether LRP1 can confer neuroprotective effects after cerebral I/R is yet to be elucidated. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of LRP1 activation on cerebral I/R injury and deducing the underlying mechanism involving TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway. Cerebral I/R injury was induced in mice by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. LPR1 ligand, apoE-mimic peptide COG1410, was administered intraperitoneally. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, overexpression of TXNIP was achieved via the hippocampal injection of AAV-TXNIP before COG1410 treatment. Neurobehavioral tests, brain water content, immunofluorescence, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, HE, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining were performed. Our results showed that the expressions of endogenous LRP1, TXNIP, NLRP3, procaspase-1, and cleaved caspase-1 were increased after cerebral I/R. COG1410 significantly ameliorated cerebral I/R-induced neurobehavioral deficits, brain edema, histopathological damage, and poor survival rate. Interestingly, COG1410 inhibited microglia proinflammatory polarization and promoted anti-inflammatory polarization, decreased oxidative stress, attenuated apoptosis, and inhibited the expression of the TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway. However, the benefits of COG1410 were abolished by TXNIP overexpression. Thus, our study suggested that LRP1 activation with COG1410 attenuated cerebral I/R injury at least partially related to modulating microglial polarization through TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling pathway in mice. Thus, COG1410 treatment might serve as a promising therapeutic approach in the management of cerebral I/R patients.

AB  - Thermally robust, narrow-band green phosphors are vital for advancing white light emitting diodes (w-LEDs). In this study, we examined Sr2ZnGe2O7:x% Mn2+ (SZGO:x% Mn2+) phosphors, with Mn2+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 mol %, synthesized via a solution combustion method using Camellia sinensis (C.S.) extract as the fuel. Upon monitoring the 539 nm emission, the excitation spectrum of the SZGO:4 %Mn2+ phosphors revealed two distinct ultraviolet (UV) excitation bands. When exposed to UV light, the phosphor produces a brilliant green emission at 539 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic Mn2+ transition (4T1 -> 6A1). Moreover, the SZGO:4% Mn2+ phosphor achieved an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 86.57 % and maintained a thermal stability of 90.73 % at 420 K. Thermometric analysis reveals that SZGO:4% Mn2+ phosphors achieve a maximum relative sensitivity (Sr) of 0.2112 % K-1 at 300 K. Ultimately, a high-performance w-LED is assembled by coating commercial blue and red phosphors with the SZGO:4% Mn2+ phosphors on a 310 nm UV chip, yielding a correlated colour temperature (CCT) of 5391 K and an impressive colour rendering index (CRI) Ra of 93.7. In addition, the aging, thermal and continuous operation tests are conducted on w-LEDs to evaluate the stability of the devices. The results show that the phosphor can improve the operational stability of w-LEDs. These findings underscore the potential of SZGO:Mn2+ as an effective green component in w-LED lighting applications. Additionally, the outstanding luminescence properties of SZGO:4% Mn2+ phosphors are further leveraged for anti-counterfeiting (AC) purposes, enabling multi-level security features under UV-254 nm excitation. Its high-contrast fluorescence response also facilitated precise latent fingerprints (LFPs) detection and classification using You Only Look Once, version 8-Extra Large model (YOLOv8x), demonstrating significant promise for automated forensic analysis and secure authentication systems.

AB  - A total of 357 Syngnathidae fishes (Syngnathus abaster Risso, 1827, S. typhle Linnaeus, 1758 and Hippocampus hippocampus (Linnaeus, 1758) caught in different habitats along Crimean Black Sea shelf were examined for presence of endohelminths and revealed to be hosts of 15 helminth species. The fishes are second intermediate hosts for five "birds'" digenean species and nematodes (larvae of three species and immature adults of one more species) completing life-cycles in waterbirds and fish; for two acanthocephalans and three cestodes larvae ending development in fish. We suggest, basing on data on feeding of the Black Sea predatory fish and waterbirds, that Syngnathid fishes are paratenic hosts in parasitic systems of most cestodes, nematodes and acanthocephalans. All the trematodes found are generalists at metacercarial stage; specialists Timoniella imbutiformis and Aphallus tubarium use Syngnathidae as definitive hosts. Cestodes, nematodes as well as acanthocephalans found are generalists, too. Based on infection indices, S. typhle are main final host and H. hippocampus are main 2nd intermediate hosts for T. imbutiformis; Syngnathids are accidental hosts for other trematodes as well as for all the cestodes, nematodes and acanthocephalans. Cryptocotyle concava and Pygidiopsis genata are important as Syngnathid fishes' threats, especially in marine protected aquatoria, being potential agents of "black spot disease".

AB  - In 2017-2020, 3833 birds representing 103 species were captured at two localities in the Lazovsky State Nature Reserve, Primorye Territory, Russian Far East. All birds were ringed and released on site. The research team recorded the presence of louse f lies in 646 birds representing 62 species (51 nestlings, 11 migrants), while 41 species from two orders, Charadriiformes and Apodiformes, were found to be uninfested. A total of 1184 specimens of louse flies from two subfamilies, Ornithomyinae (3 genera, 6 species) and Lipopteninae (1 genus, 2 species), were revealed. Forty-seven species of birds were recorded to be infested by Ornithoica momiyamai Kishida 1932, most of these serving as hosts new to this louse fly. Forty-two bird species were infested by Ornithomya avicularia (L. 1758) s. l., 11 bird species were found hosts to O. fringillina (Curtis 1856). Ornithoica unicolor Speiser 1900 was revealed on 11 bird species, being the most abundant on the Ural owl (Strix uralensis). Ornithomya comosa (Austen 1930) and Crataerina hirundinis (Curtis 1856) were found on Hirundinidae birds and Parus palustris. Lipoptena cervi (Linnaeus 1758) and L. fortisetosa Maa 1965 were recorded as uncommon bird parasites, as both species were only found on six bird species.

AB  - Species of the digenean genus Enenterum Linton, 1910 (Lepocreadioidea: Enenteridae) are characterised primarily by their elaborate oral suckers, which are divided into varying numbers of anteriorly directed lobes, and their host-restriction to herbivorous marine fishes of the family Kyphosidae. We describe Enenterum petrae n. sp. from the brassy chub Kyphosus vaigiensis (Quoy & Gaimard) collected off Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Enenterum petrae n. sp. is readily differentiated from congeners by its unique oral sucker morphology, in having a minute pharynx, and the combination of a genital cap and accessory sucker. We also provide the first record of Enenterum kyphosi Yamaguti, 1970 from Australia based on material obtained from the blue sea chub Kyphosus cinerascens (Forssk??l) collected off Lizard Island and North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. Morphologically, our specimens of E. kyphosi agree closely with descriptions of this species from Hawaii and South Africa, and despite lack of molecular data from outside of Australian waters, we consider all three reports to represent a single, widespread species. The first ITS2 and COI mtDNA gene sequences for species of Enenterum are provided and molecular phylogenetic analyses of 28S rDNA gene sequences place these species in a strongly-supported clade with the type-species of the genus, Enenterum aureum Linton, 1910. The oral suckers of both E. kyphosi and E. petrae n. sp. can be interpreted as having varying numbers of lobes depending on the particular specimen and how the division between lobes is defined. Scanning electron microscopical images improves understanding of the morphology of the enenterid oral sucker, and permits speculation regarding the evolutionary history leading to its specialisation in this lineage.

AB  - Individual identification is a basic requirement for research in behavior, ecology and conservation. Photographic records are commonly used in situations where individuals are visually distinct. However, keeping track of identities becomes challenging with increasing population sizes and corresponding datasets. There is growing interest in the potential of deep-learning methods for computer vision to assist with automating this task. Here we apply Convolutional Neural Networks, a popular architecture for Artificial Neural Networks used in image classification, to the problem of identifying individual Asian elephants through photographs. We evaluate the performance of five different types of CNN models used in facial recognition (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, and Alexnet), on datasets representing three different feature regions (the full body, face, and ears), trained with two techniques (transfer learning vs. training from scratch) for n = 56 elephants. We tested accuracy in matching the top candidate as well as top five candidates. We found that VGG16 trained with the transfer-learning technique outperformed other models on the body and face datasets with accuracies of 21.34% and 42.35%, respectively, in matching the top candidate. Nevertheless, the best performance was achieved by an Xception model trained from the scratch on the ear dataset, with an accuracy of 89.02% for matching the top candidate and 99.27% for including the correct individual among the top five. However, this impressive level of accuracy was obtained with a dataset of 3816 labeled training images of 56 elephants. There are more than 1000 wild elephants in the population under observation, requiring extensive human effort and skill to initially annotate the images used as training data. Therefore, we consider this approach impractical for monitoring large wild populations. Nevertheless this it could be very useful in record keeping and fraud prevention for large captive elephant populations, as well as monitoring animals that have been rehabilitated and released or moved for management purposes.

AB  - Different categories of social calls may be used in a variety of behavioral contexts and may have different functions. Here, we show that Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats emit two types of calls: bent upward frequency modulated (bUFM) calls emitted during agonistic interactions between two bats that have perched close to each other and stepped upward frequency modulated (sUFM) calls emitted by a roosting individual when a free-flying bat approached. There were significant differences in acoustic parameters between bUFM calls and sUFM calls. Moreover, we tested different choices of Hipposideros armiger to playback of bUFM calls and sUFM calls. The bats avoided the location of bUFM call playbacks independent of the simultaneous playback of echolocation pulses, silence, or sUFM calls. The bats also avoided approaching the side of the flight room where sUFM calls were broadcast when also presented with playbacks of echolocation pulses, but not when simultaneously presented with silence. The results suggest that bUFM calls may serve the function of territorial defense, while sUFM calls may convey warning information. Our results, therefore, imply that the two types of calls have different functions depending on behavioral context. These differences in function suggest that bats can detect context-dependent modifications of acoustic cues across the two types of social calls.

AB  - During a recent inventory survey of the nematofauna of tea plantation at Zhejiang Province, China, Discocriconemella parasinensis n. sp. was detected in the rhizosphere of Camellia sinensis. The new species can be characterized by having the uninterrupted rounded labial disc, en face view showing rectangular-rounded labial plate without submedian lobes, R = 82.6 (80-86), Rex = 22 (21-23), stylet length of 68.3 (59-76) mu m, excretory pore located 1-2 annuli posterior to the esophageal bulb, vulva open, postvulval body elongated conoid, and tail conoid with bilobed terminus. Morphologically, the species shares the same lip-type with D. discolabia, D. mauritiensis, D. mineira, D. perseae, and D. sinensis. Phylogenetic relationships of the new species based on D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S, ITS, and 18S rRNA genes revealed that D. parasinensis n. sp. formed a separated Glade from other criconematid species, thereby supporting its status as a new species of the genus. The new species showed close phylogenetic relationships with Criconemoides geraerti.

AB  - Islands often comprise unique faunal assemblages, particularly when they lie at the boundaries of different bioregions or host endemic taxa. Bats are among the few mammals that can regularly be found on islands around the world, yet knowledge on insular bat assemblages is often poor and anecdotal. Here we integrate different approaches to assess the bat assemblage composition on the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria. We found that at least six species occur on the island, including two typically African taxa, thus doubling the numbers known from previous studies. We provide insights into the distribution, biogeography and conservation planning of these bat species, highlighting the importance of studying and conserving insular bat populations.

AB  - The formation, stabilization, and elimination of synapses are tightly regulated during neural development and into adulthood. Pumilio RNA-binding proteins regulate the translation and localization of many synaptic mRNAs and are developmentally downregulated in the brain. We found that simultaneous downregulation of Pumilio 1 and 2 increases both excitatory and inhibitory synapse density in primary hippocampal neurons and promotes synapse maturation. Loss of Pum1 and Pum2 in the mouse brain was associated with an increase in mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic translation. These findings reveal a role for developmental Pumilio downregulation as a permissive step in the maturation of synapses and suggest that modulation of Pumilio levels is a cell-intrinsic mechanism by which neurons tune their capacity for synapse stabilization.

AB  - Insufficient supply of cardiac grafts represents a severe obstacle in heart transplantation. Donation after circulatory death (DCD), in addition to conventional donation after brain death, is one promising option to overcome the organ shortage. However, DCD organs undergo an inevitably longer period of unprotected warm ischemia between circulatory arrest and graft procurement. In this scenario, we aim to improve heart preservation after a warm ischemic period of 20 min by testing different settings of myocardial protective strategies. Pig hearts were collected from a slaughterhouse and assigned to one of the five experimental groups: baseline (BL), cold cardioplegia (CC), cold cardioplegia + adenosine (CC-ADN), normothermic cardioplegia (NtC + CC) or normothermic cardioplegia + cold cardioplegia + adenosine (NtC-ADN + CC). After treatment, tissue biopsies were taken to assess mitochondrial morphology, antioxidant enzyme activity, lipid peroxidation and cytokine and chemokine expressions. NtC + CC treatment significantly prevented mitochondria swelling and mitochondrial cristae loss. Moreover, the antioxidant enzyme activity was lower in this group, as was lipid peroxidation, and the pro-inflammatory chemokine GM-CSF was diminished. Finally, we demonstrated that normothermic cardioplegia preserved mitochondria morphology, thus preventing oxidative stress and the subsequent inflammatory response. Therefore, normothermic cardioplegia is a better approach to preserve the heart after a warm ischemia period, with respect to cold cardioplegia, before transplantation.

AB  - Objective This study was to assess the specific impacts and mechanism of lncRNA GHET1 in the development of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods The lncRNA GHET1 expression in TNBC tissues and adjacent healthy tissues was detected by qRT-PCR, and its expression was then measured at the cellular level, including TNBC cells and human normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. On the completion of transfection of negative shRNA or lncRNA GHET1 shRNA, the TNBC cells, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468, were then cultured in a normoxia or hypoxia environment, respectively. 5-Ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were applicable to the determination of cell proliferation, cell viability, and invasion in each group, respectively. Reagent kits were used for testing glucose consumption and lactate production levels. HCC1937 cells with knockdown or overexpression of lncRNA GHET1 were injected into the nude mice, followed by the examination of resulting tumor volume and weight. The distribution and expression of Hippo/YAP signaling pathway-related proteins were probed using western blotting. Results Highly expressed lncRNA GHET1 in TNBC tissues and cells and induction of lncRNA GHET1 by hypoxia were proved. Knockdown of lncRNA GHET1 significantly reduced proliferation, viability, and invasion of TNBC cells, and decreased glucose consumption and lactate production levels under the hypoxia condition. Furthermore, lncRNA GHET1 knockdown decreased HIF-1 alpha expression in hypoxia and significantly inhibited tumor development in vivo. Knockdown of lncRNA GHET1 increased the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 and Yes-associated protein (YAP) to retain YAP within the cytoplasm, while the overexpression of lncRNA GHET1 or hypoxia promoted nuclear translocation of YAP and TNBC development. Conclusion LncRNA GHET1 expression can be induced by hypoxia, which leads to excessive activation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, thus promoting TNBC progression.

AB  - This study summarizes the taxonomic treatment of the camel spider genus Chanbria Muma, 1951. Taking an integrative taxonomic approach incorporating phylogenomic, morphological, and geographical information, the genus is herein revised. Of the four species currently placed in the genus, two are retained: Chanbria regalis Muma, 1951 and Chanbria serpentinus Muma, 1951. Eremochelis plicatus (Muma, 1962) is transferred to this genus because it is consistently recovered in a clade with Chanbria based on several phylogenetic analyses using hundreds of loci recovered from ultraconserved element data. In this study, we re-analyse previously acquired genomic data to assess former species hypotheses and identify new morphological synapomorphies that support the monophyly of Chanbria. The genetic data support the synonymization of Chanbria rectus Muma, 1962 syn. nov. with C. regalis. Furthermore, we synonymize Chanbria tehachapianus Muma, 1962 syn. nov. with C. regalis because C. tehachapianus was erected based on limited morphological information and lack of geographical separation between other populations of C. regalis. Two new species, Chanbria brookharti sp. nov. and Chanbria mapemes sp. nov., are described. This brings the total number of species of Chanbria described to five recognized species: C. regalis, C. serpentinus, C. plicatus com. nov., C. brookharti sp. nov., and C. mapemes sp. nov.

AB  - In the present study, the effects of beta-escin, a central component of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) plant, were on oxidative stress, inflammation, and islet cells of Langerhans investigated in type 2 diabetes. In the experimental type 2 diabetes model, rats were first fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for ten weeks. Then, type 2 diabetes was induced by a double dose of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin injection at five-day intervals. The experimental animals were administered three different beta-escin doses (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg) by gavage for four weeks after the type-2 diabetes was induced. Essential biochemical (insulin, glucose, ghrelin, cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL), inflammation (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, IL-18, leptin, adiponectin), and oxidative stress (TAS, TOS, OSI) parameters were analyzed in the study samples. Furthermore, caspase three positive (cas3+) and insulin-positive (Ins+) cell rates were determined with immunohistochemical methods to identify the effects of beta-escin on pancreatic tissue islet cells. The analysis revealed that administering various beta-escin doses increased beta cell functions by inhibiting apoptosis in pancreatic islet cells and increasing insulin synthesis in rats with type 2 diabetes. Thus, it was concluded that beta-escin exhibited antidiabetic activities since increased serum insulin levels and decreased blood glucose levels were observed. Furthermore, it was determined that inflammation was reduced with the decrease in glucotoxicity due to beta-escin administration. The findings suggested that beta-escin may be employed in treating diabetic complications.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) resulting in sudden cardiac death is common following a myocardial infarction (MI). Our objective was to evaluate the effects of an intracoronary (IC) administration of cardiosphere-derived cell secretome (S-CDCs) on VT inducibility and cardiac function in a swine model of MI. Methods: Fourteen pigs underwent endovascular MI model creation. At 4 weeks, saline (CON; 5 mL; n = 7) or S-CDCs (S-CDCs; 9.16 mg protein in 5 mL saline; n = 7) was blindly administered via the IC route. VT inducibility and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed both pre- and 4 months post-IC therapy, calculating left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), infarct size as a percentage of left ventricle (% MI), and left ventricular indexed end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDVi, LVESVi). Results: While VT was inducible in 100% of the animals before IC therapy, at 4 months, the inducibility rate was lower in the S-CDCs group compared to the CON group (57% versus 100%, p = 0.05). Likewise, in the S-CDCs group, % MI was significantly lower than in the CON group (12 +/- 3% versus 16 +/- 3%, p = 0.03). LVEF (S-CDCs: 35 +/- 10% versus CON: 29 +/- 10%, p = NS), LVEDVi and LVESVi (S-CDCs: 83 +/- 18 mL/m2 and 56 +/- 20 mL/m2 versus CON: 88 +/- 29 mL/m2 and 64 +/- 20 mL/m2, p = NS) did not change. Conclusions: IC therapy with S-CDCs appears to reduce the development of post-MI VT. Furthermore, it suggests a beneficial effect on infarct size, reducing % MI in this experimental swine model.

AB  - In the first days of life, cells of the mammalian embryo segregate into two distinct lineages, trophectoderm and inner cell mass. Unlike nonmammalian species, mammalian development does not proceed from predetermined factors in the oocyte. Rather, asymmetries arise de novo in the early embryo incorporating cues from cell position, contractility, polarity, and cell-cell contacts. Molecular heterogeneities, including transcripts and non-coding RNAs, have now been characterized as early as the 2-cell stage. However, it's debated whether these early heterogeneities bias cells toward one fate or the other or whether lineage identity arises stochastically at the 16-cell stage. This review summarizes what is known about early blastomere asymmetries and our understanding of lineage allocation in the context of historical models. Preimplantation development is reviewed coupled with what is known about changes in morphology, contractility, and transcription factor networks. The addition of single-cell atlases of human embryos has begun to reveal key differences between human and mouse, including the timing of events and core transcription factors. Furthermore, the recent generation of blastoid models will provide valuable tools to test and understand fate determinants. Lastly, new techniques are reviewed, which may better synthesize existing knowledge with emerging data sets and reconcile models with the regulative capacity unique to the mammalian embryo.
   Graphical Abstract Lineage segregation requires crosstalk between cell position, polarity, and mechanical signaling and is defined by the activation of core transcriptional networks. ZGA, zygotic genome activation.

AB  - Maternal diets during pregnancy and lactation are key determinants that regulate the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in offspring. L-malic acid (MA) was previously reported to improve antioxidant capacity and aerobic metabolism. However, the effects of maternal MA consumption on the metabolic features of offspring remain largely unexplored. Herein, through pig models consuming MA-enriched diets during late pregnancy and lactation, we found that maternal MA consumption potentiated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of sows, thereby improving their reproductive performance and the growth performance of piglets. Maternal MA consumption also induced a transition of slow-twitch to fast-twitch fibers in the early life of offspring. Along with muscle growth and fiber-type transition, insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, including aerobic metabolism and glycolysis, were improved in the skeletal muscle of offspring. An untargeted metabolomic analysis further revealed the contribution of modified amino acid metabolism to the improved aerobic metabolism. Mechanistically, maternal MA consumption remodeled colonic microbiota of their offspring. Briefly, the abundance of Colidextribacter, Romboutsia, and Family_XIII_AD3011_group increased, which were positively associated with the antioxidant capacity and glucose metabolism of skeletal muscles. A decreased abundance of Prevotella, Blautia, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, and Collinsella was also detected, which were involved in less insulin sensitivity. Notably, milk metabolites, such as ascorbic acid (AA) and granisetron (GS), were found as key effectors regulating the gut microbiota composition of piglets. The properties of AA and GS in alleviating insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress were further verified through mice treated with high-fat diets. Overall, this study revealed that maternal MA consumption could modulate the inflammatory response, antioxidant capacity, and glucose metabolism by regulating the gut microbiota of offspring through the vertical transmission of milk metabolites. These findings suggest the potential of MA in the prevention and treatment of MetS in early life.

AB  - (1) Background: Glucuronolactone (GLU) is a glucose metabolite with antioxidant activity. At present, the exact role of it in regulating the intestinal health of piglets under weaning stress is not clear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of GLU on the growth performance and intestinal health of piglets under weaning stress and to explore potential mechanisms. (2) Methods: Twenty-four weaned piglets were randomly assigned into two groups, with one group receiving a basal diet and the other group receiving an experimental diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg of GLU. (3) Results: GLU increased the ADG, ADFI, and final body weight of piglets, while reducing the diarrhea rate. Mechanistically, GLU alleviates weaning stress-induced intestinal oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in piglets partly through activating the Nrf2-Akt signaling pathway to suppress the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, while also inhibiting the activation of the TLR4-MAPK signaling pathway to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, GLU increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri in the ileum of piglets and improved the composition of the gut microbiota. (4) Conclusions: GLU reduced inflammation and oxidative stress through the Nrf2/Akt/FOXO1 signaling pathway and improved intestinal health, resulting in improved growth performance of the piglets.

AB  - Stress caused by noise is becoming widespread globally. Noise may lead to deafness, endocrine disorders, neurological diseases, and a decline in mental health. The mechanism behind noise-induced neurodevelopmental abnormalities is unclear, but apoptosis and pro-inflammatory signals may play an important role. In this study, weaned piglets were used as a model to explore noise-induced neurodevelopmental abnormalities. We hypothesized that long-term noise exposure would induce anxiety and cause acute stress, exhibited by alterations in neurotransmission in the amygdala. A total of 72 hybrid piglets (Large White x Duroc x Min Pig) were randomly divided into three groups, including noise (exposed to mechanical noise, 80-85 dB), control (blank, exposed to natural background sound, < 40 dB), and music (positive control, exposed to Mozart K.448, 60-70 dB) groups. The piglets were exposed to 6 h of auditory noise daily (10:00-16:00) for 28 days. Compared with the control group, piglets exposed to noise showed more aggressive behavior. The expression of Caspase3, Caspase9, Bax, NF-kappa B (p56), TLR4, MYD88, I kappa B alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-12RB2 was significantly upregulated in the amygdala, while the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, CAT, and SOD was downregulated in piglets in the noise group. Cell death occurred, and numerous inflammatory cells accumulated in the amygdala of piglets in the noise group. Targeted metabolomics showed that the content of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA was higher in the amygdala of piglets in the noise group. Compared with the noise group, piglets in the music group displayed more positive emotionrelated behaviors. Compared with the noise group, the expression of genes related to apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative damage was lower in the music group. Cells of the amygdala in the music group were also of normal morphology. Our results show that noise-induced stress causes apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the amygdala and induces anxiety during the early neonatal neural development of piglets. In contrast, to some extent, music alleviates noise-induced anxiety.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Previously, we showed that blood-based polarizing cardioplegia exerted beneficial cardioprotection during hypothermic ischemia; however, these positive effects of blood-based polarizing cardioplegia were reduced during normothermic ischemia compared to blood-based hyperkalemic (depolarizing) cardioplegia. This study compares crystalloid polarizing cardioplegia to crystalloid depolarizing cardioplegia in a normothermic porcine model of cardiopulmonary bypass; Methods: Twelve pigs were randomized to receive either normothermic polarizing (n = 7) or depolarizing (n = 5) crystalloid cardioplegia. After the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, normothermic arrest (34 degrees C, 60 min) was followed by 60 min of on-pump and 90 min of off-pump reperfusion. Myocardial injury (arterial CK-MB), hemodynamic function, and the energy status of the hearts were measured; Results: The arterial release of CK-MB was comparable between groups (p = 0.78) during reperfusion. During 150 min of reperfusion, systolic left ventricular pressure (p = 0.01) and coronary flow (p = 0.009) were increased, and wedge pressure (p = 0.04) was decreased in the polarized group. Further hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, stroke volume) and high-energy phosphate levels were similar between groups. The requirement for noradrenaline administration during reperfusion was significantly higher (p = 0.013) in the polarized group; Conclusions: Under normothermic conditions and despite a similar increase in levels of cardiac CK-MB, crystalloid polarizing cardioplegia protected systolic and diastolic cardiac function after 60 min of cardiac arrest. These results suggest beneficial effects for polarizing cardioplegia; clinical studies are required to confirm these effects.

AB  - Reperfusion after ischemia would cause massive myocardial injury, which leads to oxidative stress (OS). Calcium homeostasis imbalance plays an essential role in myocardial OS injury. Ca(V)1.2 calcium channel mediates calcium influx into cardiomyocytes, and its activity is modulated by a region of calpastatin (CAST) domain L, CS(L)54-64. In this study, the effect of Ahf-caltide, derived from CS(L)54-64, on myocardial OS injury was investigated. Ahf-caltide decreased the levels of LDH, MDA and ROS and increased heart rate, coronary flow, cell survival and SOD activity during OS. In addition, Ahf-caltide permeated into H9c2 cells and increased Ca(V)1.2, Ca-V beta 2 and CAST levels by inhibiting protein degradation. At different Ca2+ concentrations (25 nM, 10 mu M, 1 mM), the binding of CSL to the IQ motif in the C terminus of the Ca(V)1.2 channel was increased in a H2O2 concentration-dependent manner. CS(L)54-64 was predicted to be responsible for the binding of CSL to Ca(V)1.2. In conclusion, Ahf-caltide exerted a cardioprotective effect on myocardial OS injury by stabilizing Ca(V)1.2 protein expression. Our study, for the first time, proposed that restoring calcium homeostasis by targeting the Ca(V)1.2 calcium channel and its regulating factor CAST could be a novel treatment for myocardial OS injury.

AB  - A tooth-bearing mandible fossil of a colobine monkey discovered at Shuitangba, Zhaotong, Yunnan, China, was morphometrically analyzed and compared with extant Asian colobines. Our previous qualitative and quantitative descriptions indicate that it can be safely attributed to Mesopithecus pentelicus, a Miocene fossil colobine widely found in Europe and South Asia. The present research aims to explore fossil association with extant colobines and functionally propose its dietary preferences based on multivariate morphometric analyses of mandibular morphology. The results indicate that this fossil species presents a mosaic association with extant langurs (Presbytis, Trachypithecus, and Semnopithecus) and odd-nosed monkeys (Pygathrix, Nasalis, and Rhinopithecus), with most similarities of size-related traits and size-adjusted shapes, and a notable difference from extant Rhinopithecus, due to the increased body size of the latter since the Pliocene. The allometric analysis showed that, like the fossils of the same species in other sites, its mandibular structure appears more adapted to crushing hard seed shells than chewing leaves. Moreover, our findings also imply that the Asian colobines significantly modified their dietary preferences over the last 6 million years following the ecological and environmental changes triggered by the accelerated uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateaus and severe monsoons. Morphologically, the more developed condyle length and moment arms of the temporomandibular joint and medial pterygoid muscles appear to accommodate a more folivorous dietary selection, functionally related to the intake of rigid fibers in leaves that require frequent one or two-side mandibular chewing and grinding.

AB  - Background The 3D computed tomography produces detailed images of the digit bones in addition to the angiograph render volume 3D of the CT shows the relation between the arteries, bones, and tissues of the digit. Therefore, the present study used those imaging techniques to provide a complete description of the digit bones and arteries' origin, distribution, and course and their relations with surrounding structures in the Dromedary Camel. Which would serve as a guide for surgeons and students in distinguishing normal digit structures. The study used eight hind limbs of four adult camels of both sexes (two males and two females), aged 9-15 years (Mean +/- SD, 11.80 +/- 2.59 years). The samples were injected with latex with lead oxide were undergone 3D render volume CT (128-slice multi-detector CT scanning protocol) and angiography x-rays. Results The blood vessels and correlated structures such as bones, tendons, and ligaments were examined using 3D CT in all directions, which was easier to view than angiography and dissected specimens. The arterial supply to the camel's hind foot was the A. digitalis plantaris communis III. The angiography render volume 3D of CT explained the blood supply of the bones and joints of digital regions and showed a good visualization of the many digit arteries. The metatarsals, the phalanges, and the sesamoid bones were visualized. A. plantaris medialis superficialis, A. digitalis plantaris communis III, A. digitalis plantaris communis II and IV, A. interdigitalis, rami articularis medialis and lateralis to the fetlock joint, ramus medialis and ramus lateralis of the A. digitalis plantaris communis III, A. digitalis plantaris propriae III et IV abaxialis, A. digitalis plantaris propriae III et IV axialis, Ramus phalangis axialis and abaxialis of the first phalanx, Ramus phalangis axialis and abaxialis of the second and third phalanges, and A. metatarsae plantaris III were visualized. The study discovered new blood vessel sources in dromedary camels, such as the ramus articularis to the fetlock and the ramus plantaris phalangis abaxialis proximalis and distalis of the first phalanx. Conclusions The digital circulation angiography investigates the circulatory pattern of the camel hind digit, which can assist clinicians in diagnosing digit region affections. 3D CT explained improved visualization of bones and arteries, including many small branches in relation to surrounding structures, in some views better than others.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of EA575 in the treatment of respiratory diseases is described in various clinical studies, improving patients' disease-related symptoms. However, mechanistic in vivo data proving its beneficial effects are limited. Methods: Focusing on the treatment of acute airway inflammation and accompanying cough, this study aimed to elucidate antitussive and mucoactive properties of EA575, applying two animal models. Animals were treated orally twice daily for 7 days, resulting in 43, 215.2, or 430.5 mg/kg bw/d of EA575. Antitussive effects were investigated within an acute lung inflammation model of bleomycin-treated guinea pigs after citric acid exposure. Hereby, the number of coughs, enhanced pause (penH), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were investigated. Mucoactivity of EA575 was assessed within a murine model, determining phenol red concentration in BALF. Results: EA575 treatment within the acute lung inflammation model reduced cough events up to 56% while reducing inflammatory cell influx in BALF dose-dependently, e.g., reducing neutrophils in BALF up to 70.9%. This suggests a strong connection between anti-inflammatory and antitussive properties of EA575. Furthermore, penH decreased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting an ease in respiration. Mucoactivity was shown by a dose-dependent increase in phenol red concentration in BALF up to 38.9%. Notably, EA575/salbutamol co-administration resulted in enhanced phenol red secretion compared to respective single administrations. Conclusions: These data highlight the benefits of EA575 in treating cough-related respiratory diseases, particularly when accompanied by sputum, as EA575 has been shown to obtain mucoactivity. Furthermore, the combinatory effect of EA575/salbutamol treatment provides a foundation for future research in the treatment of chronic respiratory diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary Valproic acid (VPA) is a well-known antiepileptic medication and mood stabiliser that is frequently prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy, particularly in children, and has proven human teratogenic activity. VPA inhibits histone deacetylase, which causes teratogenicity and cell toxicity. VPA-induced autism in rodents during the pre- and postnatal periods has shown the development of an autism-like phenotype. In mice, the 14th postnatal day is thought to correspond to the third trimester of human development; it is an important period in which neuronal migration, differentiation, myelination, synaptogenesis and gliogenesis occur in the cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus. Therefore, we exposed postnatal day 14 (PND 14) mice to VPA, which resulted in autistic-like behaviours manifested as reduced social interaction, increased repetitive stereotyped behaviour and anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, lowered sensitivity to pain and neurodevelopmental delay. BALB/c mice were used in this work because they are less reactive to social contact in VPA-induced autism than many other inbred mouse strains, such as C57/129 mice. In humans, two to three times more men are affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than women, and, for this reason, the current study compares the histopathological changes and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor protein expression in the brain tissue of male and female animals with VPA-induced autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by problems with social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviour. In mice, the 14th postnatal day is believed to correspond to the third trimester of human embryonic development and is considered a vital period for central nervous system development. It has been shown that ASD affects 2 to 3 times more male than female individuals. In the present study, ASD was induced in 14 postnatal day (PND) BALB/c mice using valproic acid (VPA). VPA administration brought about substantial differences in the histoarchitecture of the brain in both male and female mice, linked to behavioural deficits. We observed that both male and female mice showed similar morphological changes in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells. We also observed hair loss from PND 17 to 25, which was again similar between male and female mice. However, there were higher rates of change in the cerebral cortex, frontal cortex and temporal lobe and hippocampus in VPA-treated male animals. With respect to the cerebellum, we did not observe any alterations by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, but detailed morphological observation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a higher rate of phenotype changes in VPA-treated male animals. Moreover, 5-HT2A receptor protein levels were upregulated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells in VPA-treated male mice compared with control animals and VPA-treated female mice, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis. Based on all these findings, we conclude that male animals are more susceptible to VPA-induced ASD than females.

AB  - Oocytes communicate with the surrounding somatic cells during follicular development. We examined the effects of two oocyte-derived growth factors, growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), on the development of porcine oocyte-cumulus cell complexes (OCCs) in vitro. We collected OCCs from early antral follicles (1.2-1.5 mm) and prepared oocytectomized cumulus cell complexes (OXCs), which were then cultured in a growth medium supplemented with 0-100 ng/ml GDF9 and/or BMP15 for 7 days. In the medium without GDF9 or BMP15, OCCs developed during culture, and approximately 30% of them formed antrumlike structures. GDF9 promoted OCC development and structure formation in a dose-dependent manner. However, OXCs did not form antrum-like structures without growth factors. GDF9 promoted the development of OXCs, and 50 and 100 ng/ml GDF9 promoted the formation of the structures by 8% and 26%, respectively; however, BMP15 did not promote the formation of these structures. OXCs were then cultured with 100 ng/ml GDF9 and various concentrations of BMP15 to investigate their cooperative effects on the formation of antrum-like structures. BMP15 promoted the formation of antrum-like structures in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, GDF9 derived from oocytes is probably important for the formation of antrum-like structures in porcine OXCs, and BMP15 cooperates with GDF9 to form these structures.

AB  - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites widely found in plants, which perform various biological activities, such as antiinflammation, antioxidation, antitumor, and so on. Camellia vietnamensis Huang, a species of oil-tea Camellia tree, is an important woody oil crop species widely planted on Hainan Island, which provides health benefits with its high antioxidant activity and abundant flavonoid content. However, very little is known about the overall molecular mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. vietnamensis Huang. In this study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is used as an inducer to change the content of secondary metabolites in C. vietnamensis. Then, the potential mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis in C. vietnamensis leaves in response to MeJA were analyzed by metabolomics and transcriptomics (RNA sequencing). The results showed that metabolome analysis detected 104 flavonoids and 74 fatty acyls which showed different expression patterns (increased or decreased expression). It was discovered by KEGG analysis that three differentially accumulated metabolites (cinnamaldehyde, kaempferol and quercitrin) were annotated in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941), and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (ko00944) pathways. In the transcriptome analysis, 35 different genes involved in the synthesis of flavonoids were identified by MapMan analysis. The key genes (PAL, 4CL, CCR, CHI, CHS, C4H, FLS) that might be involved in the formation of flavonoid were highly expressed after 2 h of MeJA treatment. This study provides new insights and data supporting the molecular mechanism underlying the metabolism and synthesis of flavonoids in C. vietnamensis under MeJA treatment.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to compare the effects of replacing inorganic trace minerals (ITM) with different levels of complex organic trace minerals (OTM) on the growth performance, oxidative status, and intestinal function of piglets. Weanling piglets were assigned to five groups: a control group fed a basal diet supplemented with inorganic trace minerals and the other four groups fed basal diets supplemented with different levels of OTMs. The results showed that diets supplemented with 50 ppm Fe, 30 ppm Zn, 15 ppm Mn, and 0.2 ppm Se from OTM (L-OTM), or with 75 ppm Fe, 45 ppm Zn, 22.5 ppm Mn, and 0.3 ppm Se from OTM (M-OTM) significantly decreased the diarrhea ratio in the piglets compared with those supplemented with 100 ppm Fe, 90 ppm Zn, 40 ppm Mn, and 0.4 ppm Se from ITM. Compared with those in the ITM group, the piglets in the M-OTM group had significantly higher serum CuZnSOD, MnSOD, and GSH-Px levels. Moreover, piglets in the L-OTM and M-OTM groups had higher Sod and Gpx gene expression than those in the ITM group. Additionally, piglets in the L-OTM and M-OTM groups had significantly higher villus height than those in the ITM group, and the M-OTM group piglets had lower serum diamine oxidase content and higher ileal ZO-1 and occludin protein expression levels than those in the ITM group. These results indicate that replacing dietary ITMs with OTMs could decrease diarrhea occurrence and improve the oxidative status and intestinal barrier function in weanling piglets.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a perinatal brain injury that is the leading cause of cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and poor cognitive outcomes in children born at term, occurring in about 1.5 out of 1000 births. The only proven therapy for HIE is therapeutic hypothermia. However, despite this treatment, many children ultimately suffer disability, brain injury, and even death. Barriers to implementation including late diagnosis and lack of resources also lead to poorer outcomes. This demonstrates a critical need for additional treatments for HIE, and to facilitate this, we need translational models that accurately reflect risk factors and interactions present in HIE. Maternal or amniotic infection is a significant risk factor and possible cause of HIE in humans. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a well-established model of maternal infection and inflammation that has significant developmental consequences largely characterized within the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. MIA can also lead to long-lasting changes within the neuroimmune system, which lead to compounding negative outcomes following a second insult. This supports the importance of understanding the interaction of maternal inflammation and hypoxic-ischemic outcomes. Animal models have been invaluable to understanding the pathophysiology of this injury and to the development of therapeutic hypothermia. However, each model system has its own limitations. Large animal models such as pigs may more accurately represent the brain and organ development and complexity in humans, while rodent models are more cost-effective and offer more possible molecular techniques. Recent studies have utilized MIA or direct inflammation prior to HIE insult. Investigators should thoughtfully consider the risk factors they wish to include in their HIE animal models. In the incorporation of MIA, investigators should consider the type, timing, and dose of the inflammatory stimulus, as well as the timing, severity, and type of hypoxic insult. Using a variety of animal models that incorporate the maternal-placental-fetal system of inflammation will most likely lead to a more robust understanding of the mechanisms of this injury that can guide future clinical decisions and therapies.
