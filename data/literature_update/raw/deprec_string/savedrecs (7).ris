AB  - Alterations of the geographical ranges of animals have become a reason for interactions with humans, leading to various consequences. We describe the pattern of range expansion of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and implications for human-elephant interactions in the agricultural landscape of South West Bengal, India. We enquired about past and current sightings of Asian elephants from local people to gather information on range expansion from the 1950 s to 2018. We also collected the records of human deaths and injuries by elephants from 2010 to 2018 from the records of the Forest Department. We employed an occupancy framework to understand the probability of the occurrence of elephants in the landscape from 2010 to 2018. The range of elephants in the landscape increased from -1200 km2 in the 1950-60 s to -13200 km2 by 2010-18. The calculated probability of use of grid cells was 36 % and the forest edge had a high influence on the space usage by the elephants. Elephants occurred in an average of 26 grid cells per month, and the number of grid cells with elephants did not differ between the months. A total of 640 attacks on humans occurred, which significantly varied between the years. The probability of elephant occurrence in a grid cell was the major determinant factor for the elephant attacks on humans. Although people respect elephants, there is a sense of intolerance towards them if they enter the crop fields, owing to the small land holdings and the incapacity to endure the monetary losses of the farmers.

AB  - The archaeological site of Notarchirico, chronologically placed at the end of MIS 17 and MIS 16 (675-610 ka), is a key site for studying Acheulean technology in southern Europe and gaining a better understanding of human occupation in that region during the Middle Pleistocene. It was excavated between 1979 and 1995 by Marcello Piperno and re-opened since 2016. Between 1990 and 1991, around forty remains of Palaeloxodon antiquus , mostly comprising the head of the animal, such as cranium, mandible and tusks fragments belonging to a subadult male were discovered as a result of the excavation of a lateral discontinuity of the level A, situated in an area known as the "elephant butchery area " . Remains of deer, mainly assigned to Dama sp., and 42 stone tools, including choppers, hand -axes, cores and some flakes were also identified in the surroundings. This accumulation was originally interpreted as a butchering site, reflecting a single event of processing of an elephant carcass, and the entire paleosurface was exposed to visitors in situ . This work re-evaluates the original archaeological materials, especially those still preserved on the paleosurface, in terms of stratigraphic distribution, taphonomy and technology, to critically evaluate the putative role of hominins in the exploitation of the megaherbivore. After a meticulous examination of each element ' s surface and its deposition, we conclude that there is no support for the previous interpretation of the so-called " elephant butchery area " of Notarchirico as the result a butchery event, as there is no evidence of human exploitation of the remains and the accumulation derives from at least two diverse and unrelated depositional events, one resulting in the deposition of the elephant remains, and the other of the majority of the fallow deer remains and the stone tools.

AB  - Context. The behaviours used by mammalian predators to track, kill, and consume prey are some of the most dynamic interspecific interactions in nature. However, they are often challenging to follow through the landscape and observe directly without disturbing the animals being watched. Aims. We describe the behaviours used by wild dingoes while hunting macropods in Namadgi National Park, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Methods. Footage was initially captured by wildlife cinematographers on behalf of documentary programs and was made available for viewing after production. Hunting events were filmed from an altitude of > 50 m by using a "long lens' fitted to either a drone or helicopter. Results. We recorded a suite of hunting behaviours that would have been extremely challenging to observe from the ground via traditional methods. This includes some of the first video records published in the scientific literature of the behaviours used by dingoes to hunt and kill macropod prey, as well as some rare observations of mother and pup hunting dynamics. We did not observe any signs of disturbance as a result of filming for either predator or prey. Conclusions. The varied repertoire of predatory behaviours displayed by dingoes is similar to that documented in wolves and asserts them as a behaviourally complex top predator in the Australian landscape. In addition, we highlight the use of drones as a valuable approach for directly observing wild behaviours. They offer a minimally invasive and relatively inexpensive and accessible alternative to helicopters. This project is also a case study exemplifying the value of collaborations between filmmakers and researchers that enable the sharing of archival documentary footage for the study of wild animal behaviour. Implications. Future studies of wild animal behaviour should consider employing drones (at a safe distance and in accordance with published best practices and guidelines) as an additional tool to collect types of data that would be challenging using other methods.

AB  - Priming of Norway spruce (Picea abies) inducible defenses is a promising way to protect young trees from herbivores and pathogens. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application is known to induce and potentially prime Norway spruce defenses but may also reduce plant growth. Therefore, we tested beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) as an alternative priming chemical to enhance spruce resistance, using 2-year-old Norway spruce plants. We compared inducible defense responses, i.e. traumatic resin duct formation and accumulation of defensive metabolites, in bark and xylem tissues of BABA- or MeJA-treated plants before and after wounding. We also evaluated the effect of these chemical treatments on Norway spruce resistance to the pathogenic bluestain fungus Grosmania penicilliata. BABA did not induce defense responses or pathogen resistance, it even reduced concentrations of total terpenes in the treated plants. In contrast, MeJA induced traumatic resin duct formation, accumulation of flavonoids, pathogen resistance, and did not affect plant growth. For the first time, flavan-3-ols (catechins) were shown to have a primed response to MeJA treatment in Norway spruce. Our results indicated that BABA is not a suitable alternative priming chemical to MeJA in Norway spruce.

AB  - With increasing air and sea temperatures, the thermodynamic environments over the oceans are becoming more favourable for the development of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) with rapid intensification (RI). The South China coastal region consists of highly densely populated cities, especially over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Intense TCs maintaining their strength or the RI of TCs close to the coastal region can present substantial forecasting challenges and have significant potential impacts on the coastal population. This study investigates the effect of sea-surface and sub-surface temperatures and salinity on the intensification of five TCs, namely Super Typhoon Hato in 2017, Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018, and Typhoon Talim, Super Typhoon Saola, and Severe Typhoon Koinu in 2023, which have significantly affected the South China coastal region and triggered high TC warning signals in Hong Kong in the past few years. This analysis utilised the Hong Kong Observatory's TC best-track and intensity data, along with sea temperature and salinity profiles generated using the China Ocean ReAnalysis version 2 (CORA2) product from the National Marine Data and Information Service of China. It was found that high sea-surface temperatures (SST) of 30 degrees C or above for a depth of about 20 m, low sea-surface salinity (SSS) levels of 33.8 psu or below for a depth of at least 20 m, and strong salinity stratification of at least 0.6 psu per 100 m depth might offer useful hints for predicting the RI of TCs over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea (SCS) in operational forecasting, while noting other contributing environmental factors and synoptic flow patterns conducive to RI. This study represents the first documentation of sub-surface salinity's impact on some intense TCs traversing the SCS during 2017-2023 based on an observational study. Our aim is to supplement operational techniques for forecasting RI with some quantitative guidance based on upper-level ocean observations of temperatures and salinity, on top of well-known but more rapidly changing dynamical factors like low-level convergence, weak vertical wind shear, and upper-level divergent outflow, as forecasted with numerical weather prediction models. This study will also encourage further research to refine the analysis of quantitative contributions from different RI factors and the identification of essential features for developing AI models as one way to improve the forecasting of TC RI before the TC makes landfall near the PRD, with due consideration given to the effect of freshwater river discharge from the Pearl River.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is broadly characterized by neurodegeneration, pathology accumulation, and cognitive decline. There is considerable variation in the progression of clinical symptoms and pathology in humans, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in the study of AD. To address this, we analyze cell composition and amyloid-beta deposition of 6- and 14-month-old AD-BXD mouse brains. We utilize the analytical QUINT workflow- a suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification, which we expand to deliver a highly effective method for registering and quantifying cell and pathology changes in diverse disease models. In applying the expanded QUINT workflow, we quantify near-global age-related increases in microglia, astrocytes, and amyloid-beta, and we identify strain-specific regional variation in neuron load. To understand how individual differences in cell composition affect the interpretation of bulk gene expression in AD, we combine hippocampal immunohistochemistry analyses with bulk RNA-sequencing data. This approach allows us to categorize genes whose expression changes in response to AD in a cell and/or pathology load-dependent manner. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the use of the QUINT workflow to standardize the quantification of immunohistochemistry data in diverse mice, - providing valuable insights into regional variation in cellular load and amyloid deposition in the AD-BXD model.
   QUINT workflow analysis of cell and amyloid density in AD-BXD mice demonstrates age-dependent and strain-specific increases in gliosis and amyloid accumulation. These changes in brain composition influence age-related variations in gene expression.

AB  - Simple Summary High-fiber unconventional feed, an alternative to conventional feed, is gaining attention as a breakthrough in alleviating the conflict between human and livestock food resources. Incorporating an appropriate amount of crude fiber into the diet can enhance the high-fiber tolerance of the pig gut microbiota, thereby improving the cellulose digesting ability, affecting pig growth performance and gut microbiota, and reducing livestock feed costs. However, there are differences in the tolerance and utilization efficiency of roughage feed among the different breeds. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in Jinwu pigs and Duroc pigs after feeding them diets with an increased roughage content. The results showed that while increasing the roughage content in the diet had a certain impact on the growth rate and feed conversion ratio, it could reduce feed costs and modify the gut microbiota structure. This preliminary study sheds light on the tolerance of Jinwu pigs to roughage and its underlying mechanisms, providing a scientific basis for optimizing feed formulations and improving pig growth performance.Abstract The Jinwu pig (JW) is a hybrid breed originating from the Chinese indigenous Jinhua pig and Duroc pig, boasting excellent meat quality and fast growth rates. This study aimed to verify the tolerance of JW to roughage, similar to most Chinese indigenous pigs. In this research, two types of feed were provided to JW and Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire pigs (DLY): a basal diet and a roughage diet (increasing the rice bran and wheat bran content in the basal diet from 23% to 40%) for a 65-day experimental period. The roughage diet showed an increasing trend in the feed conversion ratio (F/G), with a 17.61% increase in feed consumption per unit weight gain for DLY, while the increase for JW was only 4.26%. A 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that the roughage diet increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Clostridium, while reducing the relative abundance of some potential pathogens, thus improving the gut microbiota environment. After being fed with the roughage diet, the abundance of bacterial genera, such as Treponema, Terrisporobacter, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcaceae, which aid in the digestion and utilization of dietary fiber, were significantly higher in Jinwu compared to DLY, indicating that these bacterial genera confer Jinwu with a higher tolerance to roughage than DLY.

AB  - Aflatoxins are the most common types of mycotoxins that are further categorized as AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2. They are toxic metabolites and are produced by fungi, mostly Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. In the present research, aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 were monitored in the feed of captive birds. A total of 40 feed samples were collected in summer and monsoon season from Lahore Zoo from cages of ten bird species such as Ostrich (Struthio camelus), Black Swan (Cygnus atratus), Green pheasant (Phasianus versicolor), Silver Pheasant (Lophurany cthemera), Crane Bird (Grus virgo), Chukar (Alectoris chukar), Red-Wattled Lapwing (Vanellus indicus), Finches (Fringillidae), Alaxandrine parakeet (Psitta culaeupatria), and Turkey Bird (Meleagris). The Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) method was used to detect and estimate the level of aflatoxins. Upon quantification, out of 40 samples 21 were contaminated, and of them, 17 were within the permissible range, while 4 were contaminated beyond the permissible range. The tolerant range of the limit of aflatoxins in avifauna feed daily was 10 mu g/kg according to the EU (2010). AFB1 was detected in 21 samples, whereas B2, G1, and G2 were not detected in any sample. The overall percentage of contaminated feed samples was lower in summer (35%) as compared to the monsoon season (65%). Statistical analysis, such as an independent sample t-test, was done by using SPSS version 22, and significant differences (<0.05) were noticed in aflatoxin levels in summer and monsoon season. However, there were non-significant differences that were noticed among the feed samples of different birds by ANOVA. It was concluded that the storage condition of feed samples was better in Lahore Zoo. However, in the monsoon season, there is a need of special care by the feed regulating authorities of the Zoo so that the spread of aflatoxins can be reduced.

AB  - Temminck's pangolin, Smutsia temminckii (Smuts, 1832) is a threatened but protected species in Zimbabwe whose population is declining, ostensibly, due to poaching and persecution by humans. Inasmuch as the human factor is a critical dimension in Temminck's pangolin population dynamics, there are few studies documenting local perceptions on conservation threats and options for the species in Zimbabwe. The study aimed to (a) assess the conservation perceptions of local fringe communities and (b) explore existing and potential conservation options for Temminck's pangolin in Hwange National Park (HNP) in Zimbabwe. Data on local perceptions towards Temminck's pangolin were collected through a questionnaire survey from May to December 2021, delving across cultural, political, economic, and social aspects in HNP. Poaching and trafficking, spurred by lucrative market prices and frivolous superstitious cultural beliefs and myths associated with the species and its by-products, are the apex drivers for Temminck's pangolin dynamics in HNP. Climate change and habitat degradation mostly by African savanna elephants also affect Temminck's pangolin populations in the HNP. A multifaceted conservation approach integrating indigenous knowledge systems, citizen science data, active community involvement, modern conservation methods, and a zero pangolin poaching policy in HNP is imperative for Temminck's pangolin conservation.

AB  - Seabuckthorn (Hippophae salicifolia D. Don) is an economically important dioecious and deciduous actinorhizal tree species. Considering the contemporary interest in seabuckthorn as a future multipurpose crop, efforts have been initiated towards an assessment of genetic diversity prevailing in the natural populations inhabiting diverse geographical areas. In the present study, morphological and molecular diversity was studied in Hippophae salicifolia D. Don collections representing diverse ecological sites in the different geographical areas of the Garhwal and Kumaon regions of Uttarakhand, India. Morphological diversity was assessed by studying twenty-seven morphological characters. For standard identification of the color of leaves and berries, a color-coded reference (RHS)-based study was performed. By employing fifteen microsatellite markers, 109 alleles were detected and 71.5% of markers were polymorphic. Furthermore, polymorphic information content (PIC) (0.387), expected heterozygosity (H-e)/Nei's Diversity (0.641), Wright's fixation index (F-IS) (0.630), and Shannon's informative index (I) (0.646) were calculated for the four populations simultaneously to study the phylogenetic relationships. The UPGMA-based dendrogram were also prepared by using morphological and molecular data. The dendrogram showed a demarcation between collections from different regions, although a few collections were found clustered with collections from the other regions. Assessment of genetic diversity was efficient and more informative using microsatellite markers. The findings of this study will be useful in future breeding and conservation programs in Hippophae salicifolia and related species.

TI  - Automeris moloneyi Druce1 Larvae Feed on Oil Palm Leaflets
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
LA  - English
AB  - Oil palm, Elaeis guineensis Jacq., is one of the most important oil crops in Mexico. The study aimed to record herbivory, damage, and taxonomic identity of Automeris moloneyi Druce 1897 (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) in nine commercial oil palm plantations at Tabasco, Mexico. In each plantation, 30 palm trees were selected in which A. moloneyi was searched for and collected every 3 months, from September 2019 to November 2020. At each sampling, the leaf surface of four fronds in the lower-middle part of the plant canopy was examined. A. moloneyi larvae fed on oil palm leaflets, abundance was low (0.003 to 0.103 larva per frond), and damage was localized (few plants). Most larvae per frond were recorded during the wettest time of the year in the study area. This is the first record of A. moloneyi in oil palm. The finding extends the geographical distribution of the species in the Neotropical region of the world. Probable factors that might be involved in low occurrence and damage of the species in the oil palm agroecosystem of the study area were discussed.

AB  - BackgroundWithin the Hymenoptera, bees are notable for their relationship with flowering plants, being almost entirely dependent on plant pollen and nectar. Though functionally herbivorous, as a result of their role as pollinators, bees have received comparatively little attention as models for insect herbivory. Bees often display dietary specialization, but quantitative comparison against other herbivorous insects has not previously been conducted.ResultsIn the most comprehensive analysis to date for 860 bee species, dietary specialization amounted to 50.1% of studied species collecting pollen from between 1 and 2 botanical families with a relatively long tail of dietary generalists, with 11.1% of species collecting from more than 10 botanical families. This distribution deviated from the truncated Pareto distribution of dietary breadth seen in other herbivorous insect lineages. However, this deviation was predominantly due to eusocial bee lineages, which show a range of dietary breadths that conformed to a normal distribution, while solitary bees show a typical truncated distribution not strongly different from other herbivorous insects. We hypothesize that the relatively low level of dietary specialization in bees as a whole reflects the relaxation of the constraints typically observed in herbivorous insects with a comparatively reduced importance of plant chemistry and comparatively increased importance of phenology and foraging efficiency. The long flight periods of eusocial bees that are necessary to allow overlapping generations both allows and necessitates the use of multiple flowering resources, whereas solitary bees with short flight periods have more limited access to varied resources within a constrained activity period.ConclusionsCollectively, solitary bees show slightly lower specialization compared to other herbivorous insects, possibly due to their balanced relationship with plants, rather than direct antagonism such as seen in the direct consumption of plant tissues. An additional factor may be the mediocre diversity of bees at low latitudes combined with low levels of dietary specialization, whereas these areas typically display a high rate of specialization by herbivorous insects in general. Though the most important factors structuring dietary specialization in bees appear to differ from many other herbivorous insects, solitary bees show a surprisingly similar overall pattern of dietary specialization.

AB  - The status of the forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis in Guinea-Bissau has been in doubt since the last assessment in 2006. In 2020-2022 we carried out field surveys to update the species' status. We found elephant signs within an area of c. 1,000 km2. Microsatellite genotyping of faeces identified four males. Females could not be individually identified but their presence was confirmed by molecular sex determination. Camera trapping (2,075 camera-trap days) recorded 824 photos in 24 independent sequences, involving three males and two presumed females. The continued presence of elephants in Guinea-Bissau raises hope for the species in the region, but urgent efforts are needed to refine population range and size estimates, increase protected area coverage, and reduce ongoing and impending habitat loss. An emergency conservation action plan is a priority.

AB  - Cryopreservation of somatic tissues and cells can be applied to biodiversity conservation. Although vitrification is widely used for tissue cryopreservation, it is challenging to obtain viable cells in facilities that lack adequate experimental tools, such as zoos. In this study, we established a simple tissue cryopreservation method for obtaining viable cells. Using mouse tissues of the ears and skin, we explored the conditions suitable for cryopreservation. After freezing, the tissues were thawed, and the cells were isolated. The tissues were then cut into small pieces to obtain viable cells. The use of a ciyopreservative solution and freezing at -80 degrees C increased the probability of obtaining viable cells. Viable cells were obtained and cultured even after the ear tissues were stored at room temperature for 24 h. Our method allowed primary cells to be isolated and cultured from ear tissues of dead animal. Further, we examined whether cells isolated from cryopreserved tissues could be studied in vitro. We found that treatment with lipopolysaccharides and Poly I:C increased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in wild boar cells. These data suggest that the simple cryopreservation method developed here can be applied to biodiversity conservation and basic science studies of wild animal cells.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using different levels of sunflower hulls (SFH) as a source of fiber in a complete feed on Naemi ewes' milk yield, composition, and fatty acid profile at 6, 45, and 90 days postpartum. In this study, 48 primiparous lactating Naemi ewes were randomly selected for the four treatment groups as follows: C (control), total mixed ratio (TMR; 0% SFH); TMR1, including S12% SFH; TMR2, including S20% SFH; and TMR3, including S28% SFH. The data were analyzed by SAS software 9.4 as a complete randomized design with repeated measurements. Both the S20 and S28 groups showed significant effects on milk yield and persistence at 45 and 90 days compared to the control and S12 groups. The triglyceride concentration level at 6 and 90 days postpartum was significantly higher (p < 0.05; p < 0.001) in the blood serum. The treatment significantly affected fat, protein, and total solids (p < 0.05), with quadratic and cubic responses, respectively. The time significantly influenced protein (p < 0.001), lactose (p < 0.01), and total solids (p < 0.05). A significant difference (p < 0.05) in the treatments showed varying responses in the fatty acid concentration in milk. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and omega 6 (n-6)/omega 3 (n-3) in the milk fat of ewes from the S12, S20, and S28 groups were significantly lower compared to the others. Furthermore, the (n-6) and atherogenicity (AI) were high and low, respectively, in S28, which is considered beneficial to human health. In conclusion, ewes can be fed up to 28% SFH during lactation as a complete pelleted feed to obtain an acceptable milk yield, nutritive value, and healthy fatty acid profile.

AB  - Re-introduction of captive endangering or extinct animals to their native habitats holds profound ecological significance. But evaluating the feralization progress of re-introduced "wild" animals requires concise and quantitative indicator(s) to integrate traditional assessments on selfsustainability and reproduction. A fecal ARGs' profiling was conducted for Przewalski's horses, an extinct flagship herbivore, in Xinjiang, China from the Breeding Center (captive), Tianshan Wildlife Zoo (semi-captive), and Kalamaili Nature Reserve (re-introduction) with Mongolian wild asses serving as a reference in the shared Kalamaili range. Over 60 ARGs were quantified across 6 samples at each site for Przewalski's horses while 46 ARGs for Mongolian wild asses. The reintroduced Przewalski's horses had significant losses of fecal ARGs in sharing number and relative abundance in comparison to the captive ones. The re-introduced Przewalski's horses had complex internal connections among the quantified fecal ARGs in expression potential (average relative abundance per quantified ARGs by antimicrobial category) and even more significant external connections with Mongolian wild asses than with captive horse. Overall, the reintroduction of Przewalski's horses achieved notable and progressive success in feralization. Tetracyclines resistance genes (Tetra-RGs) alone, with full quantification frequency, could quantitatively characterized this achievement. Ratio of Tetra-RGs to aminoglycosides resistant genes (Amino-RGs) would differentiate the feralization progress with orders of magnitude, for the re-introduced Przewalski's horses at 279 and the captive one at 11.7, against Mongolian wild asses at 0.86 in this study. The two ARGs-based indicators might be applicable to quantify feralization progress in re-introduction of other captive endangering or extinct animals with validations.

AB  - In this study, the effects of high hydrostatic pressure treatment on the quality characteristics and the protein structure of vacuum-packed fresh pork and wild boar meats were investigated. Based on the results, an optimal pressure value was determined that would not cause the sensory properties of the treated flesh to differ from that of the untreated fresh meats but would effectively contribute to the extension of shelf life. The conclusion was made that high hydrostatic pressure treatment performed at 200 MPa did not lead to the denaturation of meat proteins and had no significant effect on the pH value or the color parameters. However, the shelf life of the meat could be extended by a week due to the two-orders-of-magnitude germicidal effect of the treatment.

AB  - Reticulitermes grassei is a subterranean termite species that forages on woody structures of the Iberian Peninsula, and is often a building and crops pest. A total of 23 microorganisms associated with the activity of R. grassei were isolated from colonized ecosystems in southern Spain. They were morphologically and molecularly characterized, with fungi being the most prevalent ones. The fungi showed high values of optimum growth temperature, suggesting that they could be able to survive and develop in warm regions. Their cellulolytic activity was tested in carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar, concluding that all fungal isolates produce cellulases, and the enzymatic index (EI) was revealed in CMC agar with Gram's iodine solution, with Penicillium citrinum showing the highest EI and Trichoderma longibrachiatum the highest mycelial growth rate on CMC. A preliminary microorganism dispersion assay was carried out with the termites, concluding that these insects may have a positive influence on fungal dispersion and the subsequent colonization of new substrates. Our study suggests that fungi associated with R. grassei may potentially be of interest in biotechnological fields such as biofuel production and the food industry.

AB  - Infestations of the small walnut aphid, Chromaphis juglandicola (Kalt.), seriously threatens the yield and quality of walnut in southern Xinjiang, China. Understanding the dominant natural enemies of pests in the crop is crucial for optimizing conservation strategies to enhance ecological services. Through field surveys, this study revealed that ladybugs and lacewings had the highest dominance and temporal niche breadth indices among predatory insects. The temporal niche overlap index between ladybugs (predominantly Hippodamia variegata (Goeze)), and C. juglandicola was the highest, with their population peaks strongly coinciding. In cage experiments with H. variegata under varying predator/aphid ratios (1 : 50, 1 : 100, 1 : 150, 1 : 200, 0), we found that a predator-to-prey ratio exceeding 1:100 effectively suppressed C. juglandicola population growth, achieving over 70% biocontrol efficacy within 1 wk. Furthermore, in the field, the growth rate of C. juglandicola was significantly and negatively correlated with the ratio of ladybugs to aphids. Path analysis indicated that for every unit increase in the predator-to-aphid ratio, biocontrol efficacy improved by 63.4% (the standardized effect coefficient in path analysis), and the aphid population growth rate decreased by 65.2%. This study confirmed that H. variegata is the dominant predator of C. juglandicola in walnut orchards of southern Xinjiang. A predator/aphid ratio exceeding 1:100 effectively suppressed aphid population growth, maintaining it at low levels. These findings provided critical theoretical support for developing biological control strategies using H. variegata to manage C. juglandicola in walnut orchards of southern Xinjiang.

AB  - The availability of high-quality food resources is a critical determinant of wildlife fitness. Over the past two decades, phenological mismatch - the temporal misalignment between animals' peak nutrient demand and optimal resource availability - has emerged as a significant conservation challenge. This issue is particularly worrisome for migratory birds, which must accumulate energy reserves to meet the elevated metabolic demands of migration between breeding and wintering grounds. In Poyang Lake, a crucial wintering ground along the East Asian-Australasian flyway, increasing asynchrony between vegetation growth and the migration of herbivorous waterbirds significantly impedes conservation efforts and presents a major management challenge for this Ramsar wetland. This study evaluates the efficacy of mowing, a grassland management measure, in regulating plant growth processes and restoring food resources for geese. In-situ mowing experiments were conducted with varying timings in Carex wet meadows, the primary foraging habitats of geese. Optimal mowing times were identified, and the maximum goose carrying capacity was assessed by comparing Carex growth and nutritional dynamics with goose dietary requirements. The results reveal that mowing effectively slows down the aging process of Carex, and protein content is identified as a critical limiting factor for geese foraging. Different mowing timings extend the suitable foraging period by 11-25 days. Estimates suggest varying carrying capacities with different mowing timings, supporting goose populations ranging from 133 to 2,046 in Changhuchi Lake during wintering. The optimal mowing window is early October, avoiding dates before late September and after late November. Moreover, multiple-stage mowing is recommended to accommodate different wintering stages. The study highlights mowing as a potential habitat restoration approach for goose conservation, effectively mitigating the challenges imposed by phenological mismatch directly and indirectly caused by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The proliferation and differentiation of mammalian skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are highly complicated. Apart from the regulatory signaling cascade driven by the protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNA) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in this biological process. However, circRNA functions in MuSCs proliferation and differentiation remain largely to be elucidated. Here, we screened for an exonic circTCF4 based on our previous RNA-Seq data, specifically expressed during the development of the longest dorsal muscle in goats. Subsequently, the circular structure and whole sequence of circTCF4 were verified using Sanger sequencing. Besides, circTCF4 was spatiotemporally expressed in multiple tissues from goats but strikingly enriched in muscles. Furthermore, circTCF4 suppressed MuSCs proliferation and differentiation, independent of AGO2 binding. Finally, we conducted Poly(A) RNA-Seq using cells treated with small interfering RNA targeting circTCF4 and found that circTCF4 would affect multiple signaling pathways, including the insulin signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway related to muscle differentiation. Our results provide additional solid evidence for circRNA regulating skeletal muscle formation.

KW  - CAPE COAST
AB  - Fossilized elephant tracks, along with other vertebrate tracks, have been identified at several sites in the coastal Woody Cape section within the Addo Elephant National Park, in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. The tracks occur in aeolianites (cemented dunes). The track-bearing unit has been dated to 126 +/- 8 ka, at approximately the boundary between the Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene. In all probability, the trackmaker was the African savannah elephant ( Loxodonta africana). Viewed in conjunction with the thirty-five elephant track sites that have been identified on South Africa's Cape south coast, a widespread Pleistocene elephant presence can be inferred, which is not obvious from the body fossil record. Collaboration with Park management is aimed at developing an interpretive exhibit, which can be complemented by the physical recovery and exhibition of suitable fossilized elephant tracks or the creation of replicas using photogrammetry data.

TI  - Exploring implications of elephant movements between land use types in a semi-arid savannah landscape
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
KW  - LOXODONTA-AFRICANA
AB  - While the numbers and distribution of African savannah elephants ( Loxodonta africana) have declined in many African range States, they have been steadily increasing in much of southern Africa. In Namibia's arid north-west, elephants are expanding beyond Protected areas (PA) into multiple types of land use, leading to socio-economic implications, both positive and negative. Our study aimed to quantify cross-land use movements and fence breaches and to explore the institutional, legislative and policy implications of fencing, as well as a new conservation paradigm for the area. We used satellite movements of eight collared elephant herds in multiple types of land use to the south and west of Etosha National Park for one year. Of these herds, seven had home ranges spanning multiple PA/communal/commercial landscapes, often crossing fences with management or disease significance. The implications of the movements between land uses are assessed in the context of relevant policy regarding management and economics. We conclude that despite challenges to livestock disease control and fencing damage, the expansion of elephant range has resulted in economic benefits to landowners and communal conservancies through tourism and possible consumptive use opportunities, as well as an improvement in general wildlife conservation practices in the area. Regardless of these benefits and the growing interest among rural residents in supporting the establishment of elephant corridors and the removal of fences, Namibia's legal and policy framework creates numerous implications for landowners and managers when considering fence breaches by elephants. We conclude with recommendations for holistic situational analysis of policy, law and practice and the consideration of amendments to outdated fencing requirements, thereby unlocking the economic and conservation benefits of elephant range expansion in the area.

AB  - This study uses telemetry and stomach content analysis to describe the ringed seals' dive pattern and prey selection within Kangia (Ilulissat Icefjord), Greenland, where the ringed seals are known to be exceptionally large and genetically distinct. Data from twenty-four ringed seals (Pusa hispida) tagged in Kangia, with satellite relay data loggers from 2012 to 2020, were used to describe the dive patterns. The transmitters were active between 28 and 270 days and showed that subadults most frequently dove to around 150 m. Adult males frequently dove to this depth, but they also had a second frequently visited depth at around 400 m, some adults significantly deeper. Adult males generally dove deeper than females and adult seals showed deeper dives during the winter, a feature that was less prominent in subadults. The stomach content from ringed seals (n = 108) harvested in Kangia by subsistence hunters revealed that polar cod (Boreogadus saida), capelin (Mallotus villosus), mysids (Mysis oculata, M. littoralis, M. Polaris) and shrimps (mainly Pandalus borealis) were the dominant prey. Shrimps were observed more often in adults, likely due to the frequently visited dive depth of around 400 m, whereas mysids were more observed in small subadult seals. The stomach content from harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) caught in Kangia also showed a strong niche overlap with the ringed seals. These findings outline the unique ecological adaptations and the importance of Kangia as a critical habitat of ringed seals.

AB  - Body composition is an important parameter in diving animals intermittently fasting on land, such as southern elephant seals, as it is known to impact their time of departure at sea, swimming effort, foraging success, and survival. Deuterium labeled water is commonly used to assess total body water, but a precise indication of equilibration time in this species and reliable sample storage are lacking. We injected newly weaned southern elephant seal female pups with deuterium-labeled water. We thereafter blood sampled the seals several times to assess the equilibration time and body composition. We implemented two storage methods, flame-sealed capillaries and frozen serums stored at - 20 degrees C in a gas freezer. The frozen serums method was reliable as capillaries and safer to bring undamaged samples from the field. This method of determining body composition in wild animals is reliable and easily applicable for isolated and difficult-to-access fieldwork.

T2  - AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES
LA  - English
AB  - We review the current usage of the species-group names Perognathus inornatus Merriam, 1889, for the San Joaquin Pocket Mouse and P. longimembris (Coues, 1875) for the Little Pocket Mouse. Wilfred Osgood, in two papers published 18 years apart at the beginning of the 20th Century, provided conflicting applications of these names, with his second assignments in common use since 1918. Contrary to this prevailing usage, we show that the skull of the holotype of longimembris is best allocated to the San Joaquin form, as Osgood had originally concluded in 1900. To maintain stability and universality of current usage (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature: Article 75.6), we propose a neotype from the Antelope Valley of California as a replacement for Coues's holotype of longimembris.

AB  - Improving the housing of pregnant sows by giving them more space and access to deep straw had positive effects on their welfare, influenced their maternal behavior and improved the survival of their offspring. The present study aimed at determining whether these effects were actually due to environmental enrichment and whether the provision of straw pellets and wood can partly mimic the effects of straw bedding during gestation. Three graded levels of enrichment were used, that were, collective conventional pens on slatted floor (C, n = 26), the same pens with manipulable wood materials and distribution of straw pellets after the meals (CE, n = 30), and larger pens on deep straw litter (E, n = 27). Sows were then housed in identical farrowing crates from 105 days of gestation until weaning. Decreased stereotypies, blood neutrophils, and salivary cortisol, and increased behavioral investigation indicated that health and welfare of sows during gestation were improved in the E environment compared with the C environment. The CE sows responded as C or E sows depending on the trait. Piglet mortality rate in the first 12 h after birth was lower in E and CE litters than in C litters, but enrichment level during gestation had only small effects on lactating sow behavior and milk composition postpartum. On days 2 and 3 of lactation, E sows interrupted less often their nursing sequences than C and CE sows. On day 2, milk from both E and CE sows contained more minerals than that from C sows. In one-day-old piglets, the expression levels of genes encoding toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) and cytokines (interleukin-1, -6 and -10) in whole blood after 20-h culture, were greater in E piglets than in CE or C piglets. In conclusion, housing sows in an enriched environment during gestation improved early neonatal survival, probably via moderate and cumulative positive effects on sow behavior, milk composition, and offspring innate immune response. The gradation in the effects observed in C, CE and E housing environment reinforced the hypothesis of a causal relationship between maternal environmental enrichment, sow welfare and postnatal piglet traits.

AB  - The chloroplast genome of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch was sequenced to investigate intraspecific variations on the chloroplast genome. Its length is 127,689 bp long (34.3% GC ratio) with atypical structure of chloroplast genome, which is congruent to those of Glycyrrhiza genus. It includes 110 genes (76 protein-coding genes, four rRNAs, and 30 tRNAs). Intronic region of ndhA presented the highest nucleotide diversity based on the six G. uralenesis chloroplast genomes. A total of 150 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 10 insertion and deletion (INDEL) regions were identified from the six G. uralensis chloroplast genomes. Phylogenetic trees show that the six chloroplast genomes of G. uralensis formed the two clades, requiring additional studies to understand it.

AB  - Simple Summary: Carthritis encephalitis, caused by small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV), is a disease that develops with various signs in adult goats, e.g., arthritis, mastitis, and progressive weight loss, while in goat kids, the disease presents with only neuropathy and extremely rarely. The disease results in reduced milk production and economic losses in herds of goats. Previously described changes in single gene expression do not fully explain all the processes occurring in the infected goats. Therefore, the present study describes the first use of a transcriptomic array designed specifically for goats in Poland. Its aim was to investigate the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood nuclear cells from SRLV-seropositive and SRLV-seronegative goats using a custom-made Capra hircus gene expression array. Just four genes out of similar to 50,000 were found to have differential expression; moreover, changes in their expression suggest an active inflammatory mechanism in SRLV-seropositive goats at the early stage of SRLV infection.
   The immune response to a viral antigen causes inflammatory cell infiltration to the tissue, which creates a suitable environment for the replication of the virus in macrophages, and the recruitment of more monocytes to the site of infection, or latently infected monocytes. The aim of the study was to analyze the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood nuclear cells isolated from SRLV-seropositive and SRLV-negative goats at the peak of their first lactation. SRLV-seropositive goats were probably infected via colostrum. Custom transcriptomic microarrays for goats were designed and developed, namely the Capra hircus gene expression array, which features similar to 50,000 unique transcripts per microarray. Only four genes were differentially expressed, with up-regulated expression of the GIMAP2, SSC5D and SETX genes, and down-regulated expression of the GPR37 gene in SRLV-seropositive vs. SRLV-seronegative goats. However, in an RT-qPCR analysis, the result for the SETX gene was not confirmed. The differences in the expressions of the studied genes indicate an active inflammatory process in the SRLV-seropositive goats at the early stage of infection.

TI  - The outcome of an elephant translocation from Isiolo to Tsavo East National Park, Kenya
T2  - PACHYDERM
LA  - English
AB  - This management piece documents the outcome of an elephant translocation from Isiolo to Tsavo East National Park, Kenya in November 2021. The translocation aimed to reduce human-elephant conflict in the area and to prevent any retaliation toward the elephants. This was achieved by removing the 'problem elephant group', however the aim of resettling the elephants in Tsavo was not achieved, as the group fragmented and some swiftly moved far outside the release site. Two elephants, which we were able to monitor through satellite collars, exhibited homing behaviour and both left Tsavo East National Park within 1-7 weeks of being released. If translocation continues to be the method of choice for problem elephants, there is a need for thorough planning and sound science to inform future operations, which should include collaring of each individual. Trained personnel and substantial budgeting for post release monitoring, and any potential conflict-reduction interventions, are therefore key management considerations for ensuring the health and wellbeing of translocated elephants in the future. In the long-term, focusing mitigation management on a larger number of habitual crop-raiders will have more impact and be a more effective approach for elephant managers. This could involve better spatial land-use planning, maintenance of corridors between protected areas, negative conditioning tactics and maintenance and upgrading of barriers.

AB  - Haastia pulvinaris (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) is endemic to alpine ecosystems in the north-eastern mountains of the Southern Alps of Te Waipounamu - South Island of Aotearoa - New Zealand. Two varieties are currently recognised: H. pulvinaris var. pulvinaris and H. pulvinaris var. minor. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 37 specimens resulted in the discovery of distinct differences between these varieties in, amongst others, branchlet diameter, leaf shape and the presence of an apical style tuft. Their consistent and distinct differences, even in sympatry, are evidence that the two varieties should be recognised as species: H. pulvinaris and H. minor comb. et stat. nov. Descriptions and distribution maps of each species are provided, together with illustrations and an identification key to all species and varieties of Haastia.

AB  - Dry soil had a high electric resistance, and thus, electric fences are not always efficient in arid regions. When an animal standing on the ground touches the electric line, an electric circuit is formed and the animal gets shocked. Not only dry soil but also snow reduces the efficacy of electric fences. This is because liquid water is conductive, but solid snow is an insulator. However, the conductance of frozen soil is not studied enough. This study aims to investigate whether frozen soil reduces the effectiveness of electric fences and determines the electrical resistance of frozen soil. Four electric fences were installed on the forest edge in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan. From May 2021 to March 2022, two sensor cameras per fence were used to detect "probability of electrification" and "probability of intrusion into the fences." We treated from May to October 2021 and November 2021 to March 2022 as a non-frozen season (summer) and frozen season (winter), respectively. Results showed that in winter, the probability of electrification was decreased from 0.5 to 0.29 and the intrusion was increased from 0.03 to 0.07. When a pulsed current was applied, the electric conductance of frozen soil was reduced to 0.5% of that of the wet soil. Therefore, due to their reduced effectiveness in cold conditions, alternate grounding techniques for electric fences are required. For instance, the use of weed control sheet interwoven with stainless steel wire could be a practical solution.

AB  - Stress response caused by transportation is an important reason that affects the health and welfare of livestock, and the intelligent and precise monitoring of the stress state during transportation is a blank in research. On-site tracking experiments, literature review, and expert consultation indicate that environmental temperature, relative humidity and vibration intensity of vehicle are important stressors in the transportation process, and cortisol (COR) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are the key biomarkers to characterize the stress level. In this paper, stressors causing stress response were collected through environmental sensor network, and key biomarkers representing stress response were identified through biochemical analysis, and their change rules were analyzed and compared. Furthermore, the predictive models coupled with environmental parameters and stress markers were constructed through supervised learning networks. The results showed that: (1) After testing, the data collection performance of the multi-sensor network is reliable (P < 0.05); transportation will cause significant changes in the concentration of COR and ACTH (P 0.05); the simulation results of stress markers data have no significant difference compared with the sample data (PSpline PPchip > 0.90). (2) The validation results of models showed that: for COR, the absolute error and relative error based on general regression neural network (GRNN) are 2.59 +/- 0.16 ng/mL and 1.30 +/- 0.07%, respectively, which is better than the accuracy based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) and Elman neural network (Elman); for ACTH, the absolute error and relative error based on GRNN models were 1.75 +/- 0.13 pg/mL and 2.14 +/- 0.17%, respectively, which were better than the accuracy based on BPNN and Elman models. (3) For the prediction performance, the prediction accuracy of GRNN model for COR concentration is basically equal to that of Elman model, which is 0.17% higher than that of BPNN model for COR concentration, but the maximum relative error of BPNN model for COR concentration is the smallest. The prediction accuracy of Elman model for ACTH concentration is 0.09% higher than that of GRNN model, and 0.29% higher than that of BPNN model. But the maximum relative error of Elman model for ACTH concentration is the largest, and the running time is significantly longer. Although the performance of the three modeling methods is different, their overall accuracy has reached more than 97%. Therefore, this study can effectively identify the stress state of mutton sheep in the actual transportation process, and provide technical support for the health traceability and control of mutton sheep.

AB  - The paper analyses weights of 2,425 tusk pairs, and lengths of 398 pairs obtained between 1965 and 1969 from two East African savannah elephant populations, one in Uganda, the other in eastern Kenya and northeastern Tanzania. They are presented as averages in five-year age cohorts. Separately, length, weight and gender showed no significant differences between the use of the right and left tusks. If neural lateralization exists in elephants, it is concealed by the dynamics of tusk growth and wear, which are described. The fact that average asymptotes at age are only 31% (female) and 38% (male) of the theoretical asymptotes is explained by weathering and wear. Contrary to expectations that single tusks, having to do the work of two, would be shorter than the pair average, they are not, but stay within pair length parameters. Evidence is presented that declining tusk growth occurs in both sexes with advanced age. The longer-tusk pairs have a tight curvilinear relationship to average shoulder height, rising evenly from 24% (females) and 26% (males) under 6.5 years to 58% and 76% respectively in the oldest age classes. That is, they relate to an elephant's height.

TI  - Predation services: quantifying societal effects of predators and their prey
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Conservation of predators - especially large carnivores and those that potentially pose threats to humans - can be controversial among stakeholders who must coexist with them. What is often overlooked, however, are the direct and indirect ecosystem services and disservices predators provide as a result of consumption of herbivores ("predation services"). We used a theoretical predator-prey-economic model to examine when predators are likely to provide a net service to society, by comparing services/disservices to a predator-free counterfactual scenario. We found that net predator services were strongly dependent on how per-capita services and disservices of predators and prey changed with abundance (ie assumed marginal value [MV] functions of service/disservice). We suggest that further empirical research is needed into MVs of services/disservices of wildlife, because transferring net services among locations - a common practice - is problematic unless MV functions are known. Rigorously quantifying services/disservices of predators could improve conservation and management outcomes by increasing effective communication to diverse stakeholders.

AB  - Crops are more susceptible to insect herbivores than wild plants. It is generally considered that crops combining with farm practices tend to disrupt insect herbivore-enemy interactions. In this study, we compared the parasitism rate of the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis Walker by its specialized endoparasitoid wasp Cotesia chilonis Matsumura in cultivated rice Oryza sativa L. with that in the wild water-oat Zizania latifolia Griseb. The wild water-oat was never sprayed or fertilized. The parasitism rate was >10-fold higher in cultivated rice than in the wild water-oat. The difference was subsequently confirmed in a common garden experiment which the two host plants were interplanted in the same field. Laboratory assays indicated that female adults of C. chilonis did not discriminate the odors of cultivated rice and the wild water-oat. Larvae of C. chilonis did not develop differently within the haemocoele of the rice feeders and the wild water-oat feeders of the rice stem borer. However, the attack efficiency of C. chilonis significantly negatively correlated the thickness of stems in which the rice stem borers were dwelling. We conclude that cultivated rice has thinner stems than the wild water-oat, which is an important reason why the parasitism rate in cultivated rice is significantly higher than that in the wild water-oat. This finding may be just an exceptional case of the theory of the herbivore-enemy interactions in agroecosystems, but it implies that it is possible to enhance the control efficiencies in agroecosystems by designing appropriate crop phenotypes to promote the search and attack of natural enemies.

AB  - Context. Overabundant native wildlife can pose serious challenges for managers. The most direct, immediate way to reduce density-dependent impacts is by culling, but lethal control often lacks public support. Fertility control offers a non-lethal management alternative. Aims. We conducted two fertility-control projects on eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), a common and widespread species in Australia. We aimed to evaluate three key components of an integrated fertility-control project, namely, delivery efficiency, contraceptive efficacy and population-level outcomes. Methods. The two study sites on the urban fringe of Melbourne, Australia, were small reserves. Both had undergone an irruptive peak and subsequent crash, with negative impacts on animal health. Gresswell Forest (52 ha) is open forest habitat enclosed by a kangaroo-proof fence. Serendip Sanctuary (250 ha) is grassy woodland and retired pasture, with a boundary allowing kangaroo movement onto neighbouring properties. We captured kangaroos with a dart gun at night and treated all healthy adult females with subdermal levonorgestrel implants. Key results. Delivery efficiency (catch-per-unit effort) was greater from a vehicle at Serendip Sanctuary than on foot at Gresswell Forest, with only a marginal decline over successive nights at both sites. Background fecundity was 91% at Serendip Sanctuary, but close to zero at Gresswell Forest. Treatment efficacy was high, being 86-100% infertility at Serendip Sanctuary and 96-100% at Gresswell Forest. At Serendip Sanctuary, the proportion of females treated never reached 75%, whereas only one female at Gresswell Forest remained untreated after 3 years. Population density at Serendip Sanctuary exceeded the target range 3 years after culling and fertility control. No culling occurred at Gresswell Forest, but fertility control apparently held population density at a moderate level, albeit much higher than the density target. Conclusions. Future management at Serendip Sanctuary and Gresswell Forest will require a sustained fertility-control effort. Further culling may also be required to complement fertility control at Serendip Sanctuary, the larger, open site. Implications. Contraceptive efficacy of levonorgestrel is high in kangaroos and implants can be delivered efficiently, but achieving control of a large, open population will be challenging.

AB  - Conservation monitoring is paramount for the gathering of information on species and populations in need of conservation actions. However, monitoring of the mountain bongo Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci, a Critically Endangered antelope endemic to Kenya, has hitherto been limited to surveillance (i.e. focused on persistence of the species in particular areas), thus limiting the information that could be retrieved on the status and trends of these populations. Using a newly developed identification system, we implemented robust design mark-recapture using existing camera-trap records of four wild subpopulations of the bongo. We provide data on sex and age structure and the first estimates of population size in the wild. Males and calves seem to be suffering higher mortality than females, and only two of the four monitored populations include adults of both sexes and calves. The combined size of these two breeding populations is estimated to be 29-50. Our findings confirm the critical situation of the mountain bongo in the wild and highlight the need for conservation actions to reinforce the wild populations for the long-term conservation of this antelope.

AB  - The use of routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to potentially assess skeletal fragility has been widely studied in osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone texture attributes (TA) from routine lumbar spine (LS) MRI and their correlation with vertebral fragility fractures (VFF) and bone mineral density (BMD). Sixty-four post-menopausal women were submitted to LS densitometry, total spine radiographs, and routine T2-weighted LS MRI. Twenty-two TA were extracted with the platform IBEX from L3 vertebra. The statistical difference was evaluated using ANOVA and Duncan's post-test. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman's coefficient. Statistical significance was considered when Po0.05. The results did not show a significant difference in BMD between the women with and without fractures. Two bone TA (cluster tendency and variance) were significantly lower in the fracture group. Cluster tendency with VFF in osteopenia was 1.54 +/- 1.37 and in osteoporosis was 1.11 +/- 58. Cluster tendency without VFF in osteopenia was 2.23 +/- 1.38 and in osteoporosis was 1.88 +/- 1.14). Variance with VFF in osteopenia was 1.44 +/- 1.37 and in osteoporosis was 1.13 +/- 59. Variance without VFF in osteopenia was 2.34 +/- 1.38 and in osteoporosis was 1.89 +/- 1.14. There was a significant correlation between BMD and cluster prominence (r=0.409), cluster tendency (r=0.345), correlation (r=0.570), entropy (r=0.364), information measure corr1 (r=0.378), inverse variance (r=0.449), sum entropy (r=0.320), variance (r=0.338), sum average (r=-0.274), and sum variance (r=-0.266). Our results demonstrated the potential use of TA extracted from routine MRI as a biomarker to assess osteoporosis and identify the tendency of skeletal fragility vertebral fractures.

AB  - To explore heavy metal passivators with environmentally friendly, economical and effective properties is crucial for improving the security of sewage sludge for the land application. In this paper, the bone meal was selected as heavy metal passivator and added in different proportions for sewage sludge aerobic composting with a period of 40 d to investigate its passivation effect on zinc, chromium and lead, in which to reveal the mechanism. The results showed that the bone meal efficiently promoted the conversion of heavy metal speciation from effective form to stable form. When the proportion of bone meal was added at 10%, the proportion of zinc in residual form, chromium in residual form and lead in residual form respectively increased from 4.71 to 13.65%, 57.53-68.77% and 45.49-88.91%, the best heavy metal passivation was obtained for the composting. The residual samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it was found that zinc, chromium and lead in sewage sludge was transformed into phosphate minerals with high stability. In addition, the redundancy analysis between physicochemical parameters and heavy metal speciation indicated that phosphorus minerals formation in composting was positively related to the available phosphorus content, and the main influencing factor affecting the speciation conversion of heavy metals was organic matter.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO)-dependent pathways may play a significant role in the decline of synaptic and cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether NO in the hippocampal dentate gyms (DG) is involved in the spatial learning and memory impairments of AD by affecting the glutamate (Glu) response during these processes is not well-understood. Here, we prepared an AD rat model by long-term i.p. of D-galactose into ovariectomized rats, and then the effects of L-NMMA (a NO synthase inhibitor) on Glu concentration and amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were measured in the DG region during the Morris water maze (MWM) test in freely-moving rats. During the MWM test, compared with the sham group, the escape latency was increased in the place navigation trial, and the percentage of time spent in target quadrant and the number of platform crossings were decreased in the spatial probe trial, in addition, the increase of fEPSP amplitude in the DG was significantly attenuated in AD group rats. L-NMMA significantly attenuated the spatial learning and memory impairment in AD rats, and reversed the inhibitory effect of AD on increase of fEPSP amplitude in the DG during the MWM test. In sham group rats, the Glu level in the DG increased significantly during the MWM test, and this response was markedly enhanced in AD rats. Furthermore, the response of Glu in the DG during spatial learning was recovered by microinjection of L-NMMA into the DG. Our results suggest that NO in the DG impairs spatial learning and memory and related synaptic plasticity in AD rats, by disturbing the Glu response during spatial learning.

AB  - The adsorption of Malachite Green (MG) from aqueous solution was achieved using biochar derived from sheep manure pyrolyzed at 450 degrees C. Sheep manure biochar was characterized before and after adsorption of MG by SEM and FTIR. In addition, surface area measurement was performed by BET surface area and pore analyzer. The influence of contact time, pH, dose, temperature, and initial MG concentrations on the adsorption of MG onto sheep manure biochar (SMB) was investigated in experiments. Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Raduskevich isotherm models were used to analyze the data. Results assumed best fitting model is Langmuir isotherm model (R-2 value 0.99). Mean free adsorption energy (E) was obtained 94.71 kJ mol(-1), R-L value was between 0.013 and 0.14. That indicates monolayer, favorable, and physisorption adsorption, as well as an endothermic adsorption process. Maximum uptake value from Langmuir model obtained 208.33 mg g(-1). Surface area of SM biochar was 11.731 m(2) g(-1). NOVELTY STATEMENT This study is the first study on the adsorption of malachite green dye substance on sheep manure derived biochar. A natural and cheap adsorbent with high dye removal, such as 208,33 mg g(-1). A guiding study for the conversion of agricultural waste into products with highly added value.

AB  - The name "Cetartiodactyla" was proposed in 1997 to reflect the molecular data that suggested that Cetacea is closely related to Artiodactyla. Since then, that taxon has spread in popularity, even outside the scientific literature. However, the implications of the name are confusing, because Cetacea and Artiodactyla are not sister-taxa. Instead, the evidence clearly shows that cetaceans are a group embedded within Artiodactyla, not a sister-taxon of equal rank. It has long been accepted practice that systematists do not modify the names of higher groups when new subgroups are added to them. For example, Owen's original concept of Artiodactyla did not change its name when more and more disparate taxa were added to it. Dinosauria did not become "Avedinosauria" when it became clear that birds are a subgroup of dinosaurs, nor did Reptilia become "Avereptilia". In the interests of taxonomic priority and stability, and especially because the name is inherently misleading, we recommend that the name "Cetartiodactyla" be abandoned. If one wishes to make a reference to the fact that whales are now considered to be a subgroup of artiodactyls, they could be referred to informally as "whales and other artiodactyls" or "whales and terrestrial artiodactyls" without using a formal taxonomic name that is confusing and misleading.

AB  - Animal-borne devices including transmitters, data loggers and identification tags are widely used across taxa to address important biological and ecological questions. Some of these devices may affect fitness, hence studies to assess device impacts are important across taxa and developmental stages. We assessed the impact of satellite tagging on sea turtles at a foraging site in the Indian Ocean. Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) were captured, and satellite tags (Fastloc-GPS Argos) attached to 25 individuals between 2018 and 2021, with a mean straight carapace length (SCLn-t) of 55.3 +/- 6.9 cm (range = 47.9-69.5 cm; N = 21). We recaptured 12 tagged turtles and removed 11 tags between 2021 and 2023 and estimated growth rates of tagged (N = 10) and untagged (N = 44) animals (mean SCL range = 33.3-69.4 cm) using capture-mark-recapture of 54 individuals at liberty for 730-1095 days. Growth rates decreased exponentially as turtle size increased, and we found no significant difference between tagged and untagged growth rates and body condition. We also found no damage to the carapace from the tag attachment. We suggest that tagging does not impact growth rates at this study site because the turtles (i) typically maintain small home ranges in the lagoon and (ii) are benthic feeders, not actively pursuing prey. We encourage best practice to study the effects of satellite tagging on turtle populations around the world, as the outlook may be different for animals that swim long distances and/or carry large devices.

AB  - Plant metabolism response to insect herbivores is the central theme of this publication. Genetically uniform individuals of European aspen (Populus tremula) were exposed to recurrent feeding by spongy moths (Lepidoptera) at specific time intervals. Changes in physiology, contents of phenolics and saccharides were quantified over the first hour. The unconventional experiment design, integrating analytical methods, and timeline led to the revealing of unexpected dynamics in plant metabolism. The time interval between herbivory initiation and sample collection revealed a pivotal moment, with induced defense activating strongly after 5 min of chewing resulting in an increase in catechin and procyanidin B1. After 10 min, a shift to a tolerant strategy occurs and induced substance concentrations return to control levels. Delayed physiological response was recorded as the first significant difference in transpiration between affected and nonaffected plants and was found after 10 min. A different strategy in exploitation of saccharides after spongy moths infestation was applied because the pool of selected saccharides was rising in the leaves but decreasing in the roots. Placing our results in the context of existing knowledge highlights the uncertain conceptual basis behind the often rigid and definitive classifications in induced plant defense or tolerance strategy.

AB  - The unique environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau provides a great opportunity to study how primate intestinal microorganisms adapt to ecosystems. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenome analysis were conducted to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota in primates and other sympatric animal species living between 3600 and 4500 m asl. Results showed that within the same geographical environment, Macaca mulatta and Rhinopithecus bieti exhibited a gut microbiome composition similar to that of Tibetan people, influenced by genetic evolution of host, while significantly differing from other distantly related animals. The gut microbiota of plateau species has developed similar strategies to facilitate their hosts' adaptation to specific environments, including broadening its dietary niche and enhancing energy absorption. These findings will enhance our comprehension of the significance of primate gut microbiota in adapting to specific habitats.

AB  - Musk, a widely used ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities and holds significant value. Due to the limited yield of natural musk, which falls far short of market demand, muskrat musk is increasingly explored as a potential alternative. To investigate the microbial differences between natural musk and muskrat musk, this study extracted bacterial and fungal DNA from four sample types: natural musk (D1), muskrat musk (D2), immature musk during its peak period (S1), and allogeneic matured muskrat musk (S2). The Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and bioinformatics analysis were employed to construct 16S rDNA v3-v4 gene sequencing libraries and ITS1 sequencing libraries for 18 samples. While no significant differences were observed between D1 and D2, S1 and S2 exhibited lower microbial diversity. In contrast, fungal diversity showed no significant differences across all samples. According to PICRUSt2 analysis, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism were the most prominently represented functional categories in D2. Additionally, functional changes were observed in S2 compared to D1. Overall, the findings suggest that the musk gland in forest musk deer influences microbial composition during seasonal development, and the microbiota in the musk gland plays a crucial role in the maturation process of musk.

AB  - Sesamum alatum Thonn. is one of the less-popular but nutritious leafy vegetables that is still collected from the wild or as weeds among crops in South Africa. The plant is also used in medicines and cosmetics in Africa and elsewhere. Despite its importance, the cultivation of S. alatum under different agronomic systems for improved harvestable yield and nutrient content is still lacking. The study aimed to determine the response of S. alatum nutrient content to the application of poultry and goat manures. Plants were grown in pots under rain-fed shade cloth conditions, with poultry and goat manures applied at 0, 1, 2, and 3 t ha(-1) each, and they were laid in a completely randomized design. Shoot tips were harvested at 60 days after planting and analyzed for nutrient content. Shoots contained better nutrients in S. alatum plants grown during the first than the second season, with minor exceptions. Poultry and goat manure application led to an increase in Ca, Mg, K, P, and micro-nutrients. Goat manure had potential to increase the nutrient content in S. alatum than poultry manure, although differences were not substantial. Therefore, both manures could be equally used to improve nutrient content of S. alatum.

AB  - The mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion) is the largest wild terrestrial mammal of Cyprus. Regarded as the local flagship species, its population range is limited to the mountainous Paphos Forest and adjacent areas including part of Troodos National Forest Park (> 700 Km2). This species, protected by both national and international legislation, is classified as Endangered by the IUCN, with livestock intrusion, poaching and habitat loss as the main threatening factors. We determined the spatial genetic structure by investigating sexes separately and shed further light on the Cyprus mouflon placement among Ovis haplogroups (HGs) to enforce its protection within an adaptive conservation framework. We genotyped 108 samples collected across the entire species' range at both14 loci of the microsatellite DNA and the mitochondrial DNA Control Region (CR). Microsatellite genotyping indicated that the wild population retained low genetic variability, which, however, was not associated with a level of inbreeding raising particular concern (FIS = 0.12). An overall weak spatial genetic structure was disclosed, consistently with the limited extension of the mouflon range, the lack of significant physical barriers to dispersal and the intense gene flow mostly occurring along a northeast-southwest axis across the forest. Nevertheless, evidences of structure were found for females in compliance with their philopatric behaviour. The disclosure of unique features compared to Mediterranean and Near East conspecifics, such as the occurrence of a six-fold 76 bp-long repeated motif in the Cyprus mouflon CR, along with the outcome of a phylogenetic reconstruction (based on a far higher number of Ovis GenBank records and Cyprus haplotypes than in previous studies) inspired the proposal of a new haplogroup (HGC2) which included the Anatolian mouflon (O. g. anatolica, former HGX) as sister taxon. While both high habitat heterogeneity and low human disturbance were the main drivers in determining the overall spatial structure, future conservation efforts to preserve this valuable genetic resource should focus on avoiding possible introgressive hybridisation with co-grazing livestock to the edge of its range.

AB  - Mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream signaling pathways have been implicated in regulating postnatal development and functioning of rodent brain. However, the biological role of its precursor pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) in the postnatal brain remains unknown. The expression of hippocampal proBDNF was blocked in postnatal weeks, and multiple behavioral tests, Western blot and morphological techniques, and neural recordings were employed to investigate how proBDNF played a role in spatial cognition in adults. The peak expression and its crucial effects were found in the fourth but not in the second or eighth postnatal week. Blocking proBDNF expression disrupted spatial memory consolidation rather than learning or memory retrieval. Structurally, blocking proBDNF led to the reduction in spine density and proportion of mature spines. Although blocking proBDNF did not affect N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits, the learning-induced phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit level declined significantly. Functionally, paired-pulse facilitation, post-low-frequency stimulation (LFS) transiently enhanced depression, and GluN2B-dependent short-lasting long-term depression in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway were weakened. The firing rate of pyramidal neurons was significantly suppressed around the target region during the memory test. Furthermore, the activation of GluN2B-mediated signaling could effectively facilitate neural function and mitigate memory impairment. The findings were consistent with the hypothesis that postnatal proBDNF played an essential role in synaptic and cognitive functions.

AB  - Diabetic encephalopathy is related to serious damage to the Central Nervous System leading to several distur-bances in memory processing and emotions. It is known that the cyclic adenosine 3 ',5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) responsive element-binding protein (CREB) pathway participates in neuronal plasticity and prevention of neu-roinflammation, as well as the mediation of learning/memory processes and emotions in brain areas such as the hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We aimed to investigate the effect of acute (one injection) and long-term treatment (21 days) with roflumilast (ROF; i.p.; 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 mg/kg), a drug able to inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) responsible for cAMP hydrolysis, on parameters related to the acquisition of fear extinction memory and anxiety-like responses in animals with type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) induced through one injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg; ip; STZ animals). When we performed acute treatment, no difference was observed between all the groups when resubmitted to the same context paired with an aversive stimulus (footshock) or to a neutral context. In contrast, long-term treatment was able to improve learning of extinction fear memory and discriminating between a conditioned and neutral context. Moreover, this treatment decreased the pronounced anxiety-like response of STZ animals. In addition, there was an increase in the product of the CREB signaling pathway, the pro brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in the HIP and PFC of these animals. The treatment did not impair glycemic control, whereas it decreased the animal's blood glucose levels. To conclude, these findings suggest that ROF treatment repositioning has potential for future translational in-vestigations involving diabetic patients considering its beneficial effects on emotional processes related to fear memory and anxiety, in addition to improvement of glycemic control.

AB  - Caviomorph rodents have presented an astonishing size variation both in the past and present times. The objective of this work is to estimate the body mass of 32 extinct caviomorphs and to analyze how several factors influence estimates: (1) the predictors selected (i.e., individual teeth and toothrows); (2) the reference sample used (i.e., rodents, rodents + artiodactyls, or rodents + artiodactyls + perissodactyls + hyracoids + lagomorphs); and (3) the method employed (i.e., simple vs. multiple regressions and whether taxonomic abundance and phylogeny are considered or not). The results indicate that the best dental structures to predict body mass are usually the upper and lower toothrow, second upper and lower molar, and first upper molar. Including ungulates improves predictions for living large rodents but not for all living caviomorphs or for small rodents. Thus, we propose different sets of best models depending on the size range of the extinct caviomorph under consideration. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, especially taxonomically weighted OLS, performs better in most cases. Multiple regression, associating dental length and width, usually improves the mean of the prediction error with respect to simple regression models. Despite a probable redundancy between these variables, independent information would be sufficient to improve the prediction error. Our estimates from dental dimensions for large and giant chinchilloids are within the range of values previously reported when a cranial variable that is considered as a robust body size proxy is used. For small extinct caviomorphs, our estimates deviate more from published body mass values.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. In domestic pigs, ASF is a rapidly-progressing disease with a mortality rate reaching 100 %, causing tremendous economic loss in affected areas. ASFV is caused by African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), which is a large, enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Asfarviridae family. ASFV has a remarkably large genome size that encodes more than 150 open reading frames. Among the virally encoded enzymes, thymidine kinase (ASFV-TK) has been shown to be critical for the efficient replication and virulence of ASFV. Here, we report the bioinformatics analysis and biochemical characterization of ASFV-TK. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that ASFV-TK can be classified as a type II thymidine kinase. Kinetics characterization revealed a maximum velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis constants (Km) that are within the same range as previously characterized type II enzymes. ASFV-TK is competitively inhibited by the feedback inhibitor thymidine 5 '-triphosphate and can use 3 '-azido-3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) as a substrate with kinetics parameters comparable to those obtained with natural substrates, suggesting that nucleosides and nucleotide analogs could be explored as anti-ASFV agents.

AB  - Conflicts between humans and wildlife, particularly involving common leopards ( Panthera pardus ) and Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ) in the Himalayan region, pose significant challenges for both communities and conservation efforts. This study fills crucial gaps in existing research, extending beyond landscape-level predictors of these conflicts. By examining patterns of losses due to leopard and elephant encounters and assessing the effectiveness of coping strategies, along with socio-economic factors associated with these conflicts in the Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR), this study aims to inform more targeted policy approaches for forest communities. Conducting face-to-face interviews with 345 households across 10 forest villages in the BTR, the study revealed that leopards predominantly target cows during the day and goats during both day and night, while elephants raid crops, particularly during crucial agricultural phases like paddy transplantation and harvesting. Financial losses prompt the adoption of coping strategies, with traditional measures showing limited effectiveness. Visual deterrents like flashing bright LED torchlights for elephants and night lights for leopards prove more promising. Larger households with substantial livestock are more vulnerable to leopard attacks, and rice cultivation areas and the eastern division of the BTR face heightened elephant-related crop damage. The study recommends immediate measures like visual deterrents and long-term strategies such as sustainable livelihood support and habitat restoration to mitigate conflicts. Its global significance lies in advocating for tailored policies worldwide that balance conservation with livelihood protection.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of sperm concentration of boar semen doses on their capacity to maintain its motility over the thermo-resistance test (TRT; sperm resilience) and verified if the extender type (short or long-term) could influence this effect. Thirty ejaculates from five cross-bred mature PIC & REG; boars were used, and a factorial design was followed to produce semen doses with 1.5 billion cells in 45 or 90 mL, using Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) or Androstar & REG; Plus (APlus). Then, low-concentration doses (16.7 x 106 cells/mL in 90 mL) and higher-concentration doses (33.3 x 106 cells/mL in 45 mL) with BTS or APlus were produced and stored at 17 degrees C for 168 h. At 72 h, during the TRT, the low-concentration doses (16.7 x 106 cells/mL) lost three-fold less motility than doses with 33.3 x 106 cells/mL (P < 0.01), regardless of the extender type (11. 5% vs. 30.5% of initial motility, respectively). Similar results were found when the TRT was carried out at 168 h, with low-concentration doses losing two-fold less motility (11.4%) than highly concentrated doses (25.9%; P < 0.01). No sperm concentration effect was observed on membrane integrity or mitochondrial membrane potential (P & GE; 0.23). The osmolarity was not affected by the sperm concentration (P = 0.56), only by the extender and the storage time (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the sperm concentration effect on sperm quality was not influenced by extender type, and the data suggest that a low concentration of semen doses positively affects sperm resilience.

AB  - Simple Summary The detection of sub-fertile boars has been a difficult task, and despite their prevalence being low, its impact is very significant because it implies economic drawbacks for artificial insemination (AI) centers and farms. Unfortunately, some crucial reproductive processes fall beyond the routine analysis performed in the porcine model, such as sperm capacitation, which is a necessary event for fertilization. A synergistic action of bicarbonate (HCO3-) with calcium (Ca2+) is needed to achieve capacitation. The transport of Ca2+ is mediated by CatSper channels and Canonical Transient Potential Channels (TRPC). We quantified mRNA transcripts of different subunits of CatSper (beta, gamma and delta) and TRPC (1, 3, 4, 6 and 7) before and after in vitro capacitation by HCO3- ions. Our results showed that in vitro capacitation using HCO3- increases the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts of almost all subunits of Ca2+ channels, except CatSper-delta and TRPC1, which were significantly reduced. More studies are needed to elucidate the specific roles of the TRPC channels at a physiological and functional level. Sperm capacitation is a stepwise complex biochemical process towards fertilization. It includes a crucial early calcium (Ca2+) transport mediated by CatSper channels and Canonical Transient Potential Channels (TRPC). We studied the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts changes of the CatSper beta, gamma and delta subunits and TRPC-channels 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 in pig spermatozoa, after triggering in vitro capacitation by bicarbonate ions at levels present in vivo at the fertilization site. For this purpose, we analyzedfive5 ejaculate pools (from three fertile adult boars) before (control-fresh samples) and after in vitro exposure to capacitation conditions (37 mM NaHCO3, 2.25 mM CaCl2, 2 mM caffeine, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 310 mM lactose) at 38 degrees C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. In vitro capacitation using bicarbonate elicits an increase in the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts of almost all studied Ca2+ channels, except CatSper-delta and TRPC1 (significantly reduced). These findings open new avenues of research to identify the specific role of each channel in boar sperm capacitation and elucidate the physiological meaning of the changes on sperm mRNA cargo.

AB  - We report the first confirmed geographical occurrences of three species of leaf-nosed bats (family Phyllostomidae) in the Brazilian Caatinga, based on specimens collected in semideciduous forests and rupestrian grasslands of the Chapada Diamantina National Park. The new records include Artibeus anderseni, A. gnomus (Stenodermatinae), and Rhinophylla pumilio (Rhinophyllinae). Additionally, we expand the known distribution of five taxa previously recorded in other sectors of the Caatinga but either unknown in Bahia state or whose presence in this region is supported by few museum specimens: Uroderma magnirostrum, Micronycteris megalotis, M. minuta, M. sanborni, and Gardnerycteris crenulata. The new findings highlight the need for precise morphological diagnoses of voucher specimens in field surveys and geographical assessments of bat communities from the Caatinga, including the taxonomic revision of historical records. Previous records of species reported in transitional areas between this natural region and the Atlantic Forest suggest that, with additional sampling efforts in other areas, new species could be added to bat inventories in the dry ecosystems of northeastern Brazil.

AB  - Herbivores and omnivores have been shown to regulate their intake of nutrients to a balance that maximizes fitness. Predators were traditionally believed to have less need for dietary regulation than herbivores, given the higher nutritional quality of animal tissue compared to plants. However, some predators, like spiders, may feed on diverse prey that could vary substantially in nutrient content and, hence, their potential quality as food items. This study compared the nutrient intake of Carolina wolf spiders (Hogna carolinensis ) when they fed on cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) and crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus ). In diet trials, spiders were fasted prior to being offered a frog or cricket for consumption. Then, prey remains and nonconsumed (control) frog and cricket samples were analyzed for lipid, lean tissue, and elemental content. Results show that frogs and crickets vary substantially in the nutrients that they provide to spiders. Frogs offer less lipids but more lean tissue compared to crickets. Additionally, spiders consumed a greater mass of micronutrients when feeding on frogs compared to crickets. While some evidence suggests that lipids may be limited for some spider species, frogs may still be beneficial to spiders' diets because they offer an abundance of lean tissue. Future research should examine how environmental and physiological factors influence the nutritional quality of prey for predators.

AB  - During the Miocene, proboscideans reached their greatest diversification, and due to their marked evolutionary changes in dental size and morphology, they comprise an important biostratigraphic/biochronological tool. In this article, we study the proboscideans from the Late Miocene hominid locality Hammerschmiede (Germany), whose fossiliferous layers HAM 6, HAM 4 and HAM 5 are dated to 11.42, 11.44 and 11.62 Ma, respectively. The studied material consists of mandibular, tusk and cheek tooth specimens, which are attributed to the deinothere Deinotherium levius and the tetralophodont gomphothere Tetralophodon longirostris. An almost complete juvenile mandible of D. levius was CT-scanned and revealed that the erupting lower tusks represent the permanent ones. The mandible is most possibly associated with a lower deciduous tusk, and therefore these specimens capture the rare, and short in duration, moment of transition between deciduous and permanent lower tusks in fossil proboscideans and represent the first such example in deinotheres. The chronologically well-constrained proboscidean fauna from Hammerschmiede and the examination of other assemblages from European localities indicate that the coexistence of D. levius and T. longirostris characterizes the late Astaracian-earliest Vallesian, while Hammerschmiede may showcase the transition from the Middle Miocene trilophodont (Gomphotherium)-dominated faunas of central Europe to the Late Miocene tetralophodont-dominated ones. Finally, in order to decipher the dietary preferences of the Hammerschmiede Tetralophodon we performed dental mesowear angle analysis, which revealed a mixed-feeding diet with an important browsing component, significantly different from the heavily browsing one of Deinotherium known from other localities. Such distinct feeding habits between the taxa indicate niche partitioning, which allowed their sympatry.

AB  - Angiogenesis plays a vital role in the treatment of full-thickness wounds. Deferoxamine (DFO) has been employed to promote neovascularization, however, smart drug delivery systems are needed to optimize its utilization. In this study, an injectable extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking hydrogel (HOG@P&D) was developed by leveraging the dynamic Schiff base and hydrogen bonds among a chitosan derivative (HACC), oxidized alginate (OSA), gelatin, and DFO-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (P&D) for efficient wound healing. The incorporation of P&D enables HOG@P&D to respond to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, converting laser energy into heat to trigger an on-demand, rapid release of DFO, thereby effectively enhancing angiogenesis. In vitro tube formation assays revealed that the number of meshes in the HOG@P&D group was fourfold higher than that of the control group. Additionally, HOG@P&D exhibited superior mechanical properties, tissue adhesion, and injectability, allowing it to cover wounds seamlessly. This hydrogel also demonstrated antibacterial and antioxidant properties, creating a conducive microenvironment for wound healing. In vivo studies further confirmed that HOG@P&D promoted angiogenesis and mitigated inflammation by upregulating angiogenic growth factor expression, thereby accelerating full-thickness wound healing. This nanocomposite hydrogel shows significant potential as a high-performance wound dressing.

AB  - Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) are natural components with a variety of biological activities. However, the regulation of lipid metabolism by BCFAs is unknown. It was dedicated to examining the impacts of BCFAs inferred from yak ghee on the expression of qualities related to lipid metabolism, natural pathways, and intestinal microbiota in mice. The treatment group (purified BCFAs from yak ghee) exhibited a decrease in cholesterol levels; a decrease in HMGCR levels; downregulation of FADS1, FADS2, ACC-alpha, FAS, GAPT4, GPAM, ACSL1, THRSP, A-FABP, and PPAR alpha gene expression; and upregulation of SCD1, ACSS1, FABP1, CPT1, and DGAT-1 gene expression. Gut microbiota 16S rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the treatment group improved the gut microbiota by increasing the relative abundances and increasing the short-chain fatty acid levels produced by the genera Akkermansia, Clostridium, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, Anaerotaenia, and Prevotella. After adding BCFAs to cultured breast cancer cells, pathways that were downregulated were found to be related to fatty acid degradation and fatty acid metabolism, while 20 other pathways were upregulated. Our results suggest that BCFAs reduce body fat in mice by modulating intestinal flora and lipid metabolism and modulating fatty acid metabolism in breast cancer cells.

AB  - Matsumurasca onukii (Matsuda, R. (1952). Oyo-Kontyu Tokyo, 8(1): 19-21), one of the dominant pests in major tea production areas in Asia, currently is known to occur in Japan, Vietnam, and China, and severely threatens tea production, quality, and international trade. To elucidate the population genetic structure of this species, 1633 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 18 microsatellite markers (SSRs) were used to genotype samples from 27 sites representing 18 geographical populations distributed throughout the known range of the species in East Asia. Analyses of both SNPs and SSRs showed that M. onukii populations in Yunnan exhibit high-genetic differentiation and structure compared with the other populations. The Kagoshima (JJ) and Shizuoka (JS) populations from Japan were separated from populations from China by SNPs, but clustered with populations from Jinhua (JH), Yingde (YD), Guilin (GL), Fuzhou (FZ), Hainan (HQ), Leshan (CT), Chongqing (CY), and Zunyi (ZY) tea plantations in China and the Vietnamese Vinh Phuc (VN) population based on the SSR data. In contrast, CT, CY, ZY, and Shaanxi (SX) populations clustered together based on SNPs, but were separated by SSRs. Both marker datasets identified significant geographic differentiation among the 18 populations. Various environmental and anthropogenic factors, including geographical barriers to migration, human transport of hosts (Camellia sinesis [L.] O. Kuntze) and adaptation of M. onukii to various local climatic zones possibly account for the rapid spread of this pest in Asia. The results demonstrate that SNPs from high-throughput genotyping data can be used to reveal subtle genetic substructure at broad scales in r-strategist insects.

AB  - This study proposes and constructs a model for a closed-loop farming system (CLFS) for pig manure waste reuse under circular economy principles (CEPs) to optimize economic benefits. Pig farming produces waste that harms the ecological environment in Taiwan. However, few studies have focused on pig farming waste within the context of CEPs, where the resource utilization of pig manure waste and CLFS are the main concerns. This study introduces a CLFS with a farming production plan that enhances systematic efficiency and builds a framework for resource reuse, supporting a local living circle. The resource utilization of pig manure waste is integrated into the CLFS, ensuring that the entire pig raising production process operates within the system, maximizing waste utilization to increase economic benefits. A sensitivity analysis is also presented. The results confirm that all counties and municipalities in Taiwan achieved self-sufficiency in pork production, reaching a 100% satisfaction rate for pork demand, and feed prices did not impact the overall CLFS.

AB  - Atypical scrapie (AS) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that affects sheep and goats. Low within-flock incidence suggests that AS is not transmissible between animals, and testing of all animals that exit positive flocks for two years following detection (i.e., intensified monitoring) used to be carried out in the EU to provide data to test this. This intensified monitoring stopped in 2021 but continues in Great Britain (GB). The aim of this study was to predict the number of AS cases missed if this monitoring were also stopped in GB, using a combination of statistical and transmission modelling. The number of AS cases estimated to be missed if the intensified monitoring was stopped was low relative to the number of AS cases detected in other active surveillance streams (e.g., fallen stock and abattoir surveys), at approximately 1 case every 3 years (0.34 per year, 95% CI: 0.18-0.54) compared to 10 per year (95% CI: 4-17) in the active surveillance stream. This suggests that stopping the intensive monitoring of AS would have relatively little impact on AS surveillance and on the power of the available AS data to infer whether AS is contagious.

AB  - Aggression between unfamiliar commercial pigs is common and likely invokes strong emotions in contestants. Furthermore, contest outcomes affect subsequent aggressive behaviour, suggesting a potential lasting influence on affective state. Here we used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the emotional expression of pigs in agonistic encounters. We investigated how recent victory or defeat influences emotions expressed in a subsequent contest, and the role of aggressiveness as a personality trait in emotional expression. We observed the pre-escalation contest behaviour (second contest; age 13 wks) in animals of different aggressiveness (categorised using two resident intruder tests as Agg+ or Agg-, age 9 wks), which had recently won or lost a contest (first contest; 10 wks). We measured gaze direction and ear position. Observers watched video clips of the initial 30 s of the second contest and evaluated the emotional expression of 57 pigs (25 contest 1 winners, 32 contest 1 losers) using qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) with a fixed list of 20 descriptive terms.
   QBA identified three principal components (PCs), accounting for 68% of the variation: PC1 (agitated/tense to relaxed/content), PC2 (fearful/aimless to confident/enjoying) and PC3 (listless/indifferent). Agg- pigs and males showed a more positive emotionality (PC2). PC1 and PC3 were unaffected by first contest outcome and aggressiveness. Agg+ pigs were more likely to hold their ears back (X-2 = 7.8, p = 0.005) during the early contest period. Differences in attention were detected in the contest outcome x aggressiveness interaction (chi(2)4.3, p = 0.04), whereby approaching the opponent was influenced by winning and losing in the Agg- pigs only. QBA and gaze behaviour reveal differences in emotional valence between pigs of different aggressiveness: less aggressive pigs may be more susceptible to the emotional impact of victory and defeat but overall, more aggressive pigs express more negative emotionality at the start of agonistic encounters.

AB  - Piglet mortality is a major challenge in organic production and in recent years there has been increasing public concern about the level of animal losses before weaning. The main objective of this study was the analysis of the relative role of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for stillbirth in piglets of the world's widely represented breeds. A total of 2,817 litter records of productive parent sows were collected between 2010 and 2013. The following traits were estimated for each litter: the number of stillborn piglets per litter and the stillbirth rate, defined as the number of stillborn piglets divided by the total number of piglets born per litter. In addition, the proportion of litters with at least one stillborn piglet was determined also. The proportion of litters with at least one stillborn piglet for the study sample was 59.2%, indicating that the majority of sows exhibited the occurrence of at least one stillbirth. The mean number of stillborn piglets ranged from 0 to 15 head, with a mean of 1.40 +/- 0.03 head, and the range of stillbirth rates per litter was 0 to 100%, with a mean of 12.91 +/- 0.28%. The breed of the boar had a highly statistically significant impact on all piglet loss traits at birth employed in the analyses. The mean piglet losses estimates for the piglets born in the Large White boar litters were all found to be lower than those for the piglets born in the Duroc and Landrace boar litters. The year of farrowing also significantly influenced the observed traits, particularly for the number of stillborn piglets per litter and the stillbirth rate. The highest values were observed for litters born in February-March, while farrowing in May exhibited the lowest piglet losses at birth. Furthermore, the sows with the shortest gestation length (110 days) always had at least one stillborn piglet per litter. A significant increase in piglet mortality at birth was associated with an increase in total litter size, both at the level of individual sows and piglets per litter. The optimal average piglet birth weight value, at which piglet losses at birth were lowest, was 1700 g or more. Conversely, piglets with lower average piglet birth weight values exhibited a higher probability of dying at birth or immediately thereafter. As the variability in live birth weight of newborn piglets increased, there was a notable rise in the frequency of litters with at least one stillborn piglet. The lowest proportion of litters with at least one stillborn piglet values were observed in litters in which all newborn piglets had the same body weight at birth. The potential for research on stillbirth includes the analysis of its impact on the average daily growth rates and survival of piglets until weaning, as well as its effect on the development of performance, meat and carcass traits of fattening pigs.

AB  - In south Florida, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are the primary prey of the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). Deer populations in some regions of south Florida have declined in recent years, and the role of fawn survival and recruitment in these declines is unknown. Determining known-fate survival of fawns is challenging, requires invasive and costly methods, and often has a limited geographic scope. We deployed 180 cameras throughout the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and the Big Cypress National Preserve to understand how environmental variables influence fawn survival. We identified 271 fawns from 12,715 photographs in 2015 and 2016. We utilized a noninvasive sampling method coupled with a spatial capture-recapture model to estimate the number of fawns born, the spatial distribution of birth locations, and the number of fawns that survived to recruitment (180 days old) during two fawning seasons. We found strong evidence of temporal variation in survival, but little evidence of spatial variation. Within the 10,941-ha study area, we estimated that 305 (95% CI: 245-385) fawns were born in 2015 and 278 (212-381) fawns were born in 2016. In 2015, 36% (110) of the estimated 305 fawns survived to 180 days. However, in 2016, only 13% (36) of the estimated 278 fawns survived to 180 days. The large difference in recruitment between years was likely driven by record flooding in 2016. Our data suggest that extreme weather events, coupled with high adult mortality, likely contributed to recent deer population decline in south Florida through reduced fawn recruitment. Unlike studies of known-fate fawn survival that require labor-intensive and invasive capture of both adults and neonates, our approach relies exclusively on camera data, which makes it possible to conduct studies over broad spatiotemporal scales in challenging environments to illuminate the drivers of variation in juvenile survival.

AB  - The dietary crude protein level could affect ruminal fermentation parameters and the microflora of ruminants. The present study's aim was to investigate the effects of different protein level diets on ruminal morphology, fermentation parameters, digestive enzyme activity, microflora and metabolites of Tibetan sheep. Ninety weaned lambs (initial weight of 15.40 +/- 0.81 kg, 2 months old) were selected and randomly divided into three groups (six pens/treatment, five rams/pen). Dietary treatments were formulated with 13.03% (high protein, HP), 11.58% (moderate protein, MP) and 10.20% (low protein, LP), respectively. Compared with LP, both papillae length and papillae width were significantly promoted in HP and MP (p < 0.05). The concentrations of ammonia nitrogen, total VFAs, propionic acids and butyric acids in HP were significantly increased compared to those in MP and LP (p < 0.05). The activities of protease and alpha-amylase in HP were significantly greater than those of LP (p < 0.05). For the ruminal microbial community, higher proportions of phylum Prevotella 1 and Succiniclasticum and genus Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group and Ruminococcus 1 were observed in HP (p < 0.05). A total of 60 differential metabolites (DMs) (28 up, 32 down) between HP and MP; 73 DMs (55 up, 18 down) between HP and LP; and 65 DMs (49 up, 16 down) between MP and LP were identified. Furthermore, four pathways of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, tryptophan metabolism, bile secretion and ABC transporters were significantly different (p < 0.05). The abundance of phylum Prevotella 1 was negatively associated with stearic acid and palmitic acid but positively associated with the taurine. The abundance of genus Ruminococcus 1 was negatively associated with stearic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, Indole-3-acetamide and palmitic acid but positively associated with 6-hydroxymelatonin. In conclusion, a 13.03% CP level improved ruminal morphology, fermentation parameters and digestive enzyme activities through modulating the microbial community and regulating metabolism in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Over the past century, the Javan rhinoceroses' (Rhinoceros sondaicus) secluded nature and low population size have led to a gap in knowledge of their ecology. With fewer than 80 individuals surviving in a single population in West Java, Indonesia, the Javan rhinoceros is one of the most critically endangered mammals in the world. As part of a pilot bioacoustics study of the Javan rhinoceros in 2019, we systematically reviewed camera trap footage from the core Javan rhinoceros range in Ujung Kulon National Park (UKNP). In doing so, we discovered a previously unknown interaction between the Javan rhinoceros and the slender-billed crow (Corvus enca), in which the crow finds and eats ectoparasites from the rhinoceros (Figure 1). We describe this interaction and suggest that it may represent a cleaning mutualism with benefits for both the crow and the rhinoceros.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common mycotoxin that causes immunosuppression in pigs. Its effects on cellular metabolism remain unclear. In this study, we investigate DON-induced metabolic alterations in porcine alveolar macrophage cell line 3D4/21 using non-targeted metabolomics. MTT assays showed DON reduced cell viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed distinct metabolic profiles between control and DON-treated groups. Metabolomic analysis identified 127 differential metabolites (VIP > 1, p < 0.05), primarily in purine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and arginine-proline metabolism. Integration with transcriptomic data confirmed that these pathways play key roles in DON-induced immunotoxicity. Specifically, changes in purine metabolism suggested disrupted nucleotide synthesis and energy balance, while glutathione depletion indicated weakened antioxidant defense. These findings provided a systems biology perspective on DON's metabolic reprogramming of immune cells and identified potential therapeutic targets to reduce mycotoxin-related immunosuppression in swine.

AB  - The Uropeltidae, a family of small, fossorial snakes endemic to south Asia, are characterized by highly modified head and tail morphology. Their secretive nature has led to a dearth of research regarding intraspecific variation in morphology and tail function. Linear morphometrics of external size and shape and scale counts were combined with 3D geometric morphometric analysis of high-resolution computed tomography scans of crania and bony tail-shields to assess intraspecific morphological variation in 35 specimens of Rhinophis philippinus. Cranial and tail-shield shape differences are slight and subtle, though both exhibited significant allometry. Significant sexual dimorphism was found only in numbers of ventral scales, numbers of subcaudal scales, and tail length. There is no evidence of sexual dimorphism in head, cranial or tail-shield shape and size. It is hypothesized that strong functional constraints, induced by head-first burrowing in R. philippinus, have led to strong stabilizing selection in head and cranial shape, with functional constraints outweighing any influence of sexual selection. Lack of tail-shield sexual dimorphism (despite strong tail length dimorphism) suggests a common function in both sexes, likely related to predator avoidance and defense.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether or not kinship relations, and breed factors of Hamdani and Awassi sheep have an effect on the shape by using geometric morphometry method through their crania. For this purpose, heads of 7 adult Hamdani sheep and 10 adult Awassi sheep were used for the dorsal analysis of cranium and heads of 8 adult Hamdani and 9 adult Awassi sheep were used for lateral analysis of cranium. In the dorsal and lateral comparison of the breeds, the first principal component (PC1) explained 41.905% and 39.078% of the total shape difference, respectively. When the procrustes coordinates were examined, it was found that the samples were both dorsally and laterally mostly similar to the samples in their own group. Consequently, it is thought that the shape analysis of the crania of Hamdani and Awassi sheep breeds was made in detail by geometric morphometry method; thus, yielding the results that may be basic data for many disciplines, especially zooarchaeology, taxonomy, and forensic sciences were presented.

AB  - Simple Summary The growth rate of dairy goat farming is due to the special qualities of goat milk, which are directly determined by its composition. Goat's milk has a higher concentration of special fatty acids but less protein than cow's milk, which is why high-quality cheeses are made from goat's milk. Therefore, the goal of breeding dairy goats is not only to increase their milk yield but also to improve the quality composition of their milk. Karachai goats are a breed of local selection, the milk of which is widely used in the regions of the North Caucasus for the production of unique cheeses. While a relatively large number of genome studies have been carried out for transboundary goat breeds, such as Saanen goats, there is not yet enough research on local goat breeds. That is why we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the milk component traits of Karachai goats. The use of genomic evaluation in the selection of Karachai goats will increase the rate of breeding progress in terms of enhancing milk productivity traits and thereby increase the profitability of their use.Abstract This study is first to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the milk quality traits in Karachai goats. The objective of the study was to identify candidate genes associated with milk composition traits based on the identification and subsequent analysis of all possible SNPs, both genome-wide (high-confidence) and suggestive (subthreshold significance). To estimate the milk components, 22 traits were determined, including several types of fatty acids. DNA was extracted from ear tissue or blood samples. A total of 167 Karachai goats were genotyped using an Illumina GoatSNP53K BeadChip panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Overall, we identified 167 highly significant and subthreshold SNPs associated with the milk components of Karachai goats. A total of 10 SNPs were located within protein-coding genes and 33 SNPs in close proximity to them (+/- 0.2 Mb). The largest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was found on chromosomes 2 and 8 and some of them were associated with several traits. The greatest number of genome-wide significant SNPs was identified for crude protein and lactose (6), and the smallest number-only 1 SNP-for freezing point depression. No SNPs were identified for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Functional annotation of all 43 SNPs allowed us to identify 66 significant candidate genes on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 27. We considered these genes potential DNA markers of the fatty acid composition of Karachai goat milk. Also, we found 12 genes that had a polygenic effect: most of them were simultaneously associated with the dry matter content and fatty acids (METTL, SLC1A 8, PHACTR1, FMO2, ECI1, PGP, ABCA3, AMDHD2). Our results suggest that the genes identified in our study affecting the milk components in Karachai goats differed from those identified in other breeds of dairy goats.

AB  - Background Populations exhibit signatures of local adaptive traits due to spatial and environmental heterogeneity resulting in microevolution. The blue sheep is widely distributed across the high Asian mountains and are the snow leopard's principal prey species. These mountains differ in their evolutionary history due to differential glaciation and deglaciation periods, orography, and rainfall patterns, and such factors causes diversification in species. Methods and Results Therefore, we assess the phylogeographic status of blue sheep using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (220 bp) across the Indian Himalayan region (IHR) and its relationship with other populations. Of the observed five haplotypes, two and three were from the western Himalayas (WH) and eastern Himalayas (EH) respectively. One of the haplotypes from WH was shared with the population of Pamir plateau, suggesting historical maternal connectivity between these areas. The phylogenetic analyses split the blue sheep into two paraphyletic clades, and western and eastern populations of IHR were within the Pamir and Tibetan plateau clades, respectively. We observed a relatively higher mean sequence divergence in the EH population than in the WH. Conclusion We propose five 'Evolutionary Significant Units' across the blue sheep distribution range based on observed variation in the species' ecological requirements, orography, climatic conditions, and maternal lineages, viz.; Western Himalaya-Pamir plateau (WHPP); Eastern Himalaya-Tibetan plateau (EHTP); Qilian mountains; Helan mountains and Hengduan mountains population. Despite the small sample size, population divergence was observed across the IHR, therefore, we suggest a transboundary, collaborative study on comparative morphology, anatomy, ecology, behaviour, and population genetics using harmonized different genetic markers for identifying the overall taxonomic status of the blue sheep across its range for planning effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Camellia oleifera C.Abel is an important oilseed crop. While germplasm resources have been widely collected and conserved, their genetic diversity remained to be explored effectively. Therefore, genomic libraries were constructed and sequenced, and all clean reads were assembled into 673,863 unigenes. In total, 27,953 SSRs were detected from all the unigenes, and 17,517 SSR primer pairs were successfully designed. Furthermore, we re-evaluated the genetic diversity of the germplasm bank of C. oleifera using 22 SSR markers. The number of alleles (Na), the effective number of alleles (Ne), the Shannon index (I), the polymorphic information index (PIC) ranged from 4 to 25 (mean of 11.41), 2.014 to 9.284 (mean of 4.800), 0.716 to 2.471 (mean of 1.682), 0.380 to 0.883 (mean of 0.717), respectively. Finally, a core collection consisting of 45 samples (15% of the 300 trees in the entire germplasm bank) was developed, the genetic diversity parameters of which showed nonsignificant differences from the entire germplasm bank. Genomic SSR development, the re-evaluation of genetic diversity and the development of a core collection from the germplasm bank in this study provided useful tools, abundant genetic resources and an effective collection for the utilization and deep exploration of C. oleifera.

AB  - Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction during 2013-2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm pond (25 m x 20 m x 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops (groundnut-barley and sorghum-chickpea), agrihorticulture [Ziziphus mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum-Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module produced 4979 kg ha(-1) barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame, fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655 US$ year(-1) net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year(-1) under intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net returns increased by 36 and 226% with the inclusion of goat under intensive (US$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US$ 2136), respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations. Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to 200%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting, agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics.

AB  - Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) are the largest extant predatory lizards and their ziphodont (serrated, curved and blade-shaped) teeth make them valuable analogues for studying tooth structure, function and comparing with extinct ziphodont taxa, such as theropod dinosaurs. Like other ziphodont reptiles, V. komodoensis teeth possess only a thin coating of enamel that is nevertheless able to cope with the demands of their puncture-pull feeding. Using advanced chemical and structural imaging, we reveal that V. komodoensis teeth possess a unique adaptation for maintaining their cutting edges: orange, iron-enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips. Comparisons with other extant varanids and crocodylians revealed that iron sequestration is probably widespread in reptile enamels but it is most striking in V. komodoensis and closely related ziphodont species, suggesting a crucial role in supporting serrated teeth. Unfortunately, fossilization confounds our ability to consistently detect similar iron coatings in fossil teeth, including those of ziphodont dinosaurs. However, unlike V. komodoensis, some theropods possessed specialized enamel along their tooth serrations, resembling the wavy enamel found in herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaurs. These discoveries illustrate unexpected and disparate specializations for maintaining ziphodont teeth in predatory reptiles.
   Chemical and structural imaging of Komodo dragon teeth reveals that they maintain their sharp cutting edges through iron-enriched coatings, a unique adaptation compared with theropod dinosaurs (for which they have previously been used as an extant model).

AB  - More widespread farming of species not typically used as livestock may be part of a sustainable approach for promoting human health and economic prosperity in a world with an increasing population; a current example is peccary farming in the Neotropics. Others have argued that species that are local to a region and which are usually not farmed should be considered for use as livestock. They may have a more desirable nutrient profile than species that are presently used as livestock. It may also reduce the pressure from hunting on other wild species, and cause less environmental damage than exotic species. We propose a sentiocentric utilitarian framework that could be used to decide whether species that are local, but generally not used as livestock, should be farmed. To illustrate the use of our decision-making framework, we employ two contrasting neotropical case studies: the Spotted Paca (Cuniculus paca) and the Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). We argue that it may be acceptable to use non-sentient species that are typically not farmed as livestock. However, research should determine whether farming them offers human, environmental or sustainability benefits. In addition, we recommend that if invertebrate species are considered for farming, research should be conducted to determine the likelihood that they are sentient. Finally, given the ethical failings of current livestock farming practices, we argue that a high bar must be met if 'new' species that are sentient are to be farmed.

AB  - Swine manure management and storage have been implicated as major sources of increasing agricultural ammonia (NH3) emissions resulting in increased ammonium deposition in North Carolina. This study was conducted to establish how improvements in manure and animal management have affected lagoon nutrient loading and subsequent NH3 emissions determined from measured lagoon chemistry and climate data. Archived lagoon chemistry analyses from 182 farm lagoons (106,000 sample analyses) were used to evaluate trends in lagoon chemical properties. Process and empirical (statistical) NH3 volatilization models were used with the data to calculate changes in NH3 emissions from 2001 through 2018. Lagoon nutrient trends for finisher and sow farms showed that annual averages of nutrients had decreases ranging from 18 to 93%, except for a 41% increase in copper for finisher primary lagoons. Because of reduced nitrogen and pH in the lagoons, a process model of NH3 emissions suggested decreases from primary lagoons of 49 and 25% from finisher and sow farm lagoons, respectively. Empirical (statistical) models predicted even larger relative NH3 decreases (up to 54%).

AB  - Wheat is a staple crop and one of the most widely consumed grains globally. Wheat yields can experience significant losses due to the damaging effects of herbivore infestation. However, little is known about the effect aphids have on the natural diurnal rhythms in plants. Our time-series transcriptomics and metabolomics study reveals intriguing molecular changes occurring in plant diurnal rhythmicity upon aphid infestation. Under control conditions, 15,366 out of the 66,559 genes in the tetraploid wheat cultivar Svevo, representing approximately 25% of the transcriptome, exhibited diurnal rhythmicity. Upon aphid infestation, 5,682 genes lost their rhythmicity, while 5,203 genes began to exhibit diurnal rhythmicity. The aphid-induced rhythmic genes were enriched in GO terms associated with plant defense, such as protein phosphorylation and cellular response to ABA and were enriched with motifs of the WRKY transcription factor families. In contrast, the genes that lost rhythmicity due to aphid infestation were enriched with motifs of the TCP and ERF transcription factor families. While the core circadian clock genes maintain their rhythmicity during infestation, we observed that approximately 60% of rhythmic genes experience disruptions in their rhythms during aphid infestation. These changes can influence both the plant's growth and development processes as well as defense responses. Furthermore, analysis of rhythmic metabolite composition revealed that several monoterpenoids gained rhythmic activity under infestation, while saccharides retained their rhythmic patterns. Our findings highlight the ability of insect infestation to disrupt the natural diurnal cycles in plants, expanding our knowledge of the complex interactions between plants and insects.

AB  - Knowledge of elephant movement and grouping patterns in the wild is critical for their management and conservation. Much of these data come from GPS collar data and aerial surveys, which have provided invaluable information, but data from these methods are often limited to small groups or entire populations. Effective elephant management requires both generalized and localized methodologies. Here, we propose the expanded use of camera traps in research relating to elephant localized movements and grouping patterns as an additional tool for elephant conservation management. In this study, we use a battery-powered camera trap to provide daily high-resolution data of African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) grouping patterns over the course of an entire year. We present findings on the seasonal and diurnal grouping patterns of elephants at a waterhole in the northeast corner of Etosha National Park from July 2016 to June 2017. The frequency of elephant occurrences varied seasonally and diurnally across all group types (solitary male, male, family, and mixed groups), while group sizes did not vary seasonally, except for male groups. Solitary males occurred relatively equally throughout the day, while male and mixed groups occurred the most midday, and family groups occurred the most in the afternoon. Additionally, we measured the reliability of research assistants when collecting group type and group size data from the camera trap images. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was excellent among and across research assistants, highlighting the potential for non-specialist observers to have greater involvement in camera trap data collection. Our results support the use of camera trap data where GPS collars and aerial surveys are not feasible and where higher-resolution data are needed for more localized management. Finally, we discuss our experience with two different types of camera traps to highlight the pros and cons of each approach.

The present study documents the first occurrence of H. patagonicus in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, where it was taken as a fishery bycatch. They were caught in gillnets and had been preserved by the fishermen in absolute alcohol. The females were in reproductive stage 3, which indicates that they may migrate to Guanabara Bay to reproduce.

AB  - The application of clay minerals facilitates the bioavailability of heavy metals and the humification in livestock manure composting. However, whether the humification plays a critical role in the bioavailability of heavy metals is still unclear. Here, with the addition of sepiolite (SEP), the fractions of Cu and Zn, and the spectral characteristics of humic acids (HAs) during aerobic pig manure composting were investigated. The SEP-amended composting had a decreased peak temperature and an increased electrical conductivity, regardless of the SEP dosage. The seed germination index increased by 15.9 & PLUSMN; 0.5% (p < 0.05) with the appropriate dosage of SEP (6%), indicating a higher maturity and a lower phytotoxicity of the SEP-amended compost. The addition of SEP reduced the water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) content and increased the percentage of HAs by 2.8-10.7%. More interestingly, during SEP-amended composting, the reducible fraction of heavy metals was transformed into the oxidizable fraction, and the bioavailability of Cu and Zn decreased by 11.0-15.9% and 15.4-26.5%, respectively. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra and fluorescence spectra analyses showed that the SUVA254 and complex fluorescent components of HAs in the SEP-amended composting increased by 4.4-15.8% and 1.2-9.0%, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) further confirmed that the addition of SEP increased the aromatic index and percentage of carbonyl-carboxyl C of HAs by 3.4-8.3% and 4.6-5.7%, respectively. The redundancy analyses (RDA) described the SUVA254, aromatic index and carbonyl-carboxyl C of HAs had a strong positive correlation with the oxidizable fraction of heavy metals, which was further confirmed by variance partitioning analysis (VPA). Overall, this work suggested that the HAs structure play an important role in the bioavailability of Cu and Zn during SEP-amended composting, potentially providing safe organic fertilizer.

AB  - Mites from the Demodecidae and Psorergatidae can optimally use mammalian hosts by inhabiting a number of different microhabitats in their skin. Hence, in individual hosts, several species of parasites from these groups have been described in different microhabitats. There are few data on their co-occurrence either at the host species level or at the host individual level. Most research has addressed the co-occurrence of Demodecidae in carnivorans, ungulates, soricomorphs, and rodents, while the co-occurrence of both families was found in bats. The present study examines the possibility of their co-occurrence in a Eurasian rodent-Apodemus flavicollis. It is a suitable model for such analyses, because representatives of both families have been demonstrated here so far, and our findings extend the list of specific Demodecidae in A. flavicollis with two new species: Demodex tenuis sp. nov. from the lip region and D. mediocris sp. nov. from the chin region. The study also includes the first record of Psorergates muricola in this host, which occurred in the genital-anal region. Therefore, the findings confirm the possibility that different Demodecidae and Psorergatidae species can co-occur in the same host in different body regions. This paper also includes a checklist of Demodecidae and Psorergatidae in rodents around the world.

AB  - Obligate mutualistic plant-ants are often constrained by their plant partner's capacity to provide resources. However, despite this limitation, some ant partners actively reject potential prey items and instead drop them from the plant rather than consuming them, leaving the ants entirely reliant on host plant-provided food, including that provided indirectly by the symbiotic scale insects that ants tend inside the plants. This dependency potentially increases the efficiency of these ants in defending their host. We hypothesize that if this ant behavior was beneficial to the symbiosis, prey rejection by ants would be observed across multiple plant host species. We also hypothesize that plant-provided food items and symbiotic scale insects from other ant plants should be rejected. We address these hypotheses in the Crematogaster ant-Macaranga plant system, in which plants provide living space and food, while ants protect plants from herbivory. We observed food acceptance and rejection behavior across five ant species and three plant host species. Ants were offered three types of food: termites as a surrogate herbivore, symbiotic scale insects, and nutritious food bodies (FB) produced by different host plant species. The unique ant species living in M. winkleri was the most likely to reject food items not provided by the plant species, followed by ants in M. glandibracteolata, while ants in M. pearsonii accepted most items offered to them. Using stable isotopes, chemical cues, and proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that this behavior was not related to differences between plant species in nutritional quality or composition of FB. Isotopic signatures revealed that certain species are primary consumers but other ant species can be secondary consumers even where surrogate herbivores are rejected, although these values varied depending on the ant developmental stage and plant species. Macaranga pearsonii and M. glandibracteolata, the two most closely related plant species, had most similar surface chemical cues of FB. However, M. glandibracteolata had strongest differences in food body nutritional content, isotopic signatures, and protein composition from either of the other two plant species studied. Taken together we believe our results point toward potential host coercion of symbiont ants by plants in the genus Macaranga Thouars (Euphorbiaceae).

AB  - Foraging by wildlife on anthropogenic foods can have negative impacts on both humans and wildlife. Addressing this issue requires reliable data on the patterns of anthropogenic foraging by wild animals, but while direct observation by researchers can be highly accurate, this method is also costly and labor-intensive, making it impractical in the long-term or over large spatial areas. Camera traps and observations by guards employed to deter animals from fields could be efficient alternative methods of data collection for understanding patterns of foraging by wildlife in crop fields. Here, we investigated how data on crop-foraging by chacma baboons and vervet monkeys collected by camera traps and crop guards predicted data collected by researchers, on a commercial farm in South Africa. We found that data from camera traps and field guard observations predicted crop loss and the frequency of crop-foraging events from researcher observations for crop-foraging by baboons and to a lesser extent for vervets. The effectiveness of cameras at capturing crop-foraging events was dependent on their position on the field edge. We believe that these alternatives to direct observation by researchers represent an efficient and low-cost method for long-term and large-scale monitoring of foraging by wildlife on crops.

AB  - Incidental catch of seabirds (bycatch) in fisheries has been identified as a major threat to the conservation of seabird populations. Acquiring accurate, detailed data on seabird bycatch is an ongoing challenge to effective integrated ecosystem management of commercial fisheries. To collect detailed data on seabird bycatch in the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides Walbaum, 1792) fishery in northern Canada, we applied two voluntary effort methods with industry partners that asked for additional, detailed information about the nature of the interactions between seabirds and the fishing gear than the data standardly reported in the fishery. We found that the amount of bird bycatch reported in both enhanced datasheets completed by at-sea observers (ASOs) and carcass collections yielded different results when compared to the typical seabird bycatch reporting in the fisheries ASO database. Across three years of data collection (2016, 2018, and 2019), the number of seabirds reported using the enhanced data collection methods were 0.5-11-fold the number from typical ASO database values. We then used these data to model how the differences between data sources may fluctuate across years. These large discrepancies between the methods highlight the challenges with obtaining accurate seabird bycatch data needed to implement a meaningful ecosystem approach to the management.

AB  - BACKGROUNDCorn is one of the main crops grown globally to produce food for human consumption and animal feed, including raw materials for bioenergy. Effective pest management is critical for the economic viability of corn production. The leafhopper Dalbulus maidis and the diseases transmitted by it have become relevant to corn production. Our study aimed to determine environmental parameters that affect D. maidis populations and the impacts of pathogen dispersion on corn productivity under different rotation systems and sowing seasons. RESULTSThe population density of leafhoppers found in the studied crops was low but capable of establishing the diseases and spreading them widely in the crops. The leafhopper's highest occurrence was in the corn vegetative development stage, and its population peaks were earlier in the corn off-season. The incidence of maize rayado fino virus and maize bushy stunt phytoplasma were higher in corn off-season than in the growing season. The incidence of diseases was higher in the final stages of the cultivation cycle. Yield losses were significantly higher for maize bushy stunt phytoplasma and not significant for maize rayado fino virus. CONCLUSIONOur study observed that corn's physiological stage was the main factor influencing D. maidis dynamics. The occurrence of D. maidis at low densities was sufficient to ensure the efficient transmission and dissemination of maize rayado fino virus and maize bushy stunt phytoplasma, which had a higher incidence in the reproductive stage and the corn sowed off-season.

AB  - Goat caseins are highly polymorphic proteins that affect milk functional properties. In this study, an in silico approach was employed to analyze the influence of goat casein allelic variants on the quantity and bioactivity potential of peptides released after enzymatic hydrolysis. The reported protein sequences from the most frequent allelic variants in Capra hircus caseins (alpha-S1, beta, alpha-S2, and kappa-casein) were analyzed in the BIOPEP-UWM database to determine the frequency of occurrence of bioactive fragments from each casein. After specific hydrolysis with pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin A, important differences in the peptide profile and bioactivity potential were observed within and between the casein allelic variants. The beta-casein A and C alleles, alpha-S1-casein allele E, and alpha-S2-casein allele F presented the highest bioactivity potential, and some allele-specific peptides were also released, highlighting the impact of genotype on the predicted bioactivity. The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activities was the most frequent bioactivity of the released peptides, suggesting possible antihypertensive and antidiabetic effects. Once confirmed by experimental studies, the use of goat casein genotyping could direct efforts to enhance the functional quality of goat milk.

AB  - Plant domestication and soil heavy metal pollution alter plant-insect interactions and influence bottom-up and top-down effects. However, their combined effect on plants, herbivores, and parasitoids remains unclear. Here, we selected three soybean genotypes, namely wild N23312, landrace N28386, and cultivated Xiangdou 33, from the same region and examined the combined effects of soybean genotype and lead (Pb) on soybeans, the herbivore Spodoptera litura, and its parasitoid Meteorus pulchricornis. The effects of soybean genotype, Pb, and their combination significantly affected soybean nutrition and defense compounds, as well as the fitness of S. litura and M. pulchricornis, along with parasitoid host selection. Pb stress decreased soybean soluble protein and sugar contents, increased trypsin inhibitor and leaf Pb contents, and extended the developmental period of S. litura while simultaneously reducing its survival and body weight. Pb stress reduced M. pulchricornis cocoon weight, adult longevity, hind tibial length, and offspring fecundity and extended the parasitoid developmental period. Pb stress primed soybean plant defenses and the effects varied significantly among soybean genotypes. The wild genotype was affected the most, followed by the landrace and cultivated genotypes, which negatively affected S. litura and M. pulchricornis. Meteorus pulchricornis exhibited a preference for S. litura larvae in Pb-stressed soybeans, with preference ranking from wild to landrace to cultivated genotypes. The findings enhance our understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying plant-insect interactions under domestication and environmental stress.

AB  - Individual diet specialization, where individuals within a population exhibit distinct dietary patterns, can be influenced by shifts in ecological opportunity. One underexplored avenue of research is in investigating whether individuals switch foraging strategies (e.g., shifting from herbivory to frugivory) when ecological opportunity provides a pulse of limiting resources, such as fleshy fruits. This study investigates the influence of seasonal frugivory on diet consistency and specialization among generalist herbivores, specifically the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), in southeastern Florida, USA. We hypothesized that increased frugivory during the wet season (June through November), coinciding with a resource pulse of fleshy fruits, leads to more inconsistent and specialized diets. Using radio telemetry to track individual tortoises and analyzing dissected fecal samples grouped into functional food categories, we applied Bayesian hierarchical modeling to examine diet consistency and specialization. Our results indicated that higher frugivory levels in the wet season correlate with greater diet inconsistency and specialization compared to the dry season. This pattern suggests that gopher tortoises may switch foraging strategies to exploit seasonal resource pulses of fleshy fruit, thus adopting more inconsistent and specialized diets. Additionally, important activities in the life history of the gopher tortoise, such as copulation, home range defense, and burrow construction, coincide with periods of increased fruit consumption and dietary inconsistency/specialization. Increased intake of carbohydrates and digestible energy from fleshy fruits may allow for more time in the tortoise's activity budget for these activities. Finally, by elucidating the relationship between seasonal frugivory and diet consistency/specialization, this research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms shaping ecological dynamics at the intraspecific level which can subsequently influence communitylevel interactions such as animal-mediated seed dispersal.

T2  - PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - IMMOBILIZATION
KW  - ZOLAZEPAM
AB  - There is often considerable social media commentary on whether remnant kangaroo populations in urban areas should be euthanased or translocated. Here, we describe a translocation program in Western Australia where kangaroos were herded into a temporary enclosure, darted, sedated, and translocated to a site in the State Forest east of the Swan Coastal Plain where they were released after 24 h. Prior to darting and after being initially herded into a temporary holding enclosure, kangaroos were repeatedly released from the enclosure by members of the public. Sixty-three of 154 adult kangaroos and 20 of 52 pouched young (40.3%) died or were euthanased before being released from the translocation release enclosure. The total volume of the sedative Zoletil (mL kg(-1)) injected into kangaroos as a sedative was significantly higher in those that survived than those that died. The primary conclusion from this management program was that the western grey kangaroos were susceptible to capture myopathy and distressed animals are at a greater risk of not surviving a translocation program. In our professional judgement, from an animal welfare perspective, these kangaroos should have been euthanased and not translocated. Such scientific advice and professional experience should inform future decisions regarding management of remnant kangaroo populations.

AB  - Environmental chemical (EC) exposure may be impacting male reproductive health. The translationally relevant biosolids treated pasture (BTP) sheep model was used to investigate gestational low-level EC mixture exposure on the testes of F1 male offspring. Adult rams from ewes exposed to BTP 1 month before and throughout pregnancy had more seminiferous tubules with degeneration and depletion of elongating spermatids, indicating possible "recovery" from previously reported testicular dysgenesis syndrome-like phenotype in neonatal and pre-pubertal BTP lambs. Expression of transcription factors CREB1 (neonatal) and BCL11A and FOXP2 (pre-pubertal) were significantly higher in the BTP exposed testes, with no changes seen in adults. Increased CREB1, which is crucial for testes development and regulation of steroidogenic enzymes, could be an adaptive response to gestational EC exposure to facilitate the phenotypic recovery. Overall, this demonstrates that testicular effects from gestational exposure to low-level mixtures of ECs can last into adulthood, potentially impacting fertility and fecundity.

AB  - Simple Summary: Long-duration transportation of goats can cause significant changes in their behavior and physiology that could compromise their welfare. This study was conducted to determine if repeated exposure to livestock trailers can be beneficial in reducing stress responses due to prolonged transportation in goats. A total of 168 uncastrated male Spanish goats were divided into groups and maintained on two identical paddocks. One group was fed a concentrate supplement inside two livestock trailers for 4 weeks, and the other group was fed the same diet in the feeding area with no trailers. After the habituation period, the goats were transported for 10 h in four replicates, and blood samples were collected every two hours to evaluate stress responses. Phenylethylamine and 5-methoxytryptamine concentrations were significantly higher in the group habituated to trailers compared to the group not habituated to trailers. Dopamine, 5-methoxytryptamine, and metanephrine concentrations were significantly influenced by transportation time. The blood biogenic amine concentrations indicate that the habituation of goats to livestock trailers may be beneficial during transportation for long periods.
   This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of habituation to livestock trailers on stress responses in goats transported for long periods. Intact male Spanish goats (12-month old; BW = 31.6 +/- 0.34 kg; N = 168) were separated into two treatment (TRT) groups and maintained on two different paddocks. Concentrate supplement was fed to one group inside two livestock trailers (5.0 x 2.3 m each; habituated group, H), while the other group received the concentrate supplement, but not inside the trailers (non-habituated, NH). After 4 weeks of habituation period, goats were subjected to a 10-h transportation stress in four replicates (n = 21 goats/replicate/TRT). Blood samples were collected by a trained individual by jugular venipuncture into vacutainer tubes before loading (Preload), 20 min after loading (0 h), and at 2-h intervals thereafter (Time) for analysis of stress responses. There was a tendency for a TRT effect (p < 0.1) on tyramine and metanephrine concentrations. Phenylethylamine and 5-methoxytryptamine concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the H group compared to the NH group. Both dopamine and 5-methoxytryptamine concentrations decreased (p < 0.05) with transportation time; however, TRT x Time interaction effects were not significant. Habituation to trailers may be beneficial in mood and energy stabilization in goats during long-distance transportation.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis), one of the world's most popular beverages, plays a vital role in socioeconomic development. However, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from tea plantation soils have become a serious environmental issue, largely due to soil acidification and excessive N fertilizer inputs. Despite this, there is still a knowledge gap in determining how much nitrification and denitrification contribute to overall N2O emissions in tea plantation soils, which makes it difficult to make focused mitigation strategies. Here, we utilized 15N isotope labeling experiments to probe into the contribution of various microbial pathways to N2O emissions of tea plantation soils across seven major tea-producing provinces in China. We assessed soil properties, microbial diversity and composition, N2O production-and-reduction-related functional gene abundances, and keystone species abundances to probe into driving mechanisms influencing N2O sources. The results revealed significant heterogeneity of N2O emission intensity and pathways among different tea plantation soils. Co-denitrification and heterotrophic nitrification emerged as the primary contributors of N2O emissions, accounting for an average of 34 % and 41 %, respectively. However, the mean contributions of denitrification and autotrophic nitrification were only 22 % and 3 %, respectively. Variance partitioning and correlation analyses indicated that this heterogeneity was predominantly driven by N-cycling gene abundances and soil properties (both contributed 71 % of the explanation) rather than microbial diversity and keystone species abundance. This study advances our understanding of the soil N-cycling process in acidic soils and provides a groundwork for formulating targeted measures to reduce N2O emissions based on the dominant pathways in tea plantation soils.

AB  - Landscape connectivity operates at a variety of scales, depending on the geography of the area in question and the focal species or ecological process under consideration. Most connectivity studies, however, are typically focused on a single scale, which in the case of resistance-based connectivity modelling, is often the entire landscape or protected area (PA) network. This large, single-scale focus may miss areas that are important for connectivity at smaller scales and that can be documented via observed animal movements without resorting to landscape-wide statistical modelling and extrapolation approaches. Here, we characterize landscape connectivity at three different scales (local/micro, inter-PA, and landscape-wide/macro), using observed animal movements rather than conventional resistance surface models, to produce a connectivity conservation blueprint for African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in the Kavango-Zambezi transfrontier conservation area (KAZA) in southern Africa. This analysis is based on an extensive, high-resolution GPS tracking database comprising approximately 4 million GPS locations from nearly 300 tagged elephants and their associated herds. Our results show that high-fidelity elephant use of micro-corridors is typically-though not exclusively-related to directed movements towards water, often amidst heavy anthropogenic presence. Movement pathways that connected KAZA's core protected areas were longer and variable, with some channelled into narrow areas of use and others more dispersed across larger sub-landscapes. At the largest scale, a network analysis incorporating all used landscape grid cells revealed several clusters of large-scale movement corridors that connected distant parts of KAZA. Synthesis and applications: Our three scales of analyses reveal disparate geographical priorities for connectivity conservation that collectively could help ensure the functional connectivity of KAZA for its largest inhabitants. Each scale will require its own set of inter-related conservation interventions, while further research into areas with sparse data collection, and other species of conservation concern, could reveal additional connectivity priorities at each scale.

AB  - Simple Summary There is a large number of sheep breeds worldwide. Today, many of them are endangered, because there are very little market demands for the majority of breeds. The integration of sheep in viticultural systems offers a promising option to put sheep and unique breed characteristics in value. However, it is unknown which characteristics and breeds are best suited for this purpose. The lack of information leads to problems in the implementation of this so-called new integrated crop-livestock system. In our research, we addressed this challenge. We studied 26 breeds and tested their suitability for integration into common vineyards of Central Europe. Two breeds fulfill the most important requirement. Southdown and Shropshire, for the latter especially, the sheep of the shorter legged Danish type seem to be unable to stand on two legs. Their muzzle heights stay within a tolerable range without harming the foliage area of vines. Therefore, adult animals of both breeds seem suitable to take over important viticultural tasks during the growing season. A third breed, the Ouessant sheep, is suitable with some limitations. Protecting a breed of sheep is simple when there is demand for its breed traits, but new market options are often hard to find. In general, grazing sheep are able to take over some viticultural work. Here, we address a new and promising integrated crop-livestock system that involves the integration of sheep in the vineyard during the growing season. Using sheep in a vineyard entails opportunities but also risks, such as the current lack of information, specifically in relation to breed traits. In our survey, we evaluated 26 breeds for their suitability for grazing as long as possible in Central European vineyards during the growing season. First, the breed traits required were identified. Then, 94 flock book breeders were interviewed about specific breed traits. The height of a sheep's muzzle is particularly important for assessing the suitability of a breed, as it defines the potential impact on the foliage area during the growing season. To determine the height of the muzzle, 179 flock book animals were measured. We found that the most important breeding objective for a new breed of sheep is the inability to stand on two legs. Adult animals of the breed Shropshire, and among these especially the shorter-legged Danish type, and Southdown, show a widespread inability to stand on two legs. Ouessant sheep are able to do so, yet are suitable with some limitations. Due to their extraordinarily small size, their reach is limited, as is their grazing performance. Thus, three of the 26 breeds studied here seem suitable for use in the most widespread vine training systems of Central Europe during the growing season. Targeted breeding could further improve the suitability of sheep for viticulture. Our findings could help to protect breeds and breed traits.

AB  - Road fencing is considered one of the most effective traffic safety measures to avoid wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC). Construction errors during fence installation, intrinsic defects and other inconsistencies allow, however, for wildlife to enter the roads. WVC thus occur even at many fenced places. We analysed WVC, from fenced D10 and D11 motorways in Czechia, which took place between 2009 and 2019. We applied the spatial-temporal KDE+ method (STKDE+) in order to determine both spatial and temporal WVC hotspot patterns. We further compared the WVC temporal pattern before and after the installation of fences. Three hotspot patterns were described: hotspot disappearance (after proper design and construction of a fence), emergence of a new hotspot (at places with fence gaps or improper fence ends) and stability of a hotspot over time (non-effective fences). We found that improper design of fencing induced WVC occurrence. We further concluded that the STKDE+ method can be used to effectively determine the effectiveness of safety measures. The STKDE+ analysis revealed 32 WVC hotspots, which contained 46% of all WVC. The fence-end effect and fence gaps caused WVC in 20 and 5 cases, respectively.

AB  - 1. North-western Australia is considered a refuge to several highly threatened elasmobranch species, but there has been little research effort targeting lesser known, large-bodied rhino rays. This study identified 2,343 records of globally threatened rays of the order Rhinopristiformes from the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a focus on the Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Area and adjacent Exmouth Gulf.
   2. Occurrence data were compiled from various sources including commercial fishing reports (35%), citizen science records (34%), targeted scientific surveys (30%) and published literature (1%). The region was inhabited by all of Australia's Pristidae (four sawfish species), all of Australia's Rhinidae (three wedgefish species) and the sole Australian representative of the Glaucostegidae (giant shovelnose ray). Of the 2,343 records, similar to 49% were sawfishes, while giant guitarfish and wedgefishes contributed to similar to 33% and 18% of records, respectively.
   3. The Exmouth Gulf appears to be a globally important refuge and pupping area for green sawfish (Pristis zijsron) which was the most commonly encountered pristid. Bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) were the most commonly identified rhinid, with less frequent encounters of shark rays (Rhina ancylostoma) and eyebrow wedgefish (Rhynchobatus palpebratus). The Ningaloo Coast World Heritage Area and adjacent Exmouth Gulf host all life stages of giant shovelnose ray (Glaucostegus typus).
   4. The combined use of several data sources has highlighted the study region as a 'lifeboat' for these globally threatened large-bodied rays. These data are essential in creating effective conservation and management plans in this globally important refuge, and are highly relevant to global conservation initiatives.

AB  - The study of animal sounds in biology and ecology relies heavily upon time-frequency (TF) visualisation, most commonly using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram. This method, however, has inherent bias towards either temporal or spectral details that can lead to misinterpretation of complex animal sounds. An ideal TF visualisation should accurately convey the structure of the sound in terms of both frequency and time, however, the STFT often cannot meet this requirement. We evaluate the accuracy of four TF visualisation methods (superlet transform [SLT], continuous wavelet transform [CWT] and two STFTs) using a synthetic test signal. We then apply these methods to visualise sounds of the Chagos blue whale, Asian elephant, southern cassowary, eastern whipbird, mulloway fish and the American crocodile. We show that the SLT visualises the test signal with 18.48%-28.08% less error than the other methods. A comparison between our visualisations of animal sounds and their literature descriptions indicates that the STFT's bias may have caused misinterpretations in describing pygmy blue whale songs and elephant rumbles. We suggest that use of the SLT to visualise low-frequency animal sounds may prevent such misinterpretations. Finally, we employ the SLT to develop 'BASSA', an open-source, GUI software application that offers a no-code, user-friendly tool for analysing short-duration recordings of low-frequency animal sounds for the Windows platform. The SLT visualises low-frequency animal sounds with improved accuracy, in a user-friendly format, minimising the risk of misinterpretation while requiring less technical expertise than the STFT. Using this method could propel advances in acoustics-driven studies of animal communication, vocal production methods, phonation and species identification.
   The conventional method for time-frequency analysis of animal sounds can be biased and hide important details. We evaluated other methods and showed that the superlet transform outperforms the conventional method for analysis of complex, low-frequency sounds. We also introduced BASSA, an open-source software tool implementing this algorithm.image

AB  - Despite the important role that octocorals (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) play in creating and maintaining deep-sea communities known as coral gardens, little is known about their diet. We analyzed the fatty acid compositions of deep-sea octocorals collected from Koko Guyot, located in the southern Emperor Seamount Chain, to identify their main food sources. The data suggests that octocorals feed mainly on zooplankton. However, the contribution of zooplankton to their diet varies greatly among different species and is determined by different zooplankton groups (herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores). This is evidenced by the increased content of some monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) and the different ratios of polyunsaturated fatty acids in corals. In bamboo coral Isidella, we observed the maximum enrichment in calanoid copepod markers (20:1n-9 and 22:1n-1). In addition to the copepod markers, most corals showed a high level of the carnivore marker (18:1n-9), which indicates a significant contribution of other (non-calanoid copepods) items to the diet. The high level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as the diatom marker 20:5n-3 suggests that corals of the family Primnoidae take up more freshly produced material. However, the high level of n-6 PUFA (especially, 20:4n-6), found in Paramuriceidae and Keroeides corals may indicate the involvement of detrital links in their diet. FA analysis is useful for identifying the diet of cold-water octocorals and provides a basis for prediction of future potential changes of the bottom ecosystems in the Emperor Seamount Chain.

AB  - Alterations in mollusc shells have been proposed contamination biomarkers. We used geometric morphometrics analyses associated with analytical determinations of contaminants to select suitable biological models among species widely distributed on coastal zones. The study was carried out using Lottia subrugosa (herbivore limpet), Crassostrea brasiliana (filter-feeder bivalve), and Stramonita brasiliensis (carnivore gastropod) obtained along a marked contamination gradient at Santos Estuarine System (Brazil). L. subrugosa and S. brasiliensis presented distinct shapes along the gradient, while no significant differences in shell form were seen for C. brasiliana. Indeed, limpets and snails presented morphometric parameters consistent with measured contamination levels hazardous substances. Based on cross-validation models, the reliability of morphometric responses was over 75% for the herbivore and carnivore species. In addition, for S. brasiliensis, a 95.2% confidence was detected in most contaminated sites. Therefore, shell alterations on carnivorous gastropods should be further investigated, seeking to be effectively employed as pollution biomarkers.

AB  - The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, and its population in the Southwest Atlantic is declining. Despite some progress in understanding the ecological requirements of the sevengill shark, there are still several information gaps. Essential aspects of its trophic ecology, such as main prey items or key feeding grounds, remain uncertain and this information is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. Stable isotopes and spontaneous regurgitations were analyzed to describe the trophic ecology of sevengill sharks within a marine protected area (MPA) of Peninsula Valde ' s in Patagonia, Argentina. Analysis of spontaneous regurgitations revealed that the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) was the primary prey item (70%) for the sevengill shark, during abundance peaks of both species in the MPA. However, the stable isotope analysis indicated that the teleosts were the main prey item, and the overall contribution of the elephant seal to the diet of the sevengill shark was around 30%. In addition, the contribution of each prey group varied with the size of the individuals. The estimated trophic position was 4.43, placing the species among the apex predators of the region. This study confirmed the use of the MPA as an essential foraging ground and contributed to identifying its main prey items. Also, it reflects the need to expand conservation tools beyond this particular coastal protection.

AB  - Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is a deepwater flatfish having a circumpolar distribution. Understanding the spatial connectivity and migratory patterns of this commercially valuable species is essential for ensuring a sustainable fishery; nonetheless, this information remains relatively scarce for many Greenland Halibut populations. Here we evaluate the connectivity and the population structure of halibut along coastal Greenland and Canada to better characterize the contribution of each production zone to the various stocks found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. In 2014 and 2016, we sampled 411 large Greenland Halibut from coastal Nunavut, Labrador, and Greenland. We used the elemental fingerprint (magnesium, strontium, and barium) from the otolith core and margin of the sampled fish to determine spatial differentiation of the source areas of the collected halibut. From the 17 sample sites, margin elemental fingerprint delineated four "elemental sectors", representing pooled adjacent sites having similar chemistry. Overall, 62% of Greenland Halibut were correctly assigned to their sampled coast. Elemental fingerprint of the otolith cores indicated three chemically distinct natal sources for the captured halibut. The chemical record in the otolith cores suggested a high connectivity of Greenland Halibut in the northwestern Atlantic and a main natal source located potentially along the west coast of Greenland. Given that our results suggest the presence of a large nursery around Disko Bay-Hellefiske Bank, protection measures should be considered for this area.

AB  - Elasmobranchs typically display slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity life history characteristics, making them vulnerable to fishing pressures and environmental perturbations. The whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari), a large pelagic migratory ray with an endangered status on the IUCN Red List, fits this pattern based on available literature. Historically, age and growth parameters for this ray have been reported through vertebral ageing methods. However, the periodicity of vertebrate band pair formation, which is used for ageing, has not been validated for this species, making ageing accuracy and thus the resulting growth parameters uncertain. In this study, we used both a frequentist and Bayesian method of estimating sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth parameters (DW infinity, k) in wild recaptured versus aquarium-housed rays. Additionally, we estimated growth from repeated measurement data collected from aquarium-housed rays, as an alternative approach to obtain growth parameters while allowing for individual variability. Between 2009 and 2020, 589 whitespotted eagle rays were caught, measured, tagged and released along the southwest coast of Florida. Of these rays, 34 were recaptured between 5-1413 days at liberty. Nineteen additional rays were collected during the same period, transported and maintained at Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, where they were regularly weighted and measured. Data from Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited facilities provided prior information on maximum size for the Bayesian estimations, and size at birth, size at maturity, and maximum life span. These data were used to plot and interpret von Bertalanffy growth curves. Wild whitespotted eagle rays were found to grow faster and mature earlier than previously thought, with Bayesian estimates of k = 0.28 year(-1) in females, and k = 0.30 year(-1) in males. Aquarium-housed individuals seemed to grow slower and reach smaller sizes, although data provided by the aquariums showed variable growth patterns depending on the facility. Longevity was estimated at 14-15 years in wild rays while maximum lifespan observed in aquariums was 19-20+ years. Life history parameters and growth trajectories generated from this study offer valuable information to aid with future conservation management strategies of this endangered species.

AB  - Secondary plant metabolites play an important role in mediating interactions among plants, insect herbivores, and their parasitoids. These defensive compounds not only affect the growth and development of herbivores, but also influence their natural enemies. In the present study, the diet-mediated effect of hexane extract of Inula racemosa (Hooker fil.) (Asteraceae) was evaluated on the growth and development of the gregarious ectoparasitoid Bracon hebetor (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) using a polyphagous pest, Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), as its host. The influence of various concentrations of I. racemosa extract was recorded on B. hebetor's parasitization behavior on its host larvae. The parasitism rate of naive female wasps decreased significantly when host larvae were reared on treated diet, but no adverse effect of plant extract was recorded on the viability of eggs. Detrimental effects of the plant extract were also detected in the form of reduced survival and delayed development of the parasitoid. Ingestion of hexane-extract-supplemented diet by S. litura adversely affected the emergence and parasitism rate of adults from the first generation of B. hebetor. In conclusion, consumption of I. racemosa extract by S. litura had a negative impact on various biological parameters of B. hebetor, although lower concentrations of plant extract had no adverse effects. There is a need to study the possible effects of secondary metabolites on these trophic interactions under natural conditions.

AB  - While levels of microplastics and other pollutants keep increasing in all coastal habitats, seafood is being eaten all over the world. In this research, three edible species were sampled from six points along the central north coast of Spain: Actinia equina anemones and Phorcus lineatus and Steromphala umbilicaris topshells (N = 100). Putative microplastics (N = 2157) were identified, counted, and many analyzed through FT-IR spectroscopy. Herbivorous topshells contained significantly more microplastics than carnivorous anemones. The most common particles were fibers, with transparent, blue and black as most prominent colours. Plastics included PE, polyester, PET, PP, nylon, PS, PVB and acrylic fibers. The sampled items contained several harmful compounds, including PTTC of which even one particle could be fatal if inhaled. This highlights the urgent need for studies regarding the safety of seafood.

AB  - The few current metabolomic studies on ferns are mostly restricted to a single species or focused on specific compounds. We performed an untargeted metabolomic study on six of the most common fern species from the cloud forest, followed by a targeted analysis of 64 phenolic compounds, many of which have been associated with herbivore defense. The untargeted analysis revealed a total of 232 putative identified metabolites from 463 to 1427 signals per fern species, each with its proper chemical signature but not necessarily correlated to their phylogenetic relationship. The flavonoid, flavone, and flavonol biosynthesis were the most expressed pathways in all species except for Marattia laxa. Fern species also differed strongly in the concentrations of the 10 detected phenolic compounds. Our results show that ferns, including the most ancestral species, such as M. laxa, display a high metabolomic diversity comparable to seed plants. Each fern species held a different combination of defensive phenolic compounds. Further research is needed to explore the metabolic diversity, to identify the biochemical defenses of ferns, and, in particular, to detect the chemical compounds that act against their specific herbivorous insects in the cloud forest ecosystem.

AB  - Agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are common around the Mediterranean Basin, where they provide a variety of goods and services to the local populations. Their sustainability relies on efficient grazing management, especially in Mediterranean rangelands. The diversity of pastoral resources, combined with the variety of grazing management techniques and farming objectives, has slowed down the development of digital tools to assist grazing management in these conditions. However, digital technologies could serve agro-sylvo-pastoral farms by improving the efficiency of grazing management and reducing the difficulty of the associated work. In this objective, and to take into account the variety of situations, we suggest developing an information system (IS) based on a variety of (contextualised) complementary data. For southern France, the following data can be combined: Sentinel 2 images, Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG), OSO land use and cover, RGE Alti altimetry data, pastoral technical references, herd GPS location and feedback from farmers. However, designing and implementing such an IS requires overcoming methodological and technical limitations concerning the integration of heterogeneous structured and unstructured data and the definition of meaningful ways to combine them to produce relevant insights for decision-making. In this article, we describe an approach to produce a spatialised IS aimed at providing farmers with relevant information to support decisions regarding grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands. The IS was codesigned with stakeholders, including farmers, to best match their needs and to facilitate its integration into farm management. The various stakeholders were involved in choosing the types of data to be associated and, defining the functions and the conceptual model of the IS. We propose to structure the IS as a spatial data lake, designed to integrate and associate the identified heterogeneous data, and to produce decision-making insights for grazing management in mountainous and Mediterranean rangelands.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of added lipids in the diets of ruminants has been found to have beneficial effects. In this study, the effects of different doses of extra virgin olive oil on the productive traits and ruminal fermentation parameters in lambs were evaluated. The relationship between nutrient intake and digestibility was optimal with 2% oil inclusion. The concentration of propionic acid increased with 2 and 4% DM of olive oil, while butyric acid decreased. The intake of olive oil did not affect the population of protozoa or animal performance. The inclusion of olive oil in low concentrations (2% of DM) positively influences feed intake and nutrient digestibility in hair sheep lambs. This study determined productive performance, ruminal fermentation kinetics and rumen ciliate protozoa in hair sheep lambs fed different levels of olive oil. Twenty-four growing lambs were used, with an initial live weight of 10.5 +/- 2.9 kg, and randomly assigned into four treatments (six animals per treatment) containing increasing levels of extra virgin olive oil (0, 2, 4 and 6% of dry matter). Animals were fed for 80 days, and sampling was carried out weekly. Intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and metabolizable energy (ME) differed between treatments (p < 0.05), with a linear and cubic tendency to decrease when oil concentrations were increased. Digestibility coefficients of OM, CP and NDF were not affected; however, the relationship between total intake and nutrient digestibility (DM, OM, NDF, ADF) increased with 2% DM olive oil. Compared with all treatments, the concentration of propionic acid increased by 16% with 4% olive oil. The intake of olive oil did not affect the protozoa population and live weight gain. Overall, the inclusion of olive oil in low concentrations (2% of DM) positively influences feed intake and nutrient digestibility in hair sheep lambs.

AB  - The Balkan chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica Bolkay, 1925), one of the subspecies of the Alpine chamois, is one important faunal representative of the Balkan region listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because of habitat loss, hunting, and disturbance by human activities. The study aimed to document the morphological and morphometrical parameters of the skull and mandible of R. r. balcanica. The sexual dimorphism detection of the Balkan chamois skull was another study objective. In total, 47 and 18 linear morphometric parameters were assessed from the skull and mandible, respectively, in 21 Balkan chamois skulls. Additionally, five indices of the skull were calculated. Among the 47 linear parameters measured on the skull, only 16 were statistically significant, primarily on the caudal surface. The study shows that the Balkan chamois skull is characterized by its long, narrow shape with a sharp top, as indicated by the Skull index (40.35), while the orbits (left, right) and foramen magnum appear nearly circular, demonstrated by their respective indices (94.96; 96.16 and 96.28). The average skull length was 210.82 +/- 8.15 mm in females and 210.5 +/- 6.39 mm in males. This study provides for the first time elements of clinical anatomy, including the location of infraorbital foramina, inter supraorbital foramina distance, as well as the mental and mandibular foramina which can be used in the clinical veterinary practice, especially for the veterinarian working with wild fauna.

AB  - Filial cannibalism is the consumption of one's own viable progeny. It occurs in a range of taxa but is particularly well-documented in fish species. Since parental care in fishes is typically male-biased, it is usually assumed that filial cannibalism is predominantly performed by the parental male while he is providing care to offspring. Filial cannibalism by females is less studied in fish. Video-recorded observations of ten pairs of adults housed in captivity revealed the first documentation of female filial cannibalism in the redhead goby (Elacatinus puncticulatus). Females were observed consuming both their own eggs and larvae. We discuss non-adaptive and adaptive explanations for female filial cannibalism in the redhead goby, including confinement due to captivity, nutritional or energetic need, and a possible lack of kin recognition. Understanding the evolutionary significance of filial cannibalism exhibited by females is an important biological inquiry. Since the redhead goby is a species used in the aquarium trade, understanding the conditions that influence female filial cannibalism in captivity may yield practical implications.

AB  - The use of insects such as black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) and common housefly (Musca domestica) as an alternative source of protein in animal feed has gained interest in recent years. This study investigated the effect of four growing substrates on the biomass, crude nutrient and mineral composition of M. domestica larvae. After a 5-day growing period, the total dry matter (DM) of maggot yield was 69.70; 59.33; 43.58 and 41.04 g/kg for soybean bran + maize pericarp, pig manure, maize bran and chicken manure, respectively. The chemical composition of maggot was significantly influenced by the type of substrate. The highest contents in crude ash (124.90 g/kg DM), crude fibre (167.65 g/kg DM) and sodium (53.47 g/kg DM) were obtained from maggots produced with pig manure. Maggots produced with the mixture of soybean bran and maize pericarp showed the highest fat (218.40 g/kg DM), crude protein (517.10 g/kg DM), potassium (89.05 g/kg DM) and metabolizable energy (4198.52 kcal/kg DM) contents. Maggots from maize bran had more calcium (51.84 g/kg DM) and phosphorus (104.55 g/kg DM) than those from others substrates. This study showed that soybean bran + maize pericarp and pig manure are the most suitable substrates for maggots' production to provide high yields of larvae with a good nutrient content.

AB  - Harvested wildlife populations should ideally be monitored to inform harvest policies and decision-making to help achieve management objectives. When the age of harvested individuals can be obtained, these data (i.e., age-at-harvest data) can be used to estimate trends of abundances, demographic rates, and harvest probabilities by the statistical reconstruction of the living population. This approach was developed primarily within the frequentist framework and requires the inclusion of auxiliary data (e.g., radiotelemetry data). We developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical approach allowing the population reconstruction from the definition of the species' life cycle without auxiliary data. The hierarchical model assumes that individuals are harvested from an open population whose fluctuations result from demographic processes, and the definition of a superpopulation composed of pseudo-individuals from which the harvested population is drawn. We evaluated the ability of our model to estimate abundances, survival, recruitment, and harvest probabilities based on simulations guided by the demographic processes of a long-lived mammal population. We considered model performance across scenarios, including varying age and temporal structures, superpopulation size, and prior information. We showed how prior information selected based on life history characteristics affects the accuracy of estimated parameters. We found that the model estimates accurate demographic parameters and abundances when the age-at-harvest matrix comprises more than two age classes. Furthermore, an increase in demographic information (number of age groups and years) increased the precision of the estimated parameters. We apply our model to a population of harvested (2012-2021) white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a mammalian carnivore, the fisher (Pekania pennanti), from Rhode Island, USA. Our model estimated biologically realistic population size and demographic rates for both species. Our approach provides robustness to track the population abundance of harvested species through time and estimate fundamental demographic parameters. Such results can be used to monitor whether population objectives are being met and whether harvest policy changes are required. Furthermore, this information can be critical for evaluating the effect of harvest on population growth and projecting trajectories of age-structured populations under different harvest scenarios. Therefore, our framework can help to guide management decisions and species conservation.

AB  - Co-composting is an effective approach to biowaste management. The co-composting potential of banana pseudostem (BPS) and mushroom media waste (MMW) with chicken manure (CM) has not been explored, let alone their suitable ratios of co-composting being determined. Meanwhile, the imbalance ratios of the feedstocks used in the process severely restrict the physicochemical properties and quality of the finished product. For this reason, six different ratios of BPS, MMW, and CM, viz. 1:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:3:1, 2:1:1, 2:2:1, and 2:3:1, respectively (T-1-T-6), were composted together in aerobic conditions to identify the suitable ratio by evaluating the changes in the physicochemical properties in the composting process. According to the ratio of treatments, the feedstocks were mixed on fresh weight basis. The turning process of co-composting piles was repeated at seven-day intervals to maintain the uniform aeration throughout the composting period. The piles having BPS, MMW, and CM at ratios of 1:2:1, 1:3:1, and 2:3:1, respectively, demonstrated a longer thermophilic phase, indicating more complete decomposition and earlier maturity compared to piles with higher amount of BPS. Of the ratios, BPS:MMW:CM at 1:2:1 ratio (T-2) resulted in the highest total nitrogen (1.53%), lowest C:N ratio (12.4), organic matter loss (54.5%), and increased CEC (41.3 cmol/kg). The highest germination index (129%) was also recorded in the T-2 compost, indicating that it was toxic-free and safe for seed germination. The nutrient-rich compost with high alkaline pH (>= 10) can effectively ameliorate soils of an acidic nature, for example, the acidity of Ultisols and Oxisols.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress has negative consequences in animal husbandry and pigs are highly susceptible because of their scattered sweat glands and elevated metabolic rate. Above 25 degrees C, pigs trigger mechanisms such as diverting blood from their internal organs to skin or decreasing the feed intake, which can affect the intestinal microbiota and capacity of fermentation. Betaine and zinc have been used as nutritional mitigation strategies to alleviate the effects of heat stress in pigs, but their effects on hindgut fermentation are unknown. By using an in vitro fermentation system and employing as the inoculum the rectal content from heat-stressed Iberian pigs supplemented or not with betaine or zinc, we showed that both supplements modified the pattern of hindgut fermentation in heat stressed pigs, having beneficial effects on acetate and butyrate production. The abundance of some bacterial groups was also modified, indicating an effect on the microbial structure. Because of the intricate interactions between the host and gut microbiota, additional studies are necessary to confirm these results under in vivo conditions. We investigated the effects of betaine and zinc on the in vitro fermentation of pigs under heat stress (HS). Twenty-four Iberian pigs (43.4 +/- 1.2 kg) under HS (30 degrees C) were assigned to treatments for 4 weeks: control (unsupplemented), betaine (5 g/kg), and zinc (0.120 g/kg) supplemented diet. Rectal content was used as the inoculum in 24-hincubations with pure substrates (starch, pectin, inulin, cellulose). Total gas, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), and methane production and ammonia concentration were measured. The abundance of total bacteria and several bacterial groups was assessed. Betaine increased the acetate production with pectin and inulin, butyrate production with starch and inulin, and ammonia concentration, and decreased propionate production with pectin and inulin. The abundance of Bifidobacterium and two groups of Clostridium decreased with betaine supplementation. Zinc decreased the production of SCFA and gas with starch and inulin, associated with diminished bacterial activity. Propionate production decreased with starch, pectin, and inulin while butyrate production increased with inulin, and isoacid production increased with cellulose and inulin in pigs supplemented with zinc. The ammonia concentration increased for all substrates. The Clostridium cluster XIV abundance decreased in pigs fed zinc supplemented diets. The results reported were dependent on the substrate fermented, but the augmented butyrate production with both betaine and zinc could be of benefit for the host.

AB  - Lophodermium piceae is the most common endophyte of Norway spruce (Picea abies) needles, and it probably occurs in the total distribution area of Norway spruce. Its significance to the host tree is still largely unknown mainly because no methodology is known for generating endophyte-free saplings nor for inoculation of intact needles with this fungus. We report here how a daily heat treatment at 40 degrees C for 8 h eradicates endophytes of Norway spruce needles within a few days without causing visible harm to the plants. We compared various methods for inoculation of endophyte-free saplings. In order to obtain effective inocula, we investigated what factors activate dormant L. piceae infections in the needle tissue resulting in ascomata formation. Best inoculation success was achieved by suspending naturally shed, highly infected needles above the saplings. Infection frequencies of up to 70% of needles were achieved with repeated inoculations in the course of 3 years. Once established in needles, individual infections by L. piceae can persist for at least 5 years. Individual infections remain small in young needles, but at a needle age of 6 years, they start to grow and spread resulting in presence all over the needle from base to tip at a needle age of 7 years, but still without causing visible symptoms on the needles. The presented methodology for generating both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected saplings of Norway spruce provides a new approach for testing the significance of infections by L. piceae to insect herbivory and diseases of Norway spruce needles.

AB  - Northern elephant seals engage in large-scale foraging migrations traveling up to 15,000 Km over 8 months in the northeast Pacific. While traditionally considered solitary migrants, we demonstrate here that female seals migrate in a surprisingly coherent manner, for individual northern elephant seals traveling in over such a large region of the ocean. Animal movement remained coherent, in terms of the direction of individual swimming relative to group movement, throughout much of their migrations. Movement coherence remained well above the value expected if the movement was independent until the migrating seals were further than 1,000 Km from the colony, beyond which movement coherence declined. Migrating seals presented regional aggregations consisting of female seals traveling within the center of the aggregation, closely following the main migration pathway, with individuals isolated on the extremes of the aggregation. These formations were preserved in the out-and-return migration trips. Animals at the edges of the group show an absence of correlation in their movement with the rest of animals. The observed movements exhibited a lag in the group movement patterns that was greater for female animals > 1,000 Km apart. A model that reproduced movement based on the average individual movement properties failed to reproduce the observed movement patterns. In turn, when a parameter was introduced that reflected group behavior, the resulting modelled movement conformed to the observed patterns, thereby demonstrating the presence of coherent, or synchronized, movement. Whereas the duration of female migration is ultimately constrained by reproductive biology, the coherent movement may involve both endogenous and exogenous cues determining the timing of the initiation of return across 25 million Km(2 )in the northeast Pacific.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of a single oxytocin injection on plasma steroid concentrations, testicular blood flow measures (resistive and pulsatility indexes), and testicular echogenicity in Baladi goats.
   Methods: Twelve Baladi goat bucks were randomly allocated into 2 groups and received an intravenous injection of either 0.7 IU/kg oxytocin or normal saline 0.9%. Venous blood samples were collected, and testicular blood flow Doppler parameters (i.e, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, time average maximum velocity, resistive index, and pulsatility index) were assessed for supratesticular arteries in the left and right testes immediately before (0), and at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection.
   Results: Plasma concentrations of testosterone significantly decreased in the oxytocin group at 60 min post-treatment compared to the control group, whereas plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta were not affected (P>0.05). Both resistive index and pulsatility index declined in the oxytocin group at 60 min post-treatment compared to the control group (P<0.05). Testicular pixel intensity increased at 30 min post-treatment in the oxytocin group compared to the control group (P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Oxytocin treatment significantly increases testicular blood flow and decreases plasma testosterone concentrations in male Baladi goats.

AB  - Simple Summary The earlier establishment of a health-benefiting intestinal microbiota can be an important strategy to improve intestinal health and subsequent growth performance. Functional oils, such as castor oil and cashew nutshell liquid, have been studied for promoting intestinal health due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate the benefits of supplementation of functional oils on modulation of mucosa-associated microbiota, enhancing the intestinal health and growth performance of nursery pigs. It was demonstrated that the functional oils enhanced the intestinal health of the pigs by increasing beneficial and reducing harmful bacteria and by potentially reducing jejunal oxidative stress and enhancing intestinal morphology. Our results suggest that the blend composed of castor oil and cashew nutshell liquid can be used in nursery pigs to modulate the jejunal mucosa-associated microbiota and intestinal integrity of nursery pigs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of functional oils on modulation of mucosa-associated microbiota, intestinal health, and growth performance of nursery pigs. Forty newly weaned pigs (20 barrows and 20 gilts) with 7.0 +/- 0.5 kg body weight (BW) were housed individually and randomly allotted in a randomized complete block design with sex and initial BW as blocks. The dietary treatments were a basal diet with increasing levels (0.00, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.50 g/kg feed) of functional oils (a blend of castor oil and cashew nutshell liquid; Oligo Basics USA LLC, Cary, NC) fed to pigs for 34 days divided in two phases (P1 for 13 days and P2 for 21 days). Growth performance was analyzed weekly. On day 34, all pigs were euthanized to collect jejunal mucosa for analyzing the mucosa-associated microbiota and intestinal health, and ileal digesta for analyzing apparent ileal digestibility. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4. Supplementation of functional oils did not affect the overall growth performance. Increasing supplementation of functional oils reduced (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Helicobacteraceae, whereas it increased (p < 0.05) Lactobacillus kitasatonis. Supplementation of functional oils tended (p = 0.064) to decrease protein carbonyl and increase the villus height (p = 0.098) and crypt depth (p = 0.070). In conclusion, supplementation of functional oils enhanced intestinal health of nursery pigs by increasing beneficial and reducing harmful bacteria, potentially reducing oxidative stress and enhancing intestinal morphology, without affecting overall growth performance of pigs. Supplementation of functional oils at 0.75-1.50 g/kg feed was the most beneficial to the jejunal mucosa-associated microbiota and intestinal integrity of nursery pigs.

AB  - This paper looks at experiential feedback and the technical and scientific challenges tied to the MERITEHIPPOCAMPE cruise that took place in the Mediterranean Sea in spring 2019. This cruise proposes an innovative approach to investigate the accumulation and transfer of inorganic and organic contaminants within the planktonic food webs. We present detailed information on how the cruise worked, including 1) the cruise track and sampling stations, 2) the overall strategy, based mainly on the collection of plankton, suspended particles and water at the deep chlorophyll maximum, and the separation of these particles and planktonic organisms into various size fractions, as well as the collection of atmospheric deposition, 3) the operations performed and material used at each station, and 4) the sequence of operations and main parameters analysed. The paper also provides the main environmental conditions that were prevailing during the campaign. Lastly, we present the types of articles produced based on work completed by the cruise that are part of this special issue.

AB  - Consumers employ a variety of foraging strategies, and oftentimes the foraging strategy employed is related to resource availability. As consumers acquire resources, they may interact with their resource base in mutualistic or antagonistic ways-falling along a mutualism-antagonism continuum-with implications for ecological processes such as seed dispersal. However, patterns of resource use vary temporally, and textbook herbivores may switch foraging tactics to become more frugivorous in periods of greater fleshy fruit availability. In this study, we investigated how fleshy fruit consumption of a generalist herbivore-the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)-shifts intra-annually following seasonal precipitation and subsequently examined how this shift toward increased frugivory influences the suite of plant syndromes dispersed. We noted a clear intra-annual shift toward a more frugivorous diet which coincided with seasonal precipitation and subsequently observed a marked shift in the plant syndromes dispersed with increasing frugivory. We found that as this generalist herbivore became more frugivorous, it dispersed a greater variety of plant syndromes at low levels of frugivory. However, when the gopher tortoise exhibited high levels of frugivory, the seed load was dominated by those exhibiting the endozoochory syndrome. This study illustrates a functional shift in a seed-dispersing herbivore toward that of a classical frugivore, suggesting that temporal variation in foraging strategy and the temporal scale in which foraging habits and seed dispersal interactions are quantified have implications for the suite of plant syndromes species disperse. Furthermore, trade-offs may exist that provide plants with the endozoochory syndrome with a competitive advantage over seeds with contrasting traits, such as the foliage is the fruit syndrome which is expected to experience greater dispersal by classical herbivores.

AB  - IntroductionThe functional connectivity patterns in the brain are highly heritable; however, it is unclear how genetic factors influence the directionality of such "information flows." Studying the "directionality" of the brain functional connectivity and assessing how heritability modulates it can improve our understanding of the human connectome. MethodsHere, we investigated the heritability of "directed" functional connections using a state-space formulation of Granger causality (GC), in conjunction with blind deconvolution methods accounting for local variability in the hemodynamic response function. Such GC implementation is ideal to explore the directionality of functional interactions across a large number of networks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were drawn from the Human Connectome Project (total n = 898 participants). To add robustness to our findings, the dataset was randomly split into a "discovery" and a "replication" sample (each with n = 449 participants). The two cohorts were carefully matched in terms of demographic variables and other confounding factors (e.g., education). The effect of shared environment was also modeled. ResultsThe parieto- and prefronto-cerebellar, parieto-prefrontal, and posterior-cingulate to hippocampus connections showed the highest and most replicable heritability effects with little influence by shared environment. In contrast, shared environmental factors significantly affected the visuo-parietal and sensory-motor directed connectivity. ConclusionWe suggest a robust role of heritability in influencing the directed connectivity of some cortico-subcortical circuits implicated in cognition. Further studies, for example using task-based fMRI and GC, are warranted to confirm the asymmetric effects of genetic factors on the functional connectivity within cognitive networks and their role in supporting executive functions and learning.

AB  - Behavioral lateralization with left- and right-hand use is common in the Animal Kingdom and can be advantageous for social species. The existence of a preferential use of the hands during agonistic interactions has been described for a number of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Bats compose the second largest order of mammals. They not only use their forelimbs for flight but also agonistic interactions. However, whether bat species show a population-level lateralized aggressive display has largely been unexplored. Here, we examine the lateralization of boxing displays during agonistic interactions in male Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros armiger, from three different populations. We found a population-level lateralization of boxing displays: Males from all three populations show a preferential use of the left forearm to attack opponents. In addition, left-handed boxers have higher fighting success over right-handed boxers. This study expands our knowledge of the handedness of bats and highlights the role of behavioral lateralization in conflict resolution in nocturnal mammals.

AB  - Although insect herbivores are known to evolve resistance to insecticides through multiple genetic mechanisms, resistance in individual species has been assumed to follow the same mechanism. While both mutations in the target site insensitivity and increased amplification are known to contribute to insecticide resistance, little is known about the degree to which geographic populations of the same species differ at the target site in a response to insecticides. We tested structural (e.g., mutation profiles) and regulatory (e.g., the gene expression of Ldace1 and Ldace2, AChE activity) differences between two populations (Vermont, USA and Belchow, Poland) of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata in their resistance to two commonly used groups of insecticides, organophosphates, and carbamates. We established that Vermont beetles were more resistant to azinphos-methyl and carbaryl insecticides than Belchow beetles, despite a similar frequency of resistance-associated alleles (i.e., S291G) in the Ldace2 gene. However, the Vermont population had two additional amino acid replacements (G192S and F402Y) in the Ldace1 gene, which were absent in the Belchow population. Moreover, the Vermont population showed higher expression of Ldace1 and was less sensitive to AChE inhibition by azinphos-methyl oxon than the Belchow population. Therefore, the two populations have evolved different genetic mechanisms to adapt to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides.

AB  - Simple Summary The concept of sustainable diets that are profitable, ethical, socioculturally acceptable, and environmentally beneficial is emerging as one of the key solutions to ensure the efficiency of livestock production systems. In this regard, agro-industrial by-products obtained from fruit processing have emerged as an alternative. Mamey pulp generates residual biomass from which the kernel is the main by-product that, due to its composition, can be used as ruminant feed. This study determined the effects of the inclusion of ground mamey kernel on intake, digestibility, and growth performance in lambs. No effects on nutrient intake or productive performance were observed. However, protein and fiber digestibility were reduced by ground mamey kernel inclusion. These findings suggest that mamey kernels can be included in ruminant diets. This study determined the effect of replacing ground corn and soybean meal with ground Pouteria sapota kernel (PSSM) in lamb diets on nutrient intake and digestibility, performance, and carcass traits. Twenty-one male hair sheep lambs with an average body weight of 22 +/- 3.5 kg were randomly assigned to three treatment diets containing PSSM at 0, 10, and 20% of the total dry matter (DM) inclusion. The study lasted 60 days, which included 15 days for adaption and 45 days for sample collection. The PSSM inclusion did not affect intake or performance (p > 0.05). However, ether extract (EE) digestibility linearly increased (p < 0.0001), while crude protein (CP) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) linearly decreased. Final body weight, total weight gain, average daily weight gain, feeding efficiency, and carcass traits were not affected by PSSM inclusion. In conclusion, these results suggest that PSSM can replace up to 200 g/kg DM of ground corn and soybean meal without affecting intake or animal performance.

AB  - The nutritional quality of herbivorous insects' food can not only directly affect the herbivorous insects themselves, but can also indirectly affect their parasitoids. To investigate these cascading, multi-trophic effects, we reared cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), on artificial diets (8.1, 11.5, 16.75, 25.5, 34.25, and 43 g protein/liter diet) to assess how diet protein content affected the development of this common pest and its suitability as a host for the gregarious parasitoid, Cotesia vanessae (Reinhard) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Nonparasitized caterpillars experienced increased mortality when reared on 8.1 g protein/liter diet, and slower development and reduced pupal mass when reared on <= 16.75 g protein/liter diet. Host diet did not affect the percentage of hosts with parasitoid emergence nor the mass of individual parasitoids. However, parasitoid broods emerging from caterpillars reared on <= 25.5 g protein/liter diet were smaller and those reared on <= 16.75 g protein/liter diet exhibited prolonged development. The consequences of host diet on these latter F-1 parasitoids did not affect their reproductive fitness. Caterpillars compensated for nutrient stress, induced by either low quality diet or parasitism, by increasing the amount of diet that they consumed. These collective results demonstrate the plasticity of host-parasitoid systems. Compensatory feeding allows the host caterpillar to moderate the consequences of low quality diets, which may subsequently affect the F-1 parasitoids developing within the host, but not necessarily affect the F-2 parasitoid generation.

AB  - In this study we investigated the sedative, anesthetic, and pulmonary histopathologic effects of dexmedetomidine/morphine (DM) and xylazine/morphine (XM) in sheep. We hypothesized that DM would provide profound sedation and better maintain physiologic parameters under anesthesia than XM in sheep undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Nineteen male sheep were premedicated with either DM (dexmedetomidine [0.006 mg/kg] and morphine [0.3 mg/kg]) or XM (xylazine [0.1 mg/kg] and morphine [0.3 mg/kg]). After DM or XM administration, 3 blinded veterinarians evaluated sedation scores (0 [no sedation], 1 [mild], 2 [moderate], 3 [severe]). Sheep were induced with intravenous tiletamine/zolazepam, intubated, and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Anesthetic parameters were monitored for 60 min, including heart rate, respiratory rate, indirect blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, body temperature, arterial blood gas analysis, and isoflurane requirement. At the end of the procedure, the sheep were euthanized, and lung pathology (pulmonary edema) was assessed. The results showed that the sedation scores did not differ between DM (0.8 [0.4 to 1.0]) and XM (1.0 [1.0 to 1.0]). In addition, the anesthetic parameters were comparable between the groups, but the DM group exhibited a higher heart rate than the XM group. Finally, marked pulmonary changes, consistent with pulmonary edema, were observed in the XM group. In conclusion, DM and XM provided similar sedation and physiologic stability under isoflurane anesthesia, but DM may help minimize bradycardia and was associated with less evidence of pulmonary edema.

AB  - Lidocaine infusions are used in several species to reduce anesthetic requirements and decrease the negative impact of high inhalant concentrations on the cardiorespiratory system. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of 2 dosages of lidocaine administered as constant rate infusions on isoflurane requirement (IR) in swine and to measure plasma concentrations of lidocaine and, its metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) corresponding to IR. Six healthy commercial-bred pigs aged 74 +/- 5.3 d and weighing 31.7 +/- 5.4 kg were anesthetized and maintained with isoflurane during mechanical ventilation. Baseline IR was determined using a supramaximal mechanical stimulus on the dewclaw of the hind limb. After randomization for treatment allocation, lidocaine (loading dose; 2 mg/kg IV) was administered, followed by either 50 (CRI50) or 200 (CRI200) mu g/kg/min and maintained for 30 min to reach a steady state and redetermination of IR. The study was repeated with the alternate infusion rate after a minimum washout period of 6 d. Lidocaine and MEGX plasma concentrations were quantified with HPLC and compared between groups. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide, body temperature, and time to extubation were measured and compared between treatment groups. Baseline IR was 1.77% +/- 0.34%. In pigs receiving CRI50 (1.53%) and CRI200 (1.61%), IR was lower than baseline IR, with a sparing effect of 7.8% (P = 0.046) and 13.4% (P = 0.041), respectively. Plasma concentrations of MEGX were inversely correlated to IR in pigs receiving CRI50 but not CRI200. Cardiovascular variables did not differ between treatments. Time to extubation was similar between groups (P = 0.92), 10.2 +/- 4.5 min in subjects receiving CRI50 and 11 +/- 3.6 min in pigs receiving CRI200. Infusion of lidocaine produced a nonlinear sparing effect on isoflurane requirement without appreciable, clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables or extubation time.

AB  - The navigational mechanisms of homing pigeons, Columba livia, have been extensively studied and represent a useful model for the navigation of birds and other animals. Pigeons navigate with an olfactory map and sun compass from unfamiliar areas and, in familiar areas, are largely guided by visual landscape cues, following stereotyped and idiosyncratic routes. However, the mechanisms by which they gain familiarity, improve their navigation and transition between navigational strategies during learning are not fully understood. Addressing these outstanding questions in this navigational model will help to improve our understanding of navigational ontogeny. We sought to investigate whether passive exposure to the cues at a site, without release, was sufficient for navigational learning, given that pigeons can determine the home direction before taking off. We exposed pigeons to cues at a novel site before returning them to the site the next day and releasing them alongside controls. We found no differences in the directional distributions, mean vector lengths, virtual vanishing times, efficiency indices or homing efficiency indices between birds that had and had not previously visited the site. We therefore found no evidence to suggest that passive exposure to the cues at a novel site was sufficient to facilitate a detectable improvement in navigational performance. There are three possible explanations for this result: first, a larger sample size would have detected a weak effect of learning; second, passive exposure to a release site is insufficient to generate navigational learning; and third, pigeons learn from passive exposure but do not rely upon this information, showing no difference in performance, despite learning. We discuss these three explanations with reference to previous findings on navigational learning in homing pigeons. We suggest that experiments should continue to examine navigational ontogeny in homing pigeons to help address this major problem for the field of navigation. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particles are under consideration for use in several proposed advanced nuclear reactor concepts. The silicon carbide (SiC) layer in TRISO acts as a barrier to prevent the release of the fission products. However, despite remarkable retention, silver (Ag) release has been observed from intact particles, which requires investigation since the Ag isotope ((110m) Ag) has a long half-life. Previous work focused on developing a multiscale, mechanistic model for Ag diffusion accounting for temperature and microstructure effect and has been successfully validated. In this work, we expand the previous model to account for irradiation- enhanced Ag diffusivity in SiC and improve its accuracy over a wider grain size and temperature ranges relevant for advanced reactor conditions. A temperature, grain size, and flux dependent diffusivity is therefore derived using the mesoscale code MARMOT and implemented in the fuel performance code BISON. The irradiation- enhanced Ag diffusivity in SiC is compared against experimental data and validated using BISON against Ag release measurements from the Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel Development and Qualification Program (AGR-1 and AGR-2). Herein, we quantify the impact of SiC grain size, irradiation, and temperature on Ag release. In agreement with previous studies, we find accounting for SiC grain size improves agreement between BISON predictions and experimental observations for most cases. We also find that accounting for irradiation improves agreement for cases where Ag release was underestimated, but the impact was less significant than accounting for microstructure.

AB  - The grazing livestock meat production sector in Bulgaria has shown considerable development in the last 7-8 years, but is still far from European countries in terms of production efficiency, quantity and quality of production. The goal of this study is to develop the most appropriate strategies to support the development of the grazing livestock meat production sector in Bulgaria through the activities of the GREENANIMO project - knowledge transfer and implementation of innovative practices in order to achieve sustainable production of quality meat while increasing the benefits for farmers. Primary data for the SWOT analysis were obtained by use of a survey of a representative sample of farmers rearing beef cattle, meat sheep and meat goats. A comparative index was used to rank the strengths (S) and weaknesses (W), opportunities (O) and threats (T) for the development of the grazing livestock meat production sector in our country. To calculate the metric assessments of each of the factors, an additional ranking was performed based on the average assessment on the importance of the factor by the respondents in the survey, weighted with an additional expert assessment of the possibility this factor to be influenced by GREENANIMO project activities. Matrices for estimation of the internal (IFE) and external factors (EFE) have been created. The determination of the strategy of the highest importance was made by compiling a SWOT matrix and analyzing the results of four alternative strategies SO, WO, ST and WT. The results of the study show that the (W) and the (T) for the business prevail at almost equal value to the (O). The analysis of the SWOT matrix points at WT and WO strategies, which are the implemented actions leading to minimization of W to limit the T for the sector, as well as to support the realization of O. The appropriate strategies and the activities for their implementation were found, which will be planned in the preparation of the "Action Plan for research and implementation of innovative practices in the grazing livestock meat production sector" within the GREENANIMO project with a view to support the development of the grazing livestock meat production sector in Bulgaria.

AB  - Syngnathids (seahorses, pipefishes and seadragons) are an attractive resource for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Despite few scientific studies supporting seahorse nutritional benefits, they are believed to possess medicinal properties that enhance human health. The European short-snout seahorse Hippocampus hippocampus is classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Nevertheless, there are increasing records of this species being illegally captured and traded to supply TCM. This study investigated the fatty acid (FA) profiles of the trunk muscles of cultured female and male H. hippocampus, to assess sex and intraspecific variation, as well as their potential nutritional value. The contents of crude lipid (4.05 +/- 2.15% dry weight, DW in females and 2.82 +/- 1.48% DW in males) and phospholipid (8.23 +/- 3.34 mu g mg(-1) DW in females and 7.91 +/- 2.36 mu g mg(-1) DW in males) were not significantly different between the two sexes. The absolute FA compositions of H. hippocampus trunk muscles revealed higher mean values for FA 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 n-9 and 22:6 n-3 (DHA), in both female (2.82 +/- 1.11, 1.81 +/- 0.89, 0.90 +/- 0.41 and 0.93 +/- 0.35 mu g mg(-1) DW, respectively) and male specimens (1.99 +/- 0.95, 1.52 +/- 0.78, 0.74 +/- 0.44 and 0.80 +/- 0.41 mu g mg(-1) DW, respectively). In terms of FA classes, saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed the highest absolute value of the total pool of FA, for both sexes (4.73 +/- 1.94 mu g mg(-1) DW in females and 3.58 +/- 1.76 mu g mg(-1) DW in males). Males tended to exhibit a more suitable profile for human nutrition, displaying a lower atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI). The relative composition of H. hippocampus trunk muscles followed the patterns of seahorse species valued in TCM, with DHA ranking amongst the PUFA with higher mean relative abundances (12.0% of total FA). While seahorse FA profiles may be of interest in terms of their nutritional value for humans, only specimens originating from sustainable production practices should be traded and the conservation of their populations in the wild should continue to be a global priority.

AB  - Observations are essential to explore and discover the ocean. The rapid advancements in technology have revolutionized our capacity to document the ocean and its diverse array of species, pushing the boundaries of our understanding further than ever before. The central Red Sea was exposed as part of the Red Sea Decade Expedition, which took place from 04 February to 18 June 2022 aboard the R/V OceanXplorer, using underwater submersibles. Here, for the first time in the Red Sea, we reported three observations of living Firoloida desmarestia specimens, one female and two male specimens, a heteropod from the Pterotracheidae family. This shell-less mollusk has been observed in the epipelagic zone of the world's oceans, with the exception of polar regions, suggesting a global distribution for these observations. The two males were observed swimming in the water column, while the female was close to the seabed. All three observations were detected during the morning, raising the question if these organisms use vertical migrations to reach deep-sea waters during the daytime. However, no ROV or submersible dives were conducted at night. Our results show a depth range expansion for observations of this species in the Red Sea. Furthermore, as far as we know, no adults of F. desmarestia have been reported until now in the Red Sea. During the expedition, all three specimens were found at similar depths (350, 400, and 464.5 m depth), with the female being the deepest, thus confirming the eurybathic distribution of this species. The emerging technology is progressively enhancing our understanding of these enigmatic creatures and expanding our knowledge of their fascinating adaptations and ecological roles. In addition to our fieldwork, a literature search was performed to uncover any pre-existing observational records of this species to understand its global distribution and ecological significance.

AB  - With the increasingly routine recovery of faunal remains from archaeological excavations and zooarchaeological analysis of such assemblages by macroscopic and, more recently, biomolecular methods, we now have an unprecedented wealth of evidence for early European livestock management at local, regional and continental scales. We can identify broad geographical and temporal trends in the relative abundance, size and mortality patterns of different livestock species, and have more piecemeal evidence for their diet, mobility and seasonality of reproduction and for human exploitation of their secondary as well as primary products. Conversely, we have little if any direct zooarchaeological evidence for the scale of livestock management and this, coupled with disagreement regarding the intensity of secondary products usage, hinders consensus on the contribution of livestock to human subsistence in Neolithic Europe. It is proposed here that most domestic ruminants in Neolithic Europe were managed for non-specialised exploitation of a mixture of carcass and secondary products and, drawing on a range of indirect proxies, that livestock were mostly kept in small numbers. It follows that the direct dietary contribution of domestic animals to Neolithic human subsistence will normally have been subordinate to that of grain crops and secondary to their role in supporting cultivation and social dynamics. If these propositions are accepted, some recent attempts to interpret regional (and diachronic) variation in zooarchaeological evidence in terms of latitudinal contrasts in climate and vegetation may be ill-founded. In conclusion, it is argued that sound interpretation of the wealth of zooarchaeological data now available, as evidence for early European animal keeping, requires their integration with other lines of archaeological, bioarchaeological and palaeoecological investigation in the context of broader models of Neolithic subsistence, land use and political economy. The approach advocated, while illustrated with examples from Neolithic Europe, is of wider geographical relevance and, despite its critical tone, this assessment of the state of the field is essentially optimistic.

AB  - Collecting and obtaining sufficient amount of airborne particles for multiple microbial component assessments can be challenging. A passive dust sampling device, the electrostatic dust fall collector (EDC) has been established for assessing airborne exposures including endotoxin and glucans. Recently, with advances in next-generation sequencing techniques, EDCs were used to collect microbial cells for DNA sequencing analysis to promote the study of airborne bacterial and fungal communities. However, low DNA yields have been problematic when employing passive sampling with EDC. To address this challenge, we attempted to increase the efficiency of extraction. We compared DNA extrac-tion efficiency of bacterial components from EDCs captured on filters through filtration using five extraction tech-niques. By measuring the abundance, diversity and structure of bacterial communities using qPCR and amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes, we found that two techniques outperformed the rest. Furthermore, we devel-oped protocols to simultaneously extract both DNA and endotoxin from a single EDC cloth. Our technique promotes a high quality to price ratio and may be employed in large epidemiological studies addressing airborne bacterial expo-sure where a large number of samples is needed.

AB  - Background: Understanding the metabolic adaptations of wild bighorn sheep (Ovis c. canadensis) to nutritional stress is crucial for their conservation. Methods: This study employed 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to investigate the biochemical responses of these animals to varying sub-maintenance nutritional states. Serum samples from 388 wild bighorn sheep collected between 2014 and 2017 from December (early sub-maintenance) through March (severe sub-maintenance) across Wyoming and Montana were analyzed. Multivariate statistics and machine learning analyses were employed to identify characteristic metabolic patterns and metabolic interactions between early and severe sub-maintenance nutritional states. Results: Significant differences were observed in the levels of 15 of the 49 quantified metabolites, including formate, thymine, glucose, choline, and others, pointing to disruptions in one-carbon, amino acid, and central carbon metabolic pathways. These metabolites may serve as indicators of critical physiological processes such as nutritional intake, immune function, energy metabolism, and protein catabolism, which are essential for understanding how wild bighorn sheep adapt to nutritional stress. Conclusions: This study has generated valuable insights into molecular networks underlying the metabolic resilience of wild bighorn sheep, highlighting the potential for using specific biochemical markers to evaluate nutritional and energetic states in free-ranging ungulates. These insights may help wildlife managers and ecologists compare populations across different times in seasonal cycles, providing information to assess the adequacy of seasonal ranges and support conservation efforts. This research strengthens our understanding of metabolic adaptations to environmental stressors in wild ruminants, offering a foundation for improving management practices to maintain healthy bighorn sheep populations.

AB  - We studied the population size, demography, seasonal ecology, and movements of Arizona Mud Turtles (Kinosternon stejnegeri) in 2 earthen stock tanks on the U.S.Mexico international border in Pima County, Arizona. Using closedpopulation models within year, we estimated the population in the "West Tank" to number 50 individuals (95% CI 42 to 65) in 2011 and 74 individuals (95% CI 62 to 96) in 2019. Using openpopulation models to fit capturerecapture data from 2011, 2018, and 2019, we estimated the population in the West Tank in 2018 to be 63 turtles. We estimated that 35 (95% CI 24 to 72) of 41 turtles (84.6%) captured in 2011 were still surviving in the West Tank in 2019, yielding an average annual survivorship rate of 0.98. The overall sizeclass distribution changed significantly from 2011 to 2019, with a shift from juvenile age classes to larger adults. In 2011, twentythree out of 41 turtles (56.1%) were smaller than 90 mm carapace length (SCL). By 2019, only 5 out of 53 turtles (9.4%) were smaller than 90 mm SCL. Conversely in 2011, only 1 out of 41 turtles (2.4%) was larger than 170 mm SCL, while in 2019, 7 out of 53 turtles (13.2%) were larger than 170 mm SCL, suggesting that the mean age of the population increased during this time. Arizona Mud Turtles that were radiotracked in at least 2 full years (2017 and 2018) had home range axes ranging from 59 to 782 m (average axis = 357.5 m, median axis = 241.0 m). Turtles tracked in both years traveled minimum overland distances of 33 to 533 m from their tankofcapture origin to either an upland activity area or to another tank (average max distance = 261 m, median max distance = 185 m). Three turtles of 11 tracked in both years (2M, 1F; 27.3%) spent portions of the summer and fall on the Mexico side of the border fence. Two turtles crossed in both years and one in only one year. Most aquatic locations (97.2%) were in anthropogenic tanks. We found that 62.7% of overwintering locations were in burrows of bannertailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis). Eight of 11 turtles (72.7%) used 12 distinct Dipodomys burrow complexes. One of the 12 overwintering burrow complexes was destroyed by a U.S. Border Patrol construction yard following the completion of this study. Though apparently stable in recent decades, this significant population on protected federal land appears to be small and vulnerable to development in the vicinity of the U.S.Mexico border. This work is the first major spatial ecology study of K. stejnegeri and provides valuable information on the ecology and movements of this poorly studied species.

AB  - The Babile Elephant Sanctuary in Ethiopia was established in 1970 specifically to protect its elephants Loxodonta africana. They were once part of a larger population that ranged in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia but that was largely extirpated during the 20th century. Since its establishment, the Sanctuary has experienced severe anthropogenic pressure, inadequate government support, and civil conflict. Mapping was undertaken to analyse the rate of human immigration into the Sanctuary in 2006, 2014 and 2017, as part of an assessment of the Sanctuary's effectiveness in protecting its resident elephant population and in mitigating anthropogenic pressures. From 2006 to 2017 the number of illegal houses in the Sanctuary increased from 18,000 to > 50,000, of which > 32,000 were in the area in which elephants range. This settlement, coupled with high demand for natural resources, has resulted in significant habitat destruction and could also have exacerbated human-elephant conflict. Elephant conservation and monitoring by the Born Free Foundation were challenging because of ethnic conflict; rural and political stability is required if efforts to protect wildlife are to be successful. Unless these issues are resolved and the integrity of the Sanctuary is restored, this elephant population will be extirpated in the near future.

AB  - The spatial and trophic ecology of the culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) was studied in the Salar de Punta Negra basin and the Llullaillaco National Park, in the high Andes of the Region of Antofagasta in northern Chile. The objectives of this study were to understand the feeding ecology, habitat use, and home range and activity pattern of culpeo fox. The study was conducted in an area of approximately 2800 km(2) inside the Punta Negra salt flat basin, Llullaillaco NP, the surrounding mountains, and within areas of mining operations. We used methodologies including camera trapping, live trapping and satellite monitoring of L. culpaeus individuals, and diet analysis. Fifteen captures and five recaptures of culpeos were made, and three of them were equipped with satellite tracking collars. The home ranges estimated using the Minimum Convex Polygon (MPC 95%) were: 1029 km(2) (female), 809 km(2) (female) and 215 km(2) (male). Culpeo foxes were nocturnal animals. A larger sample of 282 fecal scats was collected, with the main trophic prey in culpeo fox diet by frequency of occurrence being rodents (74.3%), arthropods (48%), camelids carrion (43.6%), birds (16.3%), vegetation (13.8%) and reptiles (2.5%). Niche breadth was low (0.367).

AB  - Simple Summary Optimal reproductive performance on goat farms is an important trait in terms of production and economics. From a genetic perspective, understanding molecular mechanisms through the use of RNA-seq technology can help us better understand goat herds. In this study, a whole-transcriptome sequencing approach was used to identify lncRNA, circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression in the ovaries of Chongming white goats in terms of high and low fecundity during the estrus phase. These results were helpful in terms of further studying the molecular mechanisms of goat reproduction.Abstract Reproductive performance is one of the most important economic traits in the goat industry. Increasing the number of goats is an effective measure to improve production efficiency and reduce production costs. Ovaries are important reproductive organs in female mammals that directly affect the estrous cycle and reproductive abilities. Understanding the complex transcription network of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs) and messenger RNA (mRNA) could lead to significant insights into the ovarian regulation of the reproductive processes of animals. However, the whole-transcriptome analysis of the non-coding RNAs and mRNA of the ovaries in Chongming white goats between high-fecundity (HP) and low-fecundity (LP) groups is limited. In this study, a whole-transcriptome sequencing approach was used to identify lncRNA, circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression in the ovaries of Chongming white goats during the estrus phase using RNA-Seq technology. More than 20,000 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 10,000 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 3500 circular RNAs (circRNAs), and 1000 micro RNAs (miRNAs) were identified. A total of 1024 differential transcripts (724 mRNAs, 112 lncRNAs, 178 circRNAs, and 10 miRNAs) existing between the HP and the LP groups were revealed through a bioinformatics analysis. They were enriched in the prolactin signaling pathway, the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and the GnRH signaling pathway, as well as various metabolic pathways. Differentially expressed mRNAs (such as LYPD6, VEGFA, NOS3, TNXB, and EPHA2) and miRNAs (such as miR-10a-5p) play key roles in the regulation of goat ovaries during the estrus phase. The enrichment of pathways related to reproduction, such as the Hippo, Hedgehog, PI3K-AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways, suggests that they might be involved in the prolificacy of goat ovaries. Overall, we identified several gene modules associated with goat fecundity and provided a basis for a molecular mechanism in the ovaries of Chongming white goats.

AB  - Tea-oil Camellia species as edible-oil producing trees are widely cultivated in southern China. Camellia anthracnose that is mainly caused by Colletotrichum fructicola is a major disease of tea-oil trees. However, rapid detection and precise quantification of C. fructicola in different Camellia species that are crucial for the fundamental study of this pathosystem and effective disease management remain largely unexplored. Here, we developed a sensitive, rapid, and accurate method for quantifying C. fructicola growth in different Camellia species using a quantitative PCR assay. Amplified C. fructicola DNA using ITS-specific primers is relatively compared with the amplification of Camellia oleifera using the TUB gene. We determined that the fungal growth is tightly associated with the disease development in Ca. oleifera following C. fructicola infection in a time-course manner. This assay is highly sensitive, as fungal growth was detected in six different inoculated tea-oil Camellia species without visible disease lesion symptoms. Additionally, this method was validated by quantifying the Camellia anthracnose in orchards that did not show any disease symptoms. This assay enables the rapid, highly sensitive, and precise detection and quantification of C. fructicola growth in different tea-oil Camellia species, which will have a practical application for early diagnosis of anthracnose disease under asymptomatic conditions in Camellia breeding and field and will facilitate the development of tea-oil trees and C. fructicola interaction as a mold system to study woody plant and fungal pathogens interaction.

AB  - The United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska, USA, conducted a species status assessment for a petition to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf (Canis lupus ligoni) under the Endangered Species Act in 2020-2022. This federal undertaking could not be adequately prepared without including the knowledge of Indigenous People who have a deep cultural connection with the subspecies. Our objective is to communicate the authoritative expertise and voice of the Indigenous People who partnered on the project by demonstrating how their knowledge contributed to the species status assessment. The Indigenous knowledge applied in the assessment is the cultural and intellectual property of those who have shared it. We employed rapid appraisal research to expeditiously develop a preliminary and qualitative understanding of Indigenous People's cultural and ecological knowledge of Alexander Archipelago wolves. We used semi-directed interviewing and inductive coding from grounded theory for text analysis. Indigenous knowledge contributed to the agency's understanding of the Alexander Archipelago wolf in Southeast Alaska and helped the agency with their classification decision. Indigenous research partners explained the rich cultural significance and position of wolves in Tlingit society and described human-wolf relationships and ecological interactions. The agency used a single-species assessment approach based in species ecology and conservation biology, whereas the Indigenous wolf experts applied a multi-species, community ecology approach based in a sociocultural context of balance and respect. The Indigenous wolf experts successfully addressed knowledge gaps identified by the agency. The partners were challenged by a short regulatory timeframe that did not allow for comprehensive study of Indigenous knowledge and constrained review and feedback by Indigenous experts. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service learned that its assessment framework was not designed to account for an Indigenous worldview. To level the playing field, the agency and Indigenous experts should discuss how to co-develop an assessment framework that equitably applies both perspectives.
   Tlingit existencescape can be understood in this article as the overlap of the sacred, natural, and cultural dimensions that govern the Tlingit way of life. An Indigenous model of Wolf is holistic in nature, and the species cannot be understood outside of its sociocultural and socioecological contexts. Wildlife management agencies in North America must begin to revise their assessment frameworks to include Indigenous models of wildlife conservation. image

AB  - While global population growth drives increased production efficiency in animal agriculture, there is a growing demand for environmentally friendly practices, particularly in reducing air pollutant emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations. This study explores the potential of cultivating microalgae in photobioreactors (PBRs) as an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach to mitigate NH3 and CO2 emissions from pig barns. Unlike traditional physicochemical mitigation systems, microalgae offer a renewable solution by converting pollutants into valuable biomass. The research focused on Scenedesmus dimorphus growth under typical NH3 and CO2 concentrations found in the indoor air of pig barns. Four NH3 (0, 12, 25, and 50 ppm) and four CO2 concentrations (350, 1200, 2350, and 3500 ppm) were tested using photobioreactors. Results showed a maximum specific growth rate of 0.83 d(-1) with 12 ppm NH3 and 3500 ppm CO2. The dry biomass concentration was significantly higher (1.16 +/- 0.08 g L-1; p < 0.01) at 25 ppm NH3 and 2350 ppm CO2 than other test conditions. S. dimorphus demonstrated the peak NH3 and CO2 fixation rates (23.8 +/- 2.26 mg NH3 L-1 d(-1) and 432.24 +/- 41.09 mg CO2 L-1 d(-1)) at 25 ppm NH3 and 2350 ppm CO2. These findings support the feasibility of using algae to effectively remove air pollutants in pig barns, thereby improving indoor air quality.

AB  - Contamination by microplastics (0.1 & mu;m-5 mm plastic fragments) is currently one of the major threats to the conser-vation of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Growing awareness on this issue has led to an increase in stud-ies on the effects of microplastics on freshwater organisms, although there are still few investigations on possible transfer of this contaminant along water trophic chains from producers to primary consumers. In this study, aquatic herbivorous larvae of the moth Cataclysta lemnata were fed on microplastic-free (control) and contaminated (MPs treatment) Lemna minuta fronds. For treatments, Lemna fronds were grown in mineral water enriched with fluorescent microparticles of poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) (MPs, 100 mg/L) and then fed to the larvae as a food source. Microplastics effects on larvae were tested at 0, 7,14 and 21 days of exposure, corresponding to sensitive phases of the insect life cycle. Contaminant impact was assessed based on some parameters such as viability, larva body size/weight, feeding alterations and regularity of the insect life cycle. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy, the presence of microplastics in the larvae was verified. The finding of fluorescent microplastics in both the intestinal lumen and excrement samples showed that larvae ingested contaminated Lemna fronds. In addition, larvae fed contam-inated fronds were strongly affected by the presence of microplastic contaminant over time, showing high mortality (90 %) and total inability to complete the life cycle after 21 days by failing to reach the winged adult phase. In control tests, survival rates were higher than in treatments, and 50 % of the larvae managed to pupate and emerge as moths, reaching the adult phase. The results show that there was atrophic transfer of microplastics from producer to primary consumer along a freshwater food chain, generating negative effects on the life cycle of this aquatic herbivore.

AB  - Epsilon toxin (ETX), produced by type B and D strains of Clostridium perfringens, can cause fatal enterotoxaemia in ruminant animals, particularly sheep, cattle, and goats. Previous studies show that the cytotoxicity of ETX is dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts, the maintenance of which is ensured by cholesterol. Zaragozic acid (ZA) is a statin drug that reduces the synthesis of squalene, which is responsible for cholesterol synthesis. In this study, ZA significantly reduced the toxicity of ETX in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We show that ZA does not affect the binding of ETX to MDCK cells, but propidium iodide staining (PI) and Western blotting confirmed that ZA significantly disrupts the ability of ETX to form pores or oligomers in MDCK cells. Additionally, ZA decreased the phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane and increased the Ca2+ influx of the cells. Results of density gradient centrifugation suggest that ZA decreased the number of lipid rafts in MDCK membranes, which probably contributed to the attenuation of pore-formation. Moreover, ZA protected mice against ETX in vivo. All mice pre-treated with ZA for 48 h before exposure to an absolute lethal dose of ETX (6400 ng/kg) survived. In summary, these findings provide an innovative method to prevent ETX intoxication. Considering many pore-forming toxins require lipid rafts, we tested and found ZA also inhibited the toxicity of other toxins such as Clostridium perfringens Net B and beta-toxin (CPB) and Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin (Hla). We expect ZA can thus be developed as a broad-spectrum medicine for the treatment of multiple toxins. In addition, other statins, such as lovastatin (LO), also reduced the toxicity of ETX. These findings indicate that statin medicines are potential candidates for preventing and treating multiple toxin-induced diseases.

AB  - A green approach of copper (Cu) contaminated pig manure composting by earthworm Eisenia fetida was optimized. This work aims to assess the relationship between the bio-fertility properties and bioaccumulation of Cu during vermicomposting with five different doses of Cu. The optimal concentration of copper largely promoted the enrich-ment of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but the biological activities of earthworms could be inhibited once the Cu concentration exceed the threshold. When the Cu doses at 300 mg kg-1, the nutrient recovery rate (Irecovery) of available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium reached their highest value, concomitant with largest C/N ratio re-duced at 46.01 %. Moreover, nutrients recovery mechanism of total phosphorus increased up to 0.11 % h-1 and higher bioaccumulations in faces and intestine were detected by 1.79 and 0.99, respectively, during vermicomposting. The maximal enzyme activity rates (kmax) indicate that the enzyme activities, such as ROS and SOD, are sensitive bioindicators, which can be used to estimate the stress response of earthworms and Cu biotoxicity. The maximum spe-cific growth rate (mu max) of the actinomycetes (TAct) increased gradually from 0.02 to 0.04 with the increase of Cu doses, but total fungi (TF) showed different response to mu max, which decreased firstly and then increased. It was demonstrated that Cu influenced the gut microbial community to vary the bio-fertility properties and bioaccumulation of Cu in the pig manure. All the findings refer that the vermicomposting could be the sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - The widespread application of biogas projects generates substantial amounts of waste fermentation residue. Further treatment of fermentation residues facilitates resource utilization, ensures safe disposal, and is anticipated to enhance the economic returns of biogas projects. Herein, catalytic liquefaction of pig manure fermentation residue to produce biocrude oil was investigated using various alkaline catalysts at 340 degrees C with ethanol as the solvent. Biocrude oils were analyzed by elemental analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), thermogravimetric analysis, and kinetic analysis. The maximum biocrude oil yield (45.24 wt %) was obtained with the KOH catalyst. Additionally, the biocrude oil produced by the catalysis of CaO exhibited the maximum higher heating value at 44.18 MJ/kg. GC-MS results showed that KOH and K2CO3 considerably increased the content of phenols and hydrocarbons in the biocrude while reducing nitrogenous compounds. All alkaline catalysts effectively reduced the activation energy of biocrude oil compared to biocrude oil without catalyst. The maximum reduction in activation energy (18.73 %) was achieved with the addition of Na2CO3. More importantly, adding CaO not only increased the yield and higher heating value of biocrude oil but also reduced nitrogenous compounds and activation energy, improving the overall yield and quality. Overall, this work provides an effective and promising method to convert pig manure fermentation residue into green highquality biocrude oil, simultaneously providing an economical and environmentally friendly waste management strategy for the fermentation industry.

AB  - As in the rest of Europe, the Belgian boar population has been tending to increase, posing new challenges to management by hunting. Moreover, in autumn 2018, the African Swine Fever (ASF) virus penetrated Belgian territory. In response to this so-called overpopulation and to this health crisis, wild boars were massively culled by hunters and other nature managers. The wild boar was then debated by some stakeholders as a sensitive animal and that its welfare mattered even if it must still be killed. In this article, we explore the management of wild boar through a qualitative sociological survey focusing on damage to the welfare of wild animals and ways of limiting it. This survey is part of an innovative process launched by the Walloon Region and the Walloon Council for Animal Welfare (CWBEA). It was conducted in order to qualitatively describe current hunting practices and their impact on animal welfare; it then integrated knowledge from the human sciences into the CWBEA's work; and, finally, those from the hunting world were invited to debate with the usual animal welfare advocates and managers. By identifying, based on the knowledge of hunting stakeholders and wildlife specialists, a multitude of issues and avenues for action to limit the harm to the welfare of wild boars, this paper highlights the relevance of an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach to the welfare issues of wild animals. It supports the hypothesis that animal welfare advocates can work toward establishing new norms in human/nonhuman relationships in collaboration with hunters but also to include wild animals-wild boars in this case-as sentient beings whose welfare must be considered and debated in discussions on global health.

AB  - The hole-board test has been used to assess working and reference memory in a variety of species, but not in cattle. We developed and applied a modified hole-board test for dairy calves. Fifteen bottles were evenly spaced along three walls of a test arena; 11 of these were empty and 4 were 'baited' with milk. Calves were exposed daily (over an 11-day learning period) to the test arena with the location of the baited bottles held constant; the location of the 4 baited bottles was then changed and calves were re-trained on these new locations (over a 7-day re-learning period). Working memory (no. of revisits to the baited set), general working memory (no. of revisits to the whole set), and reference memory (avoidance of non-baited bottles) were assessed daily. Performance significantly improved during the learning period for reference and general working memory. Working memory tended to improve, albeit non-significantly. The change in bottle location initially reduced all performance measures, but these subsequently improved during the 7-day re-learning period. These results indicate that a modified hole-board test can be used to assess calf cognition, and thus may be helpful in future research designed to investigate the effects of housing and rearing conditions on cognition.

AB  - The commercial utilization of genetically modified crops expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins requires careful assessment of the potential impact on non-target organisms. To assess the potential ecological impact of the Bt insect-resistant cotton variety A26-5 (expressing the Cry1Ac/1Ab protein), we tested whether there was transmission of Cry1Ac toxin through the food chain from cotton to the herbivorous prey Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) through to the non-target predatory insect Arma chinensis (Fallou). A small amount of Cry1Ac protein was detected in H. armigera and A. chinensis, indicating that Cry1Ac could be transmitted to A. chinensis. However, no differences were found in survival rate, development, or fecundity of A. chinensis after treatment with Bt-fed or Bt-free H. armigera. Cry1Ac exposure did not affect detoxification genes expression in A. chinensis, which is likely related to our finding that Cry1Ac could not bind to receptors in the midgut. Taken together, these results show that the Bt cotton A26-5 has few, if any, toxic effects on A. chinensis.

AB  - This paper presents the first application of mammal tooth enamel carbonate stable isotope analysis for the purpose of investigating late Pleistocene-early Holocene environmental change in an Australian archaeological context. Stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope ratios were analyzed from archaeological and modern spectacled hare wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) and hill kangaroo (Osphranter robustus) tooth enamel carbonates from Boodie Cave on Barrow Island in Western Australia. delta O-18 results track the dynamic paleoecological history at Boodie Cave including a clear shift towards increasing aridity preceding the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum and a period of increased humidity in the early to mid-Holocene. Enamel delta C-13 reflects divergent species feeding ecology and may imply a long-term shift toward increasing diversity in vegetation structure. This study contributes new data to the carbonate-isotope record for Australian fauna and demonstrates the significant potential of stable isotope based ecological investigations for tracking paleoenvironment change to inter-strata resolution.

AB  - More than 90% of spermatozoa of boars in pork producing countries is stored in liquid at 17 degrees C; however, the quality of these spermatozoa is affected by bacterial breeding and oxidative damage. This study analyzed sperm quality and sperm capacitation after storage to study the effects of the effects of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) supplementation on seminal plasma (SP)-free sperm preservation. We investigated the effects of adding 20, 50, 100 and 200 mu g/mL of ZnO NPs to a seminal free boar sperm diluent over a 7-day period at 17 degrees C to assess the changes in non-capacitated/capacitated sperm quality parameters, antioxidant capacity, ATP content and extent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The addition of different doses of ZnO NPs to stored sperm did not induce significant effects on the sperm motility and ATP content when compared to the sperm without ZnO NPs treatment. However, the addition of 50, 100, 200 mu g/mL ZnO NPs to stored sperm improved total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (p < 0.05). ZnO NPs also reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the preserved sperm (p < 0.05). Moreover, our results indicate that the supplementation of 50 mu g/mL ZnO NPs to preserved sperm improved the sperm membrane integrity (p < 0.05). ZnO NPs exerted protective effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, especially with regards to membrane proteins. Following incubation and capacitation, sperm exhibited good levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and ATP levels with high T-AOC and CuZn-SOD activity and low MDA content. ZnO NPs exerted protective capacity to a preservation extender used for SP-free boar sperm during storage at 17 degrees C. The optimal concentration of ZnO NPs for preservation extender was 50 mu g/mL.

AB  - In recent years, a dynamic increase in environmental pollution with textile waste has been observed. Natural textile waste has great potential for environmental applications. This work identifies potential ways of sustainably managing natural textile waste, which is problematic waste from sheep farming or the cultivation of fibrous plants. On the basis of textile waste, an innovative technology was developed to support water saving and plant vegetation- biodegradable water-absorbing geocomposites (BioWAGs). The major objective of this study was to determine BioWAG effectiveness under field conditions. The paper analyses the effect of BioWAGs on the increments in fresh and dry matter, the development of the root system, and the relative water content (RWC) of selected grass species. The conducted research confirmed the high efficiency of the developed technology. The BioWAGs increased the fresh mass of grass shoots by 230-420% and the root system by 130-200% compared with the control group. The study proved that BioWAGs are a highly effective technology that supports plant vegetation and saves water. Thanks to the reuse of waste materials, the developed technology is compatible with the assumptions of the circular economy and the goals of sustainable development.

AB  - Age influences host-plant quality, which is a key determinant of the fitness of herbivorous insects and hence biological control agents of invasive plants. We assessed the effect of host-plant age on the performance of the root-feeding flea beetle Heikertingerella sp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae), which was recently approved for release against the invasive tree Tecoma stans (L.) Juss ex Kunth var. stans (Bignoniaceae) in South Africa. Using similar-sized plants that were aged from one to three years, our aim was to determine an optimal host-plant age to facilitate mass-rearing of the beetle for impending releases. While significantly more F-1 progeny were produced with increasing plant age, presumably due to larger root masses in progressively older plants, plant age did not influence the size of the F-1 adults. There was no significant effect of plant age on the survival and percentage of leaves damaged by the P-1 adults. Tecoma stans plants of all ages produced significantly fewer leaves when exposed to feeding by Heikertingerella sp. adults and their larval progeny, relative to the unexposed control plants. Irrespective of plant age, adults displayed higher feeding intensity on the younger leaves at the top sections of the plants than on the older leaves on the middle and bottom sections. Although plants of all three ages were suitable for adult feeding and survival in quarantine cultures, progressively older plants are best suited for F-1 progeny production and therefore for the mass-rearing of Heikertingerella sp. for releases.

AB  - Phenological match/mismatch between cultivated plants and their pest could impact pest infestation dynamics in the field. To explore how such match/mismatch of plant and pest phenologies may interact with plant defense dynamics, we studied the infestation dynamics of maize by one of its main pests in Europe, the European Corn Borer (Ostrinia nubilalis; Lepidoptera: Crambidae). A two-year field experiment was carried out on a collection of 23 maize inbred lines contrasted for their earliness. Each inbred line was sown at three different dates in order to expose different developmental stages of maize to natural European corn borer infestation. The effect of the sowing date depended on the inbred line, the pest generation, and the year. In 2021, the final pest incidence ranged from 36% to 91% depending on inbred lines and sowing date. In 2022, it ranged from 2% to 77%. This variability in final pest incidence can be related to variations in plant development during plant exposure to pest infestation. However, this relationship was not straightforward. Indeed, the shape and intensity of the relationship depended on the timing of the onset of the pest infestation. When infestation occurred while plants were in a vegetative stage, a nonlinear relationship between development and pest incidence was observed with the least and most developed plants being the most infested. When infestation occurred when all plants were in the mature phase, the most developed plants were the least infested. Our results highlight the effect of plant-pest phenological match/mismatch on pest infestation dynamics and underline the importance of taking plant-pest interactions into account to propose relevant control strategies.

AB  - Forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a C4 cereal crop with excellent quality, which is widely cultivated in many countries and regions. Acid detergent fiber is widely found in the stem and leaf tissues of plant, which is the main substance affecting the digestibility of livestock. It has a very important impact on the milk yield and quality of cows, dairy sheep and pigs. In order to further understand its genetic mechanism, we re-sequenced 206 forage sorghum germplasms from different regions of the world and identified 14,570,430 SNPs and 1,967,033 indels. Based on SNP markers, we analyzed the population genetic structure and identified the gene loci related to acid detergent fiber content by genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). Genetic relationship between materials showed that Asian and American sorghum varieties, breeding lines and improved varieties were more diverse, while European varieties were relatively more closely related. These findings provide new clues and directions for further study. GWAS revealed that 8 QTLs harboring 91 genes were found to be associated with acid detergent fiber content. These genes were significantly enriched into 6 major genes involved in cell membrane material transport or enzymes, showing a regional distribution. The findings provide a basis for us to understand the origin and spread of haplotypes related to acid detergent fiber content. The findings will accelerate the study of genetic gain of acid detergent fiber content and help breeders to improve feed quality and stress tolerance of forage sorghum.

AB  - Hazardous chemicals are commonly found in cereals and cereal-based products. However, most studies focus on the individual effects of these mycotoxins or metals, rather than their combined toxicity. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of cadmium (Cd) and ochratoxin A (OTA) on intestinal barrier integrity using Caco-2 cells and pig small intestinal epithelial (PSI) cells as models of intestinal epithelial cells and to measure alterations in cell survival and barrier integrity. The combined effects on cell viability were assessed in terms of a combination of index values. These findings showed that co-exposure to Cd + OTA had synergistic effects on Caco-2 and PSI cells at 25%, 50%, and 75% inhibitory concentrations (IC25, IC50, and IC75, respectively) against cell viability. Individual Cd and OTA treatments had no effect, but combined Cd + OTA exposure resulted in synergistic down-regulation of paracellular apical junction complex proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and E-cadherin. The current findings indicate that the combined effects of OTA +Cd may have consequences at the gut level, which should not be underestimated when considering their risk to human health.

AB  - Understanding uneven patterns of forest use and tracking changes in the composition of forest residents are both important for sensitive forest policy and management. With increases in migration streams in several tropical forest regions, we need corresponding information about how new immigrants are influencing humanenvironment relations in sites of ecological significance. We use data from over 6500 household surveys collected by the Wildlife Conservation Society in three sites in Central Africa: the forests surrounding Nouabale ' Ndoki National Park and Lac Te ' le ' Community Reserve in the Republic of Congo, and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We compare household characteristics, livelihoods, and forest use among recent migrants (arriving within the past decade), longer-established households, and households belonging to an Indigenous group. We find that recent migrants are less likely to engage in forest-harvest-based livelihoods and harvest several types of forest foods and fibers less frequently than other households. Recent migrants also tend to be wealthier, younger, and over-represented in salaried jobs. Meanwhile, Indigenous households are 3 to 16 times more likely to participate in a forest-based livelihood, depending on the site. Other consistent predictors of forest harvest include village, age of the household head, household size, whether a household is femaleheaded (-), and wealth (-). Many trends hold broadly across all three sites, but there are also site-specific patterns related to differences in remoteness and economic opportunities. We conclude with reflections about what the changing make-up of forest-proximate communities might mean for forest management and governance.

AB  - Due to increasing global population, the need of focusing on land cover and land uses by human beings is felt. Nowadays, most of the researchers and scientists are found showing much attention in agricultural landscapes because the effectual land-cover (LC) mapping provides the correct information regarding the land uses and land cover. Crop classification is one of the essential issues in the agriculture field because it affects the government and private agencies economically. The number of methodologies exist to classify the crop images from the remotely sensed image, but the traditional methodologies do not perform well due to some factors, like blurring effect, noise, etc. We have proposed an Adaptive Fuzzy-Centred Denoising Filter (AFDF) and Extended Elman Neural Network ((EN2)-N-2) to enhance visualization of crop image to crop classification in order to overcome traditional techniques RSI. The remote-sensing crop images have been considered in the proposed work, and the AFDF preprocesses the image to eradicate the noise. After that, the Jaccard Coefficient-based Shared Nearest Neighbour (JCSNN) segments the object as preprocessed images. The LTrP, DWT, GLCM, and shape features are extracted as the optimal features chosen by Enhanced Elephant Herding Optimization ((EHO)-H-2). Lastly, the crop is classified using the (EN2)-N-2 classifier. The high-resolution images were utilized for the experiments to validate the proposed work. At last, various techniques have been compared against the proposed system, and outcomes have shown significant enhancement in accuracy and reliability. The proposed system obtains 88.01% F-measure, 95.2% accuracy with lesser FPR values that are greater when analogized to all prevalent methods. The advantage of using proposed effective protocols, like Adaptive Fuzzy-centred Denoising Filter and also (EN2)-N-2 classifier, boost-up the crop images' visualization and also crop categorization in remote-sensing images.

AB  - Gaseous emissions (i.e. Greenhouse gases (CH 4 and N 2 O) and NH 3 ) were a serious environmental problem during composting. Magnesium salt could effectively reduce NH 3 emission with the principle of struvite crystallization. Biochar, particularly modified biochar, could be served as a new type of adsorbent for gaseous reduction. In this study, Mg -modified biochars were successfully prepared with different magnesium to biochar mass ratios, and then used as additives in pig manure composting. Mg -modified biochars exhibited excellent properties in terms of functional groups, porous structure and composition. Adding Mg -modified biochar improved composting performance, and thus synergistically reduced CH 4 , N 2 O and NH 3 emissions. Especially, Mg -modified biochar prepared with the magnesium to biochar mass ratio of 0.50 (MBC-0.50) achieved the best reduction effects during pig manure composting. Both additive and composting phases could influence the bacterial composition by regulating temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and moisture content. Besides biochar adsorption, NH 3 could be further reduced with the formation of struvite crystallization (MgNH 4 PO 4 & sdot;6H 2 O) by adding Mgmodified biochar. Pristine and modified biochars inhibited the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria (e.g. Pseudoxanthomonas and norank-f-Methylococcaceae ) and anaerobe methanogenic bacteria (e.g. Jeotgalibaca and Lactobacillus ) to further mitigate N 2 O and CH 4 emissions.

   The current study described the evolution of the gut microbiota of an indigenous pig breeds, Ningxiang pigs (NXP), from one week before weaning to the end of nursery. The results showed that dietary factors mainly drove the evolution of the microbial community of NXP. Our results contributed to a better understanding of the evolutionary characteristics and influencing factors of the gut microbiota of indigenous pig breeds.
   The current study aimed to investigate the evolution of gut microbiota and its influencing factors for NXP in youth. The results showed that Shannon index increased from d 21 to d 28 whereas the ACE index increased from d 21 until d 60. Firmicutes, mainly Lactobacillus dominated on d 21. The Bacteroides and Spirochetes showed highest relative abundance on d 28. Fiber-degrading bacteria, mainly Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Oscillospiraceae_UCG-002, dominated the microbial communities at d 28 and d 35. The microbial communities at d 60 and d 75 contained more Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Terrisporobacter and Oscillospiraceae_UCG-005 than other ages, which had significantly positive correlations with acetate and total SCFAs concentration. In conclusion, the evolution of gut microbiota was mainly adapted to the change of dietary factors during NXP growth. The response of fiber-degrading bacteria at different stages may help NXP better adapt to plant-derived feeds.

AB  - The initial running speed of the pig during gas-liquid two-phase pipeline pigging can significantly influence the velocities of both gas and liquid phases within the pipeline. However, due to the complexity and limited understanding of these velocity variations, developing an effective operational plan for pigging becomes challenging. To enhance pigging efficiency and effectively seal the pig, it is crucial to monitor the velocity variations in the gas-liquid phase within the pipeline. In this study, an experimental platform was established to facilitate precise observation of these variations. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology was employed for a comprehensive understanding of gas-liquid two-phase velocities during pig operation in the pipeline. The experimental results demonstrated that increasing both the velocity and the initial liquid level height of the pig resulted in a corresponding augmentation of velocity fluctuation range. Specifically, at a holdup rate of 30%, there was a 10% reduction in the maximum liquid-phase velocity, while at a holdup rate of 25%, this reduction amounted to 16% compared to the pigging velocity.

AB  - From the perspective of interactions in the human-animal-ecosystem, the study and control of pathogenic bacteria that can cause disease in animals and humans is the core content of "One Health". In order to test the effect of human disturbance (HD) on the health risk of pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARBs) to wild animals and transfer risk of the PARBs from wild animals to humans, golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were used as sentinel animals. Metagenomic analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of PARBs in the gut microbiota of golden snub-nosed monkeys. Then, the total contribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) of the PARBs were used to assess the health risk of PARBs to golden snub-nosed monkeys, and the antimicrobial drug resistance and bacterial infectious disease of PARBs were determined to assess the transfer risk of PARBs from golden snub-nosed monkeys to humans. There were 18 and 5 kinds of PARBs in the gut microbiota of golden snub-nosed monkeys under HD (HD group) and wild habitat environments (W group), respectively. The total health risks of PARBs to the W group and the HD group were -28.5 x 10(-3) and 125.8 x 10(-3), respectively. There were 12 and 16 kinds of KEGG pathways of human diseases in the PARBs of the W group and the HD group, respectively, and the gene numbers of KEGG pathways in the HD group were higher than those in the W group. HD increased the pathogenicity of PARBs to golden snub-nosed monkeys, and the PARBs in golden snub-nosed monkeys exhibited resistance to lincosamide, aminoglycoside, and streptogramin antibiotics. If these PARBs transfer from golden snub-nosed monkeys to humans, then humans may acquire symptoms of pathogens including Tubercle bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia, Pertussis, and Vibrio cholera.

AB  - Oridonin, a natural terpenoid isolated from the leaves of Isodon rubescens (Hemsley) H.Hara, is widely used in oriental medicine for its anticancer properties across various cancer types. Despite its prevalent use, the toxic effects of oridonin on male reproduction, particularly its impact on sperm functions and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. This study aimed to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of oridonin on sperm functions. We initially treated Duroc boar spermatozoa with varying concentrations of oridonin (0, 5, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mu M) and incubated them to induce capacitation. We then assessed cell viability and several sperm functions, including sperm motility and motion kinematics, capacitation status, and ATP levels. We also analyzed the expression levels of proteins associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway and phosphotyrosine proteins. Our results indicate that oridonin adversely affects most sperm functions in a dose-dependent manner. We observed significant decreases in AKT, p-AKT (Thr308), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), p-PDK1, and pPI3K levels following oridonin treatment, alongside an abnormal increase in phosphotyrosine proteins. These findings suggest that oridonin may disrupt normal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by inhibiting the PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis, thus potentially harming sperm functions. Consequently, we recommend considering the reproductive toxicity of oridonin when using it as a therapeutic agent.

AB  - Applying organic waste and inorganic additives during composting can be an effective and easy-to-control strategy for optimizing humification, fi cation, maturation, and the availability of essential mineral elements in compost. In this respect, this study aims to evaluate the effect of organic (olive-mill waste and horse manure) and inorganic (phosphogypsum) additives on the evolution of maturity indices, aromatic compounds, and nutrient availability during composting. Four mixtures [horse manure + green waste (M1), olive-mill + green waste (M2), sewage-sludge + phos-phogypsum + green waste (M3), and green waste (M4)] were carried out. Physicochemical (temperature, pH, phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio), infrared-spectroscopic, and phytotoxicity were monitored. The results showed that (in)organic additives have a positive effect on maturity and humification fi cation indices, pH stability, and the phosphorus and nitrogen availability in the composts produced. The horse manure additive reduced the carbon and increased the nitrogen, reducing the C/N ratio. Phosphogypsum and olive-mill reduced phytotoxicity, boosting the nitrogen and phosphorus availability of in composts. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis revealed that phosphogypsum and olive-mill addition improved the aromatic compounds and reduced the aliphatic ones in M3 and M4 com-posts. These results suggest new approaches to promoting maturity and stability, as well as phosphorus and nitrogen availability in composts, through better use of organic waste and inorganic additives in composting.

AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to compare BSF larvae flooding technique and goat manure application for baglog waste bioconversion. The compared parameters were the effectiveness of technique, the quality of compost produced, and the suitability as a growing media and nutrients supplier. Method: A total of four treatments were applied to assess the bioconversion process and the resulting compost quality. The effectiveness of compost application as a growing media and nutrient supplier for cultivating Bok choy (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) was also evaluated. Results: The results showed that the highest waste reduction percentage was found in treatment P2 (D = 54.48%; WRI = 2.59%/day). Furthermore, BSF larvae flooding technique was identified as the most effective in reducing the fly population index. Goat manure application in treatment P4 (-0.2) yielded the lowest odor of hedonic scales. The quality of compost produced by all treatments was analyzed, and the results showed conformity with the Indonesian National Standard for N, P, K, and Ca content. Bok choy cultivated using compost treatment P2 had the highest plant height (16.3 +/- 1.5b cm), leaves count (13 +/- 2a leaves), wet weight (187.7 +/- 5.8b g). Conclusion: BSF larvae flooding technique was more effective in reducing the fly population index and provided a significant reduction in baglog and food waste. On the other hand, goat manure application was more effective in reducing odor levels. Compost produced by treatment P2 showed the best growth parameters for cultivating bok choy.

AB  - Oviducts contain various nutrients that provide energy during oocyte development. This study aimed to improve the efficiency of in vitro reproduction using extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by the oviduct epithelial cells of sika deer (Cervus nippon). Surprisingly, the uptake of deer oviduct epithelial cell extracellular vesicles (DOEC-EVs) by cumulus-oocyte complexes, which were encapsulated by dense cumulus cells (CCs), occurred only in CCs during maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that DOEC-EVs are transported to oocytes through CCs to exert their effects. We first investigated the effects of DOEC-EVs on the expansion capacity of the cumulus-oocyte complexes, as well as cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, and lactate and pyruvate levels in CCs, and examined reactive oxygen species levels, mitochondrial function, and key gene expression. The results showed that DOEC-EVs regulated cell cycle progression, promoted proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and improved antioxidant capacity and glycolysis, and through the oocyte first polar body excretion rate, reactive oxygen levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential, it was shown that CC promoted in vitro oocyte maturation, improved the antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function of oocytes, and promoted parthenogenetic embryo development. These results suggest that DOEC-EVs improve the efficiency of oocyte development in deer in vitro by acting on CCs, laying the foundation for further research on in vitro deer reproduction.

AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems and organic manure application are vital strategies for sustainable agriculture. Understanding carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling from crops, through animal digestion to manure, and subsequently to soil is essential. However, studies on these processes remain scarce due to high costs and technical complexities associated with preparing dual-labeled (C-13 and N-15) manure, which deter researchers from conducting such experiments. Our study pioneers dual-labeled manure preparation and provides a methodological framework for simultaneously tracing C and N cycling from feedstuffs to manure in long-term nutrient cycling research. Key findings include the distribution of C-13 and N-15 across different maize components (kernel, cob, leaves, stalk, and root), and goat manure, and compost. The study revealed the transformation and recovery of C and N from maize to manure. For instance, 31.7% of manure C and 27.3% of manure N originated from maize feed, with 11.8% of feed C-13 and 28.6% of feed N-15 recovered in manure, and 16.5% and 25.8% recovered in compost, respectively. Composting enhanced C retention and stabilized N, improving nutrient cycling efficiency. While no correlation between C-13 and N-15 was observed in maize tissues, a strong linear relationship (R-2 = 0.9908, p < 0.001) was identified in goat manure during a 10-day feeding period. These findings provide a foundation for future studies tracing C and N cycling from manure compost, invaluable for refining C and N cycling models. Future studies should extend the tracing period across diverse crop-livestock systems to validate these findings.

AB  - Polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorodibenzo-furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) enter the food chain from the environment. In this study, we report the 2008-2018 time-trends in the PCDD/F and DL-PCB contamination of milk from buffaloes fed on local forage in rural areas of the Campania region. Validated according to QA/QC criteria, the dataset (N = 808 on a total of 2068 samples, after excluding follow-up results and outliers) was computed on the upper-bound value pgWHO-TEQ(2005) g(-1) fat. We assessed time-trends and assayed baseline contamination levels, which displayed log-normal distribution. A significant decreasing trend (p < 0.01) was observed from 2008 to 2009 and 2010; the P50-P95 range fell from 2.37-8.48 pg WHO-TEQ(2005) g(-1) fat (N = 393) in 2008 to 1.73-4.61 in 2009 (N = 86) and to 0.67-1.46 in 2010 (N = 42). From 2010 to 2018 (N = 329), no significant variation was found among years and the related dataset fitted a log-normal distribution (p < 0.05). Occurrence descriptors indicated that the baseline contamination of dairy products (mean = 0.54; P50-P95 = 0.47-1.24) in the Campania Region was well below the EU regulatory limit in force (5.5 pg WHO-TEQ(2005) g(-1) fat). Given the Tolerable Weekly Intake of 2 pg WHO-TEQ kg(-1) body weight (bw) proposed by the EFSA for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs, this level of baseline contamination is discussed with regard to the orientation of food safety and food security risk connected with buffalo mozzarella cheese production.

AB  - As the range of Ixodes scapularis Say expands, host abundance and land use can play important roles in regions where ticks and their associated pathogens are emerging. Small mammal hosts serve as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, with Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque often considered a primary reservoir. A sympatric species Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner is also a competent reservoir and is notoriously difficult to differentiate from P. leucopus. Anthropogenic land use can alter host and habitat availability, potentially changing tick exposure risk. We tested the hypotheses that tick infestation and pathogen prevalence differ between the two Peromyscus spp. and that host-seeking I. scapularis density and pathogen prevalence differ across land use and ecotone gradients. We live trapped small mammals and collected ticks across 3 land-use classifications and ecotones in Maine, an emergent area for tick-borne disease. We tested each small mammal and tick sample for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti. While both Peromyscus spp. serve as hosts for immature ticks, P. leucopus exhibited a higher tick infestation frequency and intensity. We did not detect any significant difference in pathogen infection prevalence between the two species. The density of I. scapularis nymphs and the density of infected nymphs did not differ significantly between land-use types, though did differ across ecotones. We also noted a significant north/south gradient, with higher tick densities and pathogen prevalence at the southern end of the study area. Our study highlights the potential variability in tick density and pathogen prevalence across fine spatial scales within an emerging region for tick-borne disease.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route and is considered an anthropozoonosis. Genotypes with zoonotic potential (mainly HEV-3 and HEV-4) can be transmitted through the consumption of raw or undercooked pork, wild boar, deer meat, or processed products. This study aims to explore methodologies for processing meat samples to establish a protocol for HEV detection in meat. The analysis of pre-analytical conditions involved comparing homogenization with PBS versus TRIzol, comparing tissue disruption methods (ultra-turrax versus mortar and pestle), and assessing nucleic acid extraction techniques (spin columns and magnetic beads) across three types of artificially contaminated meat matrices: pork, salmon (fish-meat), and salami. Each test included a process control virus (PP7) and an HEV transcript. Molecular detection was performed via RT-qPCR. Results indicated that TRIzol provided better recovery rates for homogenization, while spin columns were the most effective option for RNA extraction. Both the ultra-turrax homogenizer and the mortar-pestle methods were effective for pork and fish-meat homogenization, while the use of the UT yielded superior results for salami. HEV recovery rates were 36.7%, 26.3%, and 34.1% for salami, salmon, and pork meat, respectively. In conclusion, we reached a simple and reliable protocol for the detection of RNA-HEV from three meat matrices. This method, which includes homogenization with TRIzol, mechanical tissue disruption, and RNA extraction using spin columns followed by real-time PCR, can be applied in future studies to evaluate HEV prevalence in food sources and contribute to the discussion about HEV detection methodologies.

AB  - Simple Summary Velvet antler from sika (and other deer species) is a highly valued nutraceutical in traditional Chinese medicine, a market of hundreds of million dollars. Thus, in this case, and in deer breeding in general, reducing the feeding cost of male sika deer is important to improving the profitability of breeding for velvet antlers. Spent mushroom substrate (SMS) is a waste culture medium for mushrooms. The improper handling of SMS causes environmental pollution. Since SMS can be digested and absorbed by ruminants such as sika deer, replacing SMS with a sika deer concentrate supplement can fully utilize the waste resource of SMS and reduce the production cost of velvet antler. At present, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) is a waste resource that is producing a pollution problem in China, and which has some use as animal feed or fertilizer, has not been assessed as a feed for deer. The purpose of this study is to expand the feed of male sika deer and reduce the feeding cost by using the waste resource of SMS. The 10% concentrated supplement was replaced with SMS and the feed intake, apparent digestibility, blood index and velvet production of male sika deer were measured. As the results showed, compared to the control group, the substitution of SMS for 10% of the concentrate supplement decreased the concentration of IgA (p < 0.01), replacing 10% concentrated supplement with SMS of Pleurotus ostreatus (SMS-MP) reduced the intake of organic matter (OMI) and improved the digestibility of ether extract (EE), while replacing 10% concentrated supplement with SMS of Flammulina velutipes (SMS-MF) had no effect on apparent nutrient digestibility, feed intake, velvet antler production, and biochemical indexes. In conclusion, SMS had no effect on serum biochemical indexes and the ratio of the feed weight of the deer supplement to the weight of velvet antler (p > 0.05). At the same time, SMS could reduce the feed consumption and improve the economy by using SMS as a waste resource.

AB  - The bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.), is a major pest of Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.), causing enormous economic losses globally. The adult stage of the I. typographus has a complex life cycle (callow and sclerotized); the callow beetles feed ferociously, whereas sclerotized male beetles are more aggressive and pioneers in establishing new colonies. We conducted a comparative proteomics study to understand male and female digestion and detoxification processes in callow and sclerotized beetles. Proteome profiling was performed using high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of >3000 proteins were identified from the bark beetle gut, and among them, 539 were differentially abundant (fold change +/- 2, FDR <0.05) between callow and sclerotized beetles. The differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) mainly engage with binding, catalytic activity, anatomical activity, hydrolase activity, metabolic process, and carbohydrate metabolism, and hence may be crucial for growth, digestion, detoxification, and signalling. We validated selected DAPs with RT-qPCR. Gut enzymes such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CYC), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase (EST) play a crucial role in the I. typographus for detoxification and digesting of host allelochemicals. We conducted enzyme activity assays with them and observed a positive correlation of CYC and GST activities with the proteomic results, whereas EST activity was not fully correlated. Furthermore, our investigation revealed that callow beetles had an upregulation of proteins associated with juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis and chitin metabolism, whereas sclerotized beetles exhibited an upregulation of proteins linked to fatty acid metabolism and the TCA cycle. These distinctive patterns of protein regulation in metabolic and functional processes are specific to each developmental stage, underscoring the adaptive responses of I. typographicus in overcoming conifer defences and facilitating their survival. Taken together, it is the first gut proteomic study comparing males and females of callow and sclerotized I. typographus, shedding light on the adaptive ecology at the molecular level. Furthermore, the information about bark beetle handling of nutritionally limiting and defence-rich spruce phloem diet can be utilized to formulate RNAi-mediated beetle management.

AB  - Six fern species are newly reported or substantiated as indigenous to New Caledonia: Davallia sessilifolia, Dicranopteris caudata, Dryopteris arborescens, Pteris terminalis, Trichomanes atrovirens, and T. kurzii. This is the first record of Dryopteris for New Caledonia. Our findings are based on extensive fieldwork, inspection of specimens in relevant herbaria including type material, comparisons with authoritative references, and phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA sequences. The global and New Caledonian distribution, morphological diagnosis, and conservation status are given for each species. Davallia sessilifolia, Dryopteris arborescens, Pteris terminalis, and Trichomanes atrovirens are provisionally assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered in New Caledonia, because they have few populations that are each of limited size, and some are also threatened by fire or introduced deer and pigs. While Dicranopteris caudata occurs in open habitats, the others are largely confined to humid habitats at high elevation, or to the wetter forested valleys of north-east Grande Terre. These are the most likely habitats in which to find more populations of these species, but also other new species records and new endemic ferns. Alongside the recent description of several new endemic species, the addition of so many non-endemic indigenous species to a fern and lycophyte flora of approximately 300 species is an indication that considerable work remains to be done in documenting these plants in New Caledonia.

AB  - Outbreaks of disease at the wildlife-livestock interface may require management interventions. Where they involve exotic/non-endemic pathogens in wildlife, then such plans may need to be rapidly conceived and implemented to prevent further disease spread. However, detailed information on the distribution of infection is likely to be absent, whilst limited resources and tools, and ethical considerations impose constraints on what is possible and proportionate.We describe four considerations to inform decision-making on whether to intervene. With reference to two recent examples (bovine tuberculosis in badgers in an otherwise disease-free area, and African swine fever in wild boar in central Europe), we outline six steps to guide implementation.In both examples, a Disease Control Area was defined by determining a minimum infected area (MIA) and a buffer zone based on wildlife ecology and the potential for unrecorded spread of infection. The total area was the subject of management intervention, with the level of infection used to inform adaptive management.The MIA is defined as the minimum area that could contain all infected wildlife, given our current level of information, with a surrounding buffer zone to account for the possibility of further onward spread. In our examples, the zones were defined using a combination of field data and existing knowledge of host spatial organization and movement.The MIA (plus buffer zone) approach provides a framework for optimizing the targeting of resources in a proportionate response to a disease outbreak. Where infected animals occur outside the MIA, our examples show how wildlife management has been adapted. In principle, this approach is suitable for the delivery of disease outbreak control in wildlife, whether through culling, vaccination or other forms of control.

AB  - Background C. Oleifera is among the world's largest four woody plants known for their edible oil production, yet the contribution rate of improved varieties is less than 20%. The species traditional breeding is lengthy cycle (20-30 years), occupation of land resources, high labor cost, and low accuracy and efficiency, which can be enhanced by molecular marker-assisted selection. However, the lack of high-quality molecular markers hinders the species genetic analysis and molecular breeding. Results Through quantitative traits characterization, genetic diversity assessment, and association studies, we generated a selection population with wide genetic diversity, and identified five excellent high-yield parental combinations associated with four reliable high-yield ISSR markers. Early selection criteria were determined based on kernel fresh weight and cultivated 1-year seedling height, aided by the identification of these 4 ISSR markers. Specific assignment of selected individuals as paternal and maternal parents was made to capitalize on their unique attributes. Conclusions Our results indicated that molecular markers-assisted breeding can effectively shorten, enhance selection accuracy and efficiency and facilitate the development of a new breeding system for C. oleifera.

AB  - Main conclusionSolanum dulcamara primary and adventitious roots showed qualitative and quantitative differences in their steroidal glycosides profile. This opened new venues to evaluate the bioactivity of these molecules in belowground ecosystems.The Solanum genus is characterized by the presence of steroidal glycosides (SGs) that confer herbivore resistance and serve as drug precursors in the pharmaceutical industry. Solanum dulcamara is a self-compatible, sexually reproducing species that produces seeds after buzz-pollination. In addition, primordia on the stem facilitate clonal propagation via adventitious root (AR) formation. ARs contain aerenchyma being developmentally and morphologically different from primary roots (PRs). Therefore, we hypothesized that ARs and PRs have different SG profiles. Aiming to assess differences in SGs profiles in S. dulcamara roots in relation to their origins and morphologies, we used liquid chromatography coupled to electron spray ionization quadruple time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-qToF-MS) to profile SGs from PRs and ARs of seven S. dulcamara individuals. Mass fragmentation pattern analysis indicated the presence of 31 SG-type structures, including those with spirostans and furostans moieties. We assigned the 31 structures to 9 classes of steroidal aglycons (SAgls) that differ in hydroxylation and degree of unsaturation. We found that SAgls were conjugated with di-, tri- and tetra saccharides whereby one compound contained a malonylated sugar. Principle component analysis showed that SG profiles of PRs and ARs separated on the first principal component, supporting our hypothesis. Specifically, PRs contain higher number of SGs than ARs with some compounds exclusively present in PRs. Our results reveal a high level of novel chemodiversity in PRs and ARs of Solanum dulcamara. The knowledge gained will deepen our understanding of SGs biosynthesis and their functional role in plant-environment interactions.

AB  - Expansion of human settlements and development have undeniable impacts on wildlife and habitats. Yet wildlife continues to persist in human-modified environments. While shifting patterns of wildlife landscape use in response to development is well established, less is known about how risk avoidance by animals impacts their resource access. Our research addresses this question by assessing spatial and temporal patterns in access to water resources for savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) relative to anthropogenic features in the Okavango Panhandle of Botswana. We combined GPS collar data from 39 elephants (2014-2018) with spatial data on permanent water sources and human development to quantify patterns of water access. We modelled a multi-scale resource selection function that showed elephants selected water access points in areas with less human development (p < 0.0151). Elephants visited water more evenly across day and night in areas with no buildings nearby, but shifted to a significantly more nocturnal pattern in areas of higher building density (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Analysing spatial and temporal patterns of elephant resource access in the context of anthropogenic features provides compelling insight into the potential consequences of human-modified landscapes on the behaviour, fitness, and persistence of threatened species and our coexistence with them.

AB  - Policies that attempt to balance timber production with non-market values that forests provide are common across the United States. Such is the case in northern Maine, USA, where management of critical areas of mature softwood-dominated forest are regulated through the State's primary wildlife management agency. We use a case study approach with qualitative and quantitative analyses to understand the persistent difficulties encountered by both forest and wildlife managers when implementing this policy. Interviews with foresters and wildlife biologists established the management parameters, and simulated management scenarios compared forest management outcomes with respect to both financial and wildlife habitat provision goals. The model results indicated that there are opportunities for comparable revenues within regulated habitat areas as without, although the returns varied due to legacy of previous management and species composition. More importantly, the interviews revealed that differing habitat metrics used by foresters and biologists are a barrier to communication and management planning, and thus also a barrier to effective policy implementation. We close with thoughts on the applicability of both the methods and results to other situations where an understanding of multiple-use forest policy implementation is desired.

AB  - In the present study, we analysed how geographical distribution of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii VGI in Europe and Mediterranean area has evolved in the last four decades based on the climatic changes, and we tried to predict the scenario for the next decade. Niche modelling by Maxent analysis showed that recent climate changes have significantly affected the distribution of the fungus revealing a gradual expansion of the fundamental niche from 1980 to 2009 followed by an impressive increase in the last decade (2010-2019) during which the environmental surface suitable for the fungal survival was more than doubled. In the next decade, our model predicted an increase in the area of distribution of C. gattii VGI from the coasts of the Mediterranean basin towards the more internal sub-continental areas. On the basis of these predictions, an increase of cases of cryptococcosis due to C. gattii VGI is expected in the next decade and a constant monitoring of the epidemiology of this fungal pathogen represents a crucial strategy to detect the onset of future outbreaks.

AB  - Ectomyelois ceratoniae and Deudorix livia are the main pests of pomegranate Punica granatum L. in Tunisia. This study was carried out to investigate the susceptibility of five Tunisian pomegranate varieties (Tounsi, Guebsi, Gares, Zehri, and Baldi) from two oases (Gafsa and Degache) to infestation by E. ceratoniae and D. livia during fruit ripening. To this end, the physico-chemical properties of these pomegranate varieties were quantified during the ripening period and correlated with insect infestation. The results showed that all varieties were infested by E. ceratoniae and D. livia and that the severity of the infestation depended strongly on the pomegranate variety and the ripening stage of the fruit. It was observed that the infestation caused by E. ceratoniae was early as compared to D. livia on all the pomegranate varieties at two oases conditions. Moreover, results showed that biochemical and physico-chemical properties changed during fruit maturity. The total soluble solids (TSS), sugars, maturity index, fruit peel water content, and fruit weight are significantly increased but the titratable acidity and peel hardness are significantly decreased with ripening stage. The results pointed out that pomegranate infestation varied depending on the morphological changes of the fruit. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between E. ceratoniae and D. livia infestation and fruit juices TSS (r = 0.36 and r = 0.68), maturity index (r = 0.44 and r = 0.35), and total sugar (r = 0.36 and r = 0.67). Analyses also revealed a high negative correlation between fruit peel hardness and D. livia infestation (-0.63). The findings of this research will enhance comprehension regarding the behavior of D. livia and E. ceratoniae, which infest various pomegranate cultivars in Tunisian oases. Consequently, this will facilitate the refinement and implementation of management approaches aimed at addressing both species. For instance, early harvesting of fruits at the onset of ripening, prior to pest activity can significantly reduce levels of pomegranate infestation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three doses of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) for ovarian superstimulation on ovarian response, follicular development and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) collection in llamas. For this purpose, eighteen multiparous non-lactating adult (4-7 yo) female llamas with an average body condition of 2.8 (BCS 1-5) were submitted to a follicular ablation (FA) to induce a new follicular wave emergence. Two days after FA (Day 0), synchronized llamas were randomly allocated to three treatment groups (n = 6/group) and given 500, 750 and 1000 IU of eCG (Novormon (R), Syntex, Buenos Aires, Argentina) per animal respectively to induce ovarian superstimulation. Transrectal ultrasonography were performed on Days 2, 4, and 6; and ovum pick up (OPU) was performed on Day 6. Data was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), repeated measures ANOVA, and 2-tailed Chi-square. The average size (mm) of follicles was greater (p <= 0.05) in the 1000 IU group compared to the other groups. There was a greater (p <= 0.05) number of follicles >= 7 mm in the 1000 IU group compared to the 500 IU group. Number of COCs collected on Day 6 and the COC recovery rate were not different among groups. In conclusion, a single dose of 1000 IU of eCG induced the best ovarian response resulting in larger and greater number of follicles at the time of OPU.

AB  - Most MAGE family genes have been identified on the mammalian genome and are located on the X chromosome. These genes are classified into type I and type II based on their sequence and function. DreNDN was the root of this evolutionary tree. In pigs, type I MAGE genes are predominantly expressed in the testis tissue, and type II MAGE genes are primarily expressed in the brain tissue. These findings are a valuable resource for acquiring insight into the evolution and expression of the MAGE family genes. The melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family found in eukaryotes plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation, spermatogenesis, neural development, etc. This study explored the validation and evolution of MAGE genes in eukaryotic genomes and their distribution and expression patterns in pigs. In total, 249 MAGE genes were found on 13 eukaryotic species. In total, 33, 25, and 18 genes were located on human, mouse, and pig genomes, respectively. We found eight, four, and three tandemly duplicated gene clusters on the human, mouse, and pig genomes, respectively. The majority of MAGE genes in mammals are located on the X chromosome. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MAGE family genes were classified into 11 subfamilies. The NDN gene in zebrafish (DreNDN) was the root of this evolutionary tree. In total, 10 and 11 MAGE genes on human and mouse genomes, respectively, exhibited a collinearity relationship with the MAGE genes on pig genomes. Taking the MAGE family genes in pigs, the MAGE subfamilies had similar gene structures, protein motifs, and biochemical attributes. Using the RNA-seq data of Duroc pigs and Rongchang pigs, we detected that the expression of type I MAGE genes was higher in reproductive tissues, but type II MAGE genes were predominantly expressed in the brain tissue. These findings are a valuable resource for gaining insight into the evolution and expression of the MAGE family genes.

AB  - Long time series of underwater images have become a tool widely used within the benthic ecology research community. The development of new acquisition systems with bigger storing capacities lead researchers and scientists to deploy them for longer periods resulting in large amounts of data. This paper focuses on the first steps of analyzing large numbers of underwater images, which involves assessing the amount of valid data while assuming no technical problems. The question here addressed is how many of the in situ images can reliably be really used for benthic ecology purposes. To answer this question, we propose a method to eliminate nonvalid images and use it with four different sets of time-lapsed images acquired for long periods ranging from 73 to 371 ds in a row. The results show that elimination of between 8% and 22% of the images is possible depending on the data set. The main advantage of the method is easing and accelerating automation of subsequent analysis.

AB  - Survivorship of early life stages is key for the well-being of sea turtle populations, yet studies on animals that distribute around oceanic areas are very challenging. So far, the information on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that use the open NE Atlantic as feeding grounds is scarce. Strandings occurring in oceanic archipelagos can provide relevant information about the biology, ecology and current anthropogenic pressures for megafauna inhabiting the open ocean. In this study, we analysed stranding events of green turtles found in the Azores archipelago to investigate interactions with marine litter. In addition, we quantified and characterized litter items stranded on beaches to provide a direct comparison between the ingested items with the debris found in the environment. A total of 21 juvenile green turtles were found stranded in the region between 2000 and 2020 (size range: 12-49 cm, CCL). Overall, 14% of the animals were entangled in marine litter and 86% of the turtles necropsied had ingested plastic. The mean abundance of items ingested was 27.86 +/- 23.40 and 98% were white/ transparent. Hard plastic fragments between 1 and 25 mm were the most common shape recovered in the turtles, similarly to what was found on the coastline. All of the litter items analysed with pyrolysis GC-MS revealed to be polyethylene (PE). This study provides the first baseline assessment of interactions of plastic litter with juvenile green turtles found at the east edge of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. The combination of these results supports the hypothesis that migratory megafauna that use remote oceanic islands as a feeding ground are exposed to anthropogenic litter contamination dominated by plastics, even when these regions are located far away from big industrial centers or populated cities.

TI  - Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) in Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe: Implementation challenges and practices
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
LA  - English
KW  - LAW-ENFORCEMENT
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring and data-management technologies can enhance the protection of persecuted species, such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana), through providing management-relevant information. Implementing these technologies, however, often presents several capacity and resource challenges for field staff in protected areas. In the Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) is in the process of adopting the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) as law enforcement and data management tool for adaptive management. With the support of several conservation partners, ZPWMA was able to acquire SMART equipment (computers and handheld cyber-tracker devices) as well as train rangers and officers on how to use SMART in the region. Following the training and provision of SMART equipment, most protected areas (6 out of 7) in the Mid-Zambezi Valley have adopted SMART for law enforcement and relevant data are being collected. This study draws from the first-hand experience of training workshops, interviews with field staff, observations from support visits, and discussions with conservation partners in the Zambezi Valley. We observed that the introduction of SMART was marred by (a) technical and capacity challenges, (b) behavioral and human dynamics challenges, and (c) resources challenges. These were linked to ineptness among patrol rangers and officers, discomfort with the new technology, and uneven distribution of resources to implement SMART. To help overcome some of the challenges, we propose the development of an integrated SMART implementation plan, motivation of field staff, learning from implementation models of institutions that have successfully implemented SMART, and the provision of more SMART equipment.

AB  - Simple Summary Artificial insemination (AI) is a powerful tool for animals' genetic improvement. However, its application in sheep remains relatively limited due to inconsistent results, since the success of the method is dependent on many factors. In our study, we investigated the impact of housing conditions during the summer period on the fertility of dairy sheep in Greece, after cervical AI with cooled semen. The pregnancy rate was found to be negatively affected by the ambient temperature and Temperature-Humidity Index inside the shed, space availability, frequency of bedding renewal, and outdoor access. Appropriate housing conditions could help to increase pregnancy rates following AI during the summer months. The objective was to assess the effect of housing conditions during the summer months on the success rates of cervical artificial insemination (AI) with cooled semen, in intensively reared dairy ewes in Greece. The study involved 2083 Lacaune ewes from 23 flocks that were serviced during May to September. An estrous synchronization protocol with the insertion of progestogen sponges for 14 days and eCG administration at sponge removal, was used. All ewes were inseminated 54-57 h after sponge removal with cooled semen (15 degrees C) from 10 Lacaune rams. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed via trans-dermal ultrasonography at 35-40 days after AI. Data recording started the day after sponge placement (15 days prior to AI), and lasted up to 14 days after AI. Daily records included temperature, relative humidity, and Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) inside the shed. Available space and volume per animal, frequency of bedding renewal, access to a yard, and indoor light were also recorded in each farm. Binary logistic regression of data records showed that temperature and THI increases at days -15 to +4 around AI (day 0) had a negative effect on pregnancy rates (reducing the likelihood of pregnancy by 3-6% and 7%, respectively). The latter also decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in farms with high stocking density, non-frequent bedding renewal, and outdoor access by ewes (by 30%, 34%, and 44%, respectively). Overall, the results indicate that appropriate housing conditions are warranted to increase the success of AI in dairy ewes during the summer months.

AB  - This study describes patterns of steroid hormone production and activity for banteng (Bos javanicus), an endangered member of the Bovidae family. Using validated assays, concentrations of fecal progestagens, androgens, and glucocorticoids were quantified for four females and one male at the Saint Louis Zoo. A commercial activity monitor was also validated for assessing movement. The devices were then used to characterize activity in relation to season, reproductive status, and fecal steroid concentrations. General linear mixed models assessed differences in activity and steroid concentrations among individuals, in regards to reproductive status and season. Ovulatory cycle patterns, changes in activity around estrus and parturition, and events correlated with increased glucocorticoid production were also documented. Cycle lengths were 24.7 +/- 0.4 days, and cycle lengths varied among individuals. Females cycled year-round, but luteal progestagen concentrations, along with glucocorticoids and male androgens, increased during the summer. Activity also increased in the summer. Progestagen concentrations were greater in pregnant females, and the gestation length of one pregnancy was 254 days. Pregnant females were less active overall, but activity increased the day before parturition. Activity was also greater preceding the onset of the luteal phase. The majority of glucocorticoid concentrations were in the range of baseline concentrations. However, a small number of elevated concentrations were correlated with husbandry and veterinary events. This study is the first to validate non-invasive methods for monitoring reproduction, welfare, and activity of banteng. Our results may contribute to the improved management of captive populations.

AB  - This work aims to explore the feasibility of using type D botulinum toxin as a novel, environmentally friendly biological rodenticide for the population control of rodents in plateau pastoral area. The toxin is subjected to toxin component, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses. The lethal median dose (LD50) values of intragastrically and orally administred type D botulinum toxin in wild plateau pikas, plateau zokors, and Microtus fuscus are calculated through Horn's method and the improved Karber method. The ability of the toxin to prevent and control rodent damage is assessed through plot experiments. The safety of type D botulinum toxin toward nontarget animals, such as yaks, Tibetan sheep, dogs, vultures, and birds, is also tested. Results show that the toxin is encoded by a type D botulinum neurotoxin gene. The DNA and amino acid sequences of the full neurotoxin gene comprise 3831 base pairs and 1276 amino acid residues, respectively. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the toxin exhibits 99% homology with those of a known type D botulinum neurotoxin gene, and the composition of the functional domain of the toxin is consistent with that of type D botulinum neurotoxin. For plateau pikas and plateau zokors, the LD50 values of intragastrically administered type D botulinum toxin is 6810 and 5840 MLD/kg weight, respectively, and those of orally administered type D botulinum are 1.231 and 1.319 g/kg weight, respectively. The natural enemies of rodents are strongly resistant to type D botulinum toxin. Experimental results indicate that type D botulinum toxin can be used as a new biological rodenticide for the prevention and control of rodent damage in plateau pastoral area.

AB  - Improving the reproductive performance of sows is a paramount goal in breeding programs. The number of teats is significantly associated with the reproductive performance of sows, with quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to porcine papilla number traits identified across almost all chromosomes, and with candidate genes proposed. In this study, we analyzed the total teat number traits of 1518 Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) (DLY) pigs and performed genotyping using a 50K chip. By screening SNP loci and related genes, this study aimed to identify genetic factors affecting the number of teats in DLY pigs and to facilitate future breeding programs aimed at improving this trait.The number of teats is a crucial reproductive trait with significant economic implications on maternal capacity and litter size. Consequently, improving this trait is essential to facilitate genetic selection for increased litter size. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the number of teats in a three-way crossbred commercial Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) (DLY) pig population comprising 1518 animals genotyped with the 50K BeadChip. Our analysis identified crucial quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the number of teats, containing the ABCD4 and VRTN genes on porcine chromosome 7. Our results establish SNP variants of ABCD4 and VRTN as new molecular markers for improving the number of teats in DLY pigs. Furthermore, the most significant noteworthy single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (7_97568284) was identified within the ABCD4 gene, exhibiting a significant association with the total teat number traits. This SNP accounted for a substantial proportion of the genetic variance, explaining 6.64% of the observed variation. These findings reveal a novel gene on SSC7 for the number of teats and provide a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying reproductive traits.

AB  - Livestock production is greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensive, and thus the increasing international trade of livestock products in recent decades has resulted in increased embodied emissions. Considering the varying emission intensity in production in different countries and the expected further increase in livestock product trade in the future, it becomes crucial to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such embodied GHG emissions for climate change mitigation in the livestock sector. In this study, we aimed to address such gaps and analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and network characteristics of GHG emissions embodied in the international trade of seven major categories of livestock products among 228 world economies during 1986-2017. The results showed that the total volume of GHG emissions embodied in livestock product trade reached 92.0 MT in 2017, accounting for 2.6% of the total emissions from livestock production. Sheep meat has replaced cattle meat as the major contributor to embodied emissions. In 2017, the largest flows of embodied emissions were within Europe, followed by the flows from Oceania to Asia. The fluxes in intra-upper middle and intra-high-income economies accounted for most of the total embodied emissions. Although the global average emission intensity of livestock production declined in these four decades, the trade flows from high to low emission intensity economies increased, especially for cattle and sheep meat. This resulted in an overall increase of contribution from the global livestock trade in GHG emissions from the global livestock sector. Therefore, effective measures and policies must be designed from both consumption and production perspectives to ensure proper accounting of these embodied emissions and maximize the reduction potential for a sustainable food system transition.

AB  - Congenital proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA) is a rare systemic disease caused by mutations in the SLC4A4 gene that encodes the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter, NBCe1. The major NBCe1 protein variants are designated NBCe1-A, NBCe1-B, and NBCe1-C. NBCe1-A expression is kidney-specific, NBCe1-B is broadly expressed and is the only NBCe1 variant expressed in the heart, and NBCe1-C is a splice variant of NBCe1-B that is expressed in the brain. No cardiac manifestations have been reported from patients with pRTA, but studies in adult rats with virally induced reduction in cardiac NBCe1-B expression indicate that NBCe1-B loss leads to cardiac hypertrophy and prolonged QT intervals in rodents. NBCe1-null mice die shortly after weaning, so the consequence of congenital, global NBCe1 loss on the heart is unknown. To circumvent this issue, we characterized the cardiac function of NBCe1-B/C-null (KOb/c) mice that survive up to 2 months of age and which, due to the uninterrupted expression of NBCe1-A, do not exhibit the confounding acidemia of the globally null mice. In contrast to the viral knockdown model, cardiac hypertrophy was not present in KOb/c mice as assessed by heart-weight-to-body-weight ratios and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. However, echocardiographic analysis revealed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and intraventricular pressure-volume measurements demonstrated reduced load-independent contractility. We also observed increased QT length variation in KOb/c mice. Finally, using the calcium indicator Fura-2 AM, we observed a significant reduction in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients in paced KOb/c cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that congenital, global absence of NBCe1-B/C leads to impaired cardiac contractility and increased QT length variation in juvenile mice. It remains to be determined whether the cardiac phenotype in KOb/c mice is influenced by the absence of NBCe1-B/C from neuronal and endocrine tissues.

AB  - The expression pattern of GLOD4 in the testis and its regulatory effect on testicular cells was explored in goats to enhance our understanding of spermatogenesis and improve reproduction in breeding rams. In this study, we demonstrated the localization of GLOD4 in testicular cells using immunohistochemistry and subcellular localization analyses. Subsequently, we analyzed the GLOD4 expression pattern in four age-based groups (0, 6, 12, and 18 months old) using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and protein blotting. Finally, we performed GLOD4 silencing and overexpression studies in Leydig cells (LCs) and explored the effects on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, steroid hormone secretion and the expression of candidate testosterone hormone-regulated genes. GLOD4 was mainly expressed in Leydig cells, and the subcellular localization results showed that the GLOD4 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Silencing of GLOD4 significantly suppressed the mRNA expression levels of the testosterone secretion-related genes CYP11A1, 3 beta-HSD, and CYP17A1 and the mRNA expression levels of cell cycle-related genes CDK6, PCNA, and Cyclin E. Moreover, the cell cycle was blocked at the G2/M phase after GLOD4 silencing, which significantly suppressed testosterone secretion. In contrast, GLOD4 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of the testosterone secretion-related genes CYP11A1, 3 beta-HSD, and CYP17A1 and increased the expression of the cell cycle-related genes CDK6, PCNA, and Cyclin E. Moreover, GLOD4 overexpression promoted the cell cycle from G0/G1 phases to enter the S phase and G2/M phases, promoted the secretion of testosterone. Taken together, our experimental results indicate that GLOD4 may affect the development of cells in Qianbei Ma goats of different ages by influencing the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and testosterone hormone synthesis. These findings enhance our understanding of the functions of GLOD4 in goats.

AB  - Simple SummaryIn China, and even the world, the animal husbandry industry is facing the problem of a shortage of feed ingredients, and even humans and animals compete for food. The development of unconventional feed resources is an urgent task. In our previous work, we analyzed the nutritional value of tea powder and believed that it has development potential. This study investigated the effects of supplementing different levels of tea powder in diets on pig growth performance, meat quality, and antioxidant properties. These results provide a preliminary basis for the application of tea powder as a supplement in animal husbandry.This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of tea powder in diets on the growth performance, meat quality, muscular amino acid, fatty acid profile, and serum biochemical indices of pigs. A total of 120 local Chinese pigs (Tibetan x Bama miniature pigs) were randomly assigned to five treatment groups, each with six pens and four pigs per pen. During a 60-day experiment, these groups of pigs were fed the normal diet and the diet supplemented with 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6% tea powder, respectively. The results showed that the supplementation of tea powder did not affect the growth performance of pigs. However, the dietary tea powder inclusion decreased (p < 0.05) the average fat thickness, total fat, and abdominal fat, and increased (p < 0.05) the total muscle as well. In addition, the dietary 2% tea powder decreased (p < 0.05) the muscle lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*). Compared with the control group, the dietary supplementation with 1%, 2%, and 4% tea powder raised (p < 0.05) the total amino acids (TAA) and essential amino acids (EAA), and dietary 4% and 6% tea powder increased (p < 0.05) the C20:5n3 in the muscle tissue. Furthermore, the serum lipid metabolism-related biochemical indices and mRNA expression levels were improved with the addition of tea powder. These results indicated that dietary tea powder might improve the carcass traits and meat quality of the Chinese native finishing pigs, but it does not affect their growth performance. Tea powder could be fully developed and reasonably applied as a dietary supplement.

AB  - Context. For plant species that have evolved in fire-prone environments, declines after wildfires are often driven by the combination of fire and other threatening processes. Mitigating the impacts of these threatening processes can sometimes effectively support post-fire population recovery. Aims. We test the effectiveness of: (1) phosphite application to mitigate Phytophthora dieback; (2) fencing to exclude browsing by mammalian herbivores; and (3) translocation to sites where threats can be practically managed, for conservation of threatened flora affected by wildfires in 2018 and 2019 in the Stirling Range (Koi Kyeunu-ruff), south-western Australia. Methods. Survival of Phytophthora-susceptible flora was compared in repeatedly sampled plots from prior to and after wildfire and +/- recurrent phosphite application. Survival and growth of browsing-susceptible flora was compared post-fire in fenced and control plots. Survival, growth and flowering was compared between wild populations recruiting after wildfire and translocated populations. Key results. Phosphite application increased survival of most Phytophthora-susceptible flora. Fencing led to greater growth and often increased survival. Translocated populations, with supplemental water, had greater growth rates and earlier flowering than wild populations, and a non-significant trend for higher survival. Conclusions These findings provide strong evidence supporting continuation of phosphite application, herbivore exclusion and translocation for post-fire recovery of the threatened flora of the Stirling Range. Implications. With increasing wildfire extent, frequency and impact across the globe, successful management of non-fire threats will be crucial for post-fire conservation of threatened flora, with the approaches proving effective in this study likely to have conservation value elsewhere.

AB  - Recent studies on oestroidean Diptera (Brachycera) are providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the evolutionary history of this remarkably diverse clade of holometabolous insects. The Oestroidea, which includes formidable pests such as various blowflies, botflies, and flesh flies that infest livestock, pets and humans, are mostly composed of beneficial species that act as scavengers or parasitoids on various pest insects. In our research, we used genomic methods to elucidate the phylogenetic position of Nesodexia corsicana Villeneuve, 1911 (Diptera: Calliphoridae), a mysterious oestroid species endemic to Corsica and characterized by distinctive morphological features that have puzzled taxonomists for years. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our results place Nesodexia Villeneuve, 1911 within the Calliphoridae subfamily Rhinophorinae, a small lineage of terrestrial isopod parasitoids. Through detailed morphological analysis of adults of both sexes and eggs, we uncovered significant insights consistent with our phylogenomic reconstruction. The unique morphological features of the species, coupled with its restricted and fragmented habitat, highlight its potential conservation importance. We delineated the area of occupancy for N. corsicana and assessed its "threatened" category using specific IUCN Red List criteria. In addition, we mapped the available habitat within its range and determined potential key biodiversity areas (KBA) triggered by N. corsicana. New potential KBAs are only partially covered by the Corsican Regional Park. Finally, we mapped the distribution of habitats on the island to assess the potential distribution of the species beyond its currently known geographic range.

AB  - Radiation exposure can cause gut dysbiosis and there is a positive correlation between gut microbial imbalance and radiation-induced side effects in cancer patients. However, the influence of radiation on the gut-brain axis (GBA) and its neurological consequences are not well understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of pelvic irradiation on gut microbiota and the brain. Sprague Dawley rats were irradiated with a single dose of 6 Gy, and faecal samples were collected at different time points (7 and 12-days post-irradiation) for microbial analysis. Behavioural, histological, and gene expression analysis were performed to assess the effect of microbial dysbiosis on the brain. The findings indicated alterations in microbial diversity, disrupted intestinal morphology and integrity, neuronal death-related brain changes, neuroinflammation and reduced locomotor activity. Hippocampal gene expression analysis also showed a reduced expression of neural plasticity-related genes. Overall, this study demonstrated that pelvic irradiation affects gut microbiota, intestinal morphology, integrity, brain neuronal maturation, neural plasticity gene expression, and behaviour.

AB  - Coronavirus19 is caused due to infection in the respiratory system. It is the type of RNA virus that might infect animal and human species. In the severe stage, it causes pneumonia in human beings. In this research, hand-crafted and deep microscopic features are used to classify lung infection. The proposed work consists of two phases; in phase I, infected lung region is segmented using proposed U-Net deep learning model. The hand-crafted features are extracted such as histogram orientation gradient (HOG), noise to the harmonic ratio (NHr), and segmentation based fractal texture analysis (SFTA) from the segmented image, and optimum features are selected from each feature vector using entropy. In phase II, local binary patterns (LBPs), speeded up robust feature (Surf), and deep learning features are extracted using a pretrained network such as inceptionv3, ResNet101 from the input CT images, and select optimum features based on entropy. Finally, the optimum selected features using entropy are fused in two ways, (i) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are horizontally concatenated/fused (ii) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are combined/fused with deep features. The fused optimum features vector is passed to the ensemble models (Boosted tree, bagged tree, and RUSBoosted tree) in two ways for the COVID19 classification, (i) classification using fused hand-crafted features (ii) classification using fusion of hand-crafted features and deep features. The proposed methodology is tested /evaluated on three benchmark datasets. Two datasets employed for experiments and results show that hand-crafted & deep microscopic feature's fusion provide better results compared to only hand-crafted fused features.

AB  - Simple Summary The exotic cabbage seedpod weevil (CSW), Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, is a major pest of canola crops. This insect is mainly regulated in Europe by the parasitoid Trichomalus perfectus, a natural enemy also accidentally introduced in eastern Canada since 2009. The objective of the present study was to evaluate how the landscape influenced the CSW infestation and abundance and the parasitism of T. perfectus. Results from six years in eight Quebec regions show that the CSW was positively affected by roads and cereal crops. Regarding T. perfectus, the parasitism was variable (from about 5 to almost 25%) and positively influenced by landscape diversity, crop edge density, hay/pastures and soybean crops. These results will help determine the potential of an eventual introduction of T. perfectus in western Canada, where most of the canola is produced, and the optimal landscape composition and configuration needed to succeed. The cabbage seedpod weevil (CSW), Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, an exotic pest accidentally introduced in North America in 1931, spread all over this continent and is now a major pest of canola crops. One of its main natural enemies in Europe, Trichomalus perfectus, was observed in eastern Canada in 2009. This study aimed to evaluate the landscape influence on CSW infestation and abundance and on T. perfectus parasitism in Quebec to understand the optimal conditions to potentially release this parasitoid in the Canadian Prairies. Field research was conducted in 19 to 28 canola fields per year, from 2015 to 2020, among eight Quebec regions. CSW was sampled by sweep net during canola blooming and parasitoids by collecting canola pods kept in emergence boxes until adults emerge. Infestation and parasitism calculations were based on pod emergence holes. For analysis, 20 landscape predictors were considered. Results show that CSW infestation and abundance increased if there were more roads and cereal crops in the landscapes. Meanwhile, T. perfectus parasitism decreased when hedgerows length and distance from water were longer. However, it increased when landscape diversity and average crop perimeter-to-area ratio were higher, and along with more hay/pastures and soybean crops. This study's results highlight that these four landscape predictors could provide more resources and overwintering areas, promoting greater efficiency of T. perfectus to control the CSW.

AB  - The priority of studying high mountain ecosystems is due to the increasing influence of a large number of natural and anthropogenic pollutants. As solar radiation levels increase, exposure to human-caused radionuclides in alpine regions decreases due to the decay of anthropogenic radioisotopes, as well as precipitation and demobilisation of heavier elements. The present article is based on biomonitoring studies of the total f-activity of small rodents conducted in the Rila Mountains. The purpose of the study is to present data on the biomonitoring potential of small rodents in relation to radioecological studies in these areas. The suitability of two rodent taxa is discussed in a comparative aspect: the omnivorous Apodemus sp. and the herbivorous representative Chionomys nivalis. The larger reduction was observed in Apodemus sp., followed by the snow vole, which shows high zoomonitor potential for alpine ecosystems. An analysis of the animal diet and determination of total f-activity in the dominant plant components of the food spectrum was also performed. This allows further detailed studies to track the biomagnification of radionuclides along food chains in these fragile ecosystems.

AB  - Catechins, the most important bioactive components in tea plants (Camellia sinensis), are influenced by the growth environment. To identify and optimize the key meteorological factors affecting catechin accumulation, we investigated the relationship between meteorological factors and tea plant catechin biosynthesis across three growing seasons at 10 locations. Rainfall, average temperature, and effective accumulated temperature (EAT) were identified as key drivers regulating catechin accumulation via the responsive expression of key structural genes CsCHS1, CsANR, and CsSCPL. Optimal meteorological conditions for enhancing total esterified catechins (TEC) and total non-esterified catechins (TNEC) were determined using LINGO software, although the optimal conditions for these two groups were contrasting. Hot and rainy environments promote the biosynthesis of EGCG, ECG, and TEC through CsPAL and CsSCPL, while reduced rainfall and EAT promote the accumulation of C, EGC, and TNEC. This study reveals the differential effects of meteorological factors on catechin accumulation and obtains optimal meteorological conditions for promoting catechin accumulation. These results provide guidance for improving catechin accumulation and tea cultivation management.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects several brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) involved in execution, working memory, and fear extinction. Despite these critical roles, the PFC is understudied in AD pathology. People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have twice the risk of developing AD, and the underlying mechanisms linking these two diseases are less understood. Here, we investigated the effect of footshock stress on behavioural vis-a-vis molecular changes in the PFC of an amyloid-beta (A beta)-42 lesion rat model of AD. Trauma-like conditions were induced by exposing the animals to several footshocks. AD-like condition was induced via intra-hippocampal injection of A beta-42 peptide. Following A beta-42 injections, animals were tested for behavioural changes using the Open Field Test (OFT) and Y-maze test. The PFC was later harvested for neurochemical analyses. Our results showed an interactive effect of footshocks and A beta-42 lesion on: reduced percentage alternation in the Y-maze test, suggesting memory impairment; reduced number of line crosses and time spent in the centre square of the OFT, indicating anxiogenic responses. Similarly, there was an interactive effect of footshocks and A beta-42 lesion on: increased FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) expression, which can be associated with stress-induced anxiogenic behaviours; and increased neuronal apoptosis in the PFC of the animals. In addition, footshocks, as well as A beta-42 lesion, reduced superoxide dismutase levels and Bridging Integrator-1 (BIN1) expression in the PFC of the animals, which can be linked to the observed memory impairment. In conclusion, our findings indicate that footshocks exaggerate PFC-associated behavioural and molecular changes induced by an AD-like pathology.

AB  - Simple Summary In a previous study, 30 SINE-RIPs were applied for population genetic analysis in 7 Chinese miniature pig populations and approved effectively in the genetic distances and breed-relationships between these populations. There are abundant indigenous pigs famous across the world for their prolificacy in the Jiangsu Province of eastern China, such as Meishan, Erhualian. Since pork production relies on limited commercial breeds such as Landrace, Large White, and Duroc pigs, characterized by maximizing productivity in intensive production systems, these indigenous pigs are nowadays decrease sharply. The genetic characterizations of these resources are essential requirements for the development of conservation, selection, and sustainable utilizations. Therefore, SINE-RIPs were selected to evaluate the genetic variation and population structure of Jiangsu pig populations and the results may assist with the conservation and utilization of these native pig populations. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), one type of retrotransposon, are considered to be ideal molecular markers due to their wide distribution in the genome, high copy number, and high polymorphism. Preliminary studies have identified more than 35,000 SINE-retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) in the pig genome. In this study, 18 SINE-RIPs were used to evaluate the genetic variation and population structure of seven native pig populations and two crossbreeds in the Jiangsu Province of China. Two commercial pig breeds (Duroc and Large White) and one Italian native breed (Sicilian Black pig) were selected as the control. The results showed that all 18 SINE-RIPs were polymorphic among these pigs. The Jiangsu native pig populations (Erhualian, Fengjing, Middle Meishan, Mi, Shawutou, Small Meishan, and Huai) were shown to be more polymorphic than the crossbreeds (Sushan and Sujiang) and external breeds (Sicilian Black pig, Large White, and Duroc) based on the expected heterozygosity and polymorphic information content values. Some native pigs, including Small Meishan, Mi, Middle Meishan, and Erhualian, had a higher degree of inbreeding according to the F-IS values. Based on the neighbor-joining tree, all of the Jiangsu native pig populations formed one branch, while the three external pig breeds formed the other branches, with the two crossbreeds containing more than 50% external pig ancestry. The Huai pigs were independent of the other Jiangsu native pigs but shared a common ancestor with Sujiang and Mi. The results provide a new perspective on the population structure of these native pig breeds and will assist with the conservation and utilization of Chinese native pigs.

AB  - The livestock by-products (LBP) using as fertilizers are characterized by such unfavorable environmental characteristics as emissions of greenhouse gases (N2O, CO2, CH4) and the presence of a specific microbiota leading to soil and water biological contamination. The waste processing by nitrapyrin reduces the negative environmental impact of LBP. Currently, nitrapyrin is used as a nitrogen fertilizer stabilizer that reduces nitrogen losses by direct inhibition of soil microorganisms (MO) oxidizing ammonium nitrogen to nitrate. It was found that 0.05 g/L nitrapyrin application to the liquid pig manure effluents decreases the CH4 and CO2 emissions, as well as the species diversity and the number of opportunistic pathogens that promote the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes into natural environments. The number of such MO as Klebsiella sp., Proteus spp., Bacteroides sp., Pseudomonas spp., Candida sp. decreased by 2-4 orders of magnitude due to nitrapyrin. Only anaerobic bacteria of the genus Clostridium and aerobic mold fungi of the genus Aspergillus showed the resistance to the appropriate reagent, the number of the above MO remained almost unchanged in the nitrapyrin variants. The most significant decrease in CO2 emission (2-5 times compared to control) was observed in the first 3-4 days after the nitrapyrin application. The CH(4 )emission in nitrapyrin variants was lower than in the control during the whole observation period (13 days). The obtained experimental data can be used in the development of reagent formulations to improve microbiological characteristics and to reduce greenhouse gases emission from manure collection systems of livestock enterprises.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological security barrier in China. Considering the rich local waste biomass with a single treatment method and low level of resource utilization, biochar utilization of solid waste biomass can be carried out based on the research that biochar has abundant material sources. According to the application methods of various types of solid waste resources that have not been carried out, this review analyzes and discusses various types of waste biomass resources in the plateau region, such as sewage plant sludge, food waste, green leaves, barley straw, yak manure, and the unique Tibetan tea and Tibetan medicine residue waste, and reviews the biochar methods and applications for similar raw materials at home and abroad. Further, the technical outlook of solar pyrolysis technology and UV radiation modification technology and the development of hybrid pyrolysis to enhance the performance of biochar materials and heavy metal passivation are proposed by utilizing the solar energy resources of the Tibetan Plateau. Collectively, it provides a reference for prevention and restoration methods for the fragile ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, reduces the pressure of waste disposal in the region, and realizes the resource utilization of waste.

AB  - Excessive copper (Cu) has the potential risk to ecosystems and organism health, with its impact on dairy cow mammary glands being not well-defined. This study used a bovine mammary epithelial cell (MAC-T) model to explore how copper excess affects cellular oxidative stress, autophagy, ferroptosis, and protein and lipid biosynthesis in milk. Results showed the increased intracellular ROS, MDA, and CAT (P < 0.05), alongside decreased T-SOD and GSH in CuSO4-treated cells (P < 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy and Ad-mCherryGFP-LC3B assays revealed significant autophagosome accumulation in CuSO4 exposed cells (P < 0.05). Additionally, CuSO4 exposure modulated autophagy markers, evidenced by upregulation of genes such as LC3, ATG5, JNK1, and Beclin1, and downregulation of genes such as ATG4B, and p62 (P < 0.05). CuSO4 also led to notable mitochondrial changes, including size reduction, membrane rupture, and cristae loss, and reduced expression of the ferroptosis inhibitor GPX4 (P < 0.05). The expression of mTOR, HIF-1 alpha and beta-catenin signaling pathway were inhibited in differentiated MAC-T cells by CuSO4 exposure (P < 0.05), activated autophagy through activation of the AMPK-mTOR pathway which in turn affected downstream levels of genes related to milk protein and lipid. In conclusion, excessive copper induces oxidative stress in MAC-T cells, promoting autophagy through JNK-Bcl2, Beclin1-Vps34 and AMPK-mTOR pathways, leading to cell ferroptosis, as well as inhibits the cellular biosynthesis of milk protein and lipid.

AB  - Sequencing-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have facilitated the identification of causal associations between genetic variants and traits in diverse species. However, it is cost-prohibitive for the majority of research groups to sequence a large number of samples. Here, we carried out genotype imputation to increase the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms in a large-scale Swine F-2 population using a reference panel including 117 individuals, followed by a series of GWAS analyses. The imputation accuracies reached 0.89 and 0.86 for allelic concordance and correlation, respectively. A quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) affecting the chest vertebrate was detected directly, while the investigation of another QTN affecting the residual glucose failed due to the presence of similar haplotypes carrying wild-type and mutant allelesin the reference panel used in this study. A high imputation accuracy was confirmed by Sanger sequencing technology for the most significant loci. Two candidate genes, CPNE5 and MYH3, affecting meat-related traits were proposed. Collectively, we illustrated four scenarios in imputation-based GWAS that may be encountered by researchers, and our results will provide an extensive reference for future genotype imputation-based GWAS analyses in the future.

AB  - Biomaterials may enhance neural repair after spinal cord injury (SCI) and testing their functionality in large animals is essential to achieve successful clinical translation. This work developed a porcine contusion/compression SCI model to investigate the consequences of myelotomy and implantation of fibrin gel containing biofunctionalized carbon microfibers (MFs). Fourteen pigs were distributed in SCI, SCI/myelotomy, and SCI/myelotomy/implant groups. An automated device was used for SCI. A dorsal myelotomy was performed on the lesion site at 1 day post-injury for removing cloths and devitalized tissue. Bundles of MFs coated with a conducting polymer and cell adhesion molecules were embedded in fibrin gel and used to bridge the spinal cord cavity. Reproducible lesions of about 1 cm in length were obtained. Myelotomy and lesion debridement caused no further neural damage compared to SCI alone but had little positive effect on neural regrowth. The MFs/fibrin gel implant facilitated axonal sprouting, elongation, and alignment within the lesion. However, the implant also increased lesion volume and was ineffective in preventing fibrosis, thus precluding functional neural regeneration. Our results indicate that myelotomy and lesion debridement can be advantageously used for implanting MF-based scaffolds. However, the implants need refinement and pharmaceuticals will be necessary to limit scarring.

AB  - Fear memory formation and retention rely on the activation of distributed neural circuits. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (VH) in particular are two regions that support contextual fear memory processes and share reciprocal connections. The VH -> BLA pathway is critical for increases in fear after initial learning, in both fear renewal following extinction learning and during fear generalization. This raises the possibility that functional changes in VH projections to the BLA support increases in learned fear. In line with this, fear can also be increased with alterations to the original content of the memory via reconsolidation, as in fear elevation procedures. However, very little is known about the functional changes in the VH -> BLA pathway supporting reconsolidation-related increases in fear. In this study, we used in vivo extracellular electrophysiology to examine the functional neuronal changes within the BLA and in the VH -> BLA pathway as a result of fear elevation and standard fear retrieval procedures. Elevated fear expression was accompanied by higher BLA spontaneous firing compared to a standard fear retrieval condition. Across a range of stimulation frequencies, we also found that VH stimulation evoked higher BLA firing following fear elevation compared to standard retrieval. These results suggest that fear elevation is associated with an increased capacity of the VH to drive neuronal activity in the BLA, highlighting a potential circuit involved in strengthening existing fear memories.

AB  - Salmonella is a pathogen of worldwide public health concern, responsible for gastroenteritis and sometimes other health complications. Humans can be infected by eating contaminated pig products. On farms, pigs are usually asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella, making it difficult to detect the disease clinically. Some methods for controlling this microorganism are used on the farm, but their effectiveness varies between studies. Probiotics could be a reliable option in this context, reducing the presence of Salmonella in the pig's intestinal tract while modulating its microbiota. The carriage of Salmonella in pigs is a major concern for the agri-food industry and for global healthcare systems. Humans could develop salmonellosis when consuming contaminated pig products. On the other hand, some Salmonella serotypes could cause disease in swine, leading to economic losses on farms. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the anti-Salmonella activity of a novel Bacillus-based probiotic using a bioreactor containing a piglet-derived intestinal microbiota. Two methods of probiotic administration were tested: a single daily and a continuous dose. Salmonella enumeration was performed using selective agar at T24h, T48h, T72h, T96h and T120h. The DNA was extracted from bioreactor samples to perform microbiome profiling by targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing on Illumina Miseq. The quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was also assessed at T120h. The probiotic decreased Salmonella counts at T96 for the daily dose and at T120 for the continuous one. Both probiotic doses affected the alpha and beta diversity of the piglet-derived microbiota (p < 0.05). A decrease in acetate concentration and an increase in propionate proportion were observed in the continuous condition. In conclusion, the tested Bacillus-based product showed a potential to modulate microbiota and reduce Salmonella colonization in a piglet-derived intestinal microbiota and could therefore be used in vivo.

AB  - Context. Feral cats are a significant threat to wildlife in Australia and globally. Current feral cat management techniques have limitations that can result in wary, remnant individuals persisting in the landscape and reducing overall pest control efficacy, thus there is a need for additional innovative management techniques. Aims. This research aimed to identify whether the Mata Hari Judas technique could be applied to female cats (queens) in situ as a means of attracting and assisting the capture of feral cats. Methods. Three queens were induced into prolonged oestrus and contained in enclosures (vennels) in situ with traps attached to capture attracted feral cats. Two vennel treatments were trialled, one housing a Mata Hari Judas queen (queen vennel) and another using auditory and olfactory lures from a Mata Hari Judas queen (faux queen vennel) to compare the attractiveness of the two treatments at three study sites. Camera traps and soil plots were used to monitor and compare cat activity surrounding the vennels prior to, during and after the presence of a Mata Hari Judas queen or her lures. Key results. Both vennel treatments attracted multiple feral cats of both sexes, and each trapped one male cat, demonstrating proof of concept for this technique. The queen vennel was significantly more attractive than the faux queen vennel, as demonstrated by higher frequency of cat detections and the duration of time feral cats spent at this vennel. Comparisons between monitoring periods and when the vennels were active showed significant differences in the frequency of cats attracted to the area, further supporting that both the queen and her lures were attractive to cats. Conclusions. This research is the first instance where Mata Hari Judas queens have been successfully used in situ to attract and capture feral cats. Future studies should aim to assess this technique in a controlled area with a known cat population to allow for a direct comparison of efficacy with more traditional feral cat management methods. Implications. With further refinement, the use of Mata Hari Judas queens in situ could provide an efficient technique for removing remnant cats.

AB  - The effectiveness of high phosphorus pig iron (1.5 wt% P, 3.5 wt% P, and 8.0 wt% P) as sacrificial anode for the cathodic protection of mild steel was investigated in simulated concrete pore solution and concrete mortar. Electrochemical tests were carried out in both chloride-free and chloride-contaminated pore solution under freely aerated and deaerated environments. Linear and dynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and zero resistance ammeter tests were performed to compare the electrochemical behavior of the pig iron samples to the mild steel. Laboratory and field tests were also conducted by galvanically coupling the mild steel to the pig iron samples in the concrete mortar and monitoring the polarization shift. The polarization results indicate that all three different pig iron samples show more active potential as compared to the mild steel in both chloride-free and chloride contaminated pore solutions. The open circuit potential and polarization resistance for all the pig iron samples decrease with an increase in the P content. The more active galvanic potential and positive galvanic current density for the pig iron and the mild steel couple show the effectiveness of the pig iron as a sacrificial anode in simulated concrete pore solution. The laboratory and field studies also suggest that the 100 mV polarization shift criterion has been established, and the pig iron samples are effective in preventing the corrosion of the mild steel in concrete. The first time use of iron based sacrificial anode for the cathodic protection of reinforcing steel embedded in concrete defines the novelty of the present work. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in predicting faecal fibre, protein fractions and total tract apparent digestibility in dairy sheep and goats fed varying ratios of alfalfa-hay and concentrate. A total of 180 faecal samples from dairy sheep and goats were collected and chemically analysed. Faecal samples underwent also NIRS spectral acquisition and calibration models were obtained through modified partial least square regression and tested for robustness. The NIRS provided excellent estimations for N and CP as % as is (R2ExV 0.91 and 0.91, RPD 3.16 and 3.33, respectively), good estimation for N, CP and ND soluble CP % DM (R2ExV 0.90, 0.90 and 0.85, RPD 3.14, 2.90 and 2.48) and ND soluble CP expressed as % as is (R2ExV 0.87, RPD 2.55), approximative quantitative prediction for acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADICP) and ADIN % acid detergent fibre (ADF) (R2ExV 0.79 and 0.71, RPD 1.93 and 1.78, respectively) and ADICP as % as is (R2ExV 0.67, RPD 1.70) but resulted to be less effective when predicting all the other components. The prediction models for total-tract digestibility (ttD) of ADICP performed best among the developed equations (R2ExV 0.57, RPD 1.38), but the model was not sufficient for precise predictions, suggesting a good capacity of NIRS to predict faecal N excretion but also intrinsic limitations of faecal spectra due to the partial residual nutrients content, compared to the diet. Increasing the number of calibration samples and values, the forage species, and the F:C ratios in the diet offered to the animals could improve the NIRS performance.

AB  - Erhualian pigs exhibit one of the highest reproductive rates globally, and cryptorchidism is a crucial factor affecting reproductive abilities of boars. This investigation focused on cryptorchid tissues from Erhualian pigs, where the histological structure of cryptorchidism was observed using specialized staining. In addition, protein expression of P53/NF-kappa B in cryptorchid tissues was assessed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In comparison to normal Erhualian testes, Masson's trichrome staining indicated a reduction in collagen fibers in the connective tissue and around the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubules in cryptorchid testes. Moreover, collagen fiber distribution was observed to be disordered. Verhoeff Van Gieson (EVG) and argyrophilic staining demonstrated brownish-black granular nucleoli organized regions in mesenchymal cells and germ cells. When compared to normal testicles, the convoluted seminiferous tubules of cryptorchids exhibited a significantly reduced number and diameter (p < 0.01). Notably, VEGF/EGFR and P53/NF-kappa B expression in cryptorchidism significantly differed from that in normal testes. In particular, the expression of VEGF and P53 in cryptorchid tissues was significantly higher than that in normal testes tissues, whereas the expression of EGFR in cryptorchid tissues was significantly lower than that in normal testes tissues (all p < 0.01). NF-kappa B expressed no difference in both conditions. The expressions of VEGF and NF-kappa B were observed in the cytoplasm of testicular Leydig cells and spermatogenic cells, but they were weak in the nucleus. EGFR and P53 were more positively expressed in the cytoplasm of these cells, with no positive expression in the nucleus. Conclusion: There were changes in the tissue morphology and structure of the cryptorchid testis, coupled with abnormally high expression of VEGF and P53 proteins in Erhualian pigs. We speculate that this may be an important limiting factor to fecundity during cryptorchidism.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is the most famous, flavored, functional, and therapeutic non-alcoholic beverage, with two-thirds of the world's population drinking it. Tea leaves are demonstrated to contain many bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, amino acids, volatile compounds, and alkaloids, all of which have a good potential of biomedical uses. In plants under stress, including diverse elicitors or signal molecules, accumulation of such metabolites occurs frequently. In adapting plants to the ecosystem and alleviating stress conditions, phytochemicals play a significant role. Ecological factors may be categorized into biotic and abiotic factors which may be artificially induced to activate plant defense responses due to the generation of bioactive compounds. Different biotic and abiotic factors are directly linked to the productivity of tea. Abiotic and biotic factors such as temperature, cold, nutrition, shading, humidity, light intensity, water supply, mechanical, nutrition influence the growth of the plant and the production of the bioactive compounds in tea. Biotic and abiotic factors are versatile tools for the overproduction of valuable metabolites in tea. In this review, an update will be provided on current research focusing on the response of tea to an integration of various stresses. In specific, we will discuss how various stress responses are integrated and how they affect plant growth and physiological characteristics.

AB  - Herbivore digestion in aquatic ecosystems is usually considered a method of nutrient repackaging rather than recycling, as recalcitrant and low-level nutrients are presumed for their egesta. We hypothesize that this opinion holds only for nutrients recycled by excretion and egestion, not for those elements recycled overwhelmingly by fecal decomposition. In this study, we compared the dissolution of biogenic silica (BSi), phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) between two food items and fecal pellets of two marine invertebrates fed on artificial seawaters free of bacteria. Relative to raw food materials, the mass proportion in fecal pellets of BSi increased, while that of P and Fe decreased. During the 21 days of incubation, the total dissolution rate of BSi was 13.9-36.0 times higher in fecal pellets than food items, followed by P (1.5-4.2 times) and Fe (1.1-2.4 times). While the dissolution of BSi and Fe occurred mostly in the first few days, P was mostly released in the last ten days. Regarding BSi dissolution, a higher rate was observed in oyster Crassostrea gigas than the Echiuran Urechis unicinctus, but no significant difference was found between fecal pellets in either species under naturally available diatom food (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and introduced terrestrial food (rice husk powder), respectively. Our results show direct evidence of digestion-associated nutrients mobilization. BSi dissolution after animal digestion may be similarly efficient to that caused by bacteria colonization in natural seawater.

AB  - Despite their critical roles in marine ecosystems, only few studies have addressed the gut microbiome (GM) of cetaceans in a comprehensive way. Being long -living apex predators with a carnivorous diet but evolved from herbivorous ancestors, cetaceans are an ideal model for studying GM -host evolutionary drivers of symbiosis and represent a valuable proxy of overall marine ecosystem health. Here, we investigated the GM of eight different cetacean species, including both Odontocetes (toothed whales) and Mysticetes (baleen whales), by means of 16S rRNA-targeted amplicon sequencing. We collected faecal samples from free -ranging cetaceans circulating within the Pelagos Sanctuary (North-western Mediterranean Sea) and we also included publicly available cetacean gut microbiome sequences. Overall, we show a clear GM trajectory related to host phylogeny and taxonomy (i.e., phylosymbiosis), with remarkable GM variations which may reflect adaptations to different diets between baleen and toothed whales. While most samples were found to be infected by protozoan parasites of potential anthropic origin, we report that this phenomenon did not lead to severe GM dysbiosis. This study underlines the importance of both host phylogeny and diet in shaping the GM of cetaceans, highlighting the role of neutral processes as well as environmental factors in the establishment of this GM -host symbiosis. Furthermore, the presence of potentially human -derived protozoan parasites in faeces of free -ranging cetaceans emphasizes the importance of these animals as bioindicators of anthropic impact on marine ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction: Fitness of plants is affected by their symbiotic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and such effects are highly dependent on the environmental context.
   Methods: In the current study, we inoculated the nursery shrub species Artemisia ordosica with AMF species Funneliformis mosseae under contrasting levels of soil water and nutrients (diammonium phosphate fertilization), to assess their effects on plant growth, physiology and natural infestation by herbivores.
   Results: Overall, plant biomass was synergistically enhanced by increasing soil water and soil nutrient levels. However, plant height was surprisingly repressed by AMF inoculation, but only under low water conditions. Similarly, plant biomass was also reduced by AMF but only under low water and nutrient conditions. Furthermore, AMF significantly reduced leaf phosphorus levels, that were strongly enhanced under high nutrient conditions, but had only minor effects on leaf chlorophyll and proline levels. Under low water and nutrient conditions, specific root length was enhanced, but average root diameter was decreased by AMF inoculation. The negative effects of AMF on plant growth at low water and nutrient levels may indicate that under these conditions AMF inoculation does not strongly contribute to nutrient and water acquisition. On the contrary, the AMF might have suppressed the direct pathway of water and nutrient absorption by the plant roots themselves despite low levels of mycorrhizal colonization. AMF inoculation reduced the abundance of the foliar herbivore Chrysolina aeruginosa on plants that had been grown on the low nutrient soil, but not on high nutrient soil. Fertilization enhanced the abundance of this herbivore but only in plants that had received the high water treatment. The lower abundance of the herbivore on AMF plants could be related to their decreased leaf P content. In conclusion, our results indicate that AMF negatively affect the growth of Artemisia ordosica but makes them less attractive to a dominant herbivore.
   Discussion: Our study highlights that plant responses to AMF depend not only on the environmental context, but that the direction of the responses can differ for different components of plant performance (growth vs. defense).

AB  - Two cryptic species of the Bemisia tabaci species complex, MEAM1 (Middle East-Asia Minor 1) and MED (Mediterranean), are highly destructive herbivores. Attack by herbivorous insects often induces defense responses in plants, including the accumulation of toxic secondary metabolites, the synthesis of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and defensive proteins, and the release of volatile organic compounds that attract natural enemies. These defense responses, which often differ depending on the herbivore, may affect the preference and performance of later-arriving con- and heterospecific whiteflies that attack the same plant. In the present study, we found that MEAM1 whiteflies preferred settling and ovipositing on non-infested and MED-infested cabbage over MEAM1-infested cabbage plants, but that MED whiteflies showed no significant difference in settling or oviposition preference among non-infested, MEAM1-infested, and MED-infested plants. MEAM1 infestation increased the contents of total phenols and flavonoids in cabbage, which coincided with the increased expression of the following genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway: PAL2, C4H, and 4CL. Soluble protein contents were also markedly higher in the MEAM1-infested cabbage plants than in the non-infested and MED-infested cabbage plants. Overall, these results demonstrate that previous infestation by MEAM1 and MED whiteflies induced defense responses in cabbage plants that had different effects on the host preference and performance of later-arriving con- and heterospecific whiteflies. Phenolic compounds may be the key factors influencing host choice by MEAM1 and MED whiteflies on cabbage plants.

KW  - SHAP VALUE INTERPRETATION
AB  - Microplastics are tiny plastic particles originating from both commercial product manufacturing and the degradation of larger plastic materials. These particles pose significant risks to environmental and animal health. A growing body of evidence highlights plastic packaging as a major source of microplastic exposure in children, who are particularly vulnerable to these contaminants compared to adults[1]. Despite growing concern, research on the effects of microplastics on human health remains limited, particularly regarding the potential consequences of long-term microplastic exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between the neurotoxic effects of prolonged polystyrene microplastic exposure and seizure symptoms, with a special emphasis on the interplay between inflammation and ferroptosis. We hypothesize that long-term ingestion of polystyrene microplastics may disrupt the gut microbiota and induce systemic inflammation, which could subsequently trigger ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons and exacerbate seizure symptoms. Our research contributes significantly to the existing body of knowledge in three key areas. Our investigation makes significant contributions in three key areas: Firstly, by integrating observational pilot cohort studies and interpretable machine learning techniques, we demonstrate that long-term environmental microplastic exposure exposure may affect the independent inflammation-related risk factors of seizures and thereby exacerbate seizure symptoms. Second, through human network toxicology and therapeutic molecular analyses, our results suggest that melatonin may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention, uncovering mechanistic links between inflammation and ferroptosis involved in microplastic-induced seizure exacerbation. Finally, utilizing mice behavioral assays, our results validate how microplastic exposure disrupts iron and lipid metabolism in the brain, triggering neuronal ferroptosis in the hippocampus. Our study not only deepens our understanding of the neurological impacts of microplastic exposure but also identifies viable pathways for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - This paper presents the development of blast explosion sound jig to be used as wild boar repellent in oil palm plantations. The wild boar is a common problem to farmers, especially in oil palm plantations. Until now, there is still no efficient approach to overcome this problem aside from traditional methods such as hunting and trapping the animals. The proposed jig was designed by using Solid Works 2018 and Proteus Professional 8.7 and fabricated with low-cost material. Experimental work had been carried out to study the effectiveness of the developed jig to produce the significant blast sound that can be used to scare off the wild boar. It was shown that the developed jig able to produce 88.77 dB to 100.14 dB at the area of 0.26 to 9.35 acres. These values were in between the hearing of wild boar sensitivity range. Hence, based on recorded sound analysis, it was believed this jig can be used to repel the wild boar effectively.

AB  - This research investigated the effects of cassava residue meal (CRM) and fermented CRM (FCRM) on the growth performance, serum lipid indicators, carcass traits, and meat quality of Huanjiang mini-pigs. One hundred twenty Huanjiang mini-pigs with similar BW (body weight, 8.85 +/- 0.64 kg) were divided into three dietary treatment groups: the CON group with a basal diet; the CRM group with a diet containing 5% CRM; and the FCRM group with a diet containing 5% FCRM. The feeding trial was conducted for 30 days. The findings revealed that dietary CRM and FCRM did not influence the growth performance and diarrhea rate of Huanjiang mini-pigs (p > 0.05). Dietary FCRM supplementation increased serum total cholesterol level compared to the CON group while decreasing serum cholinesterase level compared to the CON and CRM groups (p < 0.05). The level of serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was higher (p < 0.05) in the CRM and FCRM groups in regard to the CON group. In addition, CRM and FCRM supplementation reduced (p < 0.05) the backfat thickness and carcass yield of Huanjiang mini-pigs. The meat quality analysis showed that dietary CRM and FCRM improved the meat quality by increasing the intramuscular fat content and redness (a*) value and decreasing the lightness (L*) value. Moreover, the MyHC-IIx expression in the longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle was upregulated (p < 0.05) in the CRM group, while MYHC-IIb expression displayed an increasing trend (p = 0.076) in the FCRM group relative to the CON group. The fatty acid composition in the LT muscle also revealed that the C20:0 level was lower in the CRM and FCRM groups, while the & sum;SFA and & sum;SFA/& sum;UFA were reduced (p < 0.05) in the FCRM group relative to the CON group. In summary, dietary CRM and FCRM supplementation improved the meat quality of Huanjiang mini-pigs without affecting growth performance and diarrhea rate. Notably, FCRM exhibited better effects on meat quality than CRM.

AB  - Simple Summary None of the approved methods for stunning pigs prior to slaughter is ideal from an animal welfare viewpoint. A method involving use of high-expansion foam to encapsulate nitrogen gas has recently been proposed as an alternative humane stunning method. The method is effective, but the foam itself induces some distress to individually exposed pigs. This study evaluated the effects of companionship from a familiar or unfamiliar conspecific during air-filled foam exposure on pigs' behavioural response. Companionship was found to be related to lower activity levels and fewer escape attempts. When comparing companionship with familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, it was found that pig pairs with familiar individuals spent more time in physical contact during foam exposure, possibly seeking social support. The results highlight the importance of contact with conspecifics when studying animal welfare and demonstrates the potential benefits of maintaining stable familiar pig groups up to the point of stunning at slaughter. The common method of stunning pigs using high concentration carbon dioxide prior to slaughter poses an animal welfare issue, as the gas is aversive. Proof of concept for using nitrogen gas encapsulated in high-expansion foam as an alternative non-aversive method for stunning pigs has recently been presented. However, the individually tested pigs showed distress-related responses to foam exposure, regardless of whether it was nitrogen- or air-filled. This study examined the effect of companionship from a familiar or unfamiliar pig on behaviours in 72 nine-weeks old pigs during exposure to air-filled foam. Escape attempts were observed by 75% of solitary pigs, 42% of pigs with unfamiliar conspecifics, and 33% of pigs with familiar conspecifics. Familiar pig pairs clearly preferred social contact during foam exposure, whereas this was not as clear in unfamiliar pig pairs, and their motivation for social contact could have multiple explanations. The results from this study highlight the importance of contact with conspecifics when studying animal welfare and suggest that familiarity between pigs is important for social support, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining social groups to reduce distress in pigs at slaughter.

AB  - Cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) have been recognized as being predominantly herbivorous. However, Romanian Carpathian cave bears have displayed a flexible diet based on a wide range of delta 15N values. In this work, we analyse 97 lower first molars of Ursus spelaeus and contemporaneous Ursus arctos from different sites in this region, using dental microwear analysis to reconstruct their pre-dormancy diets during MIS 3. Newly obtained radiocarbon dates of the individuals are also reported. The short-term diet of all populations studied is identified as omnivorous, with a preference for the consumption of hard objects. For the first time, the widespread presence of puncture pits on U. spelaeus populations has been observed, which could be linked to the intake of seeded and hard-shelled fruits from temperate broadleaf trees. Hence, the dietary patterns of Carpathian cave bears exhibit similarities to those of present-day brown bears inhabiting the same region and suggests that the Carpathians served as an ecological refuge for cave bear specimens. This is reinforced by an early 27.1 cal kyr B.P. date from an individual from Urs,ilor Cave, which sheds light on the potential dietary continuity of Romanian Carpathian cave bear populations even during the final phases leading up to their extinction.

AB  - Plant reproduction is often inhibited by herbivorous leaf damage, which affects the resource pool allocated for reproduction. Rhododendron kaempferi var. kaempferi is a semi-evergreen shrub widely distributed in Japan, and its leaves are occasionally damaged by sawfly larvae (Arge similis). This species is partially self-compatible, but its selfed seedlings suffer from inbreeding depression. Our study aimed to clarify (1) the magnitude of herbivorous damage under natural conditions, (2) the effects of foliage damage on seed number and mass, and (3) the possibility of selective abortion of selfed seeds to maintain outcrossed seed production under resource limitation. In the 2022 survey, 2 of the 20 ramets observed were collectively parasitized by sawfly larvae, and the most damaged ramet had a 59.6% foliage loss. In contrast, the herbivorous damage in 2023 was consistently low throughout the growing season, averaging a 3.2% loss. Leaf excision reduced the seed number per fruit (i.e., low seed-set rate) but did not affect the individual seed mass. The outcrossing rate of the excision treatment (81.7%) was significantly higher than that of the control (72.0%). The values of seed-set rate x outcrossing rate were 0.172 for the excision treatment and 0.171 for the control, nearly equal. Our results indicated that (1) sawfly larvae damage was concentrated on a few specific plants, (2) intense foliage damage reduced seed number but not seed mass, and (3) R. kaempferi mitigated the decline in outcrossed seed production by the abortion of selfed seeds when leaves were intensively damaged.

AB  - The reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are produced during storage of boar semen are causing oxidative stress and leads to poor fertility. Also, tropical and sub-tropical weather condition adversely impacts the physicomorphological quality and fertility of boar sperm. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of feeding linseed oil to boar on its seminal attributes, sperm kinetics, biomarkers of antioxidant, fatty acid profile of seminal plasma (SP) and sperm and in vivo fertility. Six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed with 90 ml linseed oil (LIN) whereas six Hampshire crossbreed boars were fed 90 ml canola oil (CON) for 16 weeks. Sperm quality was evaluated (60 ejaculates for each group; a total of 120 ejaculates) for motility, livability, abnormal morphology, acrosomal membrane integrity, hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) and sperm kinetic parameters by computer assisted semen analysis (CASA) at 0 h and at 72 h of storage at 17 degrees C. Biomarkers of antioxidant (glutathione peroxidase; GPx, catalase; CAT, total antioxidant capacity; TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in SP and serum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the estimation of fatty acid composition of SP and sperm. Boars fed with linseed oil had higher semen volume (p < .01) and more total sperm numbers (p < .01). Feeding linseed oil to boar enhanced seminal attributes (p < .05) at 0 h as well as at 72 h of storage. Linseed oil feeding (p < .01) improved biomarkers of antioxidants and significantly (p < .01) lowered the lipid peroxidation in serum and SP. Linseed oil feeding (p < .05) increased the proportion of alpha linolenic (ALA), arachidonic and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in SP. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids in sperm increased significantly (p < .01) in treatment group. Farrowing rate was significantly (p < .05) higher in treatment group. In conclusion, feeding linseed oil to boar improved the in vivo fertility, enhanced antioxidant capacity and increased the DHA content of SP and sperm.

AB  - Livestock production contributes to releasing methane into the atmosphere. Liquid manure management offers significant opportunities to reduce these emissions. A better understanding of the factors controlling methane emissions from manure is necessary to select effective mitigation strategies. Our study aimed to identify the influence of storage temperature and the associated change in chemical composition on methane emissions from dairy and fattening pig manure. Storage temperature affects microbial activity and induces changes in chemical composition that are key influences in methane emissions. Dairy and fattening pig manure samples were stored at five different temperatures (5-25 degrees C) for 90 days in a laboratory-scale experiment to measure the methane production. The chemical composition of the slurry samples was analyzed, and the biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were performed before and after storage. For pig manure stored at 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C, methane emissions accounted for 69.3% and 50.3% of the BMP, respectively. Maximum methane emissions for dairy slurry were observed at 25 degrees C but remained at a low level. Analyses of the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during storage are presented in few studies, this work revealed a potential inhibition of methane production, where the accumulation of VFAs was most elevated in samples stored at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. This partly counteracted the increase in methane emissions expected from the higher temperatures. The degree of VFA and dissociated fatty acids accumulation in dairy cattle slurry should be assessed for more accurate estimations of methane emissions from slurry stores.

AB  - Glass-forming liquids are broadly classified as being fragile or strong, depending on the deviation from Arrhenius behavior of their relaxation times. A fragile to strong crossover is observed or inferred in liquids like water and silica, and more recently also in metallic glasses and phase change alloys, leading to the expectation that such a crossover is more widely realised among glass formers. We investigate computationally the well-studied KobAndersen model, accessing temperatures well below the mode coupling temperature TMCT. We find that relaxation times exhibit a crossover in dynamics around TMCT, and discuss whether it bears characteristics of the fragile to strong crossover. Several aspects of dynamical heterogeneity exhibit behavior mirroring the dynamical crossover, whereas thermodynamic quantities do not. In particular, the Adam-Gibbs relation describing the relation between relaxation times and configurational entropy continues to hold below the dynamical crossover, when anharmonic corrections to the vibrational entropy are included.

AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate the repeatability of behavioral traits in sheep subjected to a 5-min arena test. Two separate tests were conducted over two years to assess the among-individual consistency of behavioral responses in 68 nonpregnant Norduz ewes (2-5 years of age). During each arena test, five behavioral variables were measured: distance to group sheep (DTG), locomotor activity (LOC), zone boundaries crossed (CRS), vocalization (VOC), escape attempts (ESC). A linear mixed model was used to predict DTG and LOC, while a GLMM with a Poisson distribution was used to predict VOC, CRS, and ESC. Age and year were used as fixed factors in both models. The effect of the year was statistically significant on DTG, LOC, and CRS (P < 0.05). The correlations between traits changed over time. In the first year, DTG had no correlation with other variables. However, DTG had a significant positive correlation with LOC (0.54) and CRS (0.64) in the second year. The repeatability of behavioral variables was estimated as linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs). To estimate adjusted repeatability, the ewes' age and the year of testing were included as fixed effects. The ID of ewes was included as a random effect in all models. The effect of age was statistically significant on LOC and CRS (P < 0.05). The repeatability of behavioral variables varied from the lowest for the ESC (R = 0.10; 95 % CI [0.000, 0.389], P = 0.319) to the highest for the VOC (R = 0.38; 95 % CI [0.054, 0.614], P = 0.006). These results indicate the consistency of among-individual variation in sheep be-haviors that was measured in the arena test.

AB  - This study documented the wild plants used by Tibetans and the related traditional knowledge in Burang Town (Karnali River Valley). Ethnobotanical surveys, including semi-structured interviews and participatory observations, were conducted in five Tibetan communities in July 2020 and August 2021. The informant consensus factor (ICF) and cultural importance index (CI) were used for data analyses. In total, 76 wild species belonging to 58 genera and 30 families were determined to be used. These included 26 edible, 29 medicinal, 34 fodder, 21 fuel, 17 incense, three economic, three dye, two ritual, two handicraft, and one species for tobacco plants species; many of these have multiple uses. The top five important plants are Carum carvi (CI = 1.88), Hippophae tibetana (CI = 1.45), Rheum moorcroftianum (CI = 0.87), Urtica dioica (CI = 1.45) and Chenopodium album (CI = 0.75). Of the wild plant species used, 53 were recorded in croplands and 25 were found in alpine pastures. This pattern of use is influenced by local livelihood patterns and culture. Plants in highland cropland have diverse ethnobotanical values that are often overlooked. These findings will inform strategies and plans for local communities and governments to sustainably use and protect plants at high altitudes.

AB  - Social hierarchies are often found in group-living animals and can be formed through pairwise aggressive interactions. The dominance rank can influence reproductive success (RS) with a skew towards high-ranking individuals. Using game theory, we investigate how the opportunity for differently ranked individuals to achieve RS influences the costs of hierarchy formation and the strength of winner and loser effects. In our model, individuals adjust their aggressive and submissive behaviour towards others through reinforcement learning. The learning is based on rewards and penalties, which depend on relative fighting ability. From individual-based simulations, we determine evolutionary equilibria of traits such as learning rates. We examine situations that differ in the extent of monopolisation of contested RS by dominants and in the proportion of total RS that is contested. The model implements two kinds of fighting costs: a decrease in effective fighting ability from damage (loss of condition) and a risk of mortality that increases with the total accumulated damage. Either of these costs can limit the amount of fighting. We find that individuals form stable dominance hierarchies, with a positive correlation between dominance position and fighting ability. The accumulated costs differ between dominance positions, with the highest costs paid by low or intermediately ranked individuals. Costs tend to be higher in high-skew situations. We identify a 'stay-in, opt-out' syndrome, comprising a range from weaker (stay-in) to stronger (opt-out) winner-loser effects. We interpret the opt-out phenotype to be favoured by selection on lower ranked individuals to opt out of contests over social dominance, because it is more pronounced when more of the total RS is uncontested. We discuss our results in relation to field and experimental observations and argue that there is a need for empirical investigation of the behaviour and reproductive success of lower ranked individuals.

AB  - Mice in the genus Peromyscus are abundant and geographically widespread in North America, serving as reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi), the causative agent of Lyme disease, transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks. While the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus (P. leucopus)) is the primary reservoir in the United States, the deer mouse (P. maniculatus), an ecologically similar congener, rarely transmits the pathogen to biting ticks. Understanding the factors that allow these similar species to serve as a poor and competent reservoir is critical for understanding tick-borne disease ecology and epidemiology, especially as climate change expands the habitats where ticks can transmit pathogens. Our study investigated immunological differences between these rodent species. Specifically, we compared the expression of six immune genes (i.e., TLR-2, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-10, GATA-3, TGF-beta) broadly involved in bacterial recognition, elimination, and/or pathology mitigation in ear biopsies collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as part of their routine surveillance. A principal components analysis indicated that immune gene expression in both species varied in two dimensions: TLR2, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and IL-10 (comprising PC1) and TGF-beta and GATA3 (comprising PC2) expression tended to covary within individuals. However, when we analyzed expression differences of each gene singly between species, P. maniculatus expressed more TLR2, IL-6, and IL-10 but less IFN-gamma and GATA3 than P. leucopus. This immune profile could partly explain why P. leucopus is a better reservoir for bacterial pathogens such as B. burgdorferi.

AB  - Since chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) conservation often involves local human populations, conservation strategies must consider psychological factors that impact their behavior. In Budongo Forest, Uganda, for example, local communities commonly engage in snare trap (hereafter: snare) setting for wild meat. This illegal activity posits a substantial threat to wild chimpanzees, causing permanent wounds or death for those who are snared. Despite various schemes previously implemented to address snare setting-an activity that is fueled by poverty, the problem and its detrimental impact on chimpanzees persists. Here, we experimentally tested a novel intervention, a systematic display of specially designed warning signs aimed at local poachers. We monitored the presence of snares before and after introducing these signs over a total period of two years and compared it with that of a similar sized control area with no intervention. Results show that snares were less likely to be present during the "sign" period than during the "non-sign" period in the experimental but not in the control area. We discuss the potential of this cost-effective intervention for limiting illegal activities that pose a severe threat to chimpanzees and other species inhabiting tropical forests.

AB  - A multitude of pathways within human food chains have been affected by the presence of lead (Pb) which has highly negative consequences on animal and human health. Numerous sources contribute to Pb exposure, and the use of Pb ammunition is considered one of the main unregulated means of releasing this hazardous metal into the game meat and environment. In addition to this, geogenic sources or anthropogenic activities could also result in higher contamination of game meat. Considering these aspects, the present study was carried out in wild boar (n = 53) from different hunting grounds in northern part of Sardinia (Italy) for evaluation of mean residual levels in liver, spleen, and thigh muscle through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest mean concentration of Pb was estimated in liver (6.70 +/- 34.87 mg/kg dw) followed by spleen (5.11 +/- 22.36 mg/kg dw) and thigh muscle (2.67 +/- 11.74 mg/kg dw). Concerning biological sexes, females (n = 27) had higher mean levels for all tissues, however, no differences were ascertained in the bioaccumulation of Pb. Among the age groups, adults had higher accumulation of Pb in all tissues compared to juveniles. Nevertheless, the level of Pb in both groups did not yield any accumulation pattern. Additionally, a moderate correlation was calculated for liver and spleen (0.643, p < 0.01) for Pb accumulation. The risk assessment revealed a very high risk to the hunters who frequently consume the game meals as margin of exposure for this group was very low. In comparison with EFSA guidelines, none of the samples was fully fit for human consumption which calls for inclusion of game meat in the EU regulation.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Animal welfare is a major challenge that most European pig producers have been facing in recent decades to comply with EU legislation and to meet the increasing societal and market demand for pork produced in a sustainable way. Pig welfare is ruled in terms of minimum requirements for housing and management, but stakeholders have considered that both farm-level and animal-based indicators are fundamental to monitor animal welfare. Some of the welfare issues still affecting fattening pigs are the lack of space, bedding and manipulable material, and the continued practice of routine tail docking of pigs. Tail docking is applied routinely across most European countries to reduce the occurrence of severe tail biting lesions, despite its ban in the EU. An observational study on 51 pig farms in seven EU countries, aimed at investigating housing risk factors for the welfare of finishing pigs, showed that body weight and presence of bedded solid floored resting area (BED) identify three clusters of farms. The outcomes of this study confirmed that BED and larger availability of space per pig, above the minimum requirement of EU legislation, can limit the occurrence of lesions in pigs with undocked tails.<br>Pig welfare is affected by housing conditions, the minimum requirements of which are set up by EU legislation. Animal and non-animal-based measures are useful indicators to investigate housing risk factors for pig welfare. An observational study on 51 pig farms in seven EU countries, aimed at investigating housing risk factors for the welfare of finishing pigs, showed body weight and presence of bedded solid floored resting area (BED) identifying three clusters of farms. Farms with BED were featured by no or limited tail docking, larger availability of manipulable materials and lower number of pigs per farm and per annual work unit. In these farms, less skin and ear lesions were found, compared with lean pigs of farms without BED, which were characterized by lower pig space allowance, mortality rate and medication cost. In farms without BED, heavy pigs were featured by more space per pig, more pigs per drinker and higher mortality rate and medication cost per pig, compared to lean pigs. No statistical difference in tail lesions was found between the three farm clusters, although tail docking was performed in all farms without BED and not performed on most farms with BED.

AB  - Sheep bones, as the main byproduct after sheep slaughter, are rich in proteins, but their utilization in deep processing is relatively low. Currently, calcium deficiency is a common health issue that can lead to metabolic bone diseases. Peptide calcium chelate is considered a superior substance, having a significant effect on improving the absorption and utilization efficiency of calcium in the human body. This study used sheep bone byproducts as the raw material to prepare sheep bone peptide-chelated calcium (SBP-Ca) and its structure was characterized and analyzed in depth. SBP-Ca was supplemented in a low-calcium diet to assess its effects on calcium absorption and bone formation in a rat model experiencing calcium deficiency. The results showed that under optimal preparation conditions for SBP-Ca (peptide-calcium ratio set at 1 : 1, pH maintained at 7, temperature set to 45 degrees C, and duration of 60 min), calcium could chelate with sheep bone peptide (SBP) at the sites C=O, -NH2, and -COOH sites, forming a structurally dense SBP-Ca with a chelation rate of up to 89.24%. In rats fed a low-calcium diet, SBP-Ca significantly improved the rat femoral diameter, dry weight, trabecular bone structure, bone density, and bone volume fraction ( P < 0.05 ). A decline in serum alkaline phosphatase levels ( P < 0.05 ), elevation in bone calcium content, and a rise in serum osteocalcin levels ( P < 0.05 ) were observed. Furthermore, morphological studies on bone tissue suggest that SBP-Ca has the ability to restore trabecular bone structure. In conclusion, SBP-Ca has been successfully prepared as a novel calcium absorption promoter. By improving the bioavailability of calcium, bone formation was facilitated, demonstrating a significant application value in the prevention of calcium deficiency disorders.

AB  - Autonomous navigation plays a crucial role in cutting-edge scientific and technological domains, such as autonomous driving and space exploration. Current models often rely on knowledge of the discharge patterns of navigation cells in living organisms (e.g. place/grid cells) to encode spatial information, which works well in ideal environments. However, real-world autonomous navigation presents greater challenges due to complex and dynamic geospatial information, leading to issues such as low robustness, poor interpretability, and high energy consumption for existing models. To address these challenges, it is essential to explore the roles and functional connectivity of distinct brain regions involved in processing real-world geospatial information and integrate these insights into autonomous navigation algorithms. This paper reviews empirical studies using neuroscientific techniques to investigate how the human brain processes geographical information during navigation. In particular, we discuss opportunities and challenges associated with three critical aspects: (1) expanding the understanding of cognitive mechanisms from isolated regional functions to integrated functional connectivity and large-scale brain networks, (2) refining neurocognitive experiments to provide ecologically valid evidence in complex and dynamic contexts and (3) developing efficient approaches to computationally mimic and implement spatial cognition mechanisms of human brain in navigation algorithms. Addressing these difficulties would not only enable machines to navigate autonomously and effectively in complex real-world and extreme environments (e.g. space and the deep sea) but also pave the way for the development of future intelligent systems (e.g. GeoAI) with human-like cognitive capabilities.

AB  - Monitoring the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) is vital for addressing the global crisis of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Despite its importance, the characterization of ARGs and microbiome structures, as well as the identification of indicators for routine ARG monitoring in pig farms, are still lacking, particularly concerning variations in antimicrobial exposure in different countries or regions. Here, metagenomics and random forest machine learning were used to elucidate the ARG profiles, microbiome structures, and ARG contamination indicators in pig manure under different antimicrobial pressures between China and Europe. Results showed that Chinese pigs exposed to high-level antimicrobials exhibited higher total and plasmid-mediated ARG abundances compared to those in European pigs (P<0.05). ANT(6)-Ib, APH(3')-IIIa, and tet(40) were identified as shared core ARGs between the two pig populations. Furthermore, the core ARGs identified in pig populations were correlated with those found in human populations within the same geographical regions. Lactobacillus and Prevotella were identified as the dominant genera in the core microbiomes of Chinese and European pigs, respectively. Forty ARG markers and 43 biomarkers were able to differentiate between the Chinese and European pig manure samples with accuracies of 100% and 98.7%, respectively. Indicators for assessing ARG contamination in Chinese and European pigs also achieved high accuracy (r=0.72-0.88). Escherichia flexneri in both Chinese and European pig populations carried between 21 and 37 ARGs. The results of this study emphasize the importance of global collaboration in reducing antimicrobial resistance risk and provide validated indicators for evaluating the risk of ARG contamination in pig farms.

AB  - Toxorhynchites are often nicknamed "elephant mosquitoes" due to their large size and bent proboscis. These colorful mosquitoes are generally covered with iridescent and metallic-colored scales and do not require blood feeding to perform their oogenesis since females acquire all the required proteins during their larval stages. Consequently, they are not involved in the transmission of pathogens, and are not considered to be of medical importance. This genus is comprised of 89 species worldwide, including three in Cambodia. During a survey conducted in Veun Sai Siem Pang National Park and in Kirirom National Park in 2021, several larvae of Toxo-rhynchites were collected inside pitchers of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes smilesii. Upon investigation, they were proven to belong to a new species, Tx. domrey sp. nov., described in the present article. LSID: https://zoobank.org/6D09A56F-A509-4FE6-BE4B-BAB5F0CB748F.

AB  - Flaxseed oil is an excellent source of the essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Omega-3 PUFAs are important neuronal components and can counteract aggressive, depressive, and anxiety-like behavior, reduce glucocorticoid (e.g. cortisol) concentrations under chronic stress but also increase acute glucocorticoid responses. As glucocorticoids per se and glucocorticoid responsiveness can modulate the establishment of dominance hierarchies, we investigated if flaxseed oil high in ALA can promote social dominance through effects on glucocorticoid concentrations. Two male and two female groups of domestic guinea pigs (n = 9 per group) were maintained on a control or a 5% (w/w) flaxseed oil diet for four weeks. Social behaviors, hierarchy indices, locomotion, and saliva cortisol concentrations were determined during basal group housing conditions and stressful social confrontations with unfamiliar individuals of the other groups. Flaxseed groups had increased basal cortisol concentrations and showed no cortisol increase during social confrontations. Cortisol concentrations in control groups significantly increased during social confrontations. Such higher cortisol responses positively affected individual hierarchy indices in control males. However, flaxseed males became dominant irrespective of cortisol concentrations. In females, the opposite was detected, namely a higher dominant status in control compared to flaxseed females. Open-field- and dark-light-tests for anxiety-like behavior revealed no pronounced differences, but flaxseed males showed the highest locomotor activity. Flaxseed oil as an ALA source sex-specifically promoted social dominance irrespective of cortisol concentrations and responses. The underlying neuronal mechanisms remain to be determined, but a sex-specific energetic advantage may have accounted for this effect.

AB  - Inbreeding may initially lower population fitness by converting masked genetic load into realised load. As deleterious variants become increasingly homozygous, purifying selection acts more effectively to purge load. Nevertheless, not all populations can survive the initial fitness decline, and it would be interesting to examine scenarios that facilitate their survival. Herein, we assembled chromosome-level reference genomes of two paradise fishes, Macropodus hongkongensis and M. opercularis, and resequenced 109 wild individuals of 15 populations to infer the history of runs of homozygosity (ROH) formation, effectiveness of purging in ROH, and the role of balancing selection in maintaining lingering polymorphisms in independently evolved small populations. While the two species diverged in genes potentially adaptive to their local niches, there were large variations in inbreeding coefficients and the amount of genetic load within species. Three populations became highly inbred (F-ROH > 0.50) from independent origins. Simulations showed that the ROH segment size distribution can be best explained by living in a small population for hundreds, if not thousands, of generations. The genetic load negatively correlated with summed ROH length. This was driven by more effective purging in ROH. The non-ROH regions between individuals from different high-F-ROH populations were repeatable, with nearby signals of balancing selection persisting in the polymorphic genomic regions through species divergence.

AB  - Simple Summary Currently, although extruded full-fat soybean (EFS) and enzyme-treated soybean meal (ESBM) are both commonly used plant proteins in the diets of nursery pigs, there are few studies focusing on comparing the effect of ESBM and EFS on immune response and gut development of pigs. This study found that ESBM replacing EFS could enhance performance by improving immune response, antioxidant status, gut morphology, and barrier function of nursery pigs in antibiotic free diets. The results revealed that ESBM could be an effective plant protein resource to alleviate weaning stress in pigs. This study aims to investigate the effects of ESBM on performance, antioxidant status, immune response, and intestinal barrier function of nursery pigs in antibiotic free diets compared with EFS. A total of 32 Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire) barrows (initial body weight of 8.05 +/- 0.66 kg, weaned on d 28) were selected and allocated to two treatments with 16 replicates per treatment and one pig per replicate using a complete random design. The treatments included an EFS group (basal diet + 24% EFS; EFS) and an ESBM group (basal diet + 15% ESBM; ESBM). Corn was used to balance energy and diets were iso-nitrogenous at about 18% crude protein. The experiment lasted for 14 days and pigs were slaughtered for sampling on d 14. Compared with EFS, pigs fed ESBM showed enhanced (p < 0.05) gain to feed ratio and average daily gain and a reduced (p < 0.05) diarrhea score. These pigs had increased (p < 0.05) contents of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, IgG, interleukin-10, and ferric reducing ability of plasma, as well as decreased (p < 0.05) malondialdehyde, IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and diamine oxidase level in serum and TNF-alpha level in the jejunal mucosa. Moreover, these pigs also showed enhanced (p < 0.05) villus height/crypt depth in ileum, villus height in duodenum, protein expression of zonula-occludens-1 in jejunal mucosa, and fecal total volatile fatty acids and butyric acid contents. In conclusion, ESBM replacing EFS could enhance performance via improving immune response, antioxidant status, gut morphology, and barrier function of nursery pigs in antibiotic free diets.

AB  - The addition of antioxidants in boar semen is an alternative to mitigate the reduction of sperm quality during preservation. To evaluate the effect of carvacrol on cooling of boar semen. Fifteen ejaculates from five boars were extended in MR-A (R) with 0, 5, 10, 15, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mu M of carvacrol (C) and were cooled for 5 days at 16 degrees C. Sperm motility and kinetics were evaluated with computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). At 0 and 96 h, membrane functionality was determined by hypoosmotic test; reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) by spectrofluorimetry and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta YM) by flow cytometry. Linear models, regression analysis and comparison of means by Duncan test, were conducted. The addition of carvacrol did not influence sperm motility, but at low concentrations decreased ROS production, whereas 30 mu M C reduced the membrane functionality and 25 mu M C decreased Delta YM. In addition, regression coefficients showed that C produced a lower rate of decrease in different parameters of sperm motility and kinetics. During cooling there is a reduction in sperm quality due to the excessive production of ROS, generating oxidative stress and affecting cell permeability and functionality. In this study, it was possible to demonstrate the protective activity of C as a molecule capable of neutralizing free radicals. In addition, it has been proposed that C is also capable of reducing peroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. Carvacrol can mitigate the reduction of boar semen quality during the storage period under cooling conditions. Likewise, it can reduce ROS production and modulate the mitochondrial activity of porcine sperm.

AB  - The Central American brocket deer (Mazama temama) is widespread across the Mesoamerican forests, yet it remains largely unknown. Three subspecies are recognized currently within M. temama using pelage coloration as the primary diagnostic character. However, it remains unclear if there is any pattern of morphological variation throughout its distribution. We compared two models of morphological subdivision, namely the traditional subspecies and another based on biogeographic provinces via 2D geometric morphometrics and ecological niche modeling. The second model presented a better fit to the observed variation in cranial shape and size. We found divergence in skull size between individuals from Mexico and Guatemala (northern group) relative to specimens from Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama (southern group), the latter being 8% larger than the northern group. Centroid size showed a significant correlation with geographic distance suggesting an isolation-by-distance pattern. Low geographical overlap between the two clusters suggests niche conservatism. Late Pleistocene dispersal from South to Central America and differences in available resources with subsequent isolation due to climatic barriers therefore may have promoted differentiation in size albeit without extensive changes in shape. In this context, the Motagua-Polochic-Jolotan fault system probably plays a key role in promoting morphological differentiation by climatic isolation. Finally, we suggest that M. t. temama () and M. t. reperticia should remain as valid names for the two morphological and ecologically differentiated groups detected here.

AB  - Background Poor estrus expression behavior causes suboptimal reproductive efficiency through poor conception rate. Various signaling pathways are involved in estrus expression but arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene with oxytocin predominantly regulates estrus behavior. This study aimed to perform genomic characterization and evolutionary dynamics of AVP gene through association testing of the novel polymorphic loci and comparative genomic analysis to explore the potential effect of AVP gene on estrus behavior of Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Methods and results 198 Nili-Ravi buffaloes were screened for the quest of novel polymorphism in the AVP gene. In exon-1, five polymorphic sites were detected including deletion of two (c.47delA and c.57delA) nucleotides that caused drastic variation in subsequent amino acid sequence due to frame shift including functional short peptide of nine residues. The 3-D structure revealed a loss of transmembrane loop between 16 and 31 residues in Nili-Ravi buffalo AVP protein sequence, suggesting that missing loop apparently reduced the gene functionality in Nili-Ravi buffalo by inhibiting cellular reactions and muting the animal estrus cyclicity. Three polymorphisms detected in AVP gene were significantly associated with silent estrus (P < 0.05). The comparative genomic analysis revealed that AVP gene is present on chromosome 14 having one conserved motif (Neurohypophysial) in buffalo. Conclusions This study suggested the potential use of polymorphic sites as promising genetic markers for selection of buffaloes with pronounced estrus expression.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth and survival of local and Dorper crossbred lambs managed under a community-based management system, using data collected between 2012 and 2021. The fixed effects considered were breed, location, sex, type of birth, parity, season, and year of birth. The results revealed that Dorper crossbred lambs consistently weighed and gained more than local lambs (p<0.0001) at all ages and that environmental factors such as location, sex, type of birth, parity, season, and year of birth had considerable influence on most growth traits at all ages. The mean birth weight of local, low-grade, and high-grade Dorper crossbred lambs were 2.12 +/- 0.04, 2.94 +/- 0.03, and 3.08 +/- 0.03 kg, respectively. The corresponding preweaning daily gain was 89.12 +/- 1.85, 112.16 +/- 1.38, and 117.98 +/- 1.71 g/day, respectively. The postweaning body weight gain at 90-180 days for the same groups was 32.6 +/- 2.16, 46.85 +/- 1.62, and 45.93 +/- 1.98 g/day, respectively. Dorper crossbred lambs exhibited a bodyweight advantage of up to 45%, 31%, 34%, and 28% over local lambs at birth, 3, 6, and 12 months of age, respectively. Lambs born in the dry season had the lowest weaning (p<0.0001) and six-month (p = 0.0098) weight compared to those born in the rainy seasons. Lamb genotype didn't have a significant influence on the survival of lambs at all ages, but most environmental factors influenced survivability. Lambs born to ewes in their 5th parity and above had a mortality risk of 0.51 times higher than those born to ewes in their 1st to 4th parity at the age of 6- months. Year of lambing affected lamb pre-weaning (chi 2 = 0.0003) and post-weaning (chi 2 = 0.0001) survival. Compared to the base year 2021, lambs born in 2017 and 2018 had a higher risk of mortality at 6-month (10.1 and 15.9 times, respectively) than those born in 2021. Season of birth also significantly (chi 2 <0.001) affected lamb survivability, with lambs born in the dry season, having a higher mortality risk at weaning (0.46 times) and yearling (0.66 times). Lambs with a birth weight of 2 kg and below had a 2.3 times higher survival risk at 6-months compared to lambs born with 3 kg and above. In conclusion, Dorper crossbred lambs can be considered to improve lamb growth performance and produce fast-growing lambs. However, the study recommends further research to validate the crossbreeding program (considering the influential production environment, research on supplementation for lambs in the dryseason, adjusting the mating season, and the economic feasibility of crossbreeding are suggested).

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigated the effects of different standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys levels on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, serum metabolites, and carcass and meat traits of Baqing pigs. The results revealed that the addition of dietary SID Lys was beneficial for the average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed ratio (G/F), and average daily gain (ADG) of Baqing pigs at the growth phase. The serum concentrations of triglycerides, lysine, and histidine increased by increasing dietary Lys levels. Compared with the treatment three group, dietary SID Lys addition content at treatment four increased the shear force of the longissimus dorsi muscle, but it did not affect the other carcass and meat traits. The SID Lys requirement of 20-40 kg, 40-60 kg, and 60-90 kg of Baqing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets is estimated to be 0.92%, 0.66%, and 0.55% of the diets, respectively. This study was carried out to determine the Lys requirements of Baqing pigs and the effects of different dietary lysine levels on growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, serum metabolites, and carcass and meat traits. A total of 120 castrated Baqing pigs were selected by body weight and randomly assigned to five dietary treatments with six replicate pens (4 pigs per pen, castrated) per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Five diets in mash form were formulated to contain SID Lys at 0.56%, 0.68%, 0.80%, 0.92%, and 1.04% of diet in phase 1 (20-40 kg), at 0.45%, 0.54%, 0.63%, 0.72%, and 0.81% of diet in phase 2 (40-60 kg), and at 0.39%, 0.47%, 0.55%, 0.63%, and 0.71% of diet in phase 3 (60-90 kg), respectively. The results showed that the bodyweight of pigs was not affected by dietary SID Lys content during each period. However, the addition of dietary SID Lys linearly reduced F/G in the first period and quadratically increased ADG during the second period (p < 0.05). The digestible energy (DE) was increased linearly and quadratically in the first phases with the dietary increased SID Lys levels, while DE was reduced in the third and second phases (p < 0.05). Increasing SID Lys contents linearly increased the serum TG concentration and quadratically decreased the serum GLU concentration, while linearly reducing the serum HDLC concentration of first period pigs (p < 0.05). Serum concentrations of TP, TG, TC, and LDLC were increased linearly with the increasing dietary SID Lys levels in the second period (p < 0.05). The serum concentrations of Lys increased quadratically, and histidine increased linearly with the increased dietary SID Lys levels (p < 0.05). Compared with the treatment three group, dietary SID Lys addition content at treatment four increased the shear force of the longissimus dorsi muscle (p < 0.05), but it did not affect the other carcass and meat traits. The optimal SID Lys requirement of 20-40 kg, 40-60 kg, and 60-90 kg of Baqing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets is estimated to be 0.92%, 0.66%, and 0.55% of the diets by the quadratic curve models, respectively.

AB  - The article presents a description of a new species of the genus Praesinomegaceros from the Early Pleistocene of Pabbi Hills (Upper Siwaliks) in Pakistan. This is a first record of Praesinomegaceros in the geological past of the Indian Subcontinent. Unlike Praesinomegaceros from the Late Miocene of Central Asia, the Siwalik form is characterized by the loss of basal tine palmation and diminished number of crown ramifications. However, the new Siwalik cervid maintains the characteristic of Praesinomegaceros general antler bauplan. The antler shape of the new species from Pakistan reveals important evolutionary changes in ecology and ethology. Antlers of Praesinomegaceros from Siwaliks have lost their function of social display and "returned" to the effective weapon antler type. The multivariate cluster analysis of antler characters supports the close evolutionary relationship of the new cervid species from the Siwaliks with Praesinomegaceros and Sinomegaceros from the Pleistocene of Asia.

AB  - Domestic pigs are shaped by artificial and natural selection into obese and lean types that are closely related to muscle tissue. However, the key genes and regulatory mechanisms behind these developments remain largely unknown. Here, we pinpoint GRB10 specificity in muscle tissue and cells between obese and lean pigs by combining genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and single-cell transcriptomics. GRB10 shows notable differences in divergent selection on haplotype blocks and expression levels between obese and lean pig breeds, with its expression profiles varying significantly by tissue and development stage. Notably, we identify a muscle-specific promoter of GRB10 and its transcription factor KLF15. This TF-promoter binding is verified by dual luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and is suggested to be conserved in humans. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further highlights differential expression patterns of GRB10 between obese and lean pig breeds across various cell types. Type IIa myonuclei and TTN+ FAPs, which are more predominant in lean pigs, play a crucial role in myofibril assembly and muscle tissue development. These findings offer insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling muscle growth. They highlight the tissue- and cell type-specific effects of GRB10 on muscle heterogeneity, which has potential applications in livestock breeding and human obesity research.

AB  - Commonly used two-sex discrete-time population projection models rely on mating functions developed for continuous-time frameworks that overestimate the number of unions between reproductive individuals. This has important consequences for our understanding of the evolution and demography of two-sex populations and consequently for management and conservation. Here, we propose a novel mating function that is robust by obeying all properties necessary to be ecologically valid and flexible by accommodating all mating systems and efficiency in mating encounters. We illustrate the usefulness of this novel function with an application to the sexually size-dimorphic and polygynous wild boar (Sus scrofa). We show that the population growth rate depends on the harem size, the operational sex ratio, and the mating efficiency. This novel function can be applied to all mating systems and tactics and is highly relevant in the context of global changes under which mating systems and mating efficiency are expected to change.

AB  - This study investigates the genomic landscape of Sika deer populations, emphasizing the detection and characterization of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and their contribution towards components of fitness. Using 85,001 high-confidence SNPs, the investigation into ROH distribution unveiled nuanced patterns of autozygosity across individuals especially in 2 out of the 8 farms, exhibiting elevated ROH levels and mean genome coverage under ROH segments. The prevalence of shorter ROH segments (0.5-4 Mb) suggests historical relatedness and potential selective pressures within these populations. Intriguingly, despite observed variations in ROH profiles, the overall genomic inbreeding coefficient (F-ROH) remained relatively low across all farms, indicating a discernible degree of genetic exchange and effective mitigation of inbreeding within the studied Sika deer populations. Consensus ROH (cROH) were found to harbor genes for important functions viz., EGFLAM gene which is involved in the vision function of the eye, SKP2 gene which regulates cell cycle, CAPSL involved in adipogenesis, SPEF2 which is essential for sperm flagellar assembly, DCLK3 involved in the heat stress. This first ever study on ROH in Sika deer, to shed light on the adaptive role of genes in these homozygous regions. The insights garnered from this study have broader implications in the management of genetic diversity in this vulnerable species.

AB  - In the absence of red wolves (Canis rufus), coyote (Canis latrans) populations have expanded across the eastern United States. However, predator populations are particularly difficult to quantify, and it remains unclear if and when eastern coyotes will reach carrying capacity. To assess coyote population trends, we constructed an integrated population model (IPM) using coyote data recorded at the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS), a 78,000-ha National Environmental Research Park located in South Carolina, United States. Coyote densities averaged 50 coyotes/100 km2 prior to lethal control in 2010 but dropped to 14 coyotes/100 km2 in 2012 after three consecutive years of intensive lethal removal. By 2014, coyote densities stabilized around 44 coyotes/100 km2. These results suggest that coyote populations can decline under sustained intensive control efforts but may rapidly increase when control efforts are ceased. Our results highlight the power of IPMs to estimate population parameters across long time scales when data collection is both spatially and temporally heterogenous. Lethal control efforts for coyotes are prohibitively expensive at a large scale and are unlikely to be a viable long-term management strategy. Managers should instead focus on setting game species hunting limits that account for coyote presence on the landscape.

AB  - Neuronal activity regulates spatial distribution of the SUMOylation system in cytosolic and dendritic sites, which has been implicated in learning, memory, and underlying synaptic structural and functional remodeling in the hippocampus. However, the functional target proteins for activated small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and downstream molecular consequences behind long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic plasticity remain to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated neuronal activity induced the covalent modification of cytosolic Akt1 by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) in rat cortical and hippocampal CA1 neurons. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) was involved in the activity-induced Akt1 SUMO1-ylation, and K64 and K276 residues were major SUMOylated sites. Importantly, Akt1 SUMOylation at K64 and K276 enhanced its enzymatic activity and facilitated T308 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the N-terminal SAP domain of PIAS3 bound Akt1 directly. The disruption of Akt1-PIAS3 interaction by Tat-SAP, a synthetic Tat-fused cell-permeable peptide containing PIAS3 SAP domain, inhibited neuronal activity-induced Akt1 SUMOylation and impaired LTP expression and late phase LTP maintenance in the hippocampus. Correlatedly, Tat-SAP not only blocked the LTP-related extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-Elk-1-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/Arc signaling, but also disrupted mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) pathway. These findings reveal an activity-induced Akt1 SUMOylation by PIAS3 that contributes to ERK1/2-BDNF/Arc and mTOR-4E-BP1 cascades, and in turn, long-lasting excitatory synaptic responses.

AB  - Blastocystis spp. and Giardia duodenalis are two prevalent intestinal parasites with a worldwide distribution that can infect humans and animals, resulting in significant public health concerns and economic losses. For goats, infection with the two parasites can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, which is not conducive to the development of stockbreeding. Shanxi Province is one of the largest goats breeding provinces in China. However, the prevalence of Blastocystis spp. and G. duodenalis in black goats in Shanxi Province remains unknown. Thus, 1200 fecal samples of black goats were collected in five representative geographical locations in Shanxi Province to examine the presence and genotypes of G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp. by using a molecular approach. The results showed that the total infection rates of G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp. were 7.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The presence and genotypes of G. duodenalis were determined based on three established loci (tpi, bg, and gdh). Among the detected assemblages B and E of G. duodenalis, the most prevalent assemblage was E in black goats in the five study areas. One novel MLG (MLG-E12) was identified by multilocus genotypes (MLGs) analysis. Through DNA sequence analysis, four subtypes of Blastocystis spp. were found in black goats, namely ST5, ST10, ST14, and ST30, among which ST10 was the dominant subtype in this study. This is the first report of Blastocystis spp. and G. duodenalis infection in black goats in Shanxi Province, which not only enhances our understanding of the genetic diversity of Blastocystis spp. and G. duodenalis in black goats in China but also provides essential baseline data for the prevention and control of Blastocystis spp. and G. duodenalis infection in black goats in the study areas. Blastocystis spp. and Giardia duodenalis are two prevalent zoonotic intestinal parasites that can cause severe diarrhea and intestinal diseases in humans and many animals. Black goat (Capra hircus) farming is increasingly important in China due to the remarkable adaptability, high reproductive performance, rapid growth rate, and significant economic value of black goats. A number of studies have indicated that black goats are the potential reservoir of multiple zoonotic protozoans in China; however, the prevalence and zoonotic status of G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp. in black goats in Shanxi Province is still unknown. Thus, a total of 1200 fecal samples of black goats were collected from several representative regions at different altitudes in Shanxi Province and were examined for the presence and genotypes of G. duodenallis and Blastocystis spp. by amplifying the beta-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) loci of G. duodenalis and SSU rRNA of Blastocystis spp. using PCR and sequence analysis methods, respectively. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp. in black goats in Shanxi Province were 7.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Two assemblages (B and E) of G. duodenalis and four subtypes (ST5, ST10, ST14, and ST30) of Blastocystis spp. were identified, with assemblage E and ST10 as the prevalent genotype and subtype in black goats, respectively. One novel multilocus genotype (MLG) was identified in MLG-E and was designated as MLG-E12. For both G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp., the prevalence was significantly related to the region and age groups (p < 0.05). This is the first report on the prevalence of G. duodenalis and Blastocystis spp. in black goats in Shanxi Province.
   These results not only provide baseline data for the prevention and control of both parasites in black goats in Shanxi Province, but also enhance our understanding of the genetic composition and zoonotic potential of these two parasites.

AB  - Nontarget effects of insecticides used in agriculture can impact the ecosystem services provided by beneficial insects. Understanding the broader effects of chemical usage requires multispecies investigations on the impact of different insecticide active ingredients. In this work, we tested the utility of coated vials as a quick, cheap, and efficient dried residue chemical toxicity assay. This method was compared against dishes sprayed with a Potter tower, which is an industry standard instrument used to apply precise insecticide doses. Our study focused on 2 natural enemies of aphids, larval and adult stages of the Hippodamia variegata (Goeze 1777) ladybird beetle, and the parasitoid wasp, Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh 1855). These natural enemies were exposed to multiple concentrations of 3 insecticides registered for aphid control in Australian agriculture: alpha-cypermethrin (pyrethroid), dimethoate (organophosphate), and sulfoxaflor (sulfoximine). Modelled concentration-response relationships showed evidence of general differences in the intercepts between methods, but not in slope (rate of mortality with concentration). However, these subtle statistically significant effects did not translate into marked differences in LC50-values, which were comparable across assay methods for all natural enemies and insecticides tested. Coated vials therefore produced estimates of chemical toxicity that were consistent with those derived from Potter tower sprays. This underscores the validity of coated vials as a method for performing high-throughput chemical toxicity experiments, as required when examining different populations of multiple taxa across a range of insecticide active ingredients.

AB  - Flooding or rain is a threat to many insects in nature, including herbivorous invertebrates whose hosts are emergent aquatic plants. They may thus have developed particular adaptations to withstand the flooding that is a feature of emergent plants' environment. The aphid Hyalopterus pruni (Hemiptera: Aphididae) modifies the physical and chemical conditions of its habitat by periodically spreading wax around itself with its hind legs. This behaviour constitutes a form of niche construction. We hypothesized that the aphid decreases its risk of death of own or around other individuals when submerged in water by spreading wax powder secreted from its body onto the leaves of its host plant, Phragmites australis. We compared the hydrophobicity of waxed and normal leaf surfaces. Next, we compared the survival rates of wax-powdering and nonwax-powdering aphids under submerged and rainy conditions in the laboratory and in the field. Finally, we examined whether the aphids' wax-powdering behaviour increased as a result of experiencing brief submergence or rain. The surface of the waxed area was significantly more water-repellent than the surface of unwaxed leaves. The waxed areas held air bubbles when under water. In experiments, aphids without wax around themselves exhibited lower survival rates: 22.9% in laboratory conditions and 15.7% in field conditions after 48 hr underwater. In contrast, aphids that secreted wax had higher survival rates, with 41.5% and 38.2% under laboratory and field conditions, respectively, after the same duration. Aphids exposed to rainfall showed similar results. Moreover, aphids that had experienced rain or submersion for 24 hr engaged in increased wax-powdering behaviour. These results indicate that aphids reduce their risk of drowning by powdering secreted wax onto the surface of leaves around them. Our findings suggest that niche construction by herbivorous invertebrates supports their ability to utilize host plants that grow under stressful conditions, such as emergent plants that are subject to periodic inundation.

AB  - Simple Summary The total dose of exogenous gonadotropins used for superovulation might be one of the causes of premature regression of corpora lutea (PRCL) in superovulated ewes. This study evaluated the effects of different superovulatory doses of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) on luteal morphology and vascularization and assessed if serum progesterone (P-4) measurements and ovarian ultrasonography could be used for early detection of PRCL in superovulated Santa Ines ewes. Superovulatory treatment with the lowest pFSH dose (100 mg) was associated with similar luteal development to that achieved with the highest dose (200 mg), although the percentage of donor ewes that had only normal corpora lutea (CL) post-treatment was greater with a 100 mg dose of pFSH. The luteal biometrics and most of the Doppler indices of the forming luteal structures in the superovulated ewes were all correlated with their P-4 secretory ability, but only serum P-4 measurements, ultrasonographically determined luteal tissue area, and pixel heterogeneity appear to be potential markers of premature luteolysis in superovulated ewes. The analysis of individual CL formed after hormonal ovarian superstimulation should provide a more accurate tool to detect PRCL and may ultimately result in the development of a practical, non-invasive technique to minimize the adverse effects and prevent the occurrence of luteal inadequacy in ewes. Premature regression of corpora lutea (PRCL) may adversely affect the outcome of hormonal ovarian superstimulation in small ruminants, and the total dose of exogenous gonadotropins used may be one of the causes of this condition. There were two major objectives of the present study: (1) to evaluate the effects of different superovulatory doses of porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) on the biometry, blood perfusion (Doppler), and echotextural characteristics of luteal structures; and, (2) to determine the usefulness of biometric, vascular, and echotextural luteal variables, as well as measurements of circulating progesterone (P-4) concentrations for early detection of PRCL in superovulated Santa Ines ewes. Twenty-seven Santa Ines ewes received an intravaginal P-4-releasing device (CIDR) from Days 0 to 8 (Day 0 = random day of the anovulatory period). An IM injection of d-cloprostenol (37.5 mu g) was given at the time of the CIDR insertion and withdrawal. On Day 6, all the ewes received 300 IU of eCG IM and were divided into three treatment groups (each n = 9): G100 (100 mg); G133 (133 mg); and G200 (200 mg of pFSH) administered IM every 12 h in eight injections. Transrectal ovarian ultrasonography and jugular blood sampling for serum P-4 measurements were performed on Days 11 to 15. On the day of embryo recovery (Day 15), all the ewes underwent diagnostic videolaparoscopy and were classified, based on their luteal characteristics, into three response groups: nCL (ewes with normal CL only); rCL (ewes with regressing CL only); and ewes with both nCL and rCL following the superovulatory regimen. Our present results indicate that the total pFSH doses of 100 mg and 200 mg result in similar ovulatory responses and luteal function/biometrics, although the percentage of donor ewes with nCL was greater (p < 0.05) for G100 compared with the G200 animals. An application of 133 mg of pFSH was associated with diminished luteogenesis.
   Lastly, circulating P-4 concentrations, ultrasonographic estimates of total luteal area, and CL pixel heterogeneity (standard deviation of numerical pixel values) are promising markers of luteal inadequacy in superovulated ewes.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a poisonous metal element that causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Selenium (Se) can reduce the damage of Cd to various organs of animals, but the protective mechanism of Se in Cd-induced lung injury has not been fully elucidated. For purpose of further illustrating the specific mechanism of Se alleviated Cd-triggered pulmonary toxicity, 48 sheep were divided into 4 groups, of which the sheep in the treatment group were taken 1 mg/kg body weight (BW) of Cd, 0.34 mg/kg BW of Se, and 0.34 mg Se + 1 mg/kg BW of Cd by intragastric administration for 50 d, respectively. The results indicated that Cd caused inflammatory cell infil-tration and alveolar wall thickening, which facilitated mitochondrial vacuolation and formation of mitophago-somes in lung tissues. Simultaneously, Cd treatment impaired the antioxidant capacity of sheep lung tissue. Additionally, Cd treatment down-regulated the expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion, but up-regulated the levels of mitochondrial fission and mitophagy mediated by FUNDC1. Moreover, the immunofluorescence co-localization puncta of LC3B/COX IV, LC3B/FUNDC1 were increased after Cd treatment. Nevertheless, co-treatment with Se improved effectively the above variation caused by Cd exposure. In summary, Se could mitigate Cd-generated mitophagy through FUNDC1-mediated mitochondrial quality control pathway in the lungs of sheep.

AB  - Red-footed (Chelonoidis carbonarius) and yellow-footed tortoises (C. denticulatus) are highly frugivorous, terrestrial chelonians found throughout the Neotropics. We investigated the role of these tortoises as seed dispersers in plant communities in the northern Brazilian region of the Amazon Basin. We analyzed movement patterns of radio- and thread-tracked individuals, estimated gut retention time of seeds in captive tortoises, and analyzed fecal samples for abundance, diversity, and viability of seeds. Our results show tortoises to be effective seed dispersers: of 113 fecal samples examined, 92% contained seeds of 19 plant species. Seeds of 17 of these species were viable. Fecal clumps averaged 2.2 species (range 0-5) per unit with a median of 102 seeds per sample (range 0-1140). Larger-bodied tortoises dispersed more seeds. Integrating these data through movement simulations revealed that long gut retention times for seeds (10-28 days), combined with mean daily tortoise displacements of 103 m, generate seed shadow curves that peak between 300 m (female tortoises) and 400 m (male tortoises) and extended beyond 1 km from the seed source. This study demonstrates differential disperser effectiveness as a result of tortoise size and differences in movement patterns between sexes.

N & oacute;s investigamos o papel dessas esp & eacute;cies de jabutis como dispersoras de sementes em comunidades vegetais na regi & atilde;o norte brasileira da Bacia Amaz & ocirc;nica. Analisamos padr & otilde;es de movimento de indiv & iacute;duos rastreados por r & aacute;dio e carret & eacute;is de rastreamento, estimamos o tempo de reten & ccedil;& atilde;o intestinal de sementes em jabutis em cativeiro e analisamos amostras fecais quanto & agrave; abund & acirc;ncia, diversidade e viabilidade de sementes. Nossos resultados mostram que os jabutis s & atilde;o dispersores de sementes eficazes: de 113 amostras fecais examinadas, 92% continham sementes de 19 esp & eacute;cies de plantas, aglomerados com m & eacute;dia de 2,2 esp & eacute;cies (intervalo de 0-5) com mediano de 102 sementes por amostra (intervalo de 0-1140). Sementes de 17 das 19 esp & eacute;cies de plantas removidas das amostras fecais eram vi & aacute;veis. Os jabutis de maior porte dispersaram mais sementes. A integra & ccedil;& atilde;o desses dados por meio de simula & ccedil;& otilde;es de movimento revelou que longos tempos de reten & ccedil;& atilde;o intestinal para sementes (10-28 dias), combinados com longos deslocamentos di & aacute;rios dos jabutis (x<overline>$$ \overline{x} $$ = 103 m), geram curvas de sombra de sementes com pico entre 300 m (jabutis f & ecirc;meas) e 400 m (jabutis machos), e se estende al & eacute;m de 1 km da fonte da semente.

AB  - The lesser horseshoe bat has a broad distribution in warm temperate regions of Europe and Western Asia, and a patchy distribution in Africa. Common in the north-western part of North Africa, the species is missing more to the east. Hereby we report the first record in Libya, considerably extending its known geographic range. Additionally, we performed a species distribution modelling (SDM) analysis to explore its potential distribution in North Africa. The final SDM depicted a relatively well-known distribution and predicted that the suitable bioclimatic areas for this species are essentially found within the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.

AB  - The fast growth increases in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in China's tourism industry. This article assessed the carbon emissions of tourist Chengdu's traffic patterns and how they are expected to change between 2005 and 2021 and explains why tourism carbon decoupling is important for sustainable tourism development. In order to investigate how carbon emissions from tourism may expand without necessarily increasing in tandem with GDP and the variables that influence it, the Tapir model and the LMDI (logarithmic mean Divisia index) method were used. In our study, we looked at six important variables, including (1) the number of visitors, (2) the level of tourism spending per capita, (3) the contribution rate of the tourism sector with according to the country's total national income, (4) the amount of passenger traffic relative to GDP, and (5) the energy consumption relative to the volume of passenger traffic. There have been five stages in the correlation: positively charged decoupling, weak decoupling, negative decoupling, strong coupling, and strong decoupling. All of these describe the relationship between the expansion of China's tourist industry and the country's carbon emissions. Findings highlighted the importance of large numbers of visitors, high levels of per-person tourism spending, and low passenger traffic volume per unit of energy consumption as key positive factors. The rise of carbon emissions may also be slowed by increasing the number of passengers transported per unit of GDP. Carbon emissions from tourists in Chengdu are fluctuating, and this influences the city's economy. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for Chengdu's transition to a low-carbon economy and for the formulation of policies to reduce emissions. During the research period, most Chinese provinces exhibited ideal decoupling situations. This research has the potential to be used as a scientific resource for guiding the long-term growth as a result of China's tourist sector.

AB  - Axonotmesis, a common peripheral nerve injury in humans and animals, leads to significant biomechanical and physiological consequences. The lack of a standardized crushing protocol for complex animal models limits research and therapeutic translations for humans and clinically relevant animal species. This study aimed to assess the impact of different crushing forces on the biomechanical behavior of the sheep common peroneal nerve and to establish a force for standardized in vivo protocols. Fourteen nerves of equal length were harvested and preserved and their initial diameter measured. They were subjected to crushing forces of 0 N, 80 N, and 180 N for one minute. Post crushing, the diameter, ultimate tensile strength, displacement at rupture, stress, strain, and stiffness were evaluated. Results showed that increasing crushing forces significantly affected nerve biomechanical parameters. Nerves crushed with 180N displayed lower tensile strength, displacement, and stiffness but higher stress and strain, indicating greater physical damage and structural degradation. These findings suggest that 180N induces substantial nerve fiber rupture and disruption of nerve trunk support elements, making it a candidate force for an axonotmesis protocol in the ovine model. Future in vivo studies should validate its effectiveness in creating complete crush injuries with functional and histological consequences, facilitating protocol standardization and translational research.

AB  - To test the "rare earth" hypothesis of geophagy, geological and hydrogeochemical studies unparalleled anywhere in the world were carried out at kudurs (salt licks) in two districts in the Primorsky Krai, Russia. The mineral and chemical compositions of geophagic earth consumed by animals, the chemical composition of surface waters and vegetation, and the chemical composition of biological tissues of red deer (Cervus elaphus) were studied in this research. It was found that ultra-fresh surface and fontinal waters in the studied areas contain anomalously high concentrations of rare earth elements (REE), the sums of which exceeded the average values in the Primorsky Krai and worldwide by tenfold, and more. The presence of landscape REE anomalies is confirmed by elevated concentrations of these elements in vegetation. Using electron microscopy, it was determined that the sources of REE in landscape components are rocks containing secondary, readily soluble, REE minerals (hydrophosphates and fluorocarbonates). The study of the chemical composition of animal tissues showed the presence of significant concentrations of heavy REE (HREE) in the blood and brain, which indirectly indicates a high probability of animals developing stress reactions against the background REE-elementosis. Eaten earthy substances in both areas are represented by mixtures of smectite clays and zeolites with high ion-exchange properties. In the digestive tract of animals, such sorbents actively interact with the biological electrolyte, saturating it with sodium ions and absorbing HREE. The main meaning of geophagy is regulation of the concentration and proportion of REE in the body. Sometimes it manifests itself in intake of significant amounts of Na.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglets have a very low feed intake immediately after weaning. We hypothesise that the EU-legislated maximum dietary zinc concentration (150 mg zinc/kg diet) will increase the risk of zinc deficiency after weaning. Zinc deficiency includes symptoms such as impaired growth and increased risk of diarrhoea. However, a high dietary zinc concentration has an antimicrobial effect on the bacteria and increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance. The findings of this study show that the dietary zinc level had a quadratic effect on growth, with a turning point at an approximately 1400 mg zinc per kg diet. The risk of diarrhoea increased up to 60% for pigs that had a blood zinc concentration which decreased after weaning. Maintaining the blood zinc concentration seven days after weaning required up to 1121 mg zinc per kg diet. There was no evidence for an antimicrobial effect when feeding pigs a diet with up to 1601 mg zinc per kg. One hundred and eighty individually housed piglets with an initial body weight of 7.63 +/- 0.98 kg (at 28 days of age) were fed a diet containing either 153, 493, 1022, 1601, 2052 or 2407 mg zinc/kg (added Zn as zinc oxide; ZnO) from day 0-21 post weaning to determine the optimal level of Zn for weaned piglets. Body weight, feed intake and faecal scores were recorded, and blood and faecal samples were collected. Dietary Zn content quadratically affected both feed intake and gain in the first two weeks, with an approximately 1400 mg Zn/kg diet and a Zn intake of 400 mg/day as the optimal levels. The relative risk of diarrhoea increased up to 60% at day 7 and 14 if serum Zn status dropped below the weaning level (767 mu g/L), and maintain the weaning serum Zn status required approximately 1100 mg Zn/kg (166 mg Zn/day) during week 1. Blood markers of intestinal integrity (D-lactate and diamine oxidase) were unaffected by dietary Zn, and dietary Zn levels of 1022 and 1601 mg/kg did not affect the faecal numbers of total bacteria, Lactobacilli and E. Coli bacteria compared to 153 mg Zn/kg. These results indicate that the requirement for Zn in newly weaned piglets may be substantially higher than currently assumed.

AB  - Goat production is affected by reproductive seasonality. In vitro embryo production (IVEP) could overcome this effect. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the season of semen collection/freezing on IVEP of prepubertal goat oocytes and on sperm quality and functionality concerning capacitation. Semen from six fertile bucks was collected, pooled and cryopreserved in spring and autumn and used for IVEP of oocytes recovered during the breeding season. Oocytes were IVM in TCM-199 with hormones, EGF and cysteamine; fertilized and cultured in BO-IVF and BO-IVC media (IVF Bioscience, UK). Semen samples were assessed at 0 and 3 h after culture in capacitating (BO-IVF, CAP) and non-capacitating conditions for sperm plasma membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular calcium and plasma membrane lipid disorder. Blastocyst production was higher with spring sperm compared to autumn (12.0% vs. 2.1%, respectively; p < .05). After CAP, acrosome reaction and intracellular calcium were higher (p < .05) in spring than autumn sperm. No differences were found in other sperm parameters. In conclusion, seasonal variations in the IVEP of prepubertal goats could be linked to differences in sperm ability to undergo in vitro capacitation.

AB  - In response to damage by insects, plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) into the air. Insectivorous birds exploit these cues and, consequently, reduce the damages inflicted to the plants. However, little is known about whether they solely use HIPVs as foraging cues, or if they also use them to modulate traits linked to reproduction. As caterpillars are the primary food source required for insectivorous birds to raise offspring, their ability to locate and predict future peaks in caterpillar biomass using olfaction is likely to be advantageous. Therefore, we tested whether an insectivorous songbird that naturally inhabits oak dominated forests can be trained to detect early spring infestation by hatchling caterpillars, at a time when oaks begin bursting, and birds prepare to breed. Tree buds were either infested with caterpillars or left as a control and visually obscured in a YMaze choice test. Additionally, we measured testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol as they influence olfactory perception in mammals and are linked to reproduction in vertebrates. After being trained to associate the presence of HIPVs with that of food, blue tits spent more time with, were more active around, and more frequently chose to first visit the infested trees, showing that blue tits can smell caterpillar activity. Males with higher testosterone spent more time around infested trees, suggesting that foraging behavior during the pre-breeding season is linked with a major reproductive signal. There was no relationship between foraging and estradiol in females. These results are an important foundation for further investigation of the role of hormones in avian olfaction and how smell may be useful for making breeding decisions that could improve reproductive success.

AB  - Bat populations are decreasing worldwide, mainly due to anthropogenic influence, climate changes, urbanisation, agricultural intensification, and industrial exploitation of natural resources. Colonies have been displaced from caves and other natural roosts, leaving mines (including metal extraction mines) as key remaining roosts for cave-dwelling bats in many regions. Consequently, mines have become important for global conservation efforts. The persistence of metals in these environments might affect biota even after exploitation activities have ceased. This study investigates potential metal exposure in cave-dwelling bats roosting in abandoned mines. Noninvasive samples of fur, wing, and faeces from 140 individuals of four insectivorous cave-dwelling bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale, Rhinolophus hipposideros, and Miniopterus schreibersii) were collected in four abandoned mines in northern and central Portugal, frequently used as hibernation roosting sites. Soil, rock, and water samples were also collected in each mine to characterise the exposure source. Concentrations of 13 metals (As, Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, Sn, and W) were measured by ICP-MS spectrophotometer. Metals were detected in the wings and fur of all bat species, confirming metal exposure. The highest concentrations were mainly found in the wing membranes. M. schreibersii presented the highest metal concentrations in fur. Differences in metal concentrations between species might be related to foraging behaviour and habitat use, linked to distinct anthropogenic activities. These results reinforce the importance of monitoring metal exposure in cave-dwelling bats roosting in abandoned mines, as this exposure may help to understand the decreases in bat populations and to support measures to prevent their decline.

AB  - Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is the essential food crop for over ninety million people living in drier parts of India and South Africa. Pearl millet crop production is harshly hindered by numerous biotic stresses. Sclerospora graminicola causes downy mildew disease in pearl millet. Effectors are the proteins secreted by several fungi and bacteria that manipulate the host cell structure and function. This current study aims to identify genes encoding effector proteins from the S. graminicola genome and validate them through molecular techniques. In silico analyses were employed for candidate effector prediction. A total of 845 secretory transmembrane proteins were predicted, out of which 35 proteins carrying LxLFLAK (Leucine-any amino acid-Phenylalanine-Leucine-Alanine-Lysine) motif were crinkler, 52 RxLR (Arginine, any amino acid, Leucine, Arginine), and 17 RxLR-dEER putative effector proteins. Gene validation analysis of 17 RxLR-dEER effector protein-producing genes was carried out, of which 5genes were amplified on the gel. These novel gene sequences were submitted to NCBI. This study is the first report on the identification and characterization of effector genes in Sclerospora graminicola. This dataset will aid in the integration of effector classes that act independently, paving the way to investigate how pearl millet responds to effector protein interactions. These results will assist in identifying functional effector proteins involving the omic approach using newer bioinformatics tools to protect pearl millet plants against downy mildew stress. Considered together, the identified effector protein-encoding functional genes can be utilized in screening oomycetes downy mildew diseases in other crops across the globe.

AB  - Background This study aimed to explore the association between polymorphisms in three genes: leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), and BMP4, and incidence of repeat breeding in Egyptian buffaloes. Methods DNA was extracted from 160 female buffaloes, involving 108 fertile and 52 repeat breeders. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Sequence analysis and alignment were performed by employing NCBI/BLAST/blastn suite, to identify SNPs among different patterns and alleles. We utilized PredictSNP software to predict the non-synonymous SNPs influences on protein function. Moreover, the conservation score of the amino acids within the target proteins was computed by ConSurf server. Results The genotyping results showed that LEP and BMP4 genes were monomorphic (CC, GG) in all tested fertile and repeat breeder buffaloes. Leptin gene sequencing showed a non-synonymous C73T SNP, replacing R to C at position 25 within the leptin polypeptide (position 4 in the mature form; R4C) which is a neutral mutation, not affecting function or structure of LEP protein. For LEPR, one synonymous SNP (T102C) and two non-synonymous SNPs (A106G and C146A), triggering V967A and G954C replacements, respectively in LEPR protein. Moreover, they are neutral mutations. Sequencing results of BMP4 showed HinfI restriction site indicate fixed GG genotype (CC genotype in the anti-sense strand) in all sequenced samples. No SNPs were observed within the amplified region. Conclusion Genotyping and sequencing results of the surveyed three genes revealed that there is no association between these genes mutations and the incidence of repeat breeding in Egyptian buffaloes.

AB  - Hog farm wastewater may require novel biological treatment techniques to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Previous studies combining vermifiltration with downstream hydroponics showed the need for a balanced wastewater nutrient content, particularly the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio. Here, a deep-water culture hydroponic system, growing lettuce as model culture, was used to remediate hog farm wastewater after an initial vermifiltration stage, aiming to produce an effluent suitable for irrigation. Supplemented vermifiltered wastewater (SVW) with added nutrients was tested against unsupplemented vermifiltered wastewater (VW) over 35 days, using a synthetic nutrient solution (NS) as a control. Supplementation was shown to improve lettuce growth, light use efficiency, and water use efficiency. Nutrient analysis over time showed a better-balanced phosphorus and nitrogen removal in SVW than in VW; in all treatments nitrogen and phosphorus content was reduced to legally acceptable levels for treated wastewater reuse in irrigation: nitrate 5 mgN L-1 in VW and undetectable in SVW and NS; ammonia undetectable in all treatments; and total phosphorus 2.4 mg L-1 in SVW, 0.9 mg L-1 in NS and undetectable in VW. Coliforms increased in VW and SVW during hydroponic treatment, which should be solved by disinfection. Overall, combining vermifiltration with downstream hydroponic culture proved to be a promising treatment to remediate nutrients in hog farm effluent to make it suitable to be reused for irrigation.

AB  - Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) (Lepechin, 1774) is often found in front of glaciers, which is the least studied of the species' habitats. Uummannap Kangerlua and Sullorsuaq in West Greenland provide a unique opportunity to study Arctic cod in the glacial habitat, as they are among the few places with a directed Arctic cod fishery. Inuit fishers from these fjords regularly catch Arctic cod as fresh bait for the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) (Walbaum, 1792) longline fishery, the main economic activity in the region. We collaborated with the fishers to learn about Arctic cod through interviews and collection of fish samples. Ten informants provided information on fishing areas, fishing methods, interannual variability in the catches, relationships with temperature and sea ice, and reported a spawning area near Saattut. One of the two samples collected contained only 21% males, which were longer, heavier, older, and had a higher gonadosomatic index than females. This skewed sex ratio may result from size-selective predation or spawning migration. Collaboration with fishers provided important baseline information on Arctic cod in fjord and glacial habitats. Continued efforts could bring a better understanding of key aspects of Arctic cod that are relevant for all Arctic communities located near glacial fjords.

AB  - Transgenic crops with genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner, a soil bacterium producing delta-endotoxin that is lethal to several phytophagous insects. Concerns related to possible effects of Cry proteins expressed in transgenic Bt crops on non-target organisms need to be addressed for environment risk assessment. Aenasius arizonensis (Girault) is the most important koinobiont parasitoid of cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley. Consequently, the impact of transgenic Bt cotton having dual toxins (Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab) on the parasitoid, A. arizonensis was studied through host mediated tritrophic analysis. Non-significant differences were observed for developmental duration from oviposition to adult emergence, proportion of adults emerged, proportion of females in progeny and longevity of A. arizonensis when reared on P. solenopsis offered with Bt cotton or non-Bt cotton leaves. The parasitism of mealybug nymphs and adults by A. arizonensis did not differ significantly on cotton with or without toxins. Despite higher expression of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins in Bollgard II cotton leaves, Cry proteins were not detected in the host, P. solenopsis or the parasitoid, A. arizonensis. Our study thus showed that Bt cotton having dual toxins (Cry1Ac/Cry2Ab) had no noticeable impact on development, longevity, parasitism rate and proportion of females in progeny of the parasitoid, A. arizonensis.

AB  - Simple Summary: Confirmation studies for SNPs associated with milk traits, identified through genome-wide or classic association approaches, are very rare in dairy animals and, to our knowledge, have not been carried out in river buffaloes. In this species, the candidate gene approach remains the most commonly applied method for identifying markers for selective breeding. In this study, we validated and confirmed the association of three SNPs in key genes (CSN1S1, CSN3 and LPL) with milk yield, protein and fat. Our data represent a very important indication for the preselection of young bulls destined for breeding programs with a view to achieving more sustainable dairy production. The search for DNA polymorphisms useful for the genetic improvement of dairy farm animals has spanned more than 40 years, yielding relevant findings in cattle for milk traits, where the best combination of alleles for dairy processing has been found in casein genes and in DGAT1. Nowadays, similar results have not yet been reached in river buffaloes, despite the availability of advanced genomic technologies and accurate phenotype records. The aim of the present study was to investigate and validate the effect of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CSN1S1, CSN3, SCD and LPL genes on seven milk traits in a larger buffalo population. These SNPs have previously been reported to be associated with, or affect, dairy traits in smaller populations often belonging to one farm. A total of 800 buffaloes were genotyped. The following traits were individually recorded, monthly, throughout each whole lactation period from 2010 to 2021: daily milk yield (dMY, kg), protein yield (dPY, kg) and fat yield (dFY, kg), fat and protein contents (dFP, % and dPP, %), somatic cell count (SCC, 10(3) cell/mL) and urea (mg/dL). A total of 15,742 individual milk test day records (2496 lactations) were available for 680 buffalo cows, with 3.6 +/- 1.7 parities (from 1 to 13) and an average of 6.1 +/- 1.2 test day records per lactation. Three out four SNPs in the CSN1S1, CSN3 and LPL genes were associated with at least one of analyzed traits. In particular, the CSN1S1 (AJ005430:c.578C>T) gave favorable associations with all yield traits (dMY, p = 0.022; dPY, p = 0.014; dFY, p = 0.029) and somatic cell score (SCS, p = 0.032). The CSN3 (HQ677596: c.536C>T) was positively associated with SCS (p = 0.005) and milk urea (p = 0.04). Favorable effects on daily milk yield (dMY, p = 0.028), fat (dFP, p = 0.027) and protein (dPP, p = 0.050) percentages were observed for the LPL. Conversely, the SCD did not show any association with milk traits. This is the first example of a confirmation study carried out in the Mediterranean river buffalo for genes of economic interest in the dairy field, and it represents a very important indication for the preselection of young bulls destined for breeding programs aimed at more sustainable dairy production.

AB  - The recovery of the wolf (Canis lupus) population in Europe is progressing, and predators settle in vast forests as well as in areas intensively used for agriculture, where interactions between wolves and livestock are frequent, often leading to conflicts with local communities. In 2020-2022, we studied the wolf diet composition in the Warta River Mouth (WRM hereinafter) region (western Poland), where herds of cattle (ca. 4,000) and horses (ca. 700) are freely grazed. Using genetic fingerprinting based on microsatellite DNA markers, tracking, and camera trapping, we confirmed that the area is used by two wolf family groups. Through the analysis of scat content (n = 109), we found that in the WRM, wolves feed primarily on wild ungulates (81.9% of the consumed food biomass) and wild medium-sized mammals (14.5%). Domestic animals were eaten rarely, and cattle and dogs comprised 3% and 0.4% of the consumed food biomass, respectively. During these two years of research, only three cattle calves consumed by wolves were found. The diet of wolves in the WRM did not significantly differ from the food composition of these predators in six other study areas within the Central European wolf population. Our research shows that despite the high availability of unguarded herds of cattle and horses, wolves prey mainly on wild mammals. Managers searching to solve wolf-livestock conflicts should consider that wolf depredation is not a simple function of livestock availability but is also influenced by other factors, such as the species and breed of livestock, grazing methods, landscape, and availability of wild prey.

AB  - Simple Summary Colostrum is the first milk produced by a mammal after giving birth, and it is awakening a high interest for its use as a sports supplement or nutraceutical due to its higher richness in immunoglobulins, growth factors, hormones, and antimicrobial enzymes than milk. Traditionally consumed by farmers, not much attention has been paid to its potential application in the production of dairy products. As a result of the increased use of artificial lactation in dairy goat systems, a surplus of colostrum is beginning to be found on farms, and the production of fermented milk may be a good opportunity for its use. This work focused on the study of the suitability of goat colostrum to produce a yoghurt-type product and compared its physicochemical, technological, mechanical, microbiological, and sensorial characteristics with those of milk. Results indicate that a colostrum yogurt with a high acceptability by consumers was obtained. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential use of goat colostrum to produce a yogurt-type product as a novel functional dairy food. Four batches of fermented goat colostrum (GCY) were produced using fermented goat milk (GMY) as a reference. Physicochemical, mechanical, and microbial characteristics of cold storage fermented products were evaluated in a weekly basis for 28 days. Sensory analysis was applied to detect potential differences between products and to evaluate the acceptance of GCY by consumers. Results indicate that colostrum showed higher coagulation times than goat milk (480 vs. 350 min to reach pH 4.6). In general, GCY showed a higher protein and fat content and similar features than GMY for most quality parameters, which were highly stable along time. Sensory evaluation led to significant differences between products related to their color and taste. The consumer acceptance test, using a 5 point-Likert scale, showed an overall acceptance of 3.90 +/- 0.79 for GCY, with aroma and consistency being the sensory attributes having highest ratings (4.30 +/- 0.80 and 4.20 +/- 0.96, respectively). Therefore, fermenting goat colostrum with yogurt specific starters could be an interesting alternative to make use of surplus colostrum on farms, allowing for the diversification of commercial goat milk products with potential health benefits for the consumer.

AB  - Non-volant mammals in Peninsular Malaysia face numerous threats, primarily driven by habitat loss, fragmentation and illegal hunting. These threats highlight the importance of conducting wildlife surveys in the available forested areas to enhance the current strategies for conservation and management, particularly for a threatened taxon like non-volant mammals. This study aimed to document and update information of non-volant mammals from four areas: Tasik Bera (Pahang state); Tasik Kenyir, Pulau Redang and Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) Campus (Terengganu state). Cage traps and Visual Encounter Survey methods were utilised to record non-volant mammals from August 2022 until March 2023. This study successfully documented 123 individuals from 27 non-volant mammal species, representing 11 families from 6 orders. Tasik Bera demonstrated the highest species count at 18, followed by UMT Campus with 6, while Tasik Kenyir and Pulau Redang each recorded 4 species. The species diversity was the highest at Tasik Bera (H ' = 2.65) and the lowest at Pulau Redang (H ' = 1.01). Macaca fascicularis, Tupaia glis and Paradoxurus hermaphroditus were recorded from three of four sites. This study has added new geographically recorded species for Tasik Bera (11 species) and UMT Campus (4 species). This study has advanced our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of non-volant mammals, enhancing our understanding in this field. This understanding is crucial for implementing efficient conservation and management strategies, aiding in the development of targeted conservation strategies to protect these species and their habitats.

AB  - Premise Nearly 200 araceous leaves and two spadices have been identified among Paleocene fossils from the Blindman River locality near Blackfalds, Alberta, Canada. Although not found in attachment, these probably represent parts of the same extinct plant species. Methods Specimens were studied using light microscopy. Phylogenetic analyses using a morphological matrix of living and fossil Araceae were performed using TNT version 1.5 to help establish relationships of the fossil leaves and spadices within Araceae and to each other. Results Leaves are simple with a broad petiole, entire margin, and elliptic to ovate or oblong blade with an acute to slightly rounded apex. A multi-veined midrib extends into the basal region of the blade. Parallelodromous primary veins of two orders diverge at acute angles, converging with a submarginal vein or at the apex. Transverse veins are opposite percurrent, producing rectangular to polygonal areoles. Higher-order veins are mixed opposite/alternate. Spadices are cylindrical, with helically arranged, bisexual, perigoniate flowers, each with six free tepals and a protruding style. Fruits are trilocular, with axile placentation and one seed per locule. Conclusions Leaves are assignable to the fossil genus Orontiophyllum J. Kvacek & S.Y. Sm. as O. grandifolium comb. nov. Spadices are described as Bognerospadix speirsiae gen. et sp. nov. Leaves and spadices each conform to an early-diverging lineage of Araceae, increasing the known diversity of Proto-Araceae (viz., subfamilies Gymnostachydoideae and Orontioideae). Together, they provide strong evidence for extinct Proto-Araceae with novel combinations of characters shortly after the Cretaceous-Paleogene floral transition.

AB  - Increasing marine microplastics (MPs) pollution potentially threatens the stability of phytoplankton community structures in marine environments. MPs toxicities to microalgae are largely determined by particle size, while the size-dependent mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this study, two sizes (0.1 mu m and 1 mu m) of poly-styrene (PS) MPs were used as experimental targets to systemically compare their different effecting mechanisms on the marine model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana with respect to oxidative stress and photosynthesis. The results indicated the toxicity of 1 mu m sized MPs was higher than 0.1 mu m sized MPs regarding to population growth. In condition of similar microalgal population inhibition rates, we found more enhanced cellular oxidative stress and cell death happened in the 1 mu m MPs treatments, which could be linked to higher zeta potential of 1 mu m MPs and more severe cell surface damage; microalgal surface light shading and cellular pig-ments decline were more obvious in the 0.1 mu m MPs treatment, which could be linked to high aggregation abilities of 0.1 mu m MPs. Gene expressions supported the morphological and physiological findings on the tran-scriptional level. Environmental related MPs concentrations (5 mu g L-1) also aroused gene expression changes of T. pseudonana while more changing genes were found under 0.1 mu m MPs than 1 mu m MPs. These results provide novel insights into the size-dependent mechanisms of MPs toxicity on marine microalgae, as well as their po-tential influence on the marine environment.

AB  - Damage of crop plants in Greece by aphids results in serious economic losses for growers. In Greece, aphids are mainly controlled by chemical insecticides such as neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. In the present study, the response of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Aphis fabae Scopoli (Hemiptera: Aphididae) parthenogenetic lineages to imidacloprid and deltamethrin was examined. We evaluated toxicity of imidacloprid and deltamethrin on the fourth instar larvae of Coccinella septempunctata L. and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Most of the A. fabae lineages showed low resistance factors (RRs) to both insecticides. However, 40% and 100% of M. persicae lineages showed moderate Resistance Ratios RRs values (> 10) for imidacloprid and deltamethrin, respectively. The Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated that imidacloprid and deltamethrin may adversely affect C. septempunctata and H. variegata. We suggest that, the use of these insecticides should be carefully applied within Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs.

AB  - Dioecious plants have different needs for natural resources due to sex differences, which can lead to skewed sex ratios. Clonal growth facilitates and optimizes resources of clonal plants. So, dioecious plants show inter-sex differences in clonality. However, it is unclear how the clonality varies between female and male plants when they exhibit skewed sex ratios along an altitudinal gradient. Here, we investigated the sex ratio and clonality of Hippophae tibetana populations growing at three altitudes in the alpine meadow. We founded that (i) H. tibetana growing at different altitudes mainly consisted of II and III age classes, with a significantly male-biased sex ratio observed at a low altitude, a female-biased ratio at a middle altitude, and no significant sex-bias in the population at a high altitude. (ii) The population distribution was generally random at both low and high altitudes, while clustered at middle altitudes with an increasing scale. Meanwhile, the male and female populations at a low altitude showed a negative correlation, while the male and female at a middle altitude only showed a negative correlation at a 0-0.5 m scale, and spatial independence with increasing scales. (iii) Females of H. tibetana had a strong clonal capacity than male plants at a middle altitude, while the opposite was observed at a low altitude. The number of males of H. tibetana growing at a low altitude and with higher clonal diversity were higher than females at mid altitude. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of the sexual dimorphism exhibited by dioecious plants as well as the importance of a clonal adaptation in response to environmental change.

AB  - Variations in the Dlg2 gene have been linked to increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and pubertal disorders. Recent studies have reported disrupted brain circuit function and behaviour in models of Dlg2 knockout and haploinsufficiency. Specifically, deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were found in heterozygous Dlg2+/- rats suggesting impacts on hippocampal dependent learning and cognitive flexibility. Here, we tested these predicted effects with a behavioural characterisation of the heterozygous Dlg2+/- rat model. Dlg2+/- rats exhibited a specific, mild impairment in reversal learning in a substrate deterministic bowl-digging reversal learning task. The performance of Dlg2+/- rats in other bowl digging task, visual discrimination and reversal, novel object preference, novel location preference, spontaneous alternation, modified progressive ratio, and novelty-suppressed feeding test were not impaired. These findings suggest that despite altered brain circuit function, behaviour across different domains is relatively intact in Dlg2+/- rats, with the deficits being specific to only one test of cognitive flexibility. The specific behavioural phenotype seen in this Dlg2+/- model may capture features of the clinical presentation associated with variation in the Dlg2 gene.

AB  - Simple Summary Resolving the taxonomic ambiguity of a species is important for their long-term conservation. We used non-invasive DNA sampling and camera trapping to address the taxonomic ambiguity in musk deer species in the Western Himalayas, and species occurrence locations were used to model the species distribution to identify suitable habitats. The combined results confirm the presence of only Kashmir musk deer (KMD) in the Western Himalayas. During our survey, no other musk deer species were found in the study area. This finding suggests that the presence of other species, such as Himalayan musk deer and Alpine musk deer, were incorrectly reported in the past. The predicted distribution (6% of the total area) of Kashmir musk deer is a narrow belt of the Western Himalayas between 2500 and 4500 m. Based on this study, we recommend long-term monitoring and assessment of KMD throughout its distribution range for its conservation and management. Insufficient research has been conducted on musk deer species across their distribution range, primarily because of their elusive behaviour and the fact they occupy remote high-altitude habitats in the Himalayas above 2500 m. The available distribution records, primarily derived from ecological studies with limited photographic and indirect evidence, fail to provide comprehensive information on the species distribution. Consequently, uncertainties arise when attempting to determine the presence of specific taxonomic units of musk deer in the Western Himalayas. This lack of knowledge hampers species-oriented conservation efforts, as there need to be more species-specific initiatives focused on monitoring, protecting, and combatting the illegal poaching of musk deer for their valuable musk pods. We used transect surveys (220 trails), camera traps (255 cameras), non-invasive DNA sampling (40 samples), and geospatial modelling (279 occurrence records) to resolve the taxonomic ambiguity, and identify the suitable habitat of musk deer (Moschus spp.) in Uttarkashi District of Uttarakhand and the Lahaul-Pangi landscape of Himachal Pradesh. All the captured images and DNA-based identification results confirmed the presence of only Kashmir musk deer (KDM) (Moschus cupreus) in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The results suggest that KMD inhabit a narrow range of suitable habitats (6.9%) of the entire Western Himalayas. Since all evidence indicates that only KMD are present in the Western Himalayas, we suggest that the presence of other species of musk deer (Alpine musk deer and Himalayan musk deer) was wrongly reported. Therefore, future conservation plans and management strategies must focus only on KMD in the Western Himalayas.

AB  - Heat stress not only affects the physical condition but also affects reproductive performance in sheep. A thorough understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying heat stress would certainly improve livestock productivity and provide genetic evaluation ways for heat resistant breeds selection. In this study, 85 Turpan Black sheep, a breed exhibited excellent heat resistance from long-term artificial selection, and 85 heat sensitive Kazakh sheep in Turpan basin were tested for physio-logical and reproductive performance from July to August in summer. The results showed that the estrus rate was significantly higher in Turpan Black sheep (P < 0.05), while the heart rate and respiratory rate of Turpan Black sheep are significantly lower than that of Kazakh sheep (P < 0.05). Furthermore, to clarify genes participated in heat stress response, the pituitary, ovarian and hepatic tissues from three Turpan Black sheep and three Kazakh sheep were subjected to RNA-seq. The results indicated that 32, 49 and 69 genes were up-regulated, and 39, 60 and 145 genes were down-regulated in pituitary, ovarian and he-patic tissues in Turpan Black sheep compared with that of the Kazakh sheep, respectively. KEGG and gene set enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in signal transduction pathways. In particular, the differentially expressed genes in hepar were enriched in the energy metabolism pathway, while the differentially expressed genes in ovarian tissue were enriched in the ovarium steroidogenesis pathway. In conclusion, our results implied that the pituitary-ovary axis might include hepar as downstream targeted organism in heat resistant regulation. Under heat stress, the signals released from pituitary would impact steroidogenesis in ovary, and further alter energy metabolism in hepar. As we know, this is the first comparative study to investigate the gene expression in multi-tissue in sheep under heat stress. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The intramuscular fat (IMF) or marbling is an essential pork sensory quality that influences the preference of the consumers and premiums for pork. IMF is the streak of visible fat intermixed with the lean within a muscle fibre and determines sensorial qualities of pork such as flavour, tenderness and juiciness. Fat metabolism and IMF development are controlled by dietary nutrients, genes, and their metabolic pathways in the pig. Nutrigenetics explains how the genetic make-up of an individual pig influences the pig's response to dietary nutrient intake. Differently, nutrigenomics is the analysis of how the entire genome of an individual pig is affected by dietary nutrient intake. The knowledge of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics, when harmonized, is a powerful tool in estimating nutrient requirements for swine and programming dietary nutrient supply according to an individual pig's genetic make-up. The current paper aimed to highlight the roles of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of fat metabolism and IMF deposition in pigs. This knowledge is essential in redefining nutritional intervention for swine production and the improvement of some economically important traits such as growth performance, backfat thickness, IMF accretion, disease resistance etc., in animals. Fat metabolism and intramuscular fat (IMF) are qualitative traits in pigs whose development are influenced by several genes and metabolic pathways. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics offer prospects in estimating nutrients required by a pig. Application of these emerging fields in nutritional science provides an opportunity for matching nutrients based on the genetic make-up of the pig for trait improvements. Today, integration of high throughput "omics" technologies into nutritional genomic research has revealed many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the mutation(s) of key genes directly or indirectly involved in fat metabolism and IMF deposition in pigs. Nutrient-gene interaction and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in fatty acid synthesis and marbling in pigs is difficult to unravel. While existing knowledge on QTLs and SNPs of genes related to fat metabolism and IMF development is yet to be harmonized, the scientific explanations behind the nature of the existing correlation between the nutrients, the genes and the environment remain unclear, being inconclusive or lacking precision. This paper aimed to: (1) discuss nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics and epigenetic mechanisms controlling fat metabolism and IMF accretion in pigs; (2) highlight the potentials of these concepts in pig nutritional programming and research.

AB  - During the MIS 4 in Southwestern France, Quina Neanderthal from the north of the Aquitaine was characterized by a hunting specialization on the reindeer and the lack of diversity in their diet. They developed task-specific locations dedicated to the capture, the butchery, and the consumption of reindeer, and the whole society seems, in this region, to be dependent on this food resource. In this context, the site of Chez-Pinaud at Jonzac (France) occupies a specific place. First, interpreted as a reindeer kill and butchery site, the recent recovery of the site underlines the importance of the large ungulate (horse and bison) to the faunal spectrum (30% of the NISP). Considering the quantity of meat and grease that these species can provide to hunters, the new zooarchaeological analyses suggest that at least the horse may have played a major role in the diet of the Neanderthal population. Since Jonzac is one of the largest sites for this period, these results relativize the importance of reindeer specialization of the Quina population and the lack of diversityl in their diet.

AB  - The effects of enhanced late I-Na, a persistent component of the Na+ channel current, on the intracellular ion dynamics and the automaticity of the pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes were studied with fluorescent microscopy. Anemonia viridis toxin II (ATX- II), an enhancer of late I-Na, caused increases in the basal Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, increases in the number of Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves, and the generation of repetitive Ca2+ transients. These phenomena were inhibited by eleclazine, a blocker of the late I-Na; SEA0400, an inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX); H89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor; and KN-93, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor. These results suggest that enhancement of late I-Na in the pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes causes disturbance of the intracellular ion environment through activation of the NCX and Ca2+-dependent enzymes. Such mechanisms are probably involved in the ectopic electrical activity of the pulmonary vein myocardium.

AB  - The physiological effects of dietary boron (B) supplementation for farm animals specifically goat on male fertility are still scarce and need deep investigation. Thus, the current study was designed to investigate how adding B to the diet of male goats affected their testicular and thyroid activity. For that purpose, twelve male goats were divided randomly into two groups (six animals each); control group that was fed the basal diet and B group that was fed the basal diet containing 70 mg B/kg diet for 6 months. Serum samples were collected at different intervals, while testicular biopsies were obtained at the end of the experiment. The results showed that 6 months of dietary B supplementation resulted in a significant increment in serum B concentration. The results of repeated measure analysis showed that there were significant GROUP and TIME x GROUP interactions effects on blood testosterone levels (F = 119.408, p = .000 and F = 6.794, p = .013, respectively), demonstrating that compared with control, B supplementation caused a significant rise in serum testosterone levels over time. However, the mean animal body weights and the serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were kept comparable with the control ones at the different time points. The most striking finding is that B supplementation increased significantly the mRNA expression of the CYP17A1 which is essential for steroidogenesis (p < .001). In addition, a histological examination of testicular tissue corroborated our findings and demonstrated that B supplementation had a positive effect. As a result, B might be considered an excellent food supplement that could be safely added to the male goats' diet at the current dose to improve their reproductive capacity.

AB  - The present study evaluated maternal and additive influences that contribute to phenotypic variation in various growth traits in Munjal sheep. The targeted traits that pertained to 2278 records of 706 lambs were birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WT3), 6-month body weight (WT6), 12-month body weight (WT12), average daily gain (ADG1: 0-3 months; ADG2: 3-6 months, ADG3: 6-12 months of age) and their corresponding Kleiber ratios designated as KR1, KR2 and KR3. The direct heritability estimates for BWT, WT3, WT6, WT12, ADG1, ADG2, ADG3, KR1, KR2 and KR3 under animal models were 0.20 +/- 0.08, 0.28 +/- 0.08, 0.17 +/- 0.07, 0.47 +/- 0.09, 0.33 +/- 0.08, 0.09 +/- 0.06, 0.36 +/- 0.10, 0.33 +/- 0.08, 0.09 +/- 0.06 and 0.32 +/- 0.10, respectively. The estimates of maternal genetic effects contributed significantly and were 8% and 7% for BWT and WT3 traits, respectively, which highlighted the considerable role of maternal effects on early growth traits. Genetic and phenotypic correlations ranged from moderate to high between weaning and post-weaning traits. It was concluded that early selection that considered additive as well as maternal effects at weaning age may be delivered to the desired genetic progress in Munjal sheep.

AB  - Spring oilseed rape is severely affected by early season herbivory of various flea beetle species. Flea beetle pest management strategies with less reliance on conventional chemical insecticides are direly needed. However, the current knowledge of flea beetle ecologies and life cycles is insufficient to design and inform such strategies effectively. Using a combination of pitfall and emergence traps, we followed the life cycles of flea beetles in 13 spring oilseed rape fields in south central Sweden, measuring densities in three sampling seasons: spring activity at crop seedling stage, summer emergence of the new generation, and emergence of overwintered adults in the following spring in the adjacent grassy field margins. We found a strong positive relationship between densities of emerging Phyllotreta atra, P. striolata and P. undulata in summer and their densities earlier in spring. Flea beetle assemblage composition differed across the seasons, driven by changes in the relative abundances of different species. While assemblages emerging in summer were filtered for species reproducing in spring oilseed rape, assemblages emerging from the grassy field margins in the following spring were again more heterogeneous. Spring activity peaks and summer emergence peaks differed among species, with P. vittula having an earlier activity peak and emerging earlier than most other species. This knowledge of spatiotemporal habitat use can contribute to a more effective flea beetle management in spring oilseed rape. Especially summer emergence in the fields became apparent as a so far unexplored point in time to control flea beetle pests.

AB  - Remote-sensing analysis of open-source satellite imagery has identified a major, new distribution of undocumented hunting kite structures in northern Arabia. This new data has important implications on the environmental viability of hunting and on possible settlement patterns during the early and middle Holocene. Running across the eastern side of the Nafud Desert in Saudi Arabia, this research has identified star-shaped kites in a distribution that continues on to southern Iraq. From a broader perspective, this new distribution appears to represent a continuation of the well-known arc of kites recorded running principally through southern Syria and eastern Jordan. As well as representing an important archaeological identification in its own right, this new distribution also has important implications in terms of the paleoenvironment of the region, faunal dispersals and human cultural connections.

AB  - Conservation management of natural populations is ideally based on the most accurate data of critical variables including demography, natural history and population size. Although Caribbean iguanids are highly threatened by a range of anthropogenic threats, the native melanistic Iguana iguana populations in the Lesser Antilles have received surprisingly little research attention. Here we assessed population size, distribution and degree of melanism for the melanistic iguanas of Saba, Caribbean Netherlands based on one month of fieldwork. Distance sampling (based on 117 separate surveys along 38 unique transects, totalling 48 survey hrs) estimated the island population size at 8233 +/- 2205 (SD) iguanas. Female maximum snout-vent length (39.0 cm) of 56 captured iguanas was less than that of males (43.9 cm). Iguanas mainly occurred on the southern and eastern sides of the island, at mid-altitudes between 180 and 390 m (max 530 m), with highest densities being in residential and certain natural areas. Historically, iguanas have been reported from higher altitudes, where their presence was likely facilitated by former extensive forest clearing for agricultural reasons. Contrary to earlier statements claiming that 20% of adult males were fully melanistic, we found that only 1% of adult iguanas exhibited > 90% melanism, whereas 81% of males were less than 50% melanistic on the body. No relationship was found between the degree of melanism and elevation, which has been suggested by others. Probably, one main threat to the Saba green iguana population is the documented crossbreeding with non-native green iguanas. Beyond non-native iguanas, the long-term stability of the native population appears under pressure given the limited nesting sites and extremely low presence of juvenile and hatchling iguanas (2.4%). In particular, the island's feral cat and large goat population likely impact nest-site quality, nest success and hatchling survival.

AB  - Introduction and spread of non-native plants provide ecologists and evolutionary biologists with abundant scientific opportunities. However, land managers charged with preventing ecological impacts face financial and logistical challenges to reduce threats by introduced species. The available toolbox (chemical, mechanical, or biological) is also rather limited. Failure to permanently suppress introduced species by mechanical and chemical treatments may result in biocontrol programs using host-specific insect herbivores. Regardless of the chosen method, long-term assessment of management outcomes on both the target species and associated biota should be an essential component of management programs. However, data to assess whether management results in desirable outcomes beyond short-term reductions of the target plant are limited. Here, we use implementation of a biocontrol program targeting a widespread wetland invader, Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), in North America to track outcomes on the target plant over more than two decades in New York State. After extensive testing, two leaf-feeding beetles (Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella pusilla; hereafter "Galerucella"), a root-feeding weevil (Hylobius transversovittatus) and a flower-feeding weevil (Nanophyes marmoratus), were approved for field releases. We used a standardized monitoring protocol to record insect abundance and L. salicaria stem densities and heights in 1-m2 permanent quadrats at 33 different wetlands and followed sites for up to 28 years. As part of this long-term monitoring, in 20 of these wetlands, we established a factorial experiment releasing either no insects (control), only root feeders, only leaf beetles, or root and leaf feeders. We documented reduced L. salicaria occupancy and stem densities following insect releases over time, irrespective of site-specific differences in starting plant communities or L. salicaria abundance. We could not complete our factorial experiment because dispersal of leaf beetles to root-feeder-only and control sites within 5 years invalidated our experimental controls. Our data show that it took time for significant changes to occur, and short-term studies may provide misleading results, as L. salicaria stem densities initially increased before significantly decreasing. Several decades after insect releases, prerelease predictions of significant purple loosestrife declines have been confirmed.

AB  - In human Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and AD mouse models, both differential pre-disease brain features and differential disease-associated memory decline are observed, suggesting that certain neurological features may protect against AD-related cognitive decline. The combination of these features is known as brain reserve, and understanding the genetic underpinnings of brain reserve may advance AD treatment in genetically diverse human populations. One potential source of brain reserve is brain microstructure, which is genetically influenced and can be measured with diffusion MRI (dMRI). To investigate variation of dMRI metrics in pre-disease-onset, genetically diverse AD mouse models, we utilized a population of genetically distinct AD mice produced by crossing the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD to 3 inbred strains (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ) and two wild-derived strains (CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ). At 3 months of age, these mice underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to probe neural microanatomy in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). At 5 months of age, these mice underwent contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Strain had a significant effect on dMRI measures in most ROIs tested, while far fewer effects of sex, sex*strain interactions, or strain*sex*5XFAD genotype interactions were observed. A main effect of 5XFAD genotype was observed in only 1 ROI, suggesting that the 5XFAD transgene does not strongly disrupt neural development or microstructure of mice in early adulthood. Strain also explained the most variance in mouse baseline motor activity and long-term fear memory. Additionally, significant effects of sex and strain*sex interaction were observed on baseline motor activity, and significant strain*sex and sex*5XFAD genotype interactions were observed on long-term memory. We are the first to study the genetic influences of brain microanatomy in genetically diverse AD mice. Thus, we demonstrated that strain is the primary factor influencing brain microstructure in young adult AD mice and that neural development and early adult microstructure are not strongly altered by the 5XFAD transgene. We also demonstrated that strain, sex, and 5XFAD genotype interact to influence memory in genetically diverse adult mice. Our results support the usefulness of the 5XFAD mouse model and convey strong relationships between natural genetic variation, brain microstructure, and memory.

AB  - Simple Summary In the scenario of global climatic change, extreme weather is a severe threat to organisms worldwide. For the purposes of dissecting the potential basis of cold environment stress responses and adaptation in lambs in cold climates, we had used cold environments with different temperature gradients to assess the effect of cold environments on growth, antioxidant status and immune function in lambs. The experimental results showed that the growth, antioxidant status and immune capacity of lambs were remarkably inhibited cold environments. Cold climates may be a risk to the health and welfare of lambs during winter because cold environments alter the physiological processes of lambs, and we used cold environments with three different temperature gradients-an indoor heating control group (IHC) using electric heating; an indoor temperature group (IT) with intermittent and slight degrees of stimulation of coldness; an outdoor temperature group (OT) exposed to cold environments in an external natural environment. The results showed that the lambs in the OT group had a greater decrease in the average daily gain (ADG) and increase in the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the feed-to-gain ratio (F:G) compared to the other two groups. The decrease in immunoglobulin A (IgA) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) contents and IL-2 gene expression, and the increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) content and TNF-alpha and nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-kappa B p65) gene expressions in the OT group suggested that the lambs had a compromised immune status in cold environments. Moreover, the decrease in catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels, and CAT, GPx, SOD1, SOD2, and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene expressions, and the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) in the OT group suggested that the lambs had a lower antioxidant defense capacity in cold environments. Thus, in extreme cold, lambs kept outdoors could reduce growth, immune function and antioxidant status. However, shelter feeding in winter could relieve the stress of cold environments on lambs, and housing with heating equipment was more conducive to the improve growth, immune, and antioxidant function of the lambs.

AB  - Sapindales is a large order with a great diversity of nectaries; however, to date, there is no information about extrafloral nectaries (EFN) in Sapindaceae, except recent topological and morphological data, which indicate an unexpected structural novelty for the family. Therefore, the goal of this study was to describe the EFN in Sapindaceae for the first time and to investigate its structure and nectar composition. Shoots and young leaves of Urvillea ulmacea were fixed for structural analyses of the nectaries using light and scanning electron microscopy. For nectar composition investigation, GC-MS and HPLC were used, in addition to histochemical tests. Nectaries of Urvillea are circular and sunken, corresponding to ocelli. They are composed of a multiple-secretory epidermis located on a layer of transfer cells, vascularized by phloem and xylem. Nectar is composed of sucrose, fructose, xylitol and glucose, in addition to amino acids, lipids and phenolic compounds. Many ants were observed gathering nectar from young leaves. These EFNs have an unprecedented structure in the family and also differ from the floral nectaries of Sapindaceae, which are composed of secretory parenchyma and release nectar through stomata. The ants observed seem to protect the plant against herbivores, and in this way, the nectar increases the defence of vegetative organs synergistically with latex.

AB  - Among the negative consequences of chronic sleep deprivation, obesity and associated metabolic and neurobehavioral disorders are of significant importance. Chronic sleep deprivation leads to increased appetite and a preference for high-calorie foods, which increases the risk of obesity. The cause-and-effect relationships between short sleep duration and the pathophysiology of obesity, as well as the consequences of the combined effects of these factors on the body, remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to comparatively investigate the effects of sleep restriction (SR) and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, separately and in combination, on metabolic parameters and neurobehavioral functions in rats. We used a model of chronic SR (3 h of sleep deprivation on a rocking platform and 1 h of rest for 5 days) and HFD (8 weeks) in male Wistar rats. The control animals received standard dry food. It was found that SR leads to body weight gain and an increase in adipose tissue mass, as well as impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, the combination of SR and HFD expands the range of metabolic and hormonal disturbances, including reduced insulin sensitivity, as indicated by elevated insulin levels and the insulin resistance index. For the first time, we demonstrated that the combination of SR and HFD also impairs neurocognitive performance, specifically working memory, as evidenced by reduced spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test, whereas these parameters remained unchanged in the SR-only or HFD-only groups. It was revealed that working memory impairment in the SR+HFD group may be associated with dysregulation of the dopaminergic system in the prefrontal cortex. The combined effects of SR and HFD can be considered as a significant risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders and cognitive deficits.

AB  - Increasing the use of organic fertilizers is an effective measure to improve, increase soil fertility and maintain crop yields. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different types of organic fertilizers on the early yield of grapes and soil parameters, as well as the relationship between soil parameters and grape yield under fertilization conditions. The 'Shine Muscat' grape was used as the material, with early maturing cultivation in the solar greenhouse. From the time of grape planting, three-year continuous fertilization management was carried out using five types of base fertilizers: chemical fertilizer (CK), fermented corn stalk residue (A1), mature sheep manure (A2) and two types of commercial organic fertilizers (B1 and B2). In the third year, berry and soil samples were collected to determine grape yield and evaluate soil physicochemical properties, nutrient status and changes in enzyme activity, studying the relationship between grape yield and soil indicators. The results show that compared to CK, the grape yields with B1 and B2 increased by 19.04% and 16.26%, respectively, while A1 and A2 decreased by 24.09% and 18.97%. Organic fertilizer application reduced soil bulk density, increased soil porosity, enhanced soil organic matter content and effectively buffered soil pH levels. Two types of commercial fertilizers (B1 and B2) improved soil total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, available nitrogen and available phosphorus content to varying degrees. All organic fertilizer treatments effectively increased soil enzyme activity, except for soil sucrase activity. Through correlation and regression analyses, it was found that in this study, the levels of available nitrogen, available potassium and soil saccharase activity were most closely related to early grape yield. Their influence on grape yield was in the order of available nitrogen > soil saccharase activity > available potassium. Therefore, with a combined organic and inorganic basal fertilization system, the fertilizer nutrients are more comprehensive and help to increase the productivity of grapes at the beginning of the fruiting period. Nitrogen and phosphorus are very important in the maintaining of grape yields and improving sucrose activity in the soil through the application of organic fertilizers cannot be ignored when increasing yields.

AB  - Background: Haemonchus contortus is a parasite widely distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions, causing significant economic losses in the livestock industry worldwide. However, little is known about the genetics of H. contortus resistance in livestock. In this study, we monitor the dynamic immune cell responses in diverse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during H. contortus infection in goats through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis. Methods and Results: A total of four Boer goats, two goats with oral infection with the L3 larvae of H. contortus and two healthy goats as controls, were used in the animal test. The infection model in goats was established and validated by the fecal egg count (FEC) test and qPCR analysis of the gene expression of IL-5 and IL-6. Using scRNA-Seq, we identified seven cell types, including T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and dendritic cells with distinct gene expression signatures. After identifying cell subpopulations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the case and control groups, we observed the upregulation of multiple inflammation-associated genes, including NFKBIA and NFKBID. Kyoto Encyclopedia of the Genome (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of NOD-like receptor pathways and Th1/Th2 cell differentiation signaling pathways in CD4 T cells DEGs. Furthermore, the analysis of ligand-receptor interaction networks showed a more active state of cellular communication in the PBMCs from the case group, and the inflammatory response associated MIF-(CD74 + CXCR4) ligand receptor complex was significantly more activated in the case group, suggesting a potential inflammatory response. Conclusions: Our study preliminarily revealed transcriptomic profiling characterizing the cell type specific mechanisms in host PBMCs at the single-cell level during H. contortus infection.

AB  - Simple Summary Pig counting is important work in the breeding process of large-scale pig farms. Currently, animal counting is mainly observed manually, which leads to increased labor costs and is also prone to animal stress. The noncontact computer vision method avoids the above problems. Therefore, we propose a method for pig counting using machine vision technology. Meanwhile, a pig counting application for the Android system was developed, which truly realized the practical application of the technology.Abstract Pig counting is an important work in the breeding process of large-scale pig farms. In order to achieve high-precision pig identification in the conditions of pigs occluding each other, illumination difference, multiscenes, and differences in the number of pigs and the imaging size, and to also reduce the number of parameters of the model, a pig counting algorithm of improved YOLOv5n was proposed. Firstly, a multiscene dataset is created by selecting images from several different pig farms to enhance the generalization performance of the model; secondly, the Backbone of YOLOv5n was replaced by the FasterNet model to reduce the number of parameters and calculations to lay the foundation for the model to be applied to Android system; thirdly, the Neck of YOLOv5n was optimized by using the E-GFPN structure to enhance the feature fusion capability of the model; Finally, Focal EIoU loss function was used to replace the CIoU loss function of YOLOv5n to improve the model's identification accuracy. The results showed that the AP of the improved model was 97.72%, the number of parameters, the amount of calculation, and the size of the model were reduced by 50.57%, 32.20%, and 47.21% compared with YOLOv5n, and the detection speed reached 75.87 f/s. The improved algorithm has better accuracy and robustness in multiscene and complex pig house environments, which not only ensured the accuracy of the model but also reduced the number of parameters as much as possible. Meanwhile, a pig counting application for the Android system was developed based on the optimized model, which truly realized the practical application of the technology. The improved algorithm and application could be easily extended and applied to the field of livestock and poultry counting, such as cattle, sheep, geese, etc., which has a widely practical value.

AB  - The tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), spread by the vector insect Bemisia tabaci, dramatically reduces worldwide tomato production and quality. Plant-mediated interactions between TYLCV and vector whiteflies commonly occur when previous infestations induce both volatile and nonvolatile changes in the shared host. These induced changes of the shared host may differentially affect subsequent interacting species within the plant-insect-virus tripartite system. These altered volatile profiles can be perceived as airborne cues that enhance or suppress defense responses in neighboring conspecifics, a phenomenon known as "plant-plant communication." Here, we present the first evidence that TYLCV-infected Mediterranean (MED) B. tabaci (hereafter referred to as viruliferous MED) preferentially settles and oviposits on previously infested peppers, an alternative host for TYLCV, over those merely exposed and intact ones. Furthermore, differences in feeding behavior of viruliferous MED, assessed using an electrical penetration graph, clearly indicate that these MED whiteflies feed more effectively on previously infested and exposed peppers than on healthy ones. Our results suggest that the suppression of pepper defenses-both nonvolatile and volatile-by previous infestation and exposure to viruliferous MED promotes alternative host-mediated mutualism between MED and TYLCV. These findings provide insight into peppers, functioning as alternative hosts, mediating the interactions between TYLCV and its vector MED whiteflies. Moreover, our results may enhance the understanding of TYLCV epidemics, particularly in the context of the rapid invasion of MED B. tabaci, thereby facilitating the development of novel management strategies for controlling this viral pathogen and its devastating whiteflies.

AB  - Plants attacked by insects may induce defenses locally in attacked plant tissues and/or systemically in non-attacked tissues, such as aboveground herbivory affecting belowground roots or belowground herbivory modifying aboveground tissues (i.e., cross-compartment systemic defense). Through induced systemic plant defenses, above-and belowground insect herbivores indirectly interact when feeding on a shared host plant. However, determining the systemic effects of herbivory on cross-compartment plant tissues and cascading consequences for herbivore communities remains underexplored. The goal of this study was to determine how belowground striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) larval herbivory alters aboveground zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo) defenses and interactions with herbivores, including adult cucumber beetles and squash bugs (Anasa tristis). To explore this question, field and laboratory experiments were conducted to compare responses of aboveground herbivores to belowground larvae-damaged plants and non-damaged control plants. We also characterized changes in defensive chemicals and nutritional content of aboveground plant structures following belowground herbivory. We discovered belowground herbivory enhanced aboveground plant resistance and deterred aboveground foraging herbivores. We also found that larvae-damaged plants emitted higher amounts of a key volatile compound, (E)-beta-ocimene, compared to non-damaged controls. Further investigation suggests that other mechanisms, such as plant nutrient content, may additionally contribute to aboveground herbivore foraging decisions. Collectively, our findings underscore connections between above-and belowground herbivore communities as mediated through induced systemic defenses of a shared host plant. Specifically, these findings indicate that belowground larval herbivory systemically enhances plant defenses and deters a suite of aboveground herbivores, suggesting larvae may manipulate aboveground plant defenses for their own benefit, while plants may benefit from enhanced systemic defenses against multi-herbivore attack.

AB  - Conservation biologists often deal with species that have small, fragmented populations throughout their range, making it necessary to prioritize populations for management. Genetics provides tools to assist with prioritization according to the levels and distribution of genetic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness. Many studies have used nuclear microsatellite loci to measure genetic diversity in disparate populations and mitochondrial DNA to assess genetic distinctiveness. However, comparing metrics based on microsatellite genotypes ascertained in different laboratories is complicated by the selection of different loci with distinct nucleotide repeat motifs. This issue may be resolved by comparing metrics to a well-characterized reference population with shared microsatellite markers. The Asian elephant, Elephas maximus, is an endangered species with 50-60% of populations in India and Sri Lanka, and small, fragmented populations throughout southeast and insular Asia. We assessed range-wide genetic diversity of the Asian elephant by directly comparing allelic diversity and heterozygosity estimates from 35 populations, overcoming marker selection bias by calibrating metrics to a large population on the Nakai Plateau, Lao PDR, genotyped at 25 loci. We coupled these results with mtDNA analysis to evaluate genetic distinctiveness and identify potential conservation management units. We found the greatest diversity in the populations of southeast Asia and the greatest genetic distinctiveness among the subspecies designations, particularly Borneo and Sumatra, and other southeast Asian populations. The populations of southeast Asia, albeit small, fragmented, and at high risk of extirpation, contain valuable diversity and distinctiveness and are thus of high priority for the preservation of the Asian elephant.

AB  - Different factors, such as starvation and metal exposure, may affect development and cause oxidative stress in insects. Some host plants may contain a high concentration of cadmium due to their hyperaccumulating property. The negative effects of metals and hunger may be manifested by low availability of energetic substrates. This study aimed to assess whether the insect population with a history of long metal exposure may better manage metal stress or/and starvation at different developmental stages, with the use of energetic substrates. Two strains of Spodoptera exigua model organism were tested: control strain and cadmium strain (treated continuously for over 200 generations with subtoxic amounts of cadmium). The effects of different factors, individually and in combination, on the tested strains were assessed, first by determining the body weight of larvae and pupae and then by estimating the concentration of biomolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, or glycogen) in the 4th and 5th larval stages and in pupae, and the total antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation level in the 4th larval stage. Compared to control strain, cadmium strain individuals exhibited changes in the concentration of soluble carbohydrates and protein. This was partly related to earlier 1-day starvation. In particular, changes in carbohydrate concentration seemed to be a sensitive biomarker of metal stress, independent of the age of individuals and period of starvation. However, the increase in the total antioxidant capacity and the concentration of lipid peroxidation products in the 4th larval stage under the effect of cadmium was dependent on strain origin.

AB  - Returning to cropland of the biogas slurry (BS) from mixed anaerobic fermentation of distiller's grain and pig manure may hold the notable potential to reduce N2O emissions and enhance soil biological activity. However, the mechanism driven by nitrifier and denitrifier remains unclear. Here we conducted a pot experiment with biogas slurry substitution for chemical fertilizer (CF) to investigate the combined impacts of BS and CF on N2O emissions and nitrifier and denitrifier communities. Four treatments were established: CK (no BS application); T1 (158 kg N ha-1 from BS); T3 (126 kg N ha-1 from BS); T6 (79 kg N ha-1 from BS). This study showed that cumulative N2O emissions were significantly reduced by 54.0%-36.0% in BS compared to the only chemical fertilizer application (p < 0.05). Biogas slurry partially substituted for CF decreased the AOB-amoA, nirK and nirS copies by 28.4-74.4%. The lower AOB-amoA and nirS may be the key factors for lower N2O emissions in BS treatments. Soil NO3--N and C/N were the most important soil properties affecting N2O emission analyzed by random forest analysis. The application of BS also weakened the soil salt stress in N cycling processes as the Shannon of nirS and nosZ type denitrifiers increased with the reduction of SSC (p < 0.05). These findings provided novel insights into how biogas slurry reduces N2O emissions and modulates its pathways in saline-alkali soil. Biogas slurry partially substituted for chemical fertilizers will be a reasonable practice to return biogas slurry to the field.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Concerns for biodiversity loss, wildlife conservation, and habitat destruction have dominated the policy agenda worldwide for decades. Unsustainable human-induced development and negative interaction between humans and wildlife have emerged as predominant issues globally. The present study deals with human and elephant conflicts (HEC) in the Polpitigama Divisional Secretariat, Sri Lanka, which is located in the Kahalla-Pallekele ele-phant corridor and connects Wilpattu and Kaudulla wildlife sanctuaries. The research objectives are identifying spatial patterns of elephant habitat suitability and probable risk zones for HEC. The elephant habitat suitability and HEC risk zones were identified on spatial and temporal scales using Geographic Information System integrat-ing Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. Different factors, including habitat suitability, distance to roads, distance to croplands, distance to forests and protected areas, settlements, and population density, were considered to deter-mine HEC risk zones in the area. Topography, water, and vegetation criteria are considered when determining elephant habitat suitability. The results of the Analytic Hierarchy Process run the spatially explicit model. The results revealed that of the total area, 15.3% is very highly suitable for elephant habitats, while the least suitable areas contribute only 4%. About 33.8% of the area is moderately suitable for elephants. The risk map indicates that 23.7% of the total area is under very high risk for HEC, and the least risk areas only account for 5.4%. About 26.2% of the area falls under the moderate risk zone for HEC. Since the model considered three aspects of HEC, it will help policymakers in wildlife conservation to avoid and minimize the HEC.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity (i.e. the ability to express different phenotypes under changing environmental conditions) is thought to play a key role in habitat adaptation, but little is known about how trait plasticity evolves following dispersal into novel island habitats. We hypothesize that shifts from seasonal Mediterranean climates to more stable (subtropical) island conditions would promote a net reduction in trait plasticity over time. To test this hypothesis, we set two common gardens with contrasting environmental (low resource vs. mesic) conditions, where we grew seedlings of wild olive (Olea europaea var. sylvestris) populations that represented two Canary Island lineages with different colonization times (old vs. young) and their Mediterranean ancestral lineage (N = 275 individuals). Plasticity was assessed for 12 morphological, photosynthetic and chemical traits by (i) sub-jecting half of the seedlings to simulated herbivore browsing (50% of aerial biomass removal) and (ii) comparing phenotypic values between both common garden settings. Simulated herbivore browsing induced few plastic responses, mostly restricted to photosynthetic traits, but these were similarly displayed by all lineages. Com-parisons between common gardens revealed a contrasting response between the Mediterranean and both sub-tropical island lineages in leaf phenotypes. Furthermore, the older island lineage showed an overall lack of plasticity (i.e. environmental canalization) in morphological and chemical traits. These results suggest that, unlike photosynthetic traits that are fundamental for fast acclimation to environmental shifts, some develop-mental traits may lose plasticity over time as a result of phenotypic adjustment to subtropical insular conditions.

AB  - Steel slag from an electric arc furnace (EAF) may contain significant amounts of oxides of valuable metals. The recovery of iron and other metals from the EAF slag using smelt-reduction process was studied with coal as the reductant. A pig iron phase with high carbon and a final slag depleted of the valuable metals were generated. SEM-EDS and ICP analysis indicated that valuable metals could be successfully recovered in the pig iron. Nearly 84% recovery of Fe was observed with about 85%, 95% and 84% recovery of Mo, Ni and Co, respectively. In addition, 48% Cr, 30% V and 7% Mn were also recovered with a total metal yield of about 20%. An experimental design was developed using the three most important process variables, dwell time, reaction temperature and basicity, with a view to optimize the process and identify the most favourable process conditions. A total of 15 experiments were carried out per the Box-Behnken design using Response Surface Methodology. The response variables included metal yield, total yield, slag yield, Fe recovery, Cr recovery, Mo recovery as well as C and S content of the metal. Statistically significant empirical models for the response variables were developed and the process was optimized. The optimum was obtained at a dwell time of 20 min, reaction temperature of 1681 K and basicity of 1.025. The recovered pig iron with 3.32% C and 0.1% S is suitable for use in steelmaking as hot metal. The final slag may be used in construction applications.

AB  - Pig breeding is moving toward more intensive development and is accompanied by the integrated generation of pig waste. This has disrupted the synergy between the original manure and sewage management mode and corresponding farmland at the household level. Centralized bio-energy mode is proposed to relieve environmental pressure, increase the resource recovery efficiency and rebuild the breeding and cropping. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on a regional scale, particularly regarding evaluation, applicability and feasibility. Therefore, compared to the individual and traditional mode at the household level, this study was conducted using life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis, systematically assessed the environmental performance and economic viability of the centralized bio-energy mode at the regional scale, and further explored the adaptability of multi-subjects (various pig farms and biogas enterprise) and regional feasibility. Results revealed that the centralized bio-energy mode appeared to be a better alternative in terms of global warming, terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication, with the significant reductions of 49.49 %, 6.8 % and 4.67 % respectively. Moreover, the study demonstrated a substantial profit of 48.5 CNY1 per ton of managed pig waste. Furthermore, both environmental and economic performance could be improved through scale expansion and transport optimization, with an optimal collection radius of less than 31.45 km. Conclusions clarified the potential of centralized bio-energy mode and provided valuable references for its implementation in various regions. Ultimately, further contributing to a more efficient, cost-effective, and regulated manner for resource recovery, culminating in the sustainability of pig farming and achieving environmental-friendly agriculture practices in regional contexts.

AB  - Introduction The hippocampal formation exhibits complex and context-dependent activity patterns and dynamics, e.g., place cell activity during spatial navigation in rodents or remapping of place fields when the animal switches between contexts. Furthermore, rodents show context-dependent renewal of extinguished behavior. However, the link between context-dependent neural codes and context-dependent renewal is not fully understood.Methods We use a deep neural network-based reinforcement learning agent to study the learning dynamics that occur during spatial learning and context switching in a simulated ABA extinction and renewal paradigm in a 3D virtual environment.Results Despite its simplicity, the network exhibits a number of features typically found in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. A significant proportion of neurons in deeper layers of the network are tuned to a specific spatial position of the agent in the environment-similar to place cells in the hippocampus. These complex spatial representations and dynamics occur spontaneously in the hidden layer of a deep network during learning. These spatial representations exhibit global remapping when the agent is exposed to a new context. The spatial maps are restored when the agent returns to the previous context, accompanied by renewal of the conditioned behavior. Remapping is facilitated by memory replay of experiences during training.Discussion Our results show that integrated codes that jointly represent spatial and task-relevant contextual variables are the mechanism underlying renewal in a simulated DQN agent.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of adding enzyme inducer (MnSO4) on humic substance (HS) formation during straw composting. The results demonstrated that both enzyme inducer treatment group (Mn) and functional microorganism treatment group (F) led to an increase in the content of HS compared to the treatment group without enzyme inducer and functional microorganism (CK). Interestingly, the enzyme inducer exhibited a higher promoting effect on HS (57.80 % similar to 58.58 %) than functional microbial (46.54 %). This was because enzyme inducer stimulated the growth of key microorganisms and changed the interaction relationship between microorganisms. The structural equation model suggested that the enzyme inducer promoted the utilization of amino acids by the fungus and facilitated the conversion of precursors to humic substance components. These findings provided a direction for improving the quality of composting products from agricultural straw waste. It also provided theoretical support for adding MnSO4 to compost.

AB  - Hunting has multiple consequences for wildlife, and it can be an important source of environmental pollution. Most big game hunters use lead (Pb) ammunition that shed metal fragments in the tissues of harvested animals. These Pb fragments become available to scavengers when hunters discard contaminated slaughter remains in the environment. This exposure route has been extensively studied in avian scavengers, but few studies have investigated Pb exposure from ammunition in mammals. Mammalian scavengers, including American black bears (Ursus americanus), frequently use slaughter remains discarded by hunters. The objective of this study was to investigate whether big game harvest density influenced long-term Pb exposure in American black bears from Quebec, Canada. Our results showed that female black bears had higher tooth Pb concentrations in areas with higher big game harvest densities, but such relationship was not evident in males. We also showed that older bears had higher tooth Pb concentrations compared to younger ones. Overall, our study showed that Pb exposure increases with age in black bears and that some of that Pb likely comes from bullet fragments embedded in slaughter remains discarded by hunters. These results suggest that hunters may drive mammalian scavengers into an evolutionary trap, whereby the long-term benefits of consuming slaughter remains could be negated due to increased Pb exposure.

AB  - The study focuses on the potential geographic distribution of a valuable green tea plant for sustainable agriculture development in the mountainous northwestern region of Vietnam, called Camellia sinensis var. shan (Css). It also discusses how the spatial simulation of species distribution through environmental variables and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model at a local scale. In the context of climate change, its potential distribution was modeled under current and future scenarios of 04 representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5) for 2050. From the field survey, 70 sample points were used for the procedure, including 75% and 25% of total for training and validation, respectively. Understanding the demand of downscaled CMIP5 bioclimatic data to higher resolution, the prediction-mapping results of Css meet the accuracy requirement of Area Under Curve, which ranges from 0.9016 +/- 0.0147. In which, the mean diurnal range (Bio 2) was contributed significantly (85.5%) to prediction results. The highest increase of Css was observed from prediction map, which has included 24.87% for RCP 2.6 (at high suitable degree), 2.11% for RCP 4.5 (at medium suitable degree), 1.85% (at very less suitable degree) and more than 3.19 times (at very high suitable degree) for RCP 6.0, and 32.03% for RCP 8.5 (at less suitable degree). Prediction results in 2050 revealed that the slight gain at high and very high suitable degree couldn't compensate for the "less suitable" expansion of Css in north-western Vietnam. This research could provide useful information about potential distribution assessment under multiple climate change scenarios for local development strategies as well as conservation management.

AB  - Simple Summary The uterus is an important place for mammals to nurture new life, and improving the physiological function of the uterus is important for improving the reproductive efficiency of mammals. NAC is a small-molecule antioxidant with a positive regulatory effect on mammalian reproductive performance. We found that NAC can alter the expression of uterine genes in goats in early gestation. These DEGs may regulate uterine performance in early pregnancy in goats by participating in signalling pathways related to reproductive regulation, resistance to oxidative stress, immune regulation, angiogenesis and development, cytokines, and cell adhesion. These findings provide a fundamental reference for the modulation of reproductive performance in goats in early gestation by NAC. N acetylcysteine (NAC) affects antioxidation and reactive oxygen species scavenging in the body and thereby promotes embryonic development and implantation and inhibits inflammation. The mechanism through which NAC regulates reproductive performance in the uteri of goats during early gestation remains unclear. In this study, the treatment group was fed 0.07% NAC for the first 35 days of gestation, whereas the control group received no NAC supplementation. The regulatory genes and key pathways associated with goat reproductive performance under NAC supplementation were identified by RNA-seq. RT-qPCR was used to verify the sequencing results and subsequently construct tissue expression profiles of the relevant genes. RNA-seq identified 19,796 genes coexpressed in the control and treatment groups and 1318 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 787 and 531 DEGs enriched in the treatment and control groups, respectively. A GO analysis revealed that the identified genes mapped to pathways such as cell activation, cytokine production, cell mitotic processes, and angiogenesis, and a KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in pathways associated with reproductive regulation, immune regulation, resistance to oxidative stress, and cell adhesion. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that BDNF and CSF-1 were most highly expressed in the uterus, that WIF1 and ESR2 showed low expression in the uterus, and that CTSS, PTX3, and TGF beta-3 were most highly expressed in the oviduct, which indicated that these genes may be directly or indirectly involved in the modulation of reproduction in early-gestation goats. These findings provide fundamental data for the NAC-mediated modulation of the reproductive performance of goats during early gestation.

AB  - Magnesium plays a crucial role in plant physiological processes. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the response of tea plants to altered magnesium nutrition under acid stress remain unclear. This study investigates how root environment acidification impacts tea seedlings and the role of magnesium (Mg) in mitigating these effects. We examine varying pH and Mg levels' influence on tea seedlings' resistance to abiotic stress, focusing on antioxidant capacity and nutritional content. In a hydroponic experiment, we varied root pH (3.5, 5.0, 6.5) and Mg concentrations (0.01, 0.4, 0.8 mM), assessing parameters like antioxidant capacity, peroxidative damage, and nutritional content at 1, 7, 15, and 30 days post treatment. Root environment acidification and Mg deficiency worsened peroxidative damage in tea plant leaves and roots. Increased Mg supplementation enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, reducing malondialdehyde and mitigating oxidative damage from root environment acid stress. Under acid stress, 0.8 mM Mg significantly increased tea leaf polyphenols, amino acids, and water-soluble extracts. Mg notably boosted chlorophyll content, surpassing lower Mg levels at pH 5. Additionally, Mg reversed root vitality inhibition induced by acid stress, leading to increased nitrogen, potassium, and Mg concentrations in leaves, promoting balanced nutrient absorption. Mg supplementation is crucial for enhancing tea plant antioxidant capacity, alleviating growth inhibition from root-environment acid stress, and improving chlorophyll content and root vitality, highlighting Mg's significance in tea cultivation and broader agricultural practices.

AB  - Featured Application Incorporating orange peel into the diets of lactating ewes offers a sustainable and innovative solution for valorisation of by-products, making it a valuable approach for dairy production while addressing waste management challenges.Abstract This study examined the effects of incorporating processed (hydrolysed) (POP) and unprocessed (non-hydrolysed) (UOP) orange peels into the diets of lactating ewes on the proximate composition, fatty acid profile, antioxidant properties, physicochemical characteristics, and sensory attributes of traditional sheep milk yoghurt. Thirty-six Chios breed ewes were divided into three dietary groups: POP, UOP, and a conventional control diet (Control). Yoghurt produced from the UOP and POP diets had higher protein content (5.93 and 5.53%, respectively) and fat content (6.79 and 6.24%, respectively) compared to the Control (5.42% for protein and 6.06% for fat). Additionally, there were no significant differences in the nutritional indices of yoghurt fat. The determination of antioxidant activity showed no significant differences among the groups using the ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP methods, whereas significant differences were observed when measured with the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Textural analysis revealed that UOP yoghurt had greater firmness and cohesiveness. The whiteness index of yoghurt across all treatments remained consistent during storage, maintaining the desirable visual characteristics of traditional sheep milk yoghurt. Syneresis levels were similar across all groups, indicating no negative effects on yoghurt stability. Sensory evaluation confirmed the high acceptability of yoghurt produced from both experimental diets. These findings highlight the potential of orange peels as a sustainable feed additive, with no adverse effects on the nutritional, functional, or sensory properties of dairy products, while contributing to effective waste valorisation.

AB  - This study was carried out in order to find an environmentally friendly solution to recover the abandoned Crenriched sludge soil, which causes a variety of environmental issues. Hence, in this research the influence of pre-identified Brevibacillus borstelensis UTM105 and Brevibacillus borstelensis AK2 coated Jatropha curcas seed in phytoremediation process with various treatment groups (group A to F) under greenhouse condition. Furthermore, their influence on growth, biomolecules (total proteins and total chlorophyll) content, and antioxidant activity of J. curcas during the phytoremediation process were analyzed. Surprisingly, the outstanding phytoremediation was recorded in group F treatment. In these groups, Group E. accompanied it, and the Cr was reduced by up to 31.17% and 25.65%, respectively, in treated soil after 90 days of treatment. Among these two bacterial strains, the B. borstelensis AK2 had greatest effect on J. curcas growth, the yield of biomass, total protein, total chlorophyll, and antioxidant activity and it followed by B. borstelensis UTM105. These phytoremediation potential of J. curcas was effective at soil diluted with fertile and xenobiotics free soil with dilution ratio of 50:50 and followed by 75:25 ratio. Because under undiluted Cr sludge soil condition seed germination has not occurred even though the seed has been coated with potential bacterial strains and soil blend with sterilized goat manure. Hence, under diluted conditions J. curcas seed coated with B. borstelensis AK2 showed an outstanding phytoremediation process. Hence, this approach can be applied to a field study to assess the metal removal potential of this sustainable approach.

AB  - Molecular investigations have gathered a diverse set of mammals-predominantly African natives like elephants, hyraxes, and aardvarks-into a clade known as Afrotheria. Nevertheless, the precise phylogenetic relationships among these species remain contentious. Here, we sourced orthologous markers and ultraconserved elements to discern the interordinal connections among Afrotherian mammals. Our phylogenetic analyses bolster the common origin of Afroinsectiphilia and Paenungulata, and propose Afrosoricida as the closer relative to Macroscelidea rather than Tubulidentata, while also challenging the notion of Sirenia and Hyracoidea as sister taxa. The approximately unbiased test and the gene concordance factor uniformly recognized the alliance of Proboscidea with Hyracoidea as the dominant topology within Paenungulata. Investigation into sites with extremly high phylogenetic signal unveiled their potential to intensify conflicts in the Paenungulata topology. Subsequent exploration suggested that incomplete lineage sorting was predominantly responsible for the observed contentious relationships, whereas introgression exerted a subsidiary influence. The divergence times estimated in our study hint at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event as a catalyst for Afrotherian diversification. Overall, our findings deliver a tentative but insightful overview of Afrotheria phylogeny and divergence, elucidating these relationships through the lens of phylogenomics.

AB  - 4-Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) is a potentially hazardous industrial chemical that may enter a goat's body in various ways during industrial breeding. Ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) play a critical role in supporting follicle development and hormone synthesis. However, there are few studies on the effect of VCD on goat ovarian GCs. In this study, goat ovarian GCs were isolated and treated with VCD. The results showed that treatment with VCD increased the proportion of S phase and G2/M cells, but decreased the proportion of G1 phase. VCD treatment significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). But the expression levels of p21 and p27 were increased. VCD could induce an apparent increase in the proportion of apoptosis and the level of cleaved caspase 3. Treatment with VCD significantly reduced the progesterone and estrogen concentration in the medium in which goat ovarian GCs were cultured. Correspondingly, the expression level of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) was significantly downregulated. Treatment with 0.25 and 0.5 mM VCD, the protein expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and Akt were significantly decreased. Moreover, treatment with 0.25 mM VCD significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt. In conclusion, VCD exposure had cytotoxic effects such as decreased cell viability, disordered cell cycle, increased apoptosis, and interference with steroid hormone synthesis on goat GCs. These cytotoxic effects of VCD on goat GCs may be due to the downregulation of IGF1R and the inhibition of IGF1R/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - The anti-inflammatory role of the programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) is well appreciated. However, the mechanism of how PD-1 signaling inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in macrophages, which is further exploited by Leishmania to foster their intracellular survival, was unknown. We found that among three major MAP kinases regulating immune activation, PD-1 signaling decreased only JNK phosphorylation without perturbing p38 and ERK. Inflammatory transcription factor STAT1 was also inhibited by PD-1. Association studies documented that SHP, the downstream phosphatase of PD-1, is directly responsible for the decreased phosphorylation of JNK and STAT1. JNK and STAT1 deactivation led to Elk-1/c-Fos inhibition, which signifi-cantly decreased IL-12 and TNF-alpha levels. Further investigation revealed c-Fos deactivation ultimately rendered transcription factor AP1 inactive and facilitating parasite-favorable anti-inflammatory environment.

AB  - Coccinellini, the 'true ladybirds', is a large, cosmopolitan tribe of lady beetles with immense variability in colour and form that include many commonly recognized species and major biocontrol agents, as well as some ubiquitous invasive species. In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyses of molecular and morphological data. For the molecular analysis, we gathered DNA sequence data from 164 species in 57 genera (and outgroups) from five nuclear genes [CAD (two fragments), TOPO, WGL, 3059fin] and one mitochondrial (COI) gene. The morphological analyses comprised 301 terminals and 61 discrete characters that were analysed by parsimony (MP). Our phylogenetic analyses indicate a monophyletic Coccinellini (former Coccinellinae) containing previously recognized tribes [Coccinellini, Discotomini, Halyziini, Singhikaliini and Tytthaspidini (incl. Bulaeini)]. Coccinellini is further divided into four main clades as follows: the Coccinella group (Clade A; incl. former Tytthaspidini), the Cycloneda group (Clade B), the Hippodamia group (Clade C) and the Synonycha group (Clade D; incl. former Halyziini, Singhikaliini and Discotomini). The phylogenetic relationships between them are: (A, (B, (C, D))). Our analyses also indicate that several currently recognized genera of Coccinellini are para- or polyphyletic. Based on our phylogenetic results, new generic groups are defined for Coccinellini, and new generic amendments are proposed as follows: Micraspis Chevrolat sensu n. (Oriental and Australian species), Microcaria Crotch sensu n. (=Bothrocalvia Crotch) (incl. Coelophora Mulsant species) and Phrynocaria Timberlake sensu n. (incl. Coelophora species). Further possible synonyms are discussed, for example, Coccinella Linnaeus (incl. Lioadalia Crotch), Psyllobora Chevrolat (including Oxytella Weise) and Xanthadalia Crotch (incl. Declivitata Fursch and the African species of Micraspis). The large Clade D, the Synonycha group, with 26 predominant Old World genera, contains the two notable, large and non monophyletic genera Calvia Mulsant and Coelophora that confound the relationships throughout the clade. Additionally, we performed ancestral state reconstruction of selected morphological characters traditionally used in the classification of this group, revealing their homoplastic nature. We also found that the traditional synapomorphy of the tribe, that is, female colleterial glands, closely resemble structures used in symbiotic relationships in other beetles. We used the results of our phylogenetic inferences to estimate divergence times of the tribe and major clades of Coccinellini.

AB  - Although it is known that stresses on females damage oocytes with increased production of stress hormones, whether corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) harm oocytes directly are largely unknown. We demonstrated that CRH exposure during in vitro maturation impaired competence of both pig and mouse cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs), and it impaired competence and induced apoptosis in pig cumulus-denuded oocytes (DOs) but not in mouse DOs. CRH receptor 1 was expressed in pig DOs and in cumulus cells (CCs) of both species but not in mouse DOs. In the presence of CRH, whereas mouse CCs underwent apoptosis, pig CCs did not. While pig CCs did, mouse CCs did not express CRH-binding protein. ACTH did not affect competence of either pig or mouse COCs or DOs although they all expressed ACTH receptor. Both pig and mouse CCs expressed steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and ACTH enhanced their progesterone production while alleviating their apoptosis. Neither pig nor mouse DOs expressed StAR, but ACTH inhibited maturation promoting factor and decelerated meiotic progression of DOs suggesting activation of protein kinase A (PKA). In conclusion, CRH impaired pig and mouse oocyte competence by interacting with CRH receptor and inducing CCs apoptosis, respectively. ACTH activated PKA in both DOs and CCs although it showed no effect on oocyte competence. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: The European sheep meat sector faces technical, market and financial challenges that threaten its economic performance and overall sustainability. At the same time, the sector is characterized by poor and slow adoption of innovations that could help towards facing these challenges. In this study, the technical efficiency of extensive, semi-intensive and intensive sheep meat farms in France, Spain and the UK was explored to reveal the profile of the most efficient ones and identify the best practices and innovations that these farms apply. The most efficient sheep meat farms reared large flocks, used available infrastructure at full capacity and managed human labor in a rational way. These best farms emphasized feeding and grazing innovations, marketing strategies, breeding programs and use of digital technologies. The uptake of such practices and innovations by farms of similar production systems could help to increase the productivity and economic performance of the sheep meat sector.
   The slow adoption of innovations is a key challenge that the European sheep sector faces for its sustainability. The future of the sector lies on the adoption of best practices, modern technologies and innovations that can improve its resilience and mitigate its dependence on public support. In this study, the concept of technical efficiency was used to reveal the most efficient sheep meat farms and to identify the best practices and farm innovations that could potentially be adopted by other farms of similar production systems. Data Envelopment Analysis was applied to farm accounting data from 458 sheep meat farms of intensive, semi-intensive and extensive systems from France, Spain and the UK, and the structural and economic characteristics of the most efficient farms were analyzed. These best farmers were indicated through a survey, which was conducted within the Innovation for Sustainable Sheep and Goat Production in the Europe (iSAGE) Horizon 2020 project, the management and production practices and innovations that improve their economic performance and make them better than their peers.

AB  - Simple Summary We found that miR-143-3p in extracellular vesicles of porcine uterine luminal fluid could be targeted and taken up by porcine trophoblast cells, with the effect of promoting cell proliferation and migration and affecting embryo implantation. We validated that miR-143-3p directly targets glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GDP2). Therefore, miR-143-3p and its target gene, GPD2, affect the function of porcine trophoblast cells and embryo implantation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in uterine luminal fluid (ULF) can reportedly affect the proliferation and migration function of porcine trophoblast cells (PTr2 cells) by mediating the maternal-fetal exchange of information. miR-143-3p is considered a crucial miRNA in early pregnancy in mammals; however, little is currently known about how it regulates the function of PTr2 cells. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ssc-miR-143-3p in ULF-EVs on the function of PTr2 cells during porcine embryo implantation. The uptake of ULF-EVs by PTr2 cells was confirmed, which significantly increased the expression of ssc-miR-143-3p. Ssc-miR-143-3p was found to facilitate the proliferation and migration of PTr2 cells in the CCK-8, EdU and wound-closure assays, while the opposite findings were observed after the knockdown of ssc-miR-143-3p. Bioinformatics analysis and the luciferase reporter assay showed that glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GDP2) was directly targeted by miR-143-3p. Inhibition of miR-143-3p was validated in mice to inhibit embryo implantation. In summary, ssc-miR-143-3p in ULF-EVs affects the proliferation and migration of PTr2 cells by mediating GPD2, thereby affecting embryo implantation.

AB  - Introduction: Allocation to plant defense traits likely depends on resource supply, herbivory, and other plant functional traits such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) traits. Yet, attempts to integrate defense and resource acquisitive traits remain elusive.
   Methods: We assessed intraspecific covariation between different defense and LES traits in a widely distributed tropical savanna herb, Solanum incanum, a unique model species for studying allocations to physical, chemical, and structural defenses to mammalian herbivory.
   Results: We found that in a multivariate trait space, the structural defenses - lignin and cellulose - were positively related to the resource conservative traits - low SLA and low leaf N. Phenolic content, a chemical defense, was positively associated with resource acquisitive traits - high SLA and high leaf N - while also being associated with an independent third component axis. Both principal components 1 and 3 were not associated with resource supply and herbivory intensity. In contrast, spine density - a physical defense - was orthogonal to the LES axis and positively associated with soil P and herbivory intensity.
   Discussion: These results suggest a hypothesized "pyramid" of trade-offs in allocation to defense along the LES and herbivory intensity axes. Therefore, future attempts to integrate defense traits with the broader plant functional trait framework, such as the LES, needs a multifaceted approach that accounts for unique influences of resource acquisitive traits and herbivory risk.

AB  - Plastic pollution is an alarming environmental problem affecting diverse species worldwide. Scavenging birds are currently exposed to plastic due to contamination of their food sources. Here, we evaluated the ingestion of plastic by a threatened top scavenger, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), and the potential origin of the plastic. We analyzed the biotic (organic items from the diet) and abiotic (synthetic material) composition of regurgitated pellets in two remote areas of Peru associated with protected areas: a marine-coastal region and an Andean region. Condors consume mainly Pinnipeds and South American camelids in the marine-coastal region, and camelids and livestock in the Andean region. We found different sizes and varieties of plastic debris, with a very high frequency of occurrence (85-100%) of microplastics in pellets of both areas studied. The occurrence of microplastics differed between sites; although very high in general, the rate of occurrence and density were higher in the marine-coastal region. We also confirmed that carcasses consumed by condors in both study areas were contaminated with plastic. Therefore, plastic in Andean condors is most probably acquired through the food web in both the marine and terrestrial environments. Andean condors from Peru are highly contaminated with plastic, which may affect their health, population dynamics, and conservation. Moreover, as condors are apex scavengers, our results highlight the fact that plastic pollution in remote areas of Peru is present at different levels of the food web and in the environment. Urgent Action should be taken to reduce environmental contamination with this hazardous pollutant.

AB  - Introduction: A wide range of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can be applied to agricultural soils as biofertilizers for increasing crop growth and yield. Current research also shows that AMF can stimulate plant defences against a range of herbivores and pathogens. However, to date, the efficient use of AMF in agriculture is largely impaired by our inability to predict the performance of different AMF-plant complexes in variable environments. For instance, AMFs by increasing plant foraging capacity might alleviate allocation constraints in relation to growth versus defences. However, whether this effect occurs might depend on the in situ conditions. The main goal of this study was to investigate the context-dependency of the ability of AMF to modulate plant growth and resistance against herbivores under variable soil water availability.
   Materials and Methods: To address our goal, we performed a greenhouse experiment for measuring the effect of different AMF inocula (Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus irregularis, or both) on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) growth and defences against an insect herbivore under two conditions: a normal watering regime or drought conditions. We measured the functional, physiological and chemical traits of the plants.
   Results: We found that AMF presence generally decreased plant growth, but increased chemical defences and resistance against generalist caterpillars. Such growth-defence trade-off was nonetheless dependent on the identity of the mycorrhizal inoculum and on soil water content. Under drought, inoculated tomato plants lowered their investment to defence and noninoculated plants lowered their growth.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the influence of abiotic factors and fungal identity on plant-AMF-herbivore interactions. In a broader sense, our results point to the necessity of finding AMF species that have reduced context-dependency to climatic factors, for more widespread use in organic agriculture.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are obligate parasites that infect a broad range of insect species. Host-seeking is a crucial step for EPN infection success and survival. Yet, the identity and ecological functions of chemicals involved in host-seeking by EPNs remain overlooked. In this review, we report known CO2, plant-derived and insect-derived cues shaping EPN host-seeking and recognition. Despite species-specific response to environmental cues, we highlight a hierarchical integration of chemicals by EPNs. We further emphasize the impact of EPN selection pressure, age, and experience on their responsiveness to infochemicals. Finally, we feature that EPN chemical ecology can translate into powerful sustainable strategies to control insect herbivores in agriculture.

AB  - A novel thermal-constant blood-feeder covered with a perforated film and using pig blood was developed for rearing Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae). The perforated film was used as a substitute for the membrane or parafilm that is normally used in conventional blood-feeders to prevent the mosquitoes from directly contacting the blood. The efficiency of this perforated blood feeder was assessed by using live mice and comparing the engorgement rate of female mosquitoes and their demographic parameters. In a no-choice test, no significant differences were observed in the engorgement rates and fecundity between females fed on perforated feeders containing pig blood and those fed on live mice. In a three-minute-long free-choice test, the accumulated engorgement rate was significantly higher in mosquitoes feeding on the perforated feeders than in those feeding on live mice. The demographic characteristics indicated that mosquitoes fed on the perforated feeder containing pig blood had a higher immature survival rate and prolonged adult male and female longevity. Although a lower intrinsic rate of increase and lower finite rate of increase were observed when female adults fed on the perforated feeder, computer projection of the population growth was comparable using both blood sources. Massn acing analysis showed that the perforated blood feeder was much more cost-effective than using live mice. These results demonstrate that the perforated blood feeder containing pig blood is more effective and cost efficient than using live mice for maintaining and mass rearing of mosquitoes in the laboratory.

AB  - Patterns of phytochemistry localisation in plant tissues are diverse within and across leaves. These spatial heterogeneities are important to the fitness of herbivores, but their effects on herbivore foraging and dietary experience remain elusive. We manipulated the spatial variance and clusteredness of a plant toxin in a synthetic diet landscape on which individual caterpillars fed. We monitored caterpillars with cameras across most of their larval development. Caterpillars that fed on diets with a lower spatial variance and more clustered arrangement of toxins had overall worse performance, mostly because those caterpillars ate less, moved more, ingested more toxin, or failed to physiologically acclimate. Using empirically parameterised individual-based models, we found that differences in movement away from, not towards, less toxic food drove a body size-dependent effect of clusteredness. Hence, the spatial pattern of phytochemicals itself, beyond mean concentration, can have important consequences for herbivores through complex interactions with herbivore foraging.

AB  - Seahorses are rare and threatened marine species facing increasing risks from habitat degradation and overexploitation. Understanding their distribution is critical for effective conservation planning, yet comprehensive studies are limited, including in Brazil. This study aimed to conduct a gap analysis and identify priority areas for seahorse conservation by using species distribution models (SDMs) to map their distribution and guide conservation efforts. Occurrence data and environmental variables were processed to develop SDMs. Conservation gaps were identified by comparing SDM predictions with the existing protected area (PA) network, and priority areas were determined using Marxan software. SDMs revealed species-specific habitat associations: Hippocampus reidi was found in shallow coastal habitats, such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and rocky shores, across Brazil, particularly in the northeast and southeast; Hippocampus patagonicus occurred in deeper coastal areas, from Rio de Janeiro to Rio Grande do Sul; and Hippocampus aff. erectus was limited to the northeast, primarily inhabiting mangrove and seagrass areas. Conservation gaps were significant, with only 9%, 11%, and 20% of suitable habitats for H. reidi, H. patagonicus, and H. aff. erectus overlapping PAs, even less in strictly protected zones. Priority areas suggest a 17% expansion of the protected area system to meet conservation targets. This study emphasizes the urgent need for targeted strategies to safeguard seahorses and their habitats in Brazil, highlighting the importance of addressing taxonomic uncertainties, filling knowledge gaps, exploring their potential as flagship species, and strengthening protections to mitigate biodiversity loss. These findings provide decision-makers and stakeholders with actionable insights to ensure the long-term preservation of these vulnerable species and their habitats.

AB  - Giardia duodenalis is a zoonotic parasite that causes gastrointestinal diseases in both humans and animals. To evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis in black goats, we collected 539 fecal samples from nine districts in Fujian Province, China. The presence of G. duodenalis was confirmed through nested PCR targeting the SSU rRNA gene, and genotyping was performed at the beta-giardin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase loci. Among the samples, 115 tested positive, yielding an overall infection rate of 21.34%. Assemblages A and E were identified, with assemblage E being predominant. Statistical analysis revealed significant regional differences in infection rates (p < 0.01), with Zhangzhou exhibiting the highest infection rate (39%) and Fuzhou the lowest (3.13%). No significant differences in infection rates were observed based on age: 24.56% (56/228) for goats <1 year, 14.92% (27/181) for goats 1-2 years, 26.8% (26/97) for goats 2-3 years, and 18.18% (6/33) for goats >= 3 years. Similarly, no significant differences were found between sexes: 24.84% (40/161) for males and 19.84% (75/378) for females. Notably, assemblage A, a zoonotic genotype, was detected, indicating a potential risk of cross-species transmission. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of G. duodenalis in black goats and provides critical data for the development of targeted control strategies in Fujian Province.

AB  - The present work compared nine Aloe species grown on the highlands of western Saudi Arabia depending on their nutrient contents and nutritive quality. The highest Ca and Na contents were recorded in the tissues of Aloe hijacensis, while the highest K and Mg were in A. vera, while the highest N and P contents were recorded in A. armatissima and A. brunneodentata, respectively. The highest nitrogen-free extract, total proteins and lipid contents were recorded in A. castellorum, A. armatissima and A. parvicoma, respectively, while the highest ash content and crude fibers in A. sabaea. The percentage of crude protein in the grazeable parts of all Aloe species except A. parvicoma, A. castellorum and A. vera, lie within the range required for the maintenance of animals, while the crude fiber content was quite low. A. armatissima had the highest value of digestible crude protein (DCP), while A. parvicoma had the highest value of the total digestible nutrients (TDN). Moreover, A. castellorum contributed to the highest values of digestible energy (DE), metabolized energy (ME) and net energy (NE). It seems that the nutritive values of all investigated species lie within the range of nutritive value of goat, dairy cattle, and beef cattle.

AB  - Functional traits are phenotypic characteristics that contribute to fitness of individuals in dynamic and changing environments. In mammals, both categorical and continuous (e.g., quantitative) functional traits have been extensively utilized as proxies for diet, locomotion, and other aspects of species ecology, but there has been less focus on form and function of soft tissues. This is particularly true for the digestive system, which varies in size and complexity across Class Mammalia and plays a major role in the energetics of species. To guide more effective utilization of gastrointestinal (GI) morphology as a functional proxy in small mammal ecology, we examined how GI tracts (lengths and masses of four GI sections) varied within a population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, United States. We collected samples of adult P. maniculatus monthly for 1 year and measured GI tracts to quantify variation with respect to seasonality and trophic level, providing insight into plasticity in this soft tissue trait over time. We found that season had a significant effect on the total length and wet mass of the GI tract, with January mice having the longest GI tracts and lengths being shortest in the summer. The relative shortening of the GI tract in summer corresponded with a partial trophic increase detected by stable isotope signatures. GI length and wet mass also were affected by reproduction, but males and females responded in sex-specific ways to demands of reproduction, with reproductively active males having shorter and lighter GI tracts than nonreproductively active males. Our study provides proof-of-concept for understanding population-level plasticity in a rarely collected soft tissue trait, which may also be complementary to standard craniodental measurements as a functional dietary proxy to understand mammalian ecology and community assembly.
   In this study, we examine seasonal and sex-specific changes in the gastrointestinal tracts of a common North American small mammal. We show that the gastrointestinal tracts of winter mice are up to 35% longer and 18% heavier than those of summer mice. This was directly coincident with decreased dietary quality in the winter months.
   Los rasgos funcionales son caracteristicas fenotipicas que contribuyen a la aptitud de los individuos en entornos dinamicos y cambiantes. En los mamiferos, los rasgos funcionales categoricos y continuos (por ejemplo, cuantitativos) se han utilizado ampliamente como indicadores de la dieta, la locomocion y otros aspectos de la ecologia de las especies, a la vez que se ha prestado menos atencion a la forma y funcion de los tejidos blandos. Este es particularmente el caso del sistema digestivo, que varia en tamano y complejidad a traves de la Clase Mammalia, jugando un papel importante en la energetica de las especies. Para propiciar una utilizacion mas efectiva de la morfologia gastrointestinal (GI) como un rasgo funcional en la ecologia de los pequenos mamiferos, examinamos como los tractos GIs (longitudes y masas de cuatro secciones GI) variaban dentro de una poblacion de ratones ciervos (Peromyscus maniculatus) de las Montanas Apalaches del sur de Carolina del Norte, Estados Unidos. Mensualmente, durante un ano, recolectamos especimenes adultos de P. maniculatus y medimos sus tractos gastrointestinales para cuantificar la variacion con respecto a la estacionalidad y el nivel trofico, brindando informacion sobre la plasticidad en estos rasgos de tejido blando a lo largo del tiempo. Descubrimos que la estacionalidad tiene un efecto significativo en la longitud total y la masa humeda del tracto gastrointestinal, ya que los ratones de enero tienen los tractos gastrointestinales mas largos y las longitudes son mas cortas durante el verano. El acortamiento relativo del tracto GI en verano se correspondio con un aumento trofico parcial detectado por las cuantificacion de isotopos estables. La longitud GI y la masa humeda tambien se vieron afectadas por la reproduccion; pero los machos y las hembras respondieron de manera diferente a las demandas de la reproduccion. Los machos reproductivamente activos tienen tractos gastrointestinales mas cortos y ligeros que los machos no activos reproductivamente. Nuestro estudio constituye un avance para comprender la plasticidad a nivel de poblacion en un rasgo de tejido blando raramente recolectado, que tambien puede ser complementario a las mediciones craneodentales estandar como un proxy dietetico funcional para entender la ecologia de los mamiferos y el ensamblaje de la comunidad.

AB  - Land-use changes have greatly impacted biodiversity and led to new conservation challenges, including greater predation pressure, although this can be difficult to quantify. Here we directly monitor predator encounters in fragmented woodlands by using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and a semi-automated assessment protocol to detect functionally referential alarm vocalisations of the noisy miner Manorina melanocephala. We demonstrate that measuring changes in perceived predation pressure, the so-called 'landscape of fear', in a prey species across temporal (dawn, midday, dusk across multiple seasons) and spatial scales (small/large fragments and edge/centre locations within fragments) is achievable. Vocalisations linked with ground predator presence were rarer during midday recordings, but more commonly detected from the edge rather than centre of smaller fragments. While the probability of detecting aerial alarm calls directed at flying raptors also increased in edge habitat, aerial alarm detections declined from a dawn peak to a minimum during dusk recordings. These patterns did not simply reflect noisy miner occupancy or different sections of monitored patches, but highlighted higher perceived predation risk along edges, particularly for small patches, demonstrating the nuanced insights that PAM can offer when quantifying animal behaviour.

AB  - Aim of study: To investigate the effect of substituting sesame meal (SM) treated with different levels of formaldehyde instead of soybean meal (SBM) on rumen fermentation, milk composition, and hemato-chemical parameters in lactating goats. Area of study: Kerman, Iran. Material and methods: Forty Murciano-Granadina goats in mid-lactation were allocated to four groups as a completely randomized design for 56 d. They were fed with diets containing: 1) SBM (control), 2) 12.5% untreated SM, 3) 12.5% treated SM with 0.8 g formaldehyde/100g crude protein (CP), and 4) 12.5% treated SM with 1.2 g formaldehyde/100g CP. Main results: The goats fed diet containing SM treated with 1.2 g of formaldehyde had greater (p < 0.01) intake of dry matter, CP and metabolizable energy (ME) than other groups. Milk yield and milk protein in goats fed diets containing 1.2 g formaldehyde-treated SM were greater than others (p < 0.01). Fat-corrected milk and total solids in groups fed diets containing formaldehyde-treated and untreated SM were greater than those in control (p < 0.01). Goats fed control diet showed a greater proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA), and short and medium-chain FA in their milk compared to other groups (p < 0.01). Partial replacement of SBM with formaldehyde-treated or untreated SM increased milk unsaturated FA and long-chain FA (p < 0.01). Goats fed formaldehyde-treated SM had lower acetate production (p < 0.01). Research highlights: Partial replacement of SBM with formaldehyde-treated SM can be suggested to increase lactating goats' performance without adverse effects on their health.

AB  - During operation of a light water reactor, waterside corrosion of the Zircaloy nuclear fuel cladding causes hydrogen pickup. The absorbed hydrogen can redistribute in the cladding driven by existing concentra-tion, stress, and temperature gradients. When the concentration reaches the solubility limit, hydrides pre-cipitate. These hydrides can be more brittle than the Zircaloy matrix, so they can endanger the cladding integrity during a transient if their concentration is too high. In recent years, extensive efforts have been made to understand hydrogen behavior and to develop simulation tools able to predict hydrogen dif-fusion and hydride precipitation and dissolution. These effort s led to the development of the Hydride Nucleation-Growth-Dissolution (HNGD) model and its implementation into the nuclear fuel performance code Bison. While it offers a significant improvement and accurately predicts the amount of precipitates, this model fails to predict the thickness of the hydride rim under a temperature gradient. The current work presents the limitation of the HNGD model and proposes two hypotheses to improve the model's accuracy. The first hypothesis introduces a time dependency to the supersolubility to reduce the nu-cleation barrier as hydrogen atoms find more favorable nucleation sites. The second one introduces a hydride content dependency to the solubility. These hypotheses were validated and implemented into Bison and are now available to the user community. The modified HNGD model accurately predicts the hydride rim thickness, and it was demonstrated that this updated model can be used in Bison to model Zircaloy cladding with a zirconium inner liner. Finally, potential experimental and numerical methods are discussed to further validate these hypotheses. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological sanitation via thermophilic composting could be a promising solution to the lack of sanitation and limited access to fertilizers, particularly in developing countries. Here, we conducted a 185-d thermophilic composting experiment with human excreta, and separately with cattle manure, mixed with kitchen scraps, teff [Eragrostis tef (Zuccagni) Trotter] straw, sawdust, and biochar (BC) by using an appropriate-technology approach. We followed the dynamics of the most important macronutrients (N, P, K), temperature, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, as well as content of organic matter, organic C, Ca, Mg, and micronutrients throughout the process. Low N (<47%), P (<9%), K (<11%), Ca (<18%), and Mg (<21%) losses and the temperature profile indicated a well-functioning thermophilic composting process. Compost temperature was >60 degrees C for 7, 6, 5, and 8 consecutive days for treatments containing human excreta, human excreta amended with BC, cattle manure, and cattle manure amended with BC, respectively, suggesting a final compost product free of pathogens. The compost mixture with cattle manure and BC reached a significantly higher temperature than the same variant without BC, with a maximum value of 65.9 degrees C on Day 6. For all treatments, final germination index values >100% indicated compost maturity and the absence of phytotoxic substances. Biochar addition reduced losses of organic matter (18-23%), C (33-42%), and N (49-100%) and decreased the amount of extractable NO3- (32-36%) in the final compost. The tested ecological sanitation concept via thermophilic composting is thus a promising strategy to improve access to cheap fertilizer by safe and sustainable sanitation and waste management.

AB  - BackgroundThiamethoxam (TMX) is insecticidal, but also can trigger physiological and metabolic reactions of plant cycles. The objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological and metabolic effect of TMX on tea plants and its potential benefits. ResultsIn this study, dose of TMX (0.09, 0.135 and 0.18 kg a.i./ha) were tested. Except for peroxidase (POD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), chlorophyll, carotenoid, catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly affected compared with the controls. The CAT activity was increased by 3.38, 1.71, 2.91 times, respectively, under three doses of TMX treatment. The metabolic response between TMX treatment and control groups on the third day was compared using a widely targeted metabolomics. A total of 97 different metabolites were identified, including benzenoids, flavonoids, lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, organic nitrogen compounds, organic oxygen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, phenylpropanoids and polyketides, and others. Those metabolites were mapped on the perturbed metabolic pathways. The results demonstrated that the most perturbation occurred in flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. The beneficial secondary metabolites luteolin and kaempferol were upregulated 1.46 and 1.31 times respectively, which protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. Molecular docking models suggest interactions between TMX and flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase. ConclusionThiamethoxam spray positively promoted the physiological and metabolic response of tea plants. And this work also provided the useful information of TMX metabolism in tea plants as well as rational application of insecticides. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Changes in the genetic mechanisms that control sexual determination have occurred independently across the tree of life, and with exceptional frequency in teleost fishes. To investigate the genomic changes underlying the evolution of sexual determination, we sequenced a chromosome-level genome, multitissue transcriptomes, and reduced representation population data for the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), which has an XY/XX sex determination mechanism and has recently diverged (0.9-3.8 Ma) from the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), which has a ZZ/ZW system. We used frequency and coverage-based population approaches to identify a putative sex-determining factor, GSDF. We characterized regions with elevated heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium indicating suppression of recombination across a nascent sex chromosome. We detected testis-specific expression of GSDF, the sequence of which is highly conserved across flatfishes. Based on evidence from genome-wide association, coverage, linkage disequilibrium, testis and brain transcriptomes, and sequence conservation with other flatfishes, we propose a mechanism for the recent evolution of an XY sex-determination mechanism in Atlantic halibut. Changes to the ancestral sex-determining gene DMRT1 in regulating the downstream gene GSDF probably coincided with GSDF, or a proximal regulatory element of it, becoming the primary sex-determining factor. Our results suggest changes to a small number of elements can have drastic repercussions for the genomic substrate available to sex-specific evolutionary forces, providing insight into how certain elements repeatedly evolve to control sex across taxa. Our chromosome-level assembly, multitissue transcriptomes, and population genomic data provide a valuable resource and understanding of the evolution of sexual systems in fishes.

AB  - Simple Summary The authors present a preliminary analysis of caprine remains from 70 burials at Dunping, a burial site associated with Bronze-Age pastoralists in northwestern China and featured by the interment of skulls and hooves of domestic ungulates in burial contexts. The minimal impact of weathering on the skeletal elements and the attachment of atlases in skulls suggest that the caprines chosen for burial may have been slaughtered on-site, and that the inhumation of the caprine skulls and hooves occurred shortly after their death. It is likely that the remaining carcasses of the caprines were consumed by or distributed among funeral participants. The mortality profiles indicate the presence of caprines across various age stages at the site, with individuals aged 6-12 months accounting for the largest proportion. This pattern differed from those observed in contemporaneous pastoral societies in the regions nearby.Abstract The late second and first millennium BC witnessed extensive economic, cultural, and political exchanges between pastoralists and sedentary farming states in East Asia. Decades of archaeological fieldwork across northern China have revealed a large number of burial sites associated with pastoralists during the first millennium BC. These sites were characterized by the inhumation of specific animal parts in burials, predominantly the skulls and hooves of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. However, the selection preference for these animals and how they were integrated into the mortuary contexts of these pastoral societies remain poorly investigated. Here, we report a preliminary analysis of caprine remains from 70 burials at the site of Dunping in the southern Gansu region of northwestern China, dated to approximately the seventh to fourth centuries BC. Based on an examination of species composition, post-depositional effects, traces of human alteration, skeletal element representation, and age at death, we discussed the selection, slaughtering, and inhumation of caprines concerning the mortuary practices at the site. Comparisons between Dunping and several other contemporaneous burial sites in neighboring regions, specifically in terms of the mortality profiles, further highlight distinct patterns in the selection of caprines for mortuary purposes among pastoral societies. These differences suggest varying degrees of emphasis placed on the economic and social significance attributed to caprines. Our findings provide new insights into the roles that caprines played in both ritual performances and subsistence practices among pastoralists in East Asia during the first millennium BC.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation level of a two-strain Bacillus subtilis probiotic on growth performance, blood parameters, fecal metabolites, and microbiome in nursery pigs. A total of 54 weaned piglets were allotted to three treatments in three replicate pens with six pigs/pen for a 28 d feeding trial. The treatments were as follows: control: no probiotic supplementation; Pro1x: B. subtilis supplementation at 1.875 x 10(5) CFU/g diet; and Pro10x: B. subtilis supplementation at 1.875 x 10(6) CFU/g diet. Body weight at d 14 postweaning (p = 0.06) and average daily gain for d 0 to 14 postweaning (p < 0.05) were greater in the Pro1x treatment than in the other treatments. Blood glucose levels were greater in both probiotic treatments than in the control treatment at d 14 postweaning (p < 0.05). In the fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, the butyrate concentrations were greater in the Pro1x treatment than in the other treatments (p < 0.05), and the acetate, propionate, and total SCFA concentrations were greater in the Pro1x treatment than in the Pro10x treatment (p < 0.05). The beta diversity of fecal microbiome composition at d 14 postweaning based on Unweighted Unifrac analysis was dissimilar between the Pro1x and Pro10x treatments (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary B. subtilis supplementation of two strains selected to reduce effects of pathogenic Escherichia coli to nursery diets at 1.875 x 10(5) CFU/g diet improved the growth rate in the early postweaning period, increased fecal SCFA concentrations and altered the fecal microbial community composition. A higher dose of B. subtilis did not improve the performance parameters over those of the control piglets.

AB  - Simple Summary Identifying new alleles and mutations at calcium-sensitive casein loci requires continuous updating of genotyping protocols useful for association study. This study reports (1) a new, more efficient, specific PCR-based genotyping protocol to detect the CSN2(01) allele in goats, (2) the genetic characterization at the CSN1S1, CSN2, and CSN1S2 loci in three endangered goat breeds reared in the Lazio Region (Central Italy) and, (3) the association of the genotypes observed in the studied animals with parameters that might affect the milk's traits. As regards the CSN1S1, CSN2, and CSN1S2 loci, no animals were found to be carriers of the CSN1S1(01), CSN1S1(E), CSN2(01), CSN1S2(D), and CSN1S2(0) alleles; instead, for the CSN1S1 locus, a high frequency of alleles associated to a low (CSN1S1(F)) and high (CSN1S1(A*,B*)) content of the alpha s1 casein (alpha s1-Cn) content in milk, with CSN1S1(F)>= CSN1S1(B*) >= CSN1S1(A*) being observed. An association between the different genotypes at the CSN1S1 locus and some milk traits, namely the fat and protein yielded and the fat, protein, solids-not-fat, and casein percentages without an effect on the milk yield, was observed. Calcium-sensitive caseins are the main protein component of milk. In the goat, they are encoded by three genes (CSN1S1, CSN2, and CSN1S2) located on chromosome 6. A high number of alleles has been discovered for these genes in the goat species, responsible for changes in the milk's qualitative and quantitative characteristics. This study aimed to develop an Allele-Specific PCR (AS-PCR), which allowed us to unequivocally detect goat carriers of the CSN2(01) allele. Subsequently, the calcium-sensitive casein loci genotype was investigated in three native goat breeds of the Lazio Region (Bianca Monticellana, Capestrina, and Ciociara Grigia). No individuals were carriers of the CSN1S1(01), CSN1S1(E), CSN2(01), CSN1S2(D), and CSN1S2(0) alleles, while a high frequency of the alleles CSN1S1(F) and CSN1S1(A*,B*) was observed. Association analyses between the different genotypes at the CSN1S1 locus and some milk traits, namely the fat and protein yielded and the fat, protein, solids-not-fat, and casein percentages without an effect on the milk yield, were observed.

AB  - Extraction of oil and gas occurs around the world and associated worksite activity can affect native species, even when some good habitat remains. Understanding the possible negative effects is important for management of protected species. Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizards ( Gambelia sila) ) are a state- and federally listed endangered species in the San Joaquin Desert of California, and part of their remaining range coincides with oil field operations. In 2015 and 2016, we used radiotelemetry to study home ranges and movements of G. sila living in an oil field with limited infrastructure and roads (a light-density oil field constructed from 2011 to 2014) and at a control site of native habitat about 3 km away. We did not find significant differences between the oil field and control site in either home-range size or daily distances moved. We did, however, find that the number of predation events was significantly greater at the oil field site, assuming that known predation occurrences represented all predation. Predation by birds was greater at the oil field site and likely was facilitated by predator perching locations provided by power poles, transmission lines, and other tall vertical structures associated with the oil field. No similar structures or other perching locations for large predatory birds existed at the control site. Only a twin-pole, three-wire transmission line existed adjacent to the oil field prior to its development. Given that G. sila are endangered largely because of habitat loss, their recovery may benefit from minimizing these hazards in oil fields that currently support the species.

AB  - In Guizhou, China, a variety of intercropping systems involving Camellia oleifera have been established, yet comprehensive scientific evaluations of these systems remain scarce. Our study aimed to assess the differences among these systems by examining two key aspects: soil properties and microbial species diversity. We discovered that Ascomycota and Proteobacteria were the prevalent fungal and bacterial groups, respectively, across all Camellia oleifera intercropping systems. In the dual-factor correlation network, encompassing species and soil environmental factors, fungi Satiozyma and bacteria Vicinambicharacters exhibited high Degree Centrality. Urease and Alkaline nitrogen emerged as soil environmental factors strongly associated with these fungi and bacteria. Particularly noteworthy were the Alpha diversity indices (Shannon, PD, and Chao1), which were significantly higher for soil fungi in the Camellia oleifera-Zea mays system and for soil bacteria in the Camellia oleifera-Glycine max system. Furthermore, the Camellia oleifera-Glycine max soil displayed notably elevated levels of Microbial Biomass Phosphorus, Sucrase, Urease, and Catalase. In the Camellia oleifera-Zea mays system, the overall soil fertility was substantially higher, coinciding with a high degree of centrality for fungi Phoma and bacteria SC-I-84 in the correlation network. Additionally, Urease and Available Mn were identified as key environmental factors influencing these fungi and bacteria. Strong correlations were observed between Phoma and TN, and SC-I-84 and TK (r=0.94, 0.99 p<0.01). Also, there was a significant association between fungal Neocosmospora and bacterial AD3 with UE and AMn, respectively (r=0.69, -0.99 p<0.05). Based on our findings, we recommend the Camellia oleifera-Zea mays intercropping system as a particularly promising option, given its advantages in fungal alpha diversity and soil fertility. Concurrently, the Camellia oleifera-Glycine max system demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of microbial biomass phosphorus, bacterial alpha diversity, and soil enzyme activities.

AB  - The human papillomavirus (HPV)-18 E7 (E7) oncoprotein is a major transforming protein that is thought to be involved in the development of cervical cancer. It is well-known that E7 stimulates tumour development by inactivating pRb. However, this alone cannot explain the various characteristics acquired by HPV infection. Therefore, we examined other molecules that could help explain the acquired cancer properties during E7-induced cancer development. Using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method, we found that the Elk-1 factor, which is crucial for cell proliferation, invasion, cell survival, anti-apoptotic activity, and cancer development, binds to the E7. By determining which part of E7 binds to which domain of Elk-1 using the Y2H method, it was found that CR2 and CR3 of the E7 and parts 1-206, including the ETS-DNA domain of Elk-1, interact with each other. As a result of their interaction, the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 was increased, thereby increasing the expression of target genes EGR-1, c-fos, and E2F. Additionally, the colony forming assay revealed that overexpression of Elk-1 and E7 promotes C33A cell proliferation. We expect that the discovery of a novel E7 function as an Elk-1 activator could help explain whether the E7 has novel oncogenic activities in addition to p53 inactivation. We also expect that it will offer new methods for developing improved strategies for cervical cancer treatment.

AB  - Background: Terpenoids emitted from plants are important for regulating plant-insect interaction. However, it is still unclear how terpenoids affect the host defense system. There are few reports of terpenoids' involvement in the mechanisms that regulate woody plants' insect resistance.
   Results: The (E)-beta-ocimene of terpenes was only found in RBO-resist leaves, and its content was higher than that of other type terpenes. Further, we also found (E)-beta-ocimene had a significant avoidance effect on RBO and reached 87.5% of the highest avoidance rate. Meanwhile, overexpression of HrTPS12 in Arabidopsis increased the HrTPS12 expression level, (E)-beta-ocimene content, and enhanced the defense against RBO. However, silencing HrTPS12 in sea buckthorn revealed that the expression levels of HrTPS12 and (E)-beta-ocimene significantly decreased, causing the attraction effect on RBO.
   Conclusion: HrTPS12 was an up-regulator, which improves sea buckthorn resistance to RBO by regulating the synthesis of volatile (E)-beta-ocimene. These results provide in-depth information about the interaction between RBO and sea buckthorn and provide a theoretical basis for developing plant-based insect repellents that can be used to manage RBO.

AB  - The ovulation mechanism is one of the fascinating physiological processes in reproductive biology in mammals. From the reproductive point of view, the species have been classified as spontaneous or induced ovulators. Although the release of GnRH followed by the preovulatory LH surge is shared between both types of ovulation, the stimulus to initiate GnRH release varies between both categories. In spontaneous ovulators, ovulation depends on the systemic concentration of ovarian steroids, however, in induced ovulators, different stimuli such as copulation, environmental, and social cues can facilitate or induce ovulation regardless of the increases in systemic estradiol concentration. In this review, we document evidence that a male-derived protein is the main factor responsible for inducing ovulation and also modulating the ovarian function in the domestic South American camelid, the llama. The neurotrophin beta-Nerve Growth Factor (beta-NGF) is the principal factor present in the semen of llamas responsible for inducing ovulation in this species. After the intrauterine deposit of semen during mating, beta-NGF is absorbed through the endometrium to reach the circulatory system, where it reaches the hypothalamus and stimulates GnRH release. The potential site of action of this neurotrophin at the brain has not been elucidated, however, hypotheses are raised that the factor may cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate upstream neuronal networks that lead to the stimulation of GnRH-secreting neurons. It is possible that beta-NGF could be sensed at the median eminence without crossing the blood-brain barrier. Finally, it has been observed that this factor is not only a powerful stimulator of ovulation but also has a luteotrophic effect, resulting in the development of a corpus luteum capable of secreting more progesterone when compared to other ovulation-stimulating analogues.

AB  - Anhui Province is located in the eastern China, in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, and contains three major basins, i.e., the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Xin'an River basins. Based on the statistical data of livestock and poultry quantity and farmland area in Anhui Province in 2019, ArcGIS was used to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of the livestock and poultry excreta (LPE) pollutants in Anhui Province in order to explore the potential pollution risk posed by livestock and poultry farming to the farmland and the water environment in Anhui Province. The equivalent pollution load method was adopted to compare and assess the release of LPE pollutants in various cities and to analyze the causes. Through the calculation of the farmland carrying capacity load and early warning value of LPE and the water load of livestock and poultry pollutant release based on the equivalent pollution index method, a comprehensive assessment of the potential pollution risk posed by livestock and poultry farming on farmland and the water environment in Anhui Province was carried out. In this study, the spatial distribution of the livestock and poultry pollution in Anhui Province was analyzed, the effect of the pollution load of the livestock and poultry on the cultivated land and water environment was evaluated, and suggestions for environmental protection measures are provided. The results of this study revealed that the total pig equivalent of the livestock and poultry farming in Anhui Province was 55,068,400 and the LPE output was 47,778,600 t in 2019. The LPE pollutant output was 1,707,700 t, and the total release was 510,400 t. The release of pollutant chemical oxygen demand (COD) accounted for 71.67% of the total release. The average farmland load of the pig manure equivalent was 8.09 t/hm(2) in the province. The average pollutant diffusion concentration of in the water was 31.63 mg/L. The average equivalent pollution index of LPE was 5.23, indicating a mild pollution impact on the water environment. Overall, the spatial distribution of the LPE pollutant output and pig manure equivalent farmland load in Anhui Province increased from south to north. Fuyang and Suzhou cities had a high risk of water environment pollution and should be the key regions for livestock and poultry pollution prevention and control measures. The optimization of the layout of livestock and poultry farming areas, smoothing the cycles of crop and livestock farming, and the vigorous promotion of the resource utilization of the LPE are proposed.

AB  - Antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance genes can enter the environment via fertilization with calf and pig manure. In a longitudinal study, nine antibiotic resistance genes (tet(B), tet(L), tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q), tet(W), erm(B), erm(F) and sul2) and 56 antibiotic residues were investigated in 288 soil samples and 8 corresponding slurry samples from 6 pig farms and 2 veal farms using qPCR and LC-MS/MS, respectively. A significant increase in gene copy number of tet(M), erm(B), erm(F) and sul2 was observed in all the soil layers between sampling times prior to (T1) and 2-3 weeks after fertilization (T3). Tet(B), tet(Q) and tet(L) were least abundant in the soil among the genes tested. From 7 classes of antibiotics, 20 residues were detected in soil and slurry using an optimized and validated extraction method. Flumequine was detected in all soil samples in concentrations below 100 mu g/kg despite being detected in only half of the corresponding slurry samples. Doxycycline, oxytetracycline, lincomycin and sulfadiazine were also frequently detected in concentrations ranging from 0.1 mu g/kg to 500 mu g/kg and from 2 mu g/kg and 9480 mu g/kg in soil and slurry, respectively. Furthermore a positive association between the presence of antibiotic residues (total antibiotic load) and antibiotic resistance genes in soil was found. One possible explanation for this is a simultaneous introduction of antibiotic residues and resistance genes upon application of animal slurry.

AB  - Rodents pose a major challenge to livestock farms by causing structural damage and serving as reservoirs and carriers of pathogens that threaten both animal and human health. With increasing restrictions on rodenticide use, there is a critical need to understand how alternative rodent management strategies influence the dynamics of rodent-borne diseases. In this study, we develop a novel model that integrates rodent population dynamics within agricultural environments (e.g., pig and poultry farms) with pathogen transmission characterized by different life histories (e.g., long-lasting vs. short-lived immunity, direct vs. indirect transmission). Our model is informed by experimental data to realistically capture rodent and pathogen dynamics and to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different management interventions. Specifically, we assess the impacts of sanitation, culling, and fertility control strategies on both rodent populations and pathogen prevalence. Our framework integrates diverse pathogen life histories and explicitly links management interventions to their effects on both disease dynamics and rodent populations within a specific agricultural context. Our results show no substantial differences between direct and environmentally transmitted pathogens. However, farm sanitation was the most effective strategy when the pathogen elicited long-lasting immunity, while culling was effective when immunity was short-lived. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of considering both pathogen life history and host population dynamics when designing sustainable and effective rodent management strategies.

AB  - The Banija spotted pig (BS) is a Croatian autochthonous breed that was officially recognised in 2018. The breed remains threatened with extinction and is on its way to establishing a production cycle that will ensure long-term conservation and sustainability. However, there is a general lack of data on the production traits of BS pigs. The aim of this work was therefore to identify the main fattening, carcass and meat quality traits of the BS pig and to assess the suitability of the breed for sustainable pork production. A total of ten pigs were fattened in a semi-free-range production system up to the average final body weight of 162 +/- 17.3 kg. At the end of fattening, the growth, carcass and meat quality traits (pH, meat colour and water holding capacity) of the BS pig were determined and the gross margin based on the production of value-added meat products was calculated and compared with other Croatian local pig breeds. The results, which are to be considered preliminary due to the small data set, show that the fattening and slaughter characteristics of the BS pig are satisfactory and consistent with the characteristics of the breed and the husbandry practices adapted to semi-free-range farming. Furthermore, the meat quality showed suitability for processing for most traits, while the calculation of gross profit confirms the advantage of this breed for a well-rounded production cycle compared with related local pig breeds.

AB  - Background and purpose: Teratological cases in insects can be of dif-ferent characteristic, quite often they are bifurcations, for example of anten-nal segments or parts of the legs. The aim of this paper is to report a case of leg duplication in Carabus violaceus L. Materials and methods: In the context of an interdisciplinary monitor -ing in the frame of a conservation project on the European bison (Bison bonasus (L.)) in Poland the carabid fauna (Carabidae) on areas grazed by this species was studied using pitfall traps in the Pszczyna forest, located in Silesia Province, to the south of the town Tychy. The traps were located inside a mixed fresh coniferous forest, with domination of Scots pine (Pinus syl -vestris L.). Results: Among the carabids gathered a teratological female specimen of the species Carabus violaceus L. with multiple anatomical duplications on the right front leg was collected. Conclusions: The multiple incident of bifurcation may suggest a ge-netic base of the teratology. In the case of increased rates teratological cases may have potential as bioindicator.

AB  - Simple Summary Animals adopt several strategies to regulate their body temperature by promoting heat loss or gain in hot and cold environments, respectively. This mechanism of heat loss or production is performed in thermal windows. A thermal window is a structure where many blood capillaries facilitate thermal exchange in this region. The presence of feathers, hair, or glabrous (hairless) skin and their structural characteristics greatly influence each species' capacity to maintain thermal comfort. This factor needs to be considered when implementing new monitoring or measuring techniques such as infrared thermography since interpretations may vary due to the presence or absence of these structures. It is essential to recognize the effects of glabrous skin, hair, and feathers on thermoregulation to identify species-specific thermal windows that allow accurate evaluations of the thermal state of domestic animals. The objective of this review is to describe and analyze the effect of feathers, hair, and glabrous (hairless) skin on the thermoregulation of domestic and endotherm animals, especially concerning the uses and scope of infrared thermography (IRT), scientific findings on heat and cold stress, and differences among species of domestic animals. Clinical medicine considers thermoregulation a mechanism that allows animals to adapt to varying thermal environmental conditions, a process in which the presence of feathers, hair, or glabrous skin influences heat loss or heat retention, respectively, under hot and cold environmental conditions. Evaluating body temperature provides vital information on an individual's physiological state and health status since variations in euthermia maintenance in vertebrates reflect a significant cellular metabolism deviation that needs to be assessed and quantified. IRT is a non-invasive tool for evaluating thermal responses under thermal stress conditions in animals, where the presence or absence of feathers, hair, and glabrous skin can affect readings and the differences detected. Therefore, anatomical regions, the characteristics of feathers, hair, glabrous skin such as structure, length, color, and extension, and strategies for dissipating or retaining heat together constitute a broad area of opportunity for future research into the phenomena of dermal thermoregulation in domestic species.

AB  - Genetic knockout and pharmaceutical inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome enhances the extinction of contextual fear memory, which is attributed to its role in neuronal and synaptic dysregulation, concurrent with neurotransmitter function disturbances. This study aimed to determine whether NLRP3 plays a role in generalizing fear via the inflammatory axis. We established the NLRP3 KO mice model, followed by behavioral and biochemical analyses. The NLRP3 KO mice displayed impaired fear generalization, lower neuroinflammation levels, and dysregulated neurotransmitter function. Additionally, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, but not the inhibition of NMDA or 5-HT2C receptors, resulted in fear generalization in NLRP3 KO mice because TAT-GluA2 3Y, but not SB242084 and D-cycloserine, treated blocked NLRP3 deprivation effects on fear generalization. Thus, global knockout of NLRP3 is associated with aberrant fear generalization, possibly through AMPA receptor signaling.

AB  - In this study, investigation was done to determine the optimum combination of cow dung (CD) and horse dung (HD) for enhanced biogas production and plant stability. Anaerobic co-digestion of CD and HD at varying percentage combination was carried out in five (5) identical 25 L cylindrical digesters (A-E) for a retention period of 37 days, at an average ambient temperature of 33 degrees C. Using the Microsoft excel solver function, 2010 version, the modified Gompertz model was applied to predict the relevant kinetic variables of the digestion process. Result obtained shows that digester D with 25% CD and 75% HD produced the highest daily biogas, followed by C (50% CD and 50% HD), B (75% CD-25% HD), A (100% CD) and E (100% HD). Digester D also had maximum biogas production potential (A) of 13.8 L/gVS, maximum biogas production rate (mu) of 0.69 L/gVS/day and shortest lag phase (lambda) of 5.20 days. Digester E with 100% HD, though had a short lag phase of 5.72 days, had the least total biogas yield of 5.1 L/gVS. The closeness of the coefficients of determination (R-2) to 1 reflects a good fit, between experimental and simulated data. The study found that increase in the amount of cow dung beyond 25% led to decrease in biogas yield. It has also shown that biogas production from CD and HD is feasible and can serve as way of removing CD and HD from the environment while serving as a source of bioenergy. Further study on best ways of pre-treating the substrates for greater biogas yield is recommended. Graphic abstract

AB  - Simple Summary The analysis of transmission routes for paratuberculosis as well as their prevention are critical for effective disease control. The aim of the present study was to assess the importance of colostrum and the udder skin as routes for transmission of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) within a dairy goat herd. Swabs of the udder skin and colostrum samples were collected from goats of a paratuberculosis-infected herd during lambing season and analyzed for MAP DNA. Additionally, cultivation of the swabs was performed. MAP could not be detected in the colostrum. A low number of udder skin swabs was positive for MAP DNA but no bacteria could be cultured. Because the detection methods are imperfect, the occurrence of MAP in colostrum or on the udder skin can never be completely excluded. Therefore, present recommendations concerning colostrum and youngstock management should still be re-evaluated, but applied in goat herds within a paratuberculosis control program until the role of colostrum and udder skin for within-herd transmission of MAP is further investigated. Oral intake of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) in first days of life is considered to be the main route of infection for paratuberculosis. This can be related to a direct contact to contaminated feces or feeding of MAP containing colostrum. Colostrum is believed to become contaminated either by lactogenic shedding or introduction of MAP from environmental sources. In this pilot study, the presence of MAP in individual and bulk colostrum samples from a paratuberculosis-infected, vaccinated dairy goat herd in Germany and the effect of udder skin disinfection on the MAP load of colostrum were examined. In order to distinguish between lactogenic shedding and fecal contamination, 49 udder skin swabs were cultivated on solid medium whereas 29 swabs were additionally analyzed by qPCR. qPCR was applied on 110 individual colostrum samples collected from 55 goats, one before and one after disinfection with a mycobactericidal disinfectant, and 14 bulk colostrum samples. MAP DNA was detected in 10.3% (3/29) of the swab samples, but no viable MAP was cultivated from any sample. These results indicate a low-level MAP contamination of the udder skin and colostrum of milking goats suggesting a low risk of MAP transmission via these routes.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) are a group of organic compounds that are regulated by polygenic and environmental factors and affect the taste, nutritional value, and quality of meat. Lamb meat is rich in FAs required by the human body, which has directed more attention to sheep research and meat production. The fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) gene is considered a candidate gene that can affect FA composition in livestock. Therefore, the aim of this study was to screen for genetic polymorphisms of FABP4 and confirm the association between these polymorphisms and FAs, chemical composition, and carcass traits in Sonid lambs. The results of the association study showed that g.57764667T>C, g.57764436T>G, g.57764242G>A, and g.57757988A>G were associated with the composition of certain long-chain FAs, and g.57764242G>A, g.57764436T>G, and g.57758026G>A were associated with free amino acid levels. In addition, g.57764667T>C and g.57757988A>G were associated with carcass weight and live weight in Sonid lambs. Therefore, the polymorphisms of the FABP4 gene are expected to be a genetic selection marker for superior traits in Sonid sheep breeding, which also provides new insights into how the ovine FABP4 gene affects traits of lamb quality.

AB  - CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14) is an important chemokine involved in infection and immunity and plays an important role in a variety of immune-related diseases. The 446 bp cDNA sequence of the CXCL14 gene in yaks was obtained. Additionally, the prokaryotic expression vector of the CXCL14 protein with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was successfully constructed and expressed. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of spleen macrophages were significantly inhibited after treatment with the CXCL14 protein at different concentrations (1, 10 and 20 mu g/mL) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8) and interferon-alpha (TNF-alpha) were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the expression of anti-inflammatory factor interleukin 10 (IL10) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The contents of inflammatory factors in the supernatant of cells were detected using ELISA, and it was also found that the contents of TNF-alpha, IL6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2) were significantly increased under different CXCL14 protein concentrations (p < 0.05). Finally, the exogenous addition of CXCL14 inhibited the activity, clonal formation and migration of hepatoma cells (HepG2). Additionally, after HepG2 cells were treated with 20 mu g/mL CXCL14 protein for 12 h, 24 h and 36 h, the expression levels of BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) and the BCL2-associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX) were increased to varying degrees, while the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) genes decreased compared to the control group. In conclusion, the CXCL14 protein can inhibit the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells by inducing the expression of macrophage pro-inflammatory factors and activating apoptosis-related genes to exert innate immunity. These results are helpful to further study the function of the CXCL14 protein and provide research data for the innate immune mechanism of yaks under harsh plateau environments.

AB  - Lentil is a main winter-sown legume crop widely grown in the Mediterranean type of climate, and has significant value as food, feed and fodder. Lentil often experiences considerable drought stress during growth season which negatively impact yield. Application of irrigation at crucial crop stages can stabilize productivity. The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of irrigation on yield and study the correlated traits for indirect selection for yield. An experiment comprising eleven lentil genotypes including check variety Shiraz-96 was evaluated for yield and related traits under irrigation in randomize complete block designed repeated 3 times at Balochistan Agricultural Research and Development Center (BARDC), Quetta during 2018-19 season. The results indicate that significant genetic variation (p<0.05) is present among lentil genotypes. Results revealed that all the traits exhibit significantly except days to flowering (50%). Maximum grain yield was recorded for genotypes 6 which produced 1030 kg ha(-1) grain yield and 3571 kg ha(-1) biological yield and 30% harvest index followed by genotype 2 with 1000 kg ha(-1) grain yield and 3183 kg ha(-1) biological yield with harvest index value of 31%. Grain yield also showed highly positive correlation with biological yield with a value of 0.84. Yield component trait of 100 seed weight depicted highest weight for genotype 5 with 3.52 grams followed by genotype 7 with 3.37 grams. Similarly, number of seeds per plant data showed maximum number of grains for genotype 10 producing 75 seeds per plant. Canopy temperature was also recorded to check the impact of heat on crop. The data on CT revealed genotype 6 as the coolest genotype which was also high yielding. Correlation data also showed moderate negative correlation of CT with grain yield-0.39. Days to flowering (50%) revealed non-significant difference with flowering range of 121 to 127 days. Cluster analysis showed four different groups within 2 major groups. Principal component analysis illustrated that first four components explained 83.9 percent variance with first two PCs explained the major variance of 31.5 and 26.6 variation.

AB  - Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential trace element that exists in all tissues of the human body, but excessive Mo intake has a toxic effect. Cadmium (Cd) is a widely known and harmful heavy metal that exists in the environment. Although studies on Mo and Cd are available, it is still unknown how the combination of Mo and Cd causes pulmonary injury. Forty-eight sheep that were 2 months old were chosen and randomly separated into four groups as follows: Control group, Mo group, Cd group, and Mo + Cd group. The experiment lasted 50 days. The results showed that Mo and/or Cd caused significant pathological damage and oxidative stress in the lungs of sheep. Moreover, Mo and/or Cd exposure could downregulate the expression levels of xCT (SLC7A11 and SLC3A2), GPX4 and FTH-1 and upregulate the expression levels of PTGS2 and NCOA4, which led to iron overload and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis induced Wnt/8-catenin-mediated fibrosis by elevating the expression levels of Caveolin-1 (CAV-1), Wnt 1, Wnt3a, 8-catenin (CTNNB1), TCF4, Cyclin D1, mmp7, a-SMA (ACTA2), Collagen 1 (COL1A1) and Vimentin. These changes were particularly noticeable in the Mo and Cd combination group. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that Mo and/or Cd exposure led to lung ferroptosis by inhibiting the SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 axis, which in turn increases CAV-1 expression and subsequently activates the Wnt/ 8-catenin pathway, leading to fibrosis in sheep lungs.

AB  - The water shrew Chimarrogale platycephala is an endangered species in Japan. Although immediate conservation actions are necessary, detailed information on this species is inadequate. We compared dietary trends obtained via C. platycephala digestive contents analysis with those through stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, %) of non-invasive body hair and invasive muscles to elucidate their diet and evaluate usefulness of the dietary stable isotope analysis. We captured 20 shrews from three streams in Aomori Prefecture from 2013 to 2016 barring snow accumulation seasons. The digestive contents analysis showed that water shrews mainly fed on aquatic insects, whereas freshwater crabs, fishes, and terrestrial insects were also observed as diets. delta C-13 values from the stable isotope analysis were not significantly different between muscles and body hair and indicated a primary diet of aquatic invertebrates and fishes. delta N-15 values were significantly lower in muscles and indicated a similar trophic position of water shrews to fishes. In the isotope mixing model, the contribution of terrestrial invertebrates was less than 0.35 except for two individuals that showed the highest terrestrial invertebrate ratio (> 0.5) and the lowest aquatic invertebrate ratio. This study also demonstrated that body hair from any part of the back was sufficiently useful for dietary stable isotope analysis.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Currently, all pigs raised on intensive farms develop iron-deficiency anemia if they do not receive supplemental iron at birth. Weaning diets commonly contain high concentrations of iron, and the effect on the copper and zinc contents in pork is unknown. In this exploratory work, we determined the effect of excessive oral iron supplementation on the contents of these microminerals in pork. Surprisingly, we found that high iron doses of 3000 ppm reduced the zinc content of pork by 32-55%.
   The aim of this work was to determine in an exploratory manner the effect of excessive iron supplementation on iron, zinc, and copper contents in pork and pork offal. Pigs averaging 50 days in age and 15 +/- 1.3 kg body weight were allocated to a control group (500 ppm dietary Fe) and a supplemental group (3000 ppm dietary Fe). After an iron supplementation period of 60 days, blood samples were analyzed to determine iron biomarkers, serum copper, and zinc contents. Animals were slaughtered to assess total iron, non-heme iron, heme iron, zinc, and copper contents in samples of nine meat cuts and some offal. Iron supplementation improved the iron status in pigs with increased hemoglobin and hematocrit, but did not affect serum levels of iron, zinc, and copper. Iron supplementation did not affect the heme and non-heme iron contents of the different meat cuts. Zinc contents decreased by 32-55% in meat cuts, where iron content increased in the liver, spleen, kidneys, and pancreas. No differences of zinc and copper were observed in offal samples. High concentrations of iron supplementation reduce zinc content in pork.

AB  - Oilseed production under semiarid conditions in Pakistan is under a threat of thermal stress at the early and later stages of the crop. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of sulfhydryl thiourea on the performance and quality of late sown camelina. The study comprised of; (i) sowing time (ST): ST1 = 10 November and ST2 = 30 November; (ii) camelina genotypes: the Australian (611) and the Canadian (618); and (iii) thiourea applications (1 g L-1): TU0 = no application (control-no applications), TU1 = water spray at the vegetative stage (positive control), TU2 = thiourea spray at the vegetative stage (1 g L-1), TU3 = water spray at the reproductive stage (positive control), and TU4 = thiourea spray at the reproductive stage (1 g L-1). Sowing time, genotypes, and thiourea supplementation showed a significant effect on the parameters studied, including physiological attributes, seed yield, and quality parameters. Yield and yield attributes were negatively affected in the late sown crop due to a significant reduction in gas exchange and plant water status compared with an early sowing. Seed quality was also affected by late sowing as saturated fatty acids increased and unsaturated fatty acids reduced under late sown crops. However, thiourea supplementation significantly improved the gas exchange, seed yield, and oil content than the control treatment. Thiourea applications improved the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid and linolenic acid) and decreased the concentration of saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acid). However, thiourea applied at the reproductive stage was more effective in relation to seed yield and seed quality parameters compared to thiourea application at the vegetative stage. Oleic acid desaturation ratio was reduced due to late sowing time; however, linoleic acid desaturation ratios were increased in late sown camelina compared to an early sown crop. Among camelina genotypes, the Canadian camelina performed better in relation to physiological and yield attributes and seed quality parameters relative to the Australian camelina. Thiourea supplementation improved seed yield and seed quality by improving unsaturated fatty acids under different sowing times with more improvement in the Canadian camelina compared with the Australian genotypes.

AB  - The relationship between herbivory and latitude may differ between native and introduced populations of invasive plants, which can generate latitudinal heterogeneity in the strength of enemy release. However, still little is known about how latitudinal heterogeneity in herbivore pressure influences latitudinal variation in defense phenotypes of invasive plants. We tested how latitudinal patterns in multi-variate defense syndromes differed between native (Argentinian) and introduced (Chinese) populations of the invasive herb Alternanthera philoxeroides. In addition, to better understand the drivers underlying latitudinal patterns, we also tested whether associations of defense syndromes with climate and herbivory differed between native and introduced ranges. We found that native plant populations clustered into three main defense syndromes associated with latitude. In contrast, we only found two defense syndromes in the introduced range. One matched the high-latitude syndrome from the native range, but was distributed at both the northern and southern range limits in the introduced range. The other was unique to the introduced range and occurred at mid-latitudes. Climatic conditions were associated with variation in syndromes in the native range, and climatic conditions and herbivory were associated with variation in syndromes in the introduced range. Together, our results demonstrate that plants may under the new environmental conditions in the introduced range show latitudinal patterns of defense syndromes that are different from those in their native range. This emphasizes that geographical dependence of population differentiation should be explicitly considered in studies on the evolution of defense in invasive plants.

AB  - Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a relevant zoonotic infectious agent causing swine erysipelas (SE) in wild boar. In Portugal, there is no information on its occurrence. For this reason, this study aims to perform a first serosurvey of SE in hunted wild boars in Portugal. During the 2019/2020 hunting season, 111 sera from hunted wild boar were collected and analysed serologically in the laboratory with a commercial ELISA kit. No animals were eviscerated and examined after the hunt. The hunters took it all for private consumption. The results identified 18 animals that were exposed to SE, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 16.2% (95% CI: 19.9-24.4%). No statistical significance was observed on the effect of gender and age on seropositivity. However, wild boar hunted in Pinhel County, had five times more likely to be seropositivity (p-value < 0.05; OD = 5.4). Apart from its potential debilitating capacity and chronicity in the wild boar population, SE is also a very serious occupational zoonosis. Thus, the result of this first serosurvey in Portugal should raise awareness and alert competent national veterinary authorities and those involved in the hunting sector, especially hunters who directly handle these carcasses. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the role of wild boar as a reservoir and spillover of this disease to other animals and humans.

AB  - Simple Summary The weaning period is one of the most stressful periods in a piglet's life due to abrupt changes in diet and environment. To mitigate production loss, creep feed is given to piglets to supplement sow's milk, but the intake of typical dry creep feed is low. Alternatively, liquid diets presented as a gruel may have increased positive effects post-weaning. The objective of this study was to discern whether a gruel pre-weaning supplementation could better prepare piglets to handle increased stress encountered after weaning. We conclude that piglets fed gruel creep feed had greater feed intake and body weight than pigs that had no supplementation, and the effects were sustained through the first week of weaning. To combat the stress of weaning, we utilized novel gruel creep feeders to supplement suckling pigs with divergent soluble (n = 6 litters) versus insoluble (n = 6) diets compared with un-supplemented controls (n = 6). Post-weaning, pigs were fed a common phase 1 diet. Average daily weight gains of pigs fed soluble and insoluble creep diets were 53% and 17% greater than control pigs, respectively (p < 0.01). Creep intake was higher (82%) for pigs fed the soluble diet, and the accompanying weight increase was sustained post-weaning (p < 0.02). Villus measures were prematurely altered in soluble-creep-fed pigs (p < 0.01), with decreases in villi length, crypt depth, and villus area pre-weaning. No effects of treatment were detected for VFA concentrations and pH in the cecum. There was an interaction between treatment and age for several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.01), where soluble-creep-fed pigs had increased cytokine levels with age, whereas cytokine levels in the insoluble and control groups decreased over time. We conclude that a soluble creep diet fed in a gruel state during the pre-weaning period has a positive impact on weaning weight that is sustained post-weaning, and is accompanied by alterations in the intestinal health of young pigs.

AB  - Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the most significant invasive and destructive pests worldwide, causing serious economic losses to the tomato industry. Rhizosphere microorganism, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Pseudomonas bacteria, can interact with plants individually or collectively to improve plant growth and resistance to pests and disease. However, the effects of AMF, Pseudomonas, and their interactions on plant responses to insect herbivores remain unclear. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of single/dual inoculation with AMF (Funneliformis mosseae, M) and Pseudomonas putida (P) on the growth and defense of tomato variety Dafen (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in response to infestation by T. absoluta, as well as the growth, development, and enzyme activity of insect. The results showed that M, P, and MP promoted tomato growth by increasing nutrient concentrations, with the growth-promoting effect of dual-inoculation significantly surpassing that of single inoculation. M, P, and MP still improved tomato growth in T. absoluta infestation, with biomass increases of 57.34%, 54.46%, and 255.49%. M, P, and MP significantly increased the defense ability of tomato, with jasmonic acid concentrations increasing by 42.15%, 60.87% and 90.02%, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity increasing by 47.40%, 47.68%, and 59.97%. The inoculation treatments inhibited the growth and development of T. absoluta, reduced its feeding, prolonged its growth and development, decreased egg weight, and increased the activity of protective and detoxifying enzymes. Overall, our results indicated that AMF and bacteria can stimulate each other, positively influence tomato growth and enhance resistance to T. absoluta. These findings indicate the feasibility of AMF and bacteria in combinations as potential biocontrol agents for the management of T. absoluta.

AB  - Living in variable and unpredictable environments, organisms face recurrent stressful situations. The endocrine stress response, which includes the secretion of glucocorticoids, helps organisms to cope with these perturba-tions. Although short-term elevations of glucocorticoid levels are often associated with immediate beneficial consequences for individuals, long-term glucocorticoid elevation can compromise key physiological functions such as immunity. While laboratory works highlighted the immunosuppressive effect of long-term elevated glucocorticoids, it remains largely unknown, especially in wild animals, whether this relationship is modulated by individual and environmental characteristics. In this study, we explored the co-variation between integrated cortisol levels, assessed non-invasively using faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs), and 12 constitutive indices of innate, inflammatory, and adaptive immune functions, in wild roe deer living in three populations with previ-ously known contrasting environmental conditions. Using longitudinal data on 564 individuals, we further investigated whether age and spatio-temporal variations in the quantity and quality of food resources modulate the relationship between FCMs and immunity. Negative covariation with glucocorticoids was evident only for innate and inflammatory markers of immunity, while adaptive immunity appeared to be positively or not linked to glucocorticoids. In addition, the negative covariations were generally stronger in individuals facing harsh environmental constraints and in old individuals. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of measuring multiple immune markers of immunity in individuals from contrasted environments to unravel the complex relationships between glucocorticoids and immunity in wild animals. Our results also help explain conflicting results found in the literature and could improve our understanding of the link between elevated glucocorticoid levels and disease spread, and its consequences on population dynamics.

AB  - Plants employ diverse anti-herbivore defences that can covary to form syndromes consisting of multiple traits. Such syndromes are hypothesized to impact herbivores more than individual defences. We studied 16 species of lowland willows occurring in central Europe and explored if their chemical and physical traits form detectable syndromes. We tested for phylogenetic trends in the syndromes and explored whether three herbivore guilds (i.e., generalist leaf-chewers, specialist leaf-chewers, and gallers) are affected more by the detected syndromes or individual traits. The recovered syndromes showed low phylogenetic signal and were mainly defined by investment in concentration, richness, or uniqueness of structurally related phenolic metabolites. Resource acquisition traits or inducible volatile organic compounds exhibited a limited correlation with the syndromes. Individual traits composing the syndromes showed various correlations to the assemblages of herbivores from the three studied guilds. In turn, we found some support for the hypothesis that defence syndromes are composed of traits that provide defence against various herbivores. However, individual traits rather than trait syndromes explained more variation for all studied herbivore assemblages. The detected negative correlations between various phenolics suggest that investment trade-offs may occur primarily among plant metabolites with shared metabolic pathways that may compete for their precursors. Moreover, several traits characterizing the recovered syndromes play additional roles in willows other than defence from herbivory. Taken together, our findings suggest that the detected syndromes did not solely evolve as an anti-herbivore defence.

AB  - Transcriptomic analysis from testis and epididymis of BMI by combining PacBio Iso-Seq and RNA-seq provides a comprehensive set of reference transcripts and improves the annotation of pig testis and epididymis isoforms, which will offer a valuable resource for further studying the spermatogenesis disorder in BMI caused by inbreeding.
   In mammals, testis and epididymis are critical components of the male reproductive system for androgen production, spermatogenesis, sperm transportation, as well as sperm maturation. Here, we report single-molecule real-time sequencing data from the testis and epididymis of the Banna mini-pig inbred line (BMI), a promising laboratory animal for medical research. We obtained high-quality full-length transcriptomes and identified 9879 isoforms and 8761 isoforms in the BMI testis and epididymis, respectively. Most of the isoforms we identified have novel exon structures that will greatly improve the annotation of testis- and epididymis-expressed genes in pigs. We also found that 3055 genes (over 50%) were shared between BMI testis and epididymis, indicating widespread expression profiles of genes related to reproduction. We characterized extensive alternative splicing events in BMI testis and epididymis and showed that 96 testis-expressed genes and 79 epididymis-expressed genes have more than six isoforms, revealing the complexity of alternative splicing. We accurately defined the transcribed isoforms in BMI testis and epididymis by combining Pacific Biotechnology Isoform-sequencing (PacBio Iso-Seq) and Illumina RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques. The refined annotation of some key genes governing male reproduction will facilitate further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BMI male sterility. In addition, the high-confident identification of 548 and 669 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in these two tissues has established a candidate gene set for future functional investigations. Overall, our study provides new insights into the role of the testis and epididymis during BMI reproduction, paving the path for further studies on BMI male infertility.

AB  - Simple Summary Both the jejunum and the colon secrete unique immune factors that interact with the gut microbiota. Investigating the association of gut microbiota and the host immune system, we detected higher populations of Bacteroides, Fibrobacteres and Spirochetes in the colon than in the jejunum of Altay sheep, which is a unique breed in Xinjiang. Levels of IL-6 and IL-12 were lower in the colon than in the jejunum. IL-10 was positively correlated with Ruminococcus_2 in the jejunum. These results indicate a potential interaction between intestinal microbiota and the host immune system that may be considered for the prevention of sheep diseases and the screening of probiotics. Both the jejunum and colon release cytokines that interact with intestinal microbiota. However, it is largely unclear which cytokines and microbial populations are involved in the homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem for sheep health. To address this, we collected contents for isolating microbiota and tissues for determining cytokines from the jejunum and colon of 7-month-old Altay sheep. We used the techniques of 16S rRNA sequencing and ELISA to detect microbial population and cytokine level, respectively. Correlations between microbial population and cytokines were analyzed by Spearman correlation coefficient. The correlation analysis revealed higher populations of Bacteroides, Fibrobacteres and Spirochetes in the colon than in the jejunum, and IL-6 and IL-12 levels were higher in the jejunum than in the colon. Association analysis further revealed a positive association between IL-10 level and both Ruminococcus_2 and norank_f_Bifidobacteriaceae population in the jejunum. The analysis also revealed positive associations between IL-6 level and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 population, IL-10 and Prevotellaceae_UCG-004, as well as TNF-alpha and Prevotellaceae_UCG-003 in the colon. These results indicate a potential interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the host immune system that needs to be further clarified for considering dietary formulations to maintain animal health and disease prevention.

AB  - Goat cheese is an important element of the Mediterranean diet, appreciated for its health-promoting features and unique taste. A pivotal role in the development of these characteristics is attributed to the microbiota and its continuous remodeling over space and time. Nevertheless, no thorough study of the cheese-associated microbiota using two metaomics approaches has previously been conducted. Here, we employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to explore the microbiota of a typical raw goat milk cheese at various ripening timepoints and depths of the cheese wheel. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing and metaproteomics results described a stable microbiota ecology across the selected ripening timepoints, providing evidence for the microbiologically driven fermentation of goat milk products. The important features of the microbiota harbored on the surface and in the core of the cheese mass were highlighted in both compositional and functional terms. We observed the rind microbiota struggling to maintain the biosafety of the cheese through competition mechanisms and/or by preventing the colonization of the cheese by pathobionts of animal or environmental origin. The core microbiota was focused on other biochemical processes, supporting its role in the development of both the health benefits and the pleasant gustatory nuances of goat cheese.

AB  - Livestock manure amendment, a common fertilization method for agricultural practice, can exacerbate antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) pollution, thus threatening food safety and human health. On the other hand, manure can also be produced as biochar to improve soil quality, which may reduce ARGs inside manure. However, it is unclear how and why shifting manure to biochar for soil amendment reduces ARG pollution. Thus, this study investigated the variations of ARGs and microbial communities in soil amended with swine manure (2 % and 5 %) and its biochar (2 % and 5 %) and then explored how shifting swine manure to biochar reduced ARG contamination. After 28 d incu-bation, ARG number in soil without amendment, manure-amended soils, and biochar-amended soils were 47, 112-136, and 43-52, respectively. ARG abundance in soil without amendment, manure-amended soils, and biochar-amended soils were 7.66 x 107, 4.32 x 109 -1.42 x 1011, and 8.44 x 107-9.67 x 107 copies g-1 dry soil, respectively. Compared to manure-amended soils, its biochar amendments reduced ARG abundance by 2-4 orders of magnitude and ARG number by 70-93 in soil. Besides, manure amendment altered while biochar did not alter bac-terial diversity and composition. The changed soil properties and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) could explain the changes in ARGs. Relative to manure amendments, its biochar amendments reduced mobile genetic elements (MGEs), Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in soil, which explained the reduced abundance and diversity of ARGs; how-ever, the multidrug-resistance genes harbored in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were still abundant in biochar-amended soil. This study suggests that converting manure to biochar as a soil amendment can help control the spread of manure ARGs.

AB  - Simple Summary Landscape structure may influence animal acoustic communication. Our playback experiments showed that the acoustic intensity and frequency of bird vocalizations differed between the upper and lower valley. Valley topography on acoustic communication could lead birds to avoid deep valleys. To investigate the effects of valley topography on the acoustic transmission of avian vocalisations, we carried out playback experiments in Daqinggou valley, Inner Mongolia, China. During the experiments, we recorded the vocalisations of five avian species, the large-billed crow (Corvus macrorhynchos Wagler, 1827), common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus Linnaeus, 1758), Eurasian magpie (Pica pica Linnaeus, 1758), Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus Linnaeus, 1758), and meadow bunting (Emberiza cioides Brand, 1843), at transmission distances of 30 m and 50 m in the upper and lower parts of the valley and analysed the intensity, the fundamental frequency (F0), and the first three formant frequencies (F1/F2/F3) of the sounds. We also investigated bird species diversity in the upper and lower valley. We found that: (1) at the distance of 30 m, there were significant differences in F0/F1/F2/F3 in Eurasian magpies, significant differences in F1/F2/F3 in the meadow bunting and Eurasian tree sparrow, and partially significant differences in sound frequency between the upper and lower valley in the other two species; (2) at the distance of 50 m, there were significant differences in F0/F1/F2/F3 in two avian species (large-billed crow and common cuckoo) between the upper and lower valley and partially significant differences in sound frequency between the upper and lower valley in the other three species; (2) there were significant differences in the acoustic intensities of crow, cuckoo, magpie, and bunting calls between the upper and lower valley. (3) Species number and richness were significantly higher in the upper valley than in the lower valley. We suggested that the structure of valley habitats may lead to the breakdown of acoustic signals and communication in birds to varying degrees. The effect of valley topography on acoustic communication could be one reason for animal species avoiding deep valleys.

AB  - Simple Summary As a zoonotic pathogen, the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is extensively distributed worldwide. Animal infections are typically asymptomatic, while human infections can result in both acute and chronic viral hepatitis. The transmission pathway is typically a fecal-oral one. Pigs are the primary host of HEV genotype 4 (HEV-4), which primarily causes sporadic infections in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate HEV infection in certain farms in Guangdong, China. Twenty-five pig farms provided 1568 blood samples, of which 902 (902/1568, 57.53%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG. Such a high serum positive rate indicates that pigs in Guangdong are widely exposed to HEV, which is a considerable public health and safety concern.Abstract The Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute and chronic Hepatitis E and is a global public health concern. HEV genotypes 3 (HEV-3) and 4 (HEV-4) are common to humans and animals, and domestic pigs and wild boars have been identified as the main reservoirs. However, limited information is available on the status of HEV infection in pigs, particularly in the Guangdong Province, China. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of HEV in pig farms within the Guangdong Province. A total of 1568 serum samples were collected from 25 farms and tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results revealed that 57.53% (902/1568) of serum samples from 24 farms (24/25, 96%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG antibodies. Year, season, region, and age were all linked risk factors for HEV in Guangdong, with season and region showing more significant impacts. The results showing a high seroprevalence of HEV confirmed its circulation among domestic pigs in the Guangdong Province, China. The presence of this antibody indicates that HEV infection was or is present on farms, posing a risk of zoonotic transmission of HEV from pigs to exposed workers and from pork or organs to consumption.

AB  - Although numerous studies have independently tested the roles of physiological integration and parental effects on the performance of clonal plant species, few have assessed them simultaneously. Moreover, the capacity for physiological integration differs greatly within species of clonal plants. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with eight genotypes of the clonal herb Hydrocotyle verticillata. In the first phase, we either severed or maintained the connections between the original proximal nodes (the basal portion) and the new distal nodes (the apical portion) of each genotype. In the second phase, the ramets in the apical portion produced in the first phase were selected and cultivated, and their connections were subjected to the same severance treatments. In the first phase, the negative effects of severance on the apical portion balanced the positive effects of severance on the basal portion, resulting in no net effect of severance on total mass, leaf mass, stem mass, and ramet number for the whole clone. In the second phase, the effects of parental severance on stem mass of the apical portion of H. verticillata varied among the eight genotypes. Additionally, the positive effect of physiological integration on offspring generations was greater in the apical portion and the whole clone of one genotype when the parental connections were intact than when they were severed, whereas it was greater in the apical portion of another genotype when the parental connections were severed than when they were intact. Our results suggest that clonal parental effects can influence the capacity for physiological integration of offspring generations and that these effects may differ among genotypes within a species.

AB  - Reproductive traits, such as ovulation rate and litter size, are important factors influencing the sheep industry. The bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) is a major gene affecting the reproductive traits in sheep, and multiple mutations in BMP15 gene could affect the ovulation rate and litter size in many sheep breeds, showing high breed specificity. However, identification of novel variations and seeking breed-specific markers associated with litter size in other sheep breeds are still important. In this study, we sequenced the BMP15 gene of Mongolia sheep, and 12 novel variants were detected by direct sequencing and whole-genome resequencing. Among them, the g.50985975 G > A polymorphism in intron and synonymous c.755 T > C (Leu252Pro) in exon 2 of BMP15 were significantly associated with the litter sizes of Mongolia ewes (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), as well as the g.50988478C > A and g.50987863G > A in the promoter region of BMP15 were significantly associated with the litter sizes of Ujimqin ewes (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The c.755 T > C mutation is predicted to change the tertiary structure of BMP15. Our findings may provide potentially useful genetic markers for increasing litter size in sheep.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Goat farming is concentrated in semi-arid and tropical regions in Brazil. From 2006 to 2017, the number of goats sold in the country increased by 65.7%. The dairy products from these animals present higher digestibility, high vitamin A and B content, hypoallergenicity, and less lactose compared to dairy products from cows, in addition to having a higher sales value. Since corn and soybean meal generate an expense for feed management, crude glycerin, originating from the manufacture of biodiesel, has been studied as an energy substitute. However, this product contains heavy metals, posing risks to animal and human health. Few data are available on trace elements in biological samples and products derived from goats' milk with the dietary introduction of glycerin. The objective was to quantify aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in the serum, urine, milk, and artisanal "coalho" cheese of dairy goats fed different levels of crude glycerin in feed management. In total, 16 Saanen goats were selected, lactating females, that were distributed in four Latin squares and randomly treated with different levels of crude glycerin (0, 5, 10, and 15%). After the end of each experiment cycle, serum, urine, milk, and artisanal "coalho" cheese samples were collected at the four moments. The samples were submitted to digestion assisted by microwave radiation. The multi-element analysis was carried out using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). There was no influence of crude glycerin levels replacing corn in serum, milk, urine, and artisanal "coalho" cheese. The serum concentration of the metals Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn; urine concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo, and Cr; and milk and artisanal "coalho" cheese concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Mn remained within the standards found in the literature. The inclusion of 5 to 15% of crude glycerin, derived from cotton oil, in the diets of dairy goats in partial replacement of corn, does not alter the concentration of essential and toxic metals in serum, urine, milk, and artisanal "coalho" cheese and does not, therefore, present a risk factor for intoxication.

KW  - China
AB  - Agricultural systems contribute nearly one-third of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and are an important source of GHGs globally. The clarification of the GHG emission pattern from agriculture is of paramount importance in the establishment of an agricultural emission reduction mechanism and the realization of China's dual-carbon target. Based on the life cycle assessment method (LCA), this paper comprehensively quantifies the greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural system in China, encompassing rice, wheat, and corn cultivation as well as animal husbandry including cows, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, and sheep. The analysis covers the period 2000-2020 and examines the spatial distribution, temporal trends, and structural changes in the greenhouse gas emissions within China's agriculture sector. The main results are as follows: (1) from 2000 to 2020, China witnessed a consistent upward trajectory in its total agricultural GHG emissions, exhibiting an average annual growth rate of 0.73%. Notably, methane (CH4) emissions emerged as the largest contributor, displaying an overall fluctuating pattern. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions demonstrated intermittent increases with a noteworthy annual growth rate of 3%, signifying the most rapid expansion within this context. Conversely, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions experienced decline over the specified period. (2) GHG emissions from cultivation demonstrate an upward trajectory, primarily driven by the CH4 emissions originating from rice cultivation and CO2 resulting from straw incineration. Conversely, GHG emissions stemming from animal husbandry declined, with the primary source being CH4 emissions arising from animal enteric fermentation. Agricultural N2O emissions predominantly arise due to manure management and nitrogen fertilizer application. (3) Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions exhibit significant variations in spatial distribution, gradually concentrating towards the North China Plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the northeast. Specifically, agricultural CH4 emissions are progressively concentrated in China's pivotal rice-growing regions, encompassing the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, as well as livestock breeding areas like Inner Mongolia. Agricultural CO2 emissions primarily concentrate in dryland crop production zones such as North China and Northeast China. Meanwhile, Agricultural N2O emissions predominantly occur in Inner Mongolia and the North China Plain. China's agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 show a significant spatial clustering effect, with hotspots primarily concentrated in Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and other regions and cold spots focused in the western and southern areas. The emission patterns of agricultural GHGs are closely intertwined with farming practices, regional development levels, and national policy; hence, tailored measures for emission reduction should be formulated based on specific crop types, livestock categories, agricultural production activities, and regional development characteristics.

AB  - The fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in full-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste (FW) and in the soil applied with biogas slurry has not been fully understood. In this study, 12 targeted ARGs and intI1 in FW, intermediate product, and biogas slurry from three full-scale AD were analyzed. The results showed that subcritical water pretreatment was an effective method for ARG attenuation, by which the absolute abundance of total targeted ARGs was removed by 99.69%. The predominant ARGs (ermB, tetM, and tetW) in FW were removed more than 99% after subcritical water pretreatment. The result of field experiments with biogas slurry as fertilizer showed that the absolute abundance of several ARGs (sul2, tetM, blaOXA-1, blaTEM) and intI1 accumulated significantly compared to the control group (CK) during three consecutive growth stages of the rice. The detected abundance of ARGs in paddy field soil increased from 190.50 (CK) to 8.87 x 10(4) copies/g (wet weight) (soil) during tillering stage, and increased from 4102.65 (CK) to 4.38 x 10(4) copies/g (wet weight) (soil) during heading time. Biogas slurry improved the soil nutrients (TN, AN, TP, and AP); meanwhile, the concentrations of total salt and Cl- increased. Network analysis indicated that 28 genera were the possible hosts of ARGs; variation partitioning analysis (VPA) indicated that microbial communities (contribution 59.30%) were the main factors that affected the fate of ARGs and intI1.

AB  - Food habits of eight insectivorous bat species from Puting Bato Cave Complex, Polillo Island, were examined. Fecal samples collected from eight species of cave-dwelling insectivorous bats contained culled fragments from seven prey taxa (six insect orders and one fish prey). Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera were the most consumed group in both percentage volume and percentage frequency. The diet of Hipposideros diadema, H. pygmaeus, Rhinolophus arcuatus, and R. philippinensis mostly concurs with previous studies but with varying proportions. Baseline information on the diets of H. coronatus, M. paululus, R. macrotis, and R. rufus is provided in this study.(c) 2023 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

AB  - Faecal contamination of freshwater and marine environments represents a significant risk for public health, recreational activity and food safety, and tools for evaluating complex multi-source contamination remain largely in the development phase. We evaluated the efficacy of the Fast Expectation Maximization (FEAST) microbial source tracking (MST) algorithm to apportion sources of faecal contamination among four mammalian species of interest in coastal waters in New Zealand. Using 16S ribosomal DNA metabarcoding of faecal samples from cows, fur seals, and sheep, as well as human wastewater, we aimed to differentiate and quantify the contribution of these sources in mixed faecal samples. Multivariate analysis confirmed significant differences in the microbial communities associated with each mammalian source, with specific bacterial classes indicative of different sources. The FEAST algorithm was tested using mixed DNA and mixed faecal samples, and we found that the algorithm correctly assigned the dominant source from all samples, but underestimated the dominant source's proportional contribution. This underestimation suggests the need for further refinement and validation to ensure accurate source apportionment in environmental samples where the faecal signal is likely to be a minor component. Despite these limitations, the findings of our study, in combination with the evidence from others who have tested the FEAST algorithm in environmental settings, indicates that it represents an advance on existing tools for microbial source tracking and may become a useful addition to the toolbox for environmental management.

AB  - Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of anthropogenic chemicals, which are not (fully) biode-gradable and accumulate in different environmental compartments worldwide. A comprehensive, quantitative analy-sis - consisting of target analysis (66 different analytes, including e. g. ultrashort-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), precursor compounds and novel substitutes) and the Total Oxidisable Precursor (TOP) assay (including triflu-oroacetic acid (TFA)) - were conducted to analyse the PFAS concentrations and patterns in 12 mammalian and two bird species from different areas of Germany and Denmark. The PFAS contamination was investigated in dependance of the trophic class (herbivores, omnivores, carnivores), ecological habitat (terrestrial, (semi-) aquatic) and body tissue (liver, musculature). PFAS concentrations were highest in carnivores, followed by omnivores and herbivores, with n-ary sumation PFAS concentration ranging from 1274 mu g/kg (Eurasian otter liver) to 22 mu g/kg (roe deer liver). TFA dominated in the herbivorous species, whereas perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and the long-chain PFCAs covered the majority of the PFAS contamination in carnivorous species. Besides trophic class, ecological habitat also affected the PFAS levels in the different species, with terrestrial herbivores and omnivores showing higher PFAS concentration than their aquatic counterparts, whereas for carnivores this relationship was reversed. The TOP assay analysis indicated similar trends, with the PFCA formation pattern differing significantly between the trophic classes. TFA was formed predom-inantly in herbivorous and omnivorous species, whereas in carnivorous species a broad spectrum of PFCAs (chain- length C2-C14) was formed. Musculature tissue of six species exhibited significantly lower PFAS concentrations than the respective liver tissue, but with similar PFAS patterns. The comprehensive approach applied in the present study showed, that primarily the trophic class is decisive for the PFAS concentration, as herbivores, omnivores and carni-vores clearly differed in their PFAS concentrations and patterns. Additionally, the TOP assay gave novel insights in the PFCA formation potential in biota samples.

AB  - Vaccination could be considered as an effective method for paratuberculosis control, although controversial, with a need for investigation in some aspects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of vaccination, depending on the age of the animals, on their immune response, the reduction of paratuberculosis cases, mortality and culled animals in a commercial dairy herd. Goats from three different ages were immunized with the inactivated Gudair (R) vaccine. Peripheral antibody and IFN-gamma output were evaluated for 21 months post-vaccination (mpv) and intradermal skin tests (IDSTs) for tuberculosis, with avian- and bovine-purified protein derivatives (PPD), were carried out at 6 and at 18 mpv to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune peripheral responses, respectively. The number of dead or culled animals, regardless of the reason, was also monitored and the causes of death determined by pathological examination. A significant increase in the production of IFN-gamma was observed in all the vaccinated groups when the blood samples were stimulated with avian PPD, from 3 mpv to 18 mpv, and with bovine PPD, between 3 and 21 mpv. Moreover, serum antibody levels increased between 3 and 21 mpv in all vaccinated groups. The highest levels were found in animals vaccinated at 5 months, and the lowest in adult individuals. No positive reactants to tuberculosis were found by intradermal skin test. No animal losses associated with clinical paratuberculosis were detected in any of the groups. The number of total culled animals was significantly lower in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated groups, especially on 1.5-month-old vaccinated kids. These results suggest that vaccination of paratuberculosis, especially in young animals, could induce heterologous protection.

AB  - Simple Summary: Pyridaben is an efficient, low-toxicity, broad-spectrum insecticide that impairs the predatory capabilities of predatory mites, but the specific mechanisms that affect the predatory functions remain underexplored. This study elucidated that pyridaben significantly diminished the predatory efficiency and searching behavior of the predatory mite Neoseiulus womersleyi. A gene linked to olfactive functions, NwNPC2a, was cloned from N. womersleyi. Post-treatment with pyridaben at LC30 and LC50 concentrations resulted in a substantial downregulation of NwNPC2a expression. Silencing NwNPC2a in N. womersleyi females led to significant reductions in predatory functions. The decrease in predatory performance at LC30 and LC50 concentrations was attributable to the suppression of NwNPC2a gene expression. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism through which pyridaben compromises the predatory function of N. womersleyi likely involves the downregulation of NwNPC2a expression. Pyridaben is a widely utilized, broad-spectrum contact acaricide, which has notable sublethal effects that impair the predatory capabilities of predatory mites, but the specific mechanisms that affect the predatory functions remain underexplored. When predatory mites hunt for prey, they may rely on Niemann-Pick-type C2 (NPC2) proteins to collect herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and other odor molecules to locate and pursue their prey. This study elucidated that pyridaben significantly diminished the predatory efficiency and searching behavior of the predatory mite Neoseiulus womersleyi. Key metrics, including predatory capacity (a/Th) and predation rate (a) on various developmental stages of Tetranychus urticae, were markedly reduced in treated mites compared to controls. The searching efficiency (S) also declined proportionally with the increased sublethal dose of pyridaben. A gene linked to olfactive functions, NwNPC2a, was cloned from N. womersleyi. Post-treatment with pyridaben at LC30 and LC50 concentrations resulted in a substantial downregulation of NwNPC2a expression by 60.15% and 58.63%, respectively. Silencing NwNPC2a in N. womersleyi females led to significant reductions in the attack rate (a), handling time (Th), predation efficiency (a/Th), and maximum predation rate (1/Th). The searching efficiency (S) was also lower than that of the control group, displaying a slight decline with the increasing prey density. The findings revealed that pyridaben exerted inhibitory effects on both the predatory function and searching efficiency of N. womersleyi populations. The decrease in predatory performance at LC30 and LC50 concentrations was attributable to the suppression of NwNPC2a gene expression. RNA interference (RNAi) studies corroborated that the NwNPC2a gene plays a critical role in the predation process of N. womersleyi. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism through which pyridaben compromises the predatory function of N. womersleyi likely involves the downregulation of NwNPC2a expression.

AB  - The development of the African swine fever epizootic in Russia is considered through the analysis of official information and literary sources. The weak effectiveness of measures to prevent the spread of infection in both domestic and wild populations has been confirmed. The continuing negative role of small producers in the spread of infection is shown. Regions with the most unfavorable situation have been identified, where outbreaks of infection have been occurring for a long time. The change in the nature of the course of the epizootic in the North Caucasus is shown. A dependence of the number of outbreaks on the density in the wild population was revealed. Emphasis is placed on the need to study the processes of natural disinfection of the territory after an outbreak. It has been proposed to ban regular depopulation of wild boar as a preventative measure due to its ineffectiveness.

AB  - Livestock manure is a main source of heavy metals, antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soils. The co-existence of heavy metals and ARGs needs to be systematically studied, since manure application is greatly encouraged. In this study, we examined soils for alterations in antibiotic resistance where doxycycline, Cu, and Zn were added equivalent to those found in typical pig manure applications. The results indicated that high levels of Cu inhibited soil respiration and urease for the first 10 days. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that Cu and Zn additions caused profound alterations in bacterial community, metal resistance genes (MRGs) and mobile genetic elements. Among the differential ARGs, efflux pump genes took a significantly high ratio compared with control for the first 5 days, emphasizing their important roles in the profile of antibiotic resistance. Moreover, the number of differential MRGs was < 30 for doxycycline treatment, but 66-87 for Cu and Zn treatments. The number of differential integrative and conjugative elements was 3 for doxycycline treatment, and 6-13 for Cu and Zn treatments. Overall, high Cu and Zn levels caused a greater influence than did doxycycline on bacterial communities and transfer of antibiotic resistance in soil.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) emissions from animal wastes are directly related to serious environmental problems and can be reduced by using gas-permeable membranes (GPMs) in animal housings, but not many studies have been conducted on the environmental impact of the entire system. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the environmental impacts caused by the implementation of GPM technology in a 920-animal swine farm with a closed cycle (i.e., birth, breeding, transition, and fattening take place on the same site), using life-cycle analysis (LCA). Two scenarios were studied: a reference scenario in which there was no NH3 reduction from the air captured in the sheds and a treatment scenario that used the GPM technology. The LCA results were evaluated by using the ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) V1.04 method, showing that using the GPM technology had beneficial environmental impacts. Terrestrial acidification (TA) showed a reduction of 14.68 kg SO2 eq compared with the reference scenario, whilst human carcinogenic toxicity (HCT), human non-carcinogenic toxicity (HnCT), and land use (LU) showed reductions of 1.52 kg 1,4-DCB, 66.26 kg 1,4-DCB, and 44.55 m(2)a crop eq, respectively.

AB  - Zoological institutions aim to continually improve the lives of the animals under their stewardship. To this end, bull elephants are now increasingly maintained in all-male groups to mimic social conditions observed in the wild. While cortisol is the most frequently used "stress" biomarker, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) as a measure of health and positive affect, and the social hormone, oxytocin, are increasingly viewed as additional markers of welfare. The introduction of a pair of bull elephants to an existing group of three bull elephants at Denver Zoo presented an opportunity to assess sIgA, oxytocin and cortisol in response to the socialization process. In this study, sIgA varied greatly between individuals and did not correlate with cortisol but did correlate with salivary oxytocin. sIgA and oxytocin concentrations differed the most between social and solo situations during the introduction period compared to before bulls were introduced, and after a stable group had been formed. In contrast to findings in some species, sIgA and oxytocin were higher when housed alone than socially. Nonetheless, these results suggest that sIgA and oxytocin may be involved in social engagement and establishment of new social dynamics, and thus provide more insight into overall welfare states.

AB  - The disposal of bamboo processing residues and spent tea leaves is an environmental concern, but their reuse as compost can be not only reduce the amount of waste, but can also convert the waste products into valuable resources that provide nutrients to crops and improve soil fertility. Combining bamboo, with its high C/N ratio, and tea leaves with high nitrogen content may produce high quality compost, but its effect on composting rate and nutrient content is unclear. This study evaluated the effect that co-composting of bamboo powder and tea leaves has on composting rate and quality. Three compost types were prepared: B100 (600 kg bamboo powder), B40 (240 kg bamboo powder and 360 kg tea leaves), and B20 (120 kg bamboo powder and 480 kg tea leaves), with two replicates each. The mixed materials were allowed to compost in an outdoor compost shed for 98 d. Peak composting temperatures occurred later for B40 and B20 than for B100, suggesting that the microbial activity of the co-composts may have been reduced during the early composting stage. However, the C/N ratio, NH4+/NO3- ratio, chemical oxygen demand (measured in hot water extracts), and juvenile plant growth experiments using komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. perviridis) revealed that the composting rate was higher in B20 than in B40 and B100. Additionally, at the end of the composting period, B20 had a C/N ratio of approximately 10 along with high total nitrogen and NO3--N content, indicating an improved compost quality for use as a fertilizer.

AB  - Adapting plants to sustainable cropping systems is a major challenge for facing climate change and promoting agroecological transition. Camelina sativa is an emerging oilseed crop species with climate-resilient properties that could be used in double-cropping systems, in particular as a summer catch crop. The availability of early-flowering camelina is essential in such cropping systems to allow full completion of the growth cycle during summer. Targeted induced gene variation (TIGV) was used in camelina on several flowering repressor genes identified in Arabidopsis to obtain early-flowering lines. Multiplex editing of 15 target genes representing FLOWERING LOCUS C, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1, TERMINAL FLOWER 1 and EARLY FLOWERING LOCUS 3 induced combinatorial mutations that were screened for early-flowering phenotypes. Certain mutants showing a stable early-flowering trait after five generations also presented additional phenotypes: determinate flowering, shorter stature and/or basal branching. Different combinations of mutations had a positive or negative impact on yield. This work demonstrates that efficient multiplex CRISPR is achievable in hexaploid plants like camelina, providing valuable genetic diversity for better selecting lines adapted to new cropping systems.

AB  - To locate herbivorous hosts, parasitoids use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are emitted by plants after herbivore attack. HIPVs may even provide information about host quality, such as whether hosts are infested with competing parasitoid larvae, allowing parasitoids to discriminate between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. However, although discrimination behaviour has been explored in controlled laboratory settings, its occurrence under field conditions remains uncertain. We conducted experiments under both controlled laboratory conditions and natural field conditions to investigate the preference of female Cotesia glomerata parasitoids for plants emitting HIPVs as defence induced by unparasitized cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, caterpillars or by P. brassicae caterpillars parasitized by conspecific or heterospecific parasitoids. In wind tunnel choice tests, C. glomerata preferred plants induced by caterpillars parasitized by the solitary parasitoid Hyposoter ebeninus over plants induced by unparasitized caterpillars. In contrast, plants induced by unparasitized caterpillars were preferred over those induced by caterpillars parasitized by conspecifics. Parasitoids did not discriminate between HIPVs when plants were damaged by Cotesia rubecula-parasitized caterpillars. In the field, caterpillars found on plants induced by H. ebeninus-parasitized caterpillars were less often parasitized than those on plants damaged by unparasitized caterpillars or those parasitized by C. glomerata or C. rubecula. Plant damage did not explain these results, suggesting that qualitative rather than quantitative differences in HIPVs support C. glomerata decision making, but we cannot rule out other simultaneously interacting factors involved in host acceptance at close range. Our study suggests that C. glomerata shows limited discrimination between parasitized and unparasitized hosts. Herein, we discuss the potential evolutionary factors that may be responsible for this behaviour and the importance of confirming laboratory results with field studies. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The use of tracking collars implemented with Global Positioning System (GPS) has allowed increasingly complex analyses of the movement and space use of tagged animals. Fundamental to these studies is the setting of parameters related to the technology itself. In this study we assessed the effect of the fix interval on certain ecological variables used to describe behavior, animal movement, home range size and habitat use through parameters such as path length, sinuosity, core area or minimum convex polygon. The aim of the study was to select the most reliable time interval in the study area in the northwest province of Jae & PRIME;n (Spain) for a subsequent use of the collars on wild ungulates. For this purpose, we designed and developed static and moving tests for evaluating 6 GNSS collars, one of them improved by using multi-costellation and multifrequency module, programmed with 5 different time intervals. The kinematic results suggest using caution when programming the collars since differences in the sampling interval leads to important differences in the real trajectories. Movement descriptors varied according to time interval, being longest and more winding with the shortest intervals. Similarly, home range approximations were closer to reality as more fixes were obtained. We progressively underestimated the use of the central core zone and the distance reached by the individual as we increased the time interval. However, there is a trade-off between time, autocorrelation and battery expenditure that is almost the only limiting factor. The experimental results show that a fixing interval of 30 min is an optimal and reliable value to studies focused on the estimation of path length or home range estimation. This value also involves a trade-off between high-resolution data and battery life.

AB  - Forest microclimatic variation can result in substantial temperature differences at local scales with concomitant impacts on plant defences and herbivory. Such microclimatic effects, however, may differ across abiotically contrasting sites depending on background environmental differences. To test these cross-scale effects shaping species ecological and evolutionary responses, we experimentally tested the effects of aboveground microhabitat warming on insect leaf herbivory and leaf defences (toughness, phenolic compounds) for saplings of sessile oak Quercus petraea across two abiotically contrasting sites spanning 9(degrees) latitude. We found higher levels of herbivory at the low-latitude site, but leaf traits showed mixed patterns across sites. Toughness and condensed tannins were higher at the high-latitude site, whereas hydrolysable tannins and hydroxycinnamic acids were higher at the low-latitude site. At the microhabitat scale, experimental warming increased herbivory, but did not affect any of the measured leaf traits. Condensed tannins were negatively correlated with herbivory, suggesting that they drive variation in leaf damage at both scales. Moreover, the effects of microhabitat warming on herbivory and leaf traits were consistent across sites, i.e. effects at the microhabitat scale play out similarly despite variation in factors acting at broader scales. These findings together suggest that herbivory responds to both microhabitat (warming) and broad-scale environmental factors, whereas leaf traits appear to respond more to environmental factors operating at broad scales (e.g. macroclimatic factors) than to warming at the microhabitat scale. In turn, leaf secondary chemistry (tannins) appears to drive both broad-scale and microhabitat-scale variation in herbivory. Further studies are needed using reciprocal transplants with more populations across a greater number of sites to tease apart plant plasticity from genetic differences contributing to leaf trait and associated herbivory responses across scales and, in doing so, better understand the potential for dynamics such as local adaptation and range expansion or contraction under shifting climatic regimes.

AB  - This work aimed to compare cleaner production alternatives for pig production in the Cuban context through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach emphasizing the utilization of food waste (FW) as a substitute for traditional grain -based pig feeding. A conventional waste management method (lagooning) was assessed, including more environmen-tally friendly approaches (use of anaerobic digestion (AD) process); including the substitution of a fraction of solid fod-der with food waste liquid fodder (LF), obtained from food waste. The analysis was based on one porcine equivalent livestock unit. The environmental impact categories assessed were global warming, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human car-cinogenic toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification, and freshwater eutrophication. The major environ-mental benefits for pig production were observed when the maximum capacity of pigs was considered. In addition, favorable environmental performance was achieved by considering the substitution of solid fodder by LF, the AD as a waste management process, and the valorization of the solid and liquid effluents. The avoided products-related ac-tivities were the main contributor to freshwater ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity impact categories (up to 71 %). The sensitivity analysis showed that the variation in LF composition (protein concen-tration) could have a remarkable impact in all impact categories. Climate change performed as the more sensible im-pact category, suggesting that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO2 and N2O, are important drivers to change the environmental impact and need more attention. This research demonstrates that the environmental profile of the process can be improved by applying a cleaner production approach (AD as a waste management alternative and LF substituting solid fodder).

AB  - Motion-activated cameras are widely used to monitor wildlife, offering a non-intrusive and cost-effective means to collect high volumes of data. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can expedite image processing, but automated species classifications can be too inaccurate to meet end-users' needs. This study evaluates how selection of data for model training influences AI detection of a focal species (desert bighorn sheep; Ovis canadensis nelsoni) across similar and novel locations. We compared two AI models: a species-specialist (deep_sheep) and a species-generalist (CameraTrapDetectoR), identified sources of bias, and retrained the specialist model using two datasets targeted toward biases associated with classification failure. Testing on 95,547 images from 36 water sources (5 novel) in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts revealed the specialist model outperformed the generalist by 21.44 % in accuracy and reduced false negatives by 45.18 %. The specialist model was retrained first on site-representative data, then on both site-representative and extreme image-condition data. Retraining iterations consecutively reduced the false negative rate (36.94 % -> 6.23 % -> 4.67 %) and improved reliability across sites at the cost of a reciprocal increase in false positive rate (2.87 % -> 15.22 % -> 23.97 %) and variation. The site-representative retraining had the highest overall accuracy. Accuracy at out-of-sample sites remained comparable to the full dataset, though minor performance declines were observed. We found that specifying an AI's training to single-species classification and conditions within specific environments produced robust classification accuracy at minimal data requirements. By narrowing objectives while ensuring adequate training data variety, we achieved 89.33 % accuracy with a small fraction of the training data required by similar performing models.

AB  - Trivalent chromium (Cr) is an essential trace element for humans and animals. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of chromium(III) yeast (CrYst) on growth performance, carcass characteristics, meat traits, antioxidant status, immune traits, and serum biochemical parameters of grow-finish pigs. A total of 72 commercial hybrid barrows (Duroc x Landrace x Large White) of approximately 50 kg body weight were allocated into two dietary treatments randomly, which received a corn-soybean meal basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 100 mg CrYst/kg. The trial duration was 11 weeks divided into three periods from body weights of 50-75 kg, 75-100 kg, and 100-110 kg, respectively. The results revealed that supplemental CrYst did not affect growth performance. Organic CrYst supplementation significantly decreased the backfat depth and increased the meat tenderness score and juiciness score values in pigs (P < 0.05), while other carcass traits and meat traits indexes were unaffected. CrYst addition significantly decreased serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content of pigs in the whole growth phase; significantly increased the serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reduced glutathione (GSH) in growing pigs; and also increased the serum IgG, IgM, and GSH concentrations in pigs during the finishing phase (P < 0.05). Additionally, diets supplemented with CrYst significantly decreased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) content in growing pigs and significantly increased the serum LDL-C level at the fattening period (P < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed for the other serum biochemical indexes compared to the control pigs. In conclusion, CrYst supplementation could reduce lipid peroxidation and backfat thickness and improve the meat tenderness and juiciness, immune traits, and antioxidant status of pigs.

AB  - The preparation of soilless medium for the growth of seeds based on macroporous scaffolds of chitosan-glutaric acid and urea (CHGAUR) is reported. The CHGAUR scaffold was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of chitosan with GA in presence of urea. The product was purified using Soxhlet extraction with methanol. CHGAUR was composed of chitosan with a small weight fraction of glutaric acid and urea, which were present in the salt form as confirmed by TGA and FT IR spectroscopy. This suggested that CH is most likely to be physically crosslinked in the scaffold through GAUR links. SEM images confirmed the porous structure of material. Water absorption studies suggested that CHGAUR could absorb similar to 4100-5700 % water and could be varied by varying the CH: UR ratio used in the preparation. The percentage porosity of CHGAUR did not vary much with urea content suggesting that significant variation in the micropore structure was not obtained by varying the urea content in the preparation. Mechanical tests revealed that material was soft and flexible and able to retain its original shape even after removing the load. CHGAUR, in purified state, was studied for the germination and seedling growth. Among the seeds investigated, pigeon pea showed the best result.

AB  - Non-glandular trichomes are essential in plant defence against herbivores and water loss. However, evolutionary pressures often favor the development of multifunctional traits, suggesting that trichomes may serve multiple ecological roles. I hypothesized that the stem trichomes of Anchusa officinalis may reduce the likelihood of climbing plants attaching to them, thereby limiting competition for pollinators, light, water, and nutrients. Field observations showed that the majority (96%) of Convolvulus arvensis, a common climbing weed that co-occurs with A. officinalis, did not coil its stems. Pot experiments supported these findings: C. arvensis coiled around A. officinalis less frequently, more slowly (measured as time to first coil), and less intensely (measured by the number of coils) compared to plants with artificial soft trichomes (wire rods with soft plastic bristles), wooden sticks, or A. officinalis with trichomes removed. In contrast, C. arvensis coiled around hard artificial trichomes at similarly low rates as it did around the A. officinalis treatment. While biochemical factors could potentially explain the reduced interaction, it seems less likely, given that the main function of non-glandular trichomes in this species is water conservation. This role typically does not involve the secretion of specific chemicals. I suggest that mechanical stress caused by trichomes may trigger internal signaling in C. arvensis, altering its climbing behavior through thigmotropic responses.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Despite the fact that fat-tailed sheep raised for meat production are well known for being resilient to harsh environmental conditions such as pasture scarcity or low-quality feedstuffs, no studies regarding feed restriction have been performed on fat-tailed dairy sheep. In this study, prepartum feed restriction from week -5 to week -1 relative to parturition did not affect body weight. Similarly, postpartum feed restriction from week 1 to week 5 relative to parturition did not affect body weight. However, both prepartum and postpartum feed restrictions affected blood metabolites and hormones, which decreased both colostrum and milk yields postpartum.
   This study aimed to investigate the effect of prepartum and postpartum feed restriction on body weight (BW), blood metabolites, and hormones as well as colostrum and milk yields and compositions in fat-tailed dairy sheep. In this study, 20 multiparous and pregnant ewes were randomly allocated to either the control (Ctrl; n = 10) or the feed-restricted (FR; n = 10) groups from week -5 to week 5 relative to parturition. Despite dry matter intake being decreased in the FR group compared to the Ctrl throughout both prepartum and postpartum periods, no differences in BW were detected between groups in any of the studied periods. Feed restriction increased both free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations during both prepartum and postpartum periods. Similarly, feed restriction increased triglyceride concentration postpartum. Additionally, feed restriction increased insulin and growth hormone and decreased prolactin concentrations during both prepartum and postpartum periods. Feed restriction caused a decreased colostrum yield and a relative increase of the main colostrum components in the FR group. Similarly, milk yield decreased in the FR group compared to the Ctrl group, although milk components were not affected. In conclusion, feed restriction did not affect BW but decreased colostrum and milk yield in fat-tailed dairy sheep.

AB  - Resilience is a key component of an animal's robustness in that failure to adapt to perturbations can result in inappropriate, detrimental responses to the production environment. Methodology used to identify pigs resilient to weaning stress could be applied in identification of pigs resilient to social stress and enable future selection and breeding of pigs, particularly gilts and sows, better suited to a group-housing environment allowing them to achieve their production potential. In this study, we introduced a novel phenotypic classification of resilience to weaning stress in gilt piglets using serum cortisol response pattern and assessed them for persistent behavioral differences during the grow-finish stage of production. At weaning (avg. 28d), 52 focal gilt piglets from 26 litters were designated as stress resilient (SR, n = 26) or stress vulnerable (SV, n = 26). At 8wk-of-age focal gilts were moved from nursery pens to grow-finish pens and mixed into new social cohorts. Skin wounds were counted 1d pre-, 1d post-, and 4d post-mixing. We found that SR gilts engaged in more agonistic interactions than SV gilts 1d post-mixing (p = 0.042), but this difference was not observed pre-mixing or 4d post-mixing. At 12wk-of-age focal gilts underwent a handling test and a novel object test (NOT), with tests spaced at least 2 days apart. No differences were observed in handling test scores or NOT latency measures. However, during NOT, SR gilts touched the object more (p = 0.029) and vocalized less (p = 0.037) compared to SV gilts. Overall, resilience to weaning stress was associated with behavioral differences in finishing gilts at mixing and when faced with novel situations.

AB  - In order to study the spatial distribution feature of mosquito vectors (vectors of Japanese B Encephalitis (JBE) and malaria) in the village house of Guangxi province, China. The Yuhuachang village, one key mosquito-borne disease surveillance site for mosquito-borne diseases of Guangxi province, was selected as the study site. Mosquito vectors abundance was firstly assessed by Chinese manufactured light-traps in twenty-five village houses in the study site. Then, 3S(GPS-RS-GIS) analysis was performed to do the environmental factors quantitative Analysis. Finally, spatial statistical analysis and generalized linear regression were applied to analyze the relationship of the spatial distribution of mosquito vectors with environmental factors, using SPSS and Geoda (095i). As the results showed, the distribution of both vectors was not spatially auto-correlated. Additionally, the number of pigsty and pig was positively correlated with the density of mosquito vector of JBE, and the area of mid-season rice was positively correlated with density of malaria vector. Thus, this study not only provides a field basis for the prevention of mosquito-borne disease as well as its vector in the study city but also provides useful guidance for the warning aide on JBE and malaria prevention in Guangxi province, China.

AB  - The effect mechanism of inorganic selenium on soil fertility has been effectively explained, but the effect of selenocysteine as organic selenium on the soil of Camellia oleifera Abel. forests has not been reported. In this study, the soil of a C. oleifera forests under natural conditions was taken as the control, and four treatments, namely selenocysteine (SeCys), cysteine + sodium selenite (Cys + Se), urea + sodium selenite (Ur + Se), and cysteine (Cys), were set up through a pot experiment to analyze the effects of different treatments on the physicochemical properties and biological characteristics of soil in C. oleifera forests. The results showed that SeCys significantly increased the soil total nitrogen content, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen contents compared with the treatment with inorganic selenium. In addition, the application of SeCys improved the activities of soil urease, soil acid phosphatase, soil nitrate reductase, and soil nitrite reductase on day 24 of culture, while under Cys + Se treatment, the activities of these four enzymes showed significant effects on day 32. The effect of SeCys on increasing the number of soil bacteria and fungi was significantly higher than that of other treatments and increased by 800% and 217%, respectively, compared with the control. SeCys also had significant effects on selenium and nitrogen content of Camellia oleifera seedlings. Correlation analysis showed that soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly correlated with soil enzyme activity, suggesting that SeCys could promote enzyme activity in C. oleifera forests by increasing the microbial number and improving microbial metabolism. The results indicated that SeCys could be used as an ingredient in new high-efficiency fertilizers.

AB  - To ensure soil quality and soil health, it is necessary to improve fertilization practices while minimizing environmental impacts. The aim of this study was to record the state of the art on soil fertility related to fertilization management (organic and/or mineral) and to detect environmental challenges in highly productive fields. A soil survey was set up in a new irrigated area (c. 20 years old), in the north-eastern part of Spain, which is mainly devoted to double annual crop rotations of cereals and maize. The area also supports an important animal rearing activity. The survey covered 733 ha of calcareous soils, owned by 35 farmers. At each farm, fertilization management was recorded, and soil was analyzed for nutrients and heavy metals. Multivariate analyses were performed. Total N, P, Cu and Zn, and available P, Cu, Zn and Mn soil concentrations were associated to the use of organic amendments. Heavy metals concentrations were below established thresholds. Available P (Olsen-P) was identified as an indicator of the previously adopted fertilization management and of the potential of P leaching towards deeper soil layers. Regression analyses were performed. A displacement of available P from the uppermost layer (0-0.3 m) occurs in the breakpoint of 86 mg P kg-1 soil. Preventative actions might be established from 53 mg P kg-1 soil due to the slowdown in P immobilization. Our results reinforce the importance of setting up P threshold soil levels for best practices of fertilization, as a basis for sustainable agriculture intensification.

Due to lack of a proper breeding plan and indiscriminate crossbreeding, the breed is under threat and its population is on a declining trend. Designing and implementation of a proper breeding plan necessitates the genetic characterization of the breed. Moreover, origin, evolution and phylogeography of the breed is still not well understood. Therefore, the present study deals with next generation sequencing based whole mitochondrial genome characterization of Andaman local goat and its evolutionary relationship with different goat breeds all over the world. The mitogenome was 16,640 bp in length containing 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA subunits (rRNAs) and a non-coding region. Nucleotide composition and AT-GC skewness indicated that the mitogenome had a biasedness towards A + T over G + C. Incomplete or truncated stop codon was detected in ND1, ND2, COX3, ND3 and ND4. Presence of 16 intergenic spacer regions of length ranging from1 bp to 7 bp and 8 overlapping regions ranging from 1 to 40 bp were also detected. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ALG is included under haplogroup or lineage A of Capra. Moreover, evolutionary analysis revealed that ALG formed a separate cluster and was phylogenetically close to some Chinese goat breeds and Jamnapari goat breed of Bangladesh. The findings of the study throw light on the evolution of the breed and will be vital for sketching a suitable breeding programme for the conservation of the breed.

AB  - The Optimal Defense Theory (ODT) postulates that reproductive structures should be more heavily defended because they contribute the most to a plant's fitness and have the highest probability of being attacked by herbivores. Ants can provide indirect defense to plants through their mutualistic interactions with hemipteran insects. In this well-studied interaction, ants provide protection to hemipterans against their natural enemies (e. g., predators and parasitic wasps) in exchange for the sugar-rich honeydew secreted by hemipterans. In turn, ants attending hemipterans can indirectly benefit plants by suppressing other harmful herbivores. Despite the numerous investigations of this ant-hemipteran mutualism, patterns of optimal allocation to indirect plant defenses mediated by this mutualistic interaction have not been previously investigated. In this study, we evaluated whether allocation to indirect plant defenses mediated by ant-hemipteran interactions and the effectiveness of such indirect defenses differ between vegetative branches (with only leaves) and reproductive branches (with leaves and inflorescences) of the tropical shrub Solanum lycocarpum. . For this, we selected plants with aggregations of the ant-tended hemipteran Enchenopa brasiliensis in both reproductive and vegetative branches. We then estimated indirect defenses (measured as the production of sugar in the plant sap and hemipteran honeydew, as well as ant attraction), and their effectiveness in terms of plant protection by ants (measured as the damage and survival of leaf-chewing herbivores). Supporting ODT predictions, we found that the sugar concentration in the plant sap, and consequently in hemipteran honeydew, was higher in reproductive than in vegetative branches. However, the increase in sugar concentration in hemipteran honeydew did not result in greater ant attraction to reproductive branches. Additionally, contrary to ODT predictions, we found that ants attending hemipterans did not enhance plant protection against leaf-chewing herbivores on reproductive branches. Overall, our study demonstrated that the patterns of allocation to indirect defenses mediated by ant-hemipteran interactions in S. lycocarpum plants did not support the predictions of the ODT.

AB  - Simple Summary YPEL3 plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression, however, its ability to regulate endometrial cell function and EMT during embryo implantation in ruminants remains unclear. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism by which YPEL3 regulates endometrial function in goats. We found that YPEL3 acts as a negative regulator of endometrial function via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways. These findings may provide a reference for improving conception rates in ruminants. In ruminants, the establishment of pregnancy requires a series of structural and functional changes in the endometrium under the action of hormones, thereby providing an optimal environment for the implantation of the embryo. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism by which YPEL3 regulates endometrial function during gestation in goats. We found YPEL3 expression was significantly downregulated during early gestation and that YPEL3 overexpression inhibited the expression of ISG15, but had no significant effects on the expression of RSAD2 and CXCL10 in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs). In addition, YPEL3 silencing significantly inhibited PGF(2 alpha) secretion and the expression of the prostaglandin synthesis-related rate-limiting enzyme-encoding genes PGFS and PTGES, with no significant effect on the expression of PTGS1 and PTGS2. Moreover, YPEL3 inhibited the expression of vimentin and beta-catenin and pretreatment of gEECs with the beta-catenin activator CHIR99021 prevented a YPEL3-induced decrease in vimentin expression. Collectively, our findings confirm that, as a hormone-regulated factor, YPEL3 regulates endometrial function by inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and provide new insights for further clarification of the mechanism by which YPEL3 functions during early pregnancy in ruminants.

AB  - Simple Summary Although the fact that ARNT may be related to sheep embryonic muscle growth and development has been clearly shown by our prior TMT proteomic study, its polymorphism, expression, and function remain unknown. Our goal was to thoroughly examine the association between the ARNT SNP loci and sheep growth traits, and elucidate the possible role of the ARNT gene in the formation and growth of sheep muscles. In this study, we evaluated the expression of the ARNT gene in the Hu, Chinese merino, and Gangba sheep, screened the polymorphism of the ARNT gene in the Hu and Ujimqin sheep populations, cloned the CDS sequence of the ARNT gene in the Hu sheep, and compared the CDS and protein sequences of the ARNT using bioinformatic analysis. The main results of our study showed an association between growth traits and sheep ARNT SNP loci, and a nonconservative missense point mutation G > C in the Hu and Ujimqin sheep, which is the primary factor that may regulate how the ARNT protein functions in the biology of sheep muscle growth and development. This work offers new and valuable insights into the mining of essential genes and identification of the molecular markers for sheep growth traits. Growth traits are influential factors that significantly affects the development of the sheep industry. A previous TMT proteomic analysis found that a key protein in the HIF signaling pathway, ARNT, may influence embryonic skeletal muscle growth and development in sheep. The purpose of this study was to better understand the association between the polymorphisms of ARNT and growth traits of sheep, and the potential function of ARNT. Real-time qPCR (qRT-PCR) of ARNT was carried out to compare its expression in different developmental stages of the muscle tissues and primary myoblasts in the Hu, Chinese merino, and Gangba sheep. The genetic variance of ARNT was detected using the Illumina Ovine SNP 50 K and 600 K BeadChip in the Hu and Ujimqin sheep populations, respectively. The CDS sequence of the ARNT gene was cloned in the Hu sheep using PCR technology. Finally, bioinformatic analytical methods were applied to characterize the genes and their hypothetical protein products. The qRT-PCR results showed that the ARNT gene was expressed significantly in the Chinese merino embryo after 85 gestation days (D85) (p < 0.05). Additionally, after the sheep were born, the expression of ARNT was significant at the weaning stage of the Hu sheep (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference in the Gangba sheep.In addition, six SNP loci were screened using 50 K and 600 K BeadChip. We found a significant association between rs413597480 A > G and the Hu sheep weight at weaning and backfat thickness in the 5-month-old sheep (p < 0.05), and four SNP loci (rs162298018 G > C, rs159644025 G > A, rs421351865 G > A, and rs401758103 A > G) were also associated with growth traits in the Ujimqin sheep (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we found that a G > C mutation at 1948 bp in the cloned ARNT CDS sequence of the Hu sheep was the same locus mutation as rs162298018 G > C identified using the 600 K BeadChip, which resulted in a nonconservative missense point mutation, leading to a change from proline to alanine and altering the number of DNA, protein-binding sites, and the alpha-helix of the ARNT protein. There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between rs162298018 G > C and rs159644025 G > A, and the ARNT protein was conserved among the goat, Hu sheep, and Texel sheep.
   And, we propose that a putative molecular marker for growth and development in sheep may be the G > C mutation at 1948 bp in the CDS region of the ARNT gene. Our study systematically analyzed the expression, structure, and function of the ARNT gene and its encoded proteins in sheep. This provides a basis for future studies of the regulatory mechanisms of the ARNT gene.

AB  - Black soldier fly (BSF) individuals can consume animal excrement and transform it into high-protein food that can be used for animals. This study investigated the changes in the levels of heavy metals (HMs) in BSF individuals and their growth related to ingesting pig manure. According to the trial findings, BSFs fed pig manure had the highest protein concentration of 21.98% and were the least expensive, and its HMs within an acceptable range. Tilapia grew the best when its feed contained half of BSF. Its single-tailed fish weight gain rate was 73.12%, and its survival rate was 100%. The total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) values of tilapia fed with various concentrations of BSF were 0.098-0.181, which were all <1. This indicated that there were no potential hazards posed to humans or the environment. This study offers fundamental information regarding the safety of BSF assessment as well as scientific backing for the widespread utilization of BSF, especially in the pig manure-BSF-tilapia food chain.

AB  - Different sources of biochar exhibit different effects on anaerobic fermentation. Here, the effects of activation temperature, activation time, impregnation ratio, and pickling times on the properties of pig bone-derived biochar additives were explored by orthogonal experiments. The pig bone-derived biochar with better performance was optimized to enhance the anaerobic fermentation. The results showed that when the preparation conditions of biochar were as follows: activation temperature of 700 degrees C, impregnation ratio of 2, activation time of 90 min, and pickling times of 2, the cumulative methane production of corn stalk by anaerobic fermentation exhibited the highest value of 164.54 mL/g VS, which was 68% higher than the control group. The correlation between the characteristics of biochar for promoting anaerobic fermentation and the performance of anaerobic fermentation was established. Interestingly, the pig bone-derived biochar can buffer pH value in straw anaerobic fermentation.

AB  - In brief Dietary phytoestrogens disrupt a specific stage of ram spermatogenesis, causing subtle decreases in sperm quality by affecting the expression of pathways involved in the structural integrity of the spermatozoa. This paper demonstrates for the first time that ram reproduction is compromised by oestrogenic pasture, whilst also providing a longitudinal model for the impact of phytoestrogens on male fertility.
   Abstract Compounds with oestrogen-like actions are now common in both the Western diet. The long-term impacts and underlying mechanisms by which oestrogenic compounds alter male reproduction, however, are unclear. To investigate this, we used a longitudinal sheep model examining the impact of oestrogenic pasture consumption on semen quality and production, testicular size, sexual behaviour and the seminal plasma proteome of Merino rams (n=20), over a full spermatogenic cycle and in the subsequent breeding season. Throughout the study period, sexual behaviour, sperm production and motility were similar between the exposed and non-exposed rams (P > 0.05). However, between 5 and 8 weeks of exposure to dietary phytoestrogens, rams produced a higher percentage of spermatozoa with a specific malformation of the sperm midpiece and reduced DNA integrity, compared to non-exposed rams (P < 0.001). Investigation into the seminal plasma proteome revealed 93 differentially expressed proteins between phytoestrogen-exposed and control rams (P < 0.05). Exposure to phytoestrogens increased the expression of proteins involved in cellular structure development, actin cytoskeleton reorganisation, regulation of cell function and decreased expression in those related to catabolic processes. The greatest fold changes were in proteins involved in the assembly of the sperm flagella, removal of cytoplasm, spermatid development and maintenance of DNA integrity. After returning to non-oestrogenic pasture, no differences in any measure were observed between treatment groups during the subsequent breeding season. We conclude that dietary phytoestrogens can transiently disrupt specific stages of ram spermatogenesis, causing subtle decreases in sperm quality by affecting the expression of pathways involved in the structural integrity of the spermatozoa.

AB  - Feral horses form relatively stable harems over time that are characterized by long-lasting bonds among their members, a characteristic that makes them an exceptional case of a social system among terrestrial ungulates. Their social system has been described as uniform despite the wide differences in their environment and demography. Horse populations subjected to human interference often show higher levels of population instability that can ultimately compromise their reproductive success. In this article, we describe demographic and dynamic changes of a Portuguese population of Garranos in Serra d'Arga (SA), which is impacted by human and predation pressures, over six breeding seasons. Furthermore, we tested several hypotheses related to the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the structure and dynamics of this population. Our results revealed that the SA population had relatively little human interference at the start of the project in 2016. This was supported by the natural composition of the herd (total number of individuals, 206), which consisted of several single- and multi-male harems (n = 17 and 7, respectively) and bachelor males (n = 9). However, from 2017 to 2021, SA's Garrano population suffered a drastic decline. Approximately two-thirds of the individuals and all bachelor males disappeared, and 76% of adult female transfers occurred after the death or disappearance of the harem male. Predatory pressures and poor management of the population, which allowed illegal human interference, contributed to this population crisis. A low population growth rate, reduced birth and foal survival rates, in addition to a delayed primiparous age were observed in this population and exacerbated after its drastic decline; suggesting the viability and survival of this Garrano population were compromised. Investigating the population demographic changes and their causes and consequences can provide guidelines for managing populations and help fight the extinction of horse breeds.

AB  - Camel livestock is an ancestral activity in Algeria; however, climate change has forced camel herders to modify their breeding practices to make them more sustainable. This study summarized livestock production practices, milk qualities, and the potential of camel livestock to preserve production ability under global warming. To collect data related to livestock farming practices, 10 camel herders were interviewed using a formal ques-tionnaire. Then, 15 milk samples (9 samples of raw milk and 6 samples that had undergone heat treatment) were collected in the region of Oued Souf in southeastern Algeria to carry out the physicochemical and bacteriological analysis. From 1990 to 2021, results showed severe drought accompanied by a significant increase in the annual average maximum temperature with a temporal slope of 0.04 degrees C year-1 and a significant decline in annual precipitation with a temporal slope of-0.07 mm year-1. A socio-demographic survey revealed a low educational level for camel herders. They owned small herd of camels (6.84 +/- 8.66 camels) in the transhumant and extensive system or > 150 heads in the nomadic and extensive system. The average daily milk production in the nomadic system was very low (<3 L/day); it was less important compared to that in the transhumant system (4-5 L/day), with an acceptable physicochemical quality but poor bacteriological quality.Given the susceptibility of the research area, we recorded that camel livestock and travel mobility were used as adaptation strategies to the effects of climate change. On the one hand, camel breed conservation programs can enhance biodiversity and a sustainable ecosystem. On the other side, a genetic improvement program that might boost productivity and profitability might be advantageous. Smallholders may benefit from this by receiving a fair and secure income and good working conditions, which could contribute significantly to social equity and local economies.

AB  - Conservation interventions for threatened species must be based on accurate assessments of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on habitat suitability. We used multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling to evaluate habitat suitability for an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in Shangyong Reserve, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. We investigated the scales at which measurements of environmental variables best reflected elephant habitat selection, and examined whether these responses changed over 2 decades (2000-2010 and 2011-2020) in response to 20 environmental variables, including 14 variables reflecting landscape fragmentation, the extent of buildings, and transport infrastructure. Elephant presence was sensitive to the scale of each variable, and the effects differed among variables within and between decades. More than half of the variables influenced elephant presence at coarse scales of 8 or 16 km, including 12 variables reflecting anthropogenic pressures in 2000-2010 and 10 in 2011-2020. Overall, multivariate models with variables at their optimal scales had higher discrimination than models at uniformly fine scales of 1 km or 2 km. The extent of suitable habitat for elephants declined by 24% over 2 decades. Less than half of elephant habitat was located within Shangyong Reserve (49% in 2000-2010, 40% in 2011-2020), indicating the importance of managing suitable habitat beyond reserve boundaries. Roads and buildings reduced the probability of elephant presence, with effects that extended beyond their immediate footprint. We advocate that infrastructure be planned with buffers, >= 8 km wide, between roads or buildings and core elephant habitat. Multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling should be employed to ensure that all suitable habitat for the remaining fragmented elephant populations in Yunnan is identified, mapped, and protected.

AB  - The combination of estrus synchronization and superovulation (SS) treatments causes alterations in ovarian and endometrial gene expression patterns, resulting in abnormal follicle and oocyte growth, fertilization, and embryo development. However, the impact of combined SS treatments on the transcriptome of the surviving embryos remains unidentified. In this study, we examined gene expression changes in day 6 blastocysts that survived a brief regimen of synchronization treatment combined with superovulation. The sows were included in one of three groups: SS7 group (n = 6), sows were administered Altrenogest (ALT) 7 days from the day of weaning and superovulated with eCG 24 h after the end of ALT treatment and hCG at the onset of estrus; SO group (n = 6), ALT nontreated sows were superovulated with eCG 24 h postweaning and hCG at the onset of estrus; control group (n = 6), weaned sows displaying natural estrus. Six days after insemination, the sows underwent a surgical intervention for embryo collection. Transcriptome analysis was performed on blastocyst-stage embryos with good morphology. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups were detected using one-way ANOVA with an un-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and a fold change </> 1.5. The effect of SO treatment on the number of altered pathways and DEGs within each pathway was minimal. Only four pathways were disrupted comprising only a total of four altered transcripts, which were not related to reproductive functions or embryonic development. On the other hand, the surviving blastocysts subjected to SS7 treatments exhibited moderate gene expression changes in terms of DEGs and fold changes, with seven pathways disrupted containing a total of 10 transcripts affected. In this case, the up-regulation of certain pathways, such as the metabolic pathway, with two up-regulated genes associated with reproductive functions, namely RDH10 and SPTLC2, may suggest suboptimal embryo quality, while the down-regulation of others, such as the glutathione metabolism pathway, with down-regulated genes related to cellular detoxification of reactive oxygen species, namely GSTK1 and GSTO1, could depress the embryos' response to oxidative stress, thereby impairing subsequent embryo development. The gene expression changes observed in the present study in SS7 embryos, along with previous reports indicating SS7 can negatively affect fertilization, embryo production, and reproductive tract gene expression, make its use in embryo transfer programs unrecommendable.

AB  - The study investigated the glycolysis pathway mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and the mechanism of its regulation. The results indicated that HIF-1 alpha expression initially increased before subsequently decreasing with aging time during postmortem (p <.01). Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hexokinase (HK) displayed a similar trend with aging time (p <.01) while pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK-1) increased gradually within the first 12 hr before decreasing at 24-120hr. However, after treatment with a HIF-1 alpha inhibitor, no significant differences were observed in the mitochondrial morphology. Furthermore, lactate content decreased, along with LDH, HK, and FOF1-ATP activities as well as GLUT-1 and PDK-1 expression (p <.01). The shear force for all groups also increased during postmortem aging (p < .01), with that of the controls being significantly higher compared with the treatment groups (p <.01). These findings confirmed that, after slaughter, the hypoxic environment within the muscles provided essential conditions for HIF-1 alpha expression, which, in turn, activated the glycolysis pathway by mediating changes in the activities of glycolytic enzymes and mitochondrial function. Moreover, in accelerating glycolysis rate, the expression of HIF-1 alpha further played a negative role in meat tenderization during postmortem aging. This, it was concluded that HIF-1 alpha expression plays a significant role in postmortem yak meat tenderization by regulating the glycolysis pathway.
   Pratical applications: While converting muscle into meat through hypoxic glycolysis during postmortem aging is undeniable, the biochemical mechanism of this process mediated remains quite obscure. However, the meat quality difference which impact muscle regulation mechanism during postmortem aging has not been reported. The study investigated the HIF-1 alpha played a major role in both the glycolytic pathway and as well as meat tenderness during the postmortem aging of yak meat. The glycolysis pathway is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), the mechanism of its regulation, and meat tenderness during the postmortem aging of yak meat.

AB  - Simple Summary The genetic mechanisms that regulate biological processes, such as skeletal muscle development and growth, or intramuscular fat deposition, have attracted great interest, given their impact on production traits and meat quality. In this sense, a comparison of the transcriptome of skeletal muscle between phenotypically different pig breeds, or along growth, could be useful to improve the understanding of the molecular processes underlying the differences in muscle metabolism and phenotypic traits, potentially driving the identification of causal genes, regulators and metabolic pathways involved in their variability. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of developmental stage, breed, and diet energy source on the genome-wide expression, meat quality traits, and tissue composition of biceps femoris muscle in growing pure Iberian and Duroc pigs. The study comprised 59 Iberian (IB) and 19 Duroc (DU) animals, who started the treatment at an average live weight (LW) of 19.9 kg. The animals were kept under identical management conditions and fed two diets with different energy sources (6% high oleic sunflower oil or carbohydrates). Twenty-nine IB animals were slaughtered after seven days of treatment at an average LW of 24.1 kg, and 30 IB animals plus all the DU animals were slaughtered after 47 days at an average LW of 50.7 kg. The main factors affecting the muscle transcriptome were age, with 1832 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and breed (1055 DEGs), while the effect of diet on the transcriptome was very small. The results indicated transcriptome changes along time in Iberian animals, being especially related to growth and tissue development, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, and cytoskeleton organization, with DEGs affecting relevant functions and biological pathways, such as myogenesis. The breed also affected functions related to muscle development and cytoskeleton organization, as well as functions related to solute transport and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Taking into account the results of the two main comparisons (age and breed effects), we can postulate that the Iberian breed is more precocious than the Duroc breed, regarding myogenesis and muscle development, in the studied growing stage.

AB  - Accumulation of secondary metabolites may exhibit developmentally regulated variation in different plant organs. Moreover, prevailing environmental conditions may interact with development-related variations in plant traits. In this study, we examined developmentally regulated variation in phenolic accumulation in the twigs of dioecious Populus tremula (L.) and how the effects of elevated temperature and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on growth and phenolics accumulation varied as the plants get older. In an open-field experiment, six female and six male genotypes were exposed to single and combined elevated temperature and UVB radiation treatments for three consecutive growing seasons. The concentrations of low molecular weight phenolics and condensed tannins did not show age-dependent variation in the twigs. In temperature-treated plants, diameter growth rate decreased, and concentration of condensed tannins increased as plants aged; there were no cumulative effects of elevated UVB radiation on growth and phenolic accumulation. Females maintained a higher concentration of low molecular weight phenolics throughout the experimental period; however, growth and phenolic concentration did not vary over time in females and males. Our results suggest that phenolic accumulation in perennial plants may not necessarily always exhibit age-dependent variation and the effects of elevated temperature on growth and phenolic may diminish as plants get older.

AB  - Studying plant-herbivore interactions within tropical rain forests is fundamental to understanding their ecology and evolution. An important aspect of plant-herbivore dynamics is the role of temporal and taxonomic variables in determining associations between herbivores and their host. Using the diverse and chemically rich plant family Annonaceae (Magnoliales), we conducted a year-long study in Ecuador's Yasun & iacute; National Park in lowland Amazonia. We focused on nine understory tree species across a broad phylogenetic range within Annonaceae. For these species, we investigated patterns of herbivory, identified herbivores through DNA barcoding, and documented unique ant-butterfly associations. In general, leaf damage ranged from 0.09% to 25%, with significant temporal fluctuations for three species. Notably, Anaxagorea brevipes and Unonopsis veneficiorum faced higher herbivore pressure when compared to the other studied species. We document a discreet but diverse herbivore community, with 40 larvae from 12 Lepidoptera families collected throughout the year. Our findings identify, for the first time across a phylogenetically diverse sampling of Annonaceae, the specialization of herbivores on our focal species. Overall, our data provide valuable information on herbivory patterns at the local scale for this important rain forest plant family. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of the ecological processes that influence plant species diversity in tropical rain forests.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

Un aspecto importante de la din & aacute;mica planta-herb & iacute;voro es el papel de las variables temporales y taxon & oacute;micas en la determinaci & oacute;n de las asociaciones entre los herb & iacute;voros y sus plantas hospederas. A trav & eacute;s del estudio de la familia Annonaceae (Magnoliales) que es diversa y presenta una qu & iacute;mica muy amplia, llevamos a cabo un estudio de un a & ntilde;o de duraci & oacute;n en el Parque Nacional Yasun & iacute; de Ecuador, en las tierras bajas de la Amazonia. Nos centramos en nueve especies pertenecientes a la familia Annonaceae, de sotobosque y de un amplio rango filogen & eacute;tico. Para estas especies investigamos patrones de herbivor & iacute;a, identificamos herb & iacute;voros y documentamos asociaciones & uacute;nicas de hormigas y larvas de mariposas. En general, se observ & oacute; que el da & ntilde;o en las hojas oscil & oacute; entre el 0.09% y el 25%, con fluctuaciones temporales significativas para tres especies. En particular, Anaxagorea brevipes y Unonopsis veneficiorum se enfrentaron a una mayor presi & oacute;n de herbivor & iacute;a en comparaci & oacute;n con las otras especies estudiadas. Documentamos una comunidad de herb & iacute;voros peque & ntilde;a pero diversa, con 40 larvas pertenecientes a 12 familias de lepid & oacute;pteros colectadas a lo largo del a & ntilde;o. Nuestros hallazgos identifican, por primera vez la especializaci & oacute;n de los herb & iacute;voros en las especies estudiadas en un muestreo filogen & eacute;ticamente diverso dentro de la familia. En general, nuestros datos proporcionan informaci & oacute;n valiosa sobre los patrones de herbivor & iacute;a a escala local para esta importante familia de plantas del boque h & uacute;medo tropical.

AB  - Simple Summary Inner Mongolia Albas white cashmere goat is a unique biological resource in Northwest China, and the cashmere produced by goat is sold well at home and abroad because of its softness and warmth. Cashmere is the product of the growth and development of secondary hair follicles, and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) are the seeds of hair follicle growth and development, which are regulated by a variety of factors in growth and development. At present, the regulation mechanism of Shh gene on DPCs of secondary hair follicles in cashmere goats is not clear. In this study, we found that Shh gene expression was significantly higher in anagen than in catagen and telogen in the secondary hair follicles of cashmere goats, and the proliferation and viability of DPCs after overexpressing Shh gene were increased, whereas the apoptosis of DPCs after interfering with Shh gene was elevated. In addition to this, we demonstrated that Shh gene promotes the expression of the related genes Ptched (Ptch), Smoothened (Smo), and GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (Gli2) in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Therefore, this study reveals that Shh regulates the genes related to the Hedgehog signaling pathway to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of dermal papilla cells, leading to the differential expression of the Shh gene in the secondary hair follicle growth cycle of cashmere goats. The result is of great significance for the study of the pathway regulation mechanism of secondary hair follicles in cashmere goat and provides a theoretical direction for the positive development of the cashmere industry.Abstract Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, playing an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the repair of damaged organisms. To further clarify the expression pattern of Shh gene in the secondary hair follicle growth cycle of cashmere goats and its mechanism of action on secondary hair follicle papilla cells, and improve cashmere quality, in this study, we took Inner Mongolia Albas white cashmere goats as the research objects and collected skin samples at different growth stages to obtain secondary hair follicles, detected Shh and its gene expression by RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and other techniques, while we also cultured DPCs in vitro. Shh gene overexpression and interference vectors were constructed, and the effects of Shh gene on the proliferation and apoptosis of DPCs were studied through cell transfection technology. The results showed that there are significant differences in Shh and its gene expression in the secondary hair follicle growth cycle skins of cashmere goats, with the highest expression level in anagen, followed by catagen, and the lowest expression level in telogen. Shh was mainly expressed in the inner root sheath, outer root sheath, and secondary hair follicle papilla. After the overexpression of Shh gene, the proliferation and vitality of the hair papilla cells were enhanced compared to the interference group. After Shh gene interference, the apoptosis rate of the cells increased, indicating that Shh gene can regulate downstream Ptch, Smo, and Gli2 gene expression to promote the proliferation of DPCs, and thus form its expression pattern in the secondary hair follicle growth cycle of cashmere goats.

AB  - Lead is a neurotoxic contaminant that exists widely in the environment. Although lead neurotoxicity has been found to be tightly linked to gut microbiota disturbance, the effect of host metabolic disorders caused by gut microbiota disturbance on lead neurotoxicity has not been investigated. In this work, the results of new object recognition tests and Morris water maze tests showed that chronic low-dose lead exposure caused learning and memory dysfunction in mice. The results of 16 S rRNA sequencing of cecal contents and fecal microbiota transplantation showed that the neurotoxicity of lead could be transmitted through gut microbiota. The results of untargeted metabolomics and bile acid targeted metabolism analysis showed that the serum bile acid metabolism profile of lead-exposed mice was significantly changed. In addition, supplementation with TUDCA or INT -777 significantly alleviated chronic lead exposure-induced learning and memory impairment, primarily through inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the hippocampus to relieve neuroinflammation. In conclusion, our findings suggested that dysregulation of host bile acid metabolism may be one of the mechanisms of lead-induced neurotoxicity, and supplementation of specific bile acids may be a possible therapeutic strategy for lead -induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions is imperative to achieve sustainable meat production and supply. Few previous studies have assessed the carbon emissions of the whole meat supply chain from the sheep fattening stage to the meat distribution stage. Therefore, this study established a boundary model of the carbon emission system of the mutton supply chain and adopted the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to comprehensively analyze the carbon emissions during breeding, transportation, processing, and distribution, and then assessed the overall carbon emissions, and optimized the route planning of the supply chain subsystems using improved genetic algorithms (GA) in order to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The results show (1) The fattening sheep process generates a relatively large share of carbon emissions, but the unit emissions are stable. The carbon emissions from the transportation and marketing phases are lower than those from the fattening phase, but their carbon emissions are uncertain, which is the focus of optimization. (2) By optimizing the routes of the subsystems in the life cycle analysis model, carbon emissions due to changes in route planning can be reduced by 24.19%. Therefore, life cycle analysis can comprehensively assess the carbon emissions and total carbon emissions of each link in the mutton supply chain, and the optimization strategy plays an important role in energy consumption and carbon emissions.

AB  - Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that transmit life-threatening pathogens to humans and animals. Only 10% of all identified tick species have been screened for different tick-borne pathogens. Hyalomma ticks are associated with a wide range of pathogens including Theileria species, Babesia species, Anaplasma species, Ehrlichia species, and Rickettsia species. Moreover, ticks of genus Hyalomma are vectors for the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a serious threat endemic in Pakistan. In Pakistan, different tick species have been found positive for rickettsial agents; however, Hyalomma kumari ticks have never been investigated for any potential pathogens. In this work, H. kumari ticks were collected from goats and sheep, and morphologically and molecularly identified using different genetic markers. The identified ticks were screened for rickettsial agents using genetic markers that resulted in the detection of Rickettsia conorii for the first time in this tick. A proper surveillance program should be designed to effectively avoid any zoonotic consequences associated with these rickettsial pathogens.As a vector of wide range of pathogenic agents, ticks pose health threats to wild and domestic animals, and humans. Information is unavailable about the prevalence and spatial survey of Hyalomma kumari ticks and associated Rickettsia spp. in Pakistan. Concerning this knowledge gap, the present study aimed to molecularly detect Rickettsia species associated with H. kumari infesting small ruminants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan. A total of 409 H. kumari ticks were collected from 163/295 infested hosts with an infestation rate of 55.25%. A total of 204 females, 158 males, and 47 nymphs were collected. Goats were heavily infested by 224 ticks having an infestation rate of 58.33% (98/168), whereas sheep were infested by 185 ticks having a lesser infestation rate of 51.18% (65/127). Genomic DNA extracted from ticks was used for the amplification of tick (cox I, 16S rRNA, ITS-2) species and Rickettsia (gltA, ompA, and ompB) partial genes. Eighty-three ticks were subjected to PCR, and 8/83 (9.6%) were found positive for rickettsial agents. The cox I and 16S rRNA sequences of H. kumari showed 98.90-99.74% identity with H. kumari sequences reported from Pakistan, and phylogenetically clustered to the corresponding species reported from Pakistan and India. The obtained rickettsial gltA, ompA, and ompB sequences showed 100% identity with Rickettsia sp. of the Rickettsia conorii reported from Pakistan. In the phylogenetic trees, rickettsial sequences clustered with uncharacterized Rickettsia sp. from Pakistan and R. conorii from Israel, Russia, South Africa, and India. The present molecular based detection of H. kumari-associated R. conorii will facilitate effective surveillance in the region.

AB  - BackgroundThe present study aimed to reveal scientific findings on goat milk as an instrument to combat food and nutrition insecurity, while considering the recurrent challenge posed by food dearth and high rise of hunger among susceptible people of numerous nations.ResultsA sum of 9206 research outputs were extracted in a BibTeX design for evaluation by means of bibliometric package in R studio software. The generated result included, but not restricted to authors, citations, affiliations, journals and key words. Published research findings on goat milk as related to nutrition security retrieved from web of science (WOS) and Scopus data bases were used with an increase in scientific findings of an annual growth of 14.42% during the period of study. From the result of the study, Spain was rated in first position with a total of publications (n = 953), and a massive global scientific influence with the highest article citations (n = 17,035). The most commonly referred authors' keywords in this research field were goat/s (n = 1605), milk (n = 920), dairy goat/s (n = 372), fatty acid/s (n = 307), cheese (n = 251), milk production (n = 220), milk consumption (n = 173), which all together gave a hint on associated research studies on goat milk and nutrition security.ConclusionsThe current study presented a global picture that covers the pool of scientific knowledge on goat milk research and its relevance in nutrition security, while giving a direction for more studies in this research area. It is of utmost importance to stress that the present findings only addressed prime areas of goat milk production as linked to nutrition security research, therefore, it is proposed that novel empirical study and potential research outcomes would give new understanding and insight on goat milk utilization as an avenue to tackle nutrition security issues as new findings emerges.

AB  - The present phylogeographic pattern of red deer in Eurasia is not only a result of the contraction of their distribution range into glacial refugia and postglacial expansion, but probably also an effect of replacement of some red deer s.l. mtDNA lineages by others during the last 50 000 years. To better recognize this process, we analysed 501 sequences of mtDNA cytochrome b, including 194 ancient and 75 contemporary samples newly obtained for this study. The inclusion of 161 radiocarbon-dated samples enabled us to study the phylogeny in a temporal context and conduct divergence-time estimation and molecular dating. Depending on methodology, our estimate of divergence between Cervus elaphus and Cervus canadensis varied considerably (370 000 or 1.37 million years BP, respectively). The divergence times of genetic lineages and haplogroups corresponded to large environmental changes associated with stadials and interstadials of the Late Pleistocene. Due to the climatic oscillations, the distribution of C. elaphus and C. canadensis fluctuated in north-south and east-west directions. Some haplotypes dated to pre-Last Glacial Maximum periods were not detected afterwards, representing possibly extinct populations.

AB  - Understanding the dietary composition of the Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) is critical for informing conservation efforts, particularly given the species' vulnerable status in the Republic of Korea and its limited ecological data. Previous dietary studies have relied on conventional methods with limitations in taxonomic precision, hindering comprehensive insights into their feeding ecology. To address this gap, we used Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 16 fecal samples collected in April from Gangwon Province, the habitat of M. moschiferus. Our results revealed 213 unique plant species, with Morus, Quercus, and Prunus accounting for the majority of the diet. Notably, nearly half of the identified genera, including Morus, Actinidia, and Viscum, were reported for the first time as dietary plants of M. moschiferus. This study confirms that M. moschiferus is a concentrate feeder that primarily relies on woody plants (98.8%) and may exhibit tree-climbing behavior to access parasitic shrubs like Viscum. These findings provide a foundation for future dietary analysis research and serve as valuable baseline data for the long-term conservation of M. moschiferus.

AB  - This study aim to compare the extraction yield, antioxidant potential, and chemical composition of Chaetoceros costatus extracted with acetone, ethanol, and hexane. The freeze-dried diatom biomass was extracted by ultrasonication for 1 h at 40 degrees C. The antioxidant capacity was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), while the chemical profiles of the extracts were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS). The ORAC assay showed a 27% higher activity of the acetone extract, while the DPPH assay showed almost 3-fold higher DPPH inhibition. Pigments, fatty acids, sterols, and their derivatives were identified in all extracts. The chemical composition of ethanolic and acetonic extracts did not differ significantly, and hexane yielded the fewest compounds. The results of this study will contribute to extraction challenges that limit biotechnological application and exploitation of diatoms.

AB  - Hangul (Cervus hanglu hanglu), the only red deer subspecies surviving in the Indian subcontinent, is of top conservation priority with global importance. Unfortunately, it has lost much of its historical distribution range, and it is now confined to Dachigam landscape within the Kashmir valley of India. The Government of India initiated a recovery plan in 2008 to augment their numbers through ex-situ conservation programs. However, it was necessary to identify potential hangul habitats in Kashmir valley for adopting landscape-level conservation planning for the species. Based on geometric aspects of reserve design, we modeled hangul habitat using an ensemble approach to identify hangul habitats. The present model indicates that the conifer and broadleaf mixed forests were the most suitable habitats. Only 9% of the total study landscape was found suitable for the species. We identified corridors among the suitable habitat blocks, which may be vital for the species' long-term genetic viability. We suggest reorganizing the existing management of Dachigam National Park (NP) following the landscape level and habitat block-level management planning based on the core principles of geometric reserve design. We recommend that the identified patch (PID-6) in the southern region of the landscape to be converted into a Conservation Reserve or merged with the Overa-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat patch PID-6 may be a stepping stone habitat and vital for maintaining the species landscape connectivity and metapopulation dynamics.

AB  - The theoretical concept of "climate-smart forestry" aims to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation to maintain and enhance forests' contributions to people and global agendas. We carried out two local transdisciplinary collaboration processes with the aim of developing local articulations of climate-smart forestry and to identify barriers, pathways and indicators to applying it in practice. During workshops in northern and southern Sweden, local stakeholders described how they would like forests to be managed, considering their past experiences, future visions and climate change. As a result, the stakeholders framed climate-smart forestry as active and diverse management towards multiple goals. They identified several conditions that could act both as barriers and pathways for its implementation in practice, such as value chains for forest products and services, local knowledge and experiences of different management alternatives, and the management of ungulates. Based on the workshop material, a total of 39 indicators for climate-smart forestry were identified, of which six were novel indicators adding to the existing literature. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding the local perspectives to promote climate-smart forestry practices across Europe. We also suggest how the concept of climate-smart forestry can be further developed, through the interplay between theory and practice.

AB  - The low production of domestic soybeans is due to the decreasing amount of productive land, so the cultivation of soybeans can be done by utilizing dry land. One type of dryland soil is grumusol soil, which is a less fertile soil and requires improvement through and applying biochar and organic fertilizers. Biochar is expected to increase water availability, thereby increasing nutrient absorption. The research was conducted by experiment with a randomized completed block design (RCBD) two-factor treatment. The treatments are biochar (without biochar as control, biochar of coconut shell, rice husk, and Strobilanthes cusia waste) and organic fertilizer (without fertilizer as control, chicken, cow, and goat manure). Each combination treatment, as an experiment unit, was replicated three times. The results showed that the types of biochar and organic fertilizer do not affect the growth and yield of soybeans. The application of types of biochar alone does not affect the soybean yield, but the various organic fertilizers alone can increase the yield of soybeans. Cow organic fertilizer was able to increase the total pods (31.68%), the number of seeds per plant (29.33%), and the stuffed pods (24.11%).

AB  - In rural areas of the Vietnamese Mekong delta, biogas digesters are applied as a potential solution to treat waste from pig rearing. Wastewater from biogas production typically contains a high level of nutrients, which requires appropriate techniques for removal. In order to contribute to making small-scale rural pig rearing in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta more sustainable, this study examines the uptake of inorganic nitrogen by water lettuce under lab scale conditions. Two treatments, including a control ( No water lettuce) and with water lettuce (8 plants # 112.6 +/- 0.5 g) were conducted in triplicate using plastic tanks (57 x 38 x 30,5 cm(3)). Each replicate contained 50 L of solutions (nominal concentration: 5 mgN/L NH4-N + 5 mgN/L NO3-N). The experiment was set up in a wet lab for 28 d. The environmental parameters of solution and plant weight were monitored every 7 days. The results showed that water lettuce could absorb both ammonium and nitrate, but ammonium uptake was preferential. With approximately 112 g of fresh biomass, over 28 days this biomass was approximately 4 times greater and removed at about 0.26 g nitrogen.

AB  - Limited options and high prices have limited the application of additives in composting. The effect of applying carbonate (SRC) and biochar (BC) to composting in a 100 L reactor was evaluated to determine the carbon and nitrogen losses. Three treatments were prepared in a 3:1 ratio of layer manure mixed with cereal chaff: CK (no additive), SRC and BC. These were composted for 30 days. The results showed that both carbonate and biochar increased the average temperature of the thermophilic phase of compost. There were no significant difference in organic matter degradation and nitrogen transformation between SRC and BC treatments. SRC and BC addition did not reduce the total carbon (TC) loss, but BC addition reduced CH4-C loss by 42.9% as compared to CK. In addition, BC reduced total nitrogen (TN) loss by 16.2%, and presented the lowest loss of NH3-N and N2O-N. SRC decreased the N2O-N loss by 33.3% as compared to CK, but the difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, the potential of carbonate in reducing nitrogen loss as a new composting additive is worthy of further research to explore, especially in N2O mitigation.

AB  - Organic waste (OW) reuse in agriculture is a common practice fostered by benefits in terms of waste recycling and crop production. However, OW amendments potentially affect the fate of pesticide spread on fields to protect the crops from pests and weeds. The influence of OW on the sorption, degradation, and leaching of pesticides is generally studied for each mechanism separately under artificial laboratory conditions. Our study aims at evaluating the balance of these mechanisms under more realistic conditions to clarify the influence of three common OW amendments on the fate, in soil, of the widely used herbicide S-Metolachlor. We performed leaching experiments in large undisturbed soil cores amended with raw sewage sludge, composted sludge, and digested pig slurry (digestate), respectively. We monitored S-Metolachlor and its two main metabolites MET-OA and MET-ESA in the leachates during a succession of 10 rainfall events over 126 days. We also quantified the remaining S-Metolachlor and metabolites in the soil at the end of the experiments. S-Metolachlor leaching didn't exceed 0.1% of the applied dose with or without OW amendment. Despite a soil organic carbon increase of 3 to 32%, OW amendments did not significantly affect the amount of S-Metolachlor that leached through the soil (0.01 to 0.1%) nor its transformation rate (6.0 to 8.6%). However, it affected the degradation pathways with an increase of MET-OA relative to MET-ESA formed after OW amendment (28 to 54%) compared to the controls (8%). Concentration of S- Metolachlor and metabolites in the leachates of all treatments greatly exceeded the regulatory limit for groundwater intended for human consumption in Europe. These high concentrations were probably the consequence of preferential macropore flow. Colloids had comparable levels in the leachates after S-Metolachlor application. Dissolved organic carbon was also comparable in the controls, digestate, and sludge treatments but was 65% higher in the compost-amended cores. These results, along with a great variability among replicates inherent to experiments performed under realistic conditions, partly explain the limited impact of OW on the transport of S-Metolachlor.

AB  - Azoles are one of the most widely used drugs to treat fungal infections. To further understand the fungal response to azoles, we analyzed the MAPK circuitry of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that operates under treatment with these antifungals. Imidazoles, and particularly clotrimazole, trigger deeper changes in MAPK phosphorylation than triazoles, involving a reduction in signaling through the mating pathway and the activation of the MAPKs Hog1 and Slt2 from the High-Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) and the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathways, respectively. Clotrimazole treatment leads to actin aggregation, mitochondrial alteration, and oxidative stress, which is essential not only for the activation of both MAPKs, but also for the appearance of a low-mobility form of Slt2 caused by additional phosphorylation to that occurring at the conserved TEY activation motif. Clotrimazole-induced ROS production and Slt2 phosphorylation are linked to Tpk3-mediated PKA activity. Resistance to clotrimazole depends on HOG and CWI-pathway-mediated stress responses. However, Pkc1 and other proteins acting upstream in the pathway are not critical for the activation of the Slt2 MAPK module, suggesting a novel rewiring of signaling through the CWI pathway. We further show that the strong impact of azole treatment on MAPK signaling is conserved in other yeast species.

AB  - Commercial harvests have been effectively employed to manage wildlife populations across the world. Although commercial harvesting of the nonnative, invasive axis deer (Axis axis) in Maui, Hawaii, occurs at small scales and only on private lands, there is potential for large-scale implementation to be used as a population management tool. To investigate local stakeholder interest in a hypothetical, large-scale commercial harvest of axis deer, we used an online survey of individuals and businesses in Maui to analyze their attitudes towards axis deer populations and management, their experiences with axis deer, and potential to utilize axis deer venison and products, as relevant. We found evidence of public support for commercial harvesting to be employed as one of the many tools available to manage axis deer populations. Additionally, we documented support on both the supply-side and demand-side for axis deer-derived products that may be available if large-scale commercialized harvesting were implemented. We leverage these results to contribute to conversations about commercial wildlife harvesting in the United States by challenging assumptions that the practice is inconsistent with the public's perceptions of the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and suggesting policies and programs that would ease axis deer commercial harvest growing pains.

AB  - . Human-wildlife conflicts resulting from the raiding of agricultural crops by elephants are among the major challenges affecting the conservation of this flagship species. Several studies have pointed at human activities, such as farming nearer to protected areas boundaries, as the main driver of these conflicts. Studies comparing the quality of food between agricultural crops and the natural vegetation in the elephants' natural habitats as the potential key driver of these conflicts, are almost non-existent. We tested if there were differences in the incidences of crop raids with distance of farming away from protected area boundaries. Further, we compared the food quality of agricultural crops to the natural vegetation in the mammals' habitat in and around Kasanka National Park in Zambia. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the incidences of crop raids relative to the distance of farming away from the protected area boundary. Further, the results show higher protein, energy, and moisture composition in the often-raided agricultural crops than the natural vegetation. However, the natural vegetation had higher ash, vitamin C, and fiber composition relative to agricultural crops. Broadly, our results suggest that the natural vegetation in the wild may not necessarily have all the key nutrients in adequate proportions to meet the body requirements of elephants. Therefore, elephants raid the crops to compensate this nutrient deficit, irrespective of how far the farms may be situated from the boundaries of protected areas.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a relationship between the microstructure and measurements of Egyptian buffalo hair and age. The buffalo studied ranged in age from young to premature to adult (3-8 months, 1.5-3, 4-6, and 8-10 years). The hair was collected from the animals' withers. Cuticle elements were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), light microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Hair shaft diameter increased with age, according to SEM and light microscopy measurements. The values of shaft diameter obtained by SEM of the same animal were 64%-67% of the values obtained by light microscopy due to shrinkage of the hair during the drying process. Additional microscopy measurements revealed that the width of the cortex and medulla increased with age, while the width of the cuticle decreased slightly. The medulla index of four different age groups ranged from 0.56 to 0.61 mu m. The average distance between successive scale values increased from 4.83 mu m in the young group to 8.86 mu m between the ages of 8 and 10 years. The scale pattern had a distinct personality at each stage of age. The hair medulla was in the center and consisted of a mesh-like structure with large pores divided into smaller pores by septa. The cortex was a bundle of fibers that wrapped around the medulla. Light microscopy revealed small oval granules and large streak-like granules in the cortex. EDX spectra revealed that carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen were shown to be more abundant in all age groups of buffalo. In buffalo hair, oxygen was the second most abundant element after carbon. The carbon mass in the examined samples decreased slightly with age (42.31%, 39.18%, 38.88%, and 38.49%), while oxygen increased with age. We concluded that hair measurements varied with age, scale microstructure, and elements, so we estimated buffalo animals' ages up to 10 years.

AB  - Sperm cells are of unique elongated structure and function, the development of which is tightly regulated by the existing proteins and the posttranslational modifications (PTM) of these proteins. Based on the phylogenetic relationships of various swine breeds, Yorkshire boar is believed to be distinctly different from Duroc boar. The comprehensive differential proteomics and phosphoproteomics profilings were performed on spermatozoa from both Yorkshire and Duroc boars. By both peptide and PTM peptide quantification followed by statistical analyses, 167 differentially expressed proteins were identified from 1,745 proteins, and 283 differentially expressed phosphopeptides corresponding to 102 unique differentially phosphorylated proteins were measured from 1,140 identified phosphopeptides derived from 363 phosphorylated proteins. The representative results were validated by Western blots. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that majority of differential expression proteins and differential phosphorylation proteins were primarily concerned with spermatogenesis, male gamete generation, sperm motility, energy metabolism, cilium morphogenesis, axonemal dynein complex assembly, sperm-egg recognition, and capacitation. Remarkably, axonemal dynein complex assembly related proteins, such as SMCP, SUN5, ODF1, AKAP3, and AKAP4 that play a key regulatory role in the sperm physiological functions, were significantly higher in Duroc spermatozoa than that of Yorkshire. Furthermore, phosphorylation of sperm-specific proteins, such as CABYR, ROPN1, CALM1, PRKAR2A, and PRKAR1A, participates in regulation of the boar sperm motility mainly through the cAMP/PKA signal pathway in different breeds, demonstrating that protein phosphorylation may be an important mechanism underlying the sperm diversity. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the 14 overlapped proteins between differential expression proteins and differential phosphorylation proteins potentially played a key role in sperm development and motility of the flagellum, including the proteins ODF1, SMCP, AKAP4, FSIP2, and SUN5. Taken together, these physiologically and functionally differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) may constitute the proteomic backgrounds between the two different boar breeds. The validation will be performed to delineate the roles of these PTM proteins as modulators of Yorkshire and Duroc boar spermatozoa.

AB  - Fujian province, an important tea-producing area in China, has abundant tea cultivars. To investigate the genetic relationships of tea plant cultivars in Fujian province and the characteristics of the tea plant varieties, a total of 70 tea cultivars from Fujian and other 12 provinces in China were subjected to restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). A total of 60,258,975 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were obtained. These 70 tea plant cultivars were divided into three groups based on analyzing the phylogenetic tree, principal component, and population structure. Selection pressure analysis indicated that nucleotide diversity was high in Southern China and genetically distinct from cultivars of Fujian tea plant cultivars, according to selection pressure analysis. The selected genes have significant enrichment in pathways associated with metabolism, photosynthesis, and respiration. There were ten characteristic volatiles screened by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical methods, among which the differences in the contents of methyl salicylate, 3-carene, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, (E)-4-hexen-1-ol, and 3-methylbutyraldehyde can be used as reference indicators of the geographical distribution of tea plants. Furthermore, a metabolome genome-wide association study (mGWAS) revealed that 438 candidate genes were related to the aroma metabolic pathway. Further analysis showed that 31 genes of all the selected genes were screened and revealed the reasons for the genetic differences in aroma among tea plant cultivars in Fujian and Southern China. These results reveal the genetic diversity in the Fujian tea plants as well as a theoretical basis for the conservation, development, and utilization of the Fujian highly aromatic tea plant cultivars.

AB  - Root exudation is involved in the recruitment of beneficial microorganisms by trophic relationships and/or signalling pathways. Among beneficial microorganisms, Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to improve plant growth and stress resistance. These interactions are of particular importance for species that do not interact with mycorrhizal fungi, such as rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz). However, heat stress is known to have a quantitative and qualitative impact on root exudation and could affect the interactions between plants and PGPR. We aimed to analyse the effects of PGPR inoculation on root morphology and exudation in rapeseed and camelina at the reproductive stage. The modulation of the effects of these interactions under heat stress was also investigated. The plants were inoculated twice at the reproductive stage with two different Pseudomonas species and were exposed to heat stress after the second inoculation. In non-stressing conditions, after bacterial inoculation, rapeseed and camelina exhibited two contrasting behaviours in C root allocation. While rapeseed plants seemed to suffer from the interactions with the bacteria, camelina plants appeared to control the relationship with the PGPR by modifying the composition of their root exudates. Under heat stress, the plant-PGPR interaction was unbalanced for rapeseed, for which the C allocation strategy is mainly driven by the C cost from the bacteria. Alternatively, camelina plants prioritized C allocation for their own above-ground development. This work opens up new perspectives for understanding plant-PGPR interactions, especially in an abiotic stress context.

AB  - Simple Summary Infections such as respiratory diseases pose major problems in pig production. We evaluated how these polymorphisms affect pattern recognition receptor genes, altering molecular function and reducing respiratory disease on two pig farms with different health conditions. Three polymorphisms were associated with respiratory disease severity, and they responded differently to two pneumonia pathogens, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, which showed different invasion levels on each farm. Likewise, the respective effects of each polymorphism were more pronounced on the different farms, depending on the severity of the symptoms. These findings demonstrate the possibility of using a combination of immune-gene-located DNA markers to reduce respiratory diseases caused by bacterial pathogens in pig breeding. Reduced productivity caused by infections, particularly respiratory diseases, is a serious problem in pig farming. We have previously reported polymorphisms in porcine pattern recognition receptor genes affecting molecular functions and demonstrated that the 2197A/C polymorphism in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene influences porcine circovirus 2-induced mortality. Here, we investigated how these polymorphisms affect respiratory disease-induced lesions, using samples from a slaughterhouse dealing with pigs from two farms. Lung lesions were evaluated using two scoring systems, Goodwin (GW) and slaughterhouse pleuritis evaluation system (SPES), to determine the influence of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App), respectively. SPES scores were significantly higher when the 1205T allele of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5-1205T), rather than TLR5-1205C, was present. On the farm with more severe Mhp invasion, lower GW lesion scores were significantly associated with the presence of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-2906G allele; where App invasion was worse, lower SPES scores were significantly associated with the presence of the NOD2-2197C allele. Combinations of polymorphisms in pattern recognition receptor genes can therefore be utilized for breeding for resistance against respiratory diseases in pigs. DNA markers of these polymorphisms can thus be used to improve productivity by reducing respiratory diseases due to bacterial pathogens in pig livestock.

AB  - Infant survival is a major determinant of individual fitness and constitutes a crucial factor in shaping species' ability to maintain viable populations in changing environments.1 Early adverse conditions, such as maternal loss, social isolation, and ecological hazards, have been associated with reduced rates of infant survivorship in wild primates.2-4 Agricultural landscapes increasingly replacing natural forest habitats may additionally threaten the survival of infants through exposure to novel predators,5 human -wildlife conflicts,6,7 or the use of harmful chemicals.8,9 Here, we investigated potential links between agricultural habitat use and high infant mortality in wild southern pig -tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) inhabiting a mosaic landscape of rainforest and oil palm plantation in Peninsular Malaysia. Longitudinal data revealed that 57% of all infants born during the study period (2014-2023) died before the age of 1 year, far exceeding mortality rates reported for other wild primates.10-14 Importantly, prolonged time spent in the plantation during infancy decreased the likelihood of infant survival by 3 -fold, likely caused by increased exposure to the threats inherent to this environment. Further, mortality risk was elevated for infants born to primiparous mothers and predicted by prolonged maternal interbirth intervals, suggesting potential long-term effects attributed to the uptake and/or accumulation of pesticides in mothers' bodies.15-17 Indeed, existing literature reports that pesticides may cross the placental barrier, thus impacting fetal development during pregnancy.18-20 Our findings emphasize the importance of minimizing anthropogenic threats to wildlife in agricultural landscapes by establishing environmentally friendly cultivation practices that can sustain wildlife populations in the long term.

AB  - Theories have been widely proposed and tested for impacts of soil nitrogen (N) on phytochemical defenses. Among the hundreds of distinct cardenolide toxins produced by milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), few contain N, yet these appear to be the most toxic against specialist herbivores. Because N- and non-N-cardenolides coexist in milkweed leaves and likely have distinct biosynthesis, they present an opportunity to address hypotheses about drivers of toxin expression. We tested effects of soil N and herbivore-damage on cardenolide profiles of two milkweed species differing in life-history strategies (Asclepias syriaca and A. curassavica), and the toxicity of their leaves. In particular leaf extracts were tested against the target enzymes (Na+/K+-ATPase extracted from neural tissue) from both monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) as well as less cardenolide-resistant queen butterflies, D. gilippus. Increasing soil N enhanced biomass of Asclepias syriaca but had weak effects on cardenolides, including causing a significant reduction in the N-cardenolide labriformin; feeding by monarch caterpillars strongly induced N-cardenolides (labriformin), its precursors, and total cardenolides. Conversely, soil N had little impact on A. curassavica biomass, but was the primary driver of increasing N-cardenolides (voruscharin, uscharin and their precursors); caterpillar induction was weak. Butterfly enzyme assays revealed damage-induced cardenolides substantially increased toxicity of both milkweeds to both butterflies, swamping out effects of soil N on cardenolide concentration and composition. Although these two milkweed species differentially responded to soil N with allocation to growth and specific cardenolides, leaf toxicity to butterfly Na+/K+-ATPases was primarily driven by herbivore-induced defense. Thus, both biotic and abiotic factors shape the composition of phytochemical defense expression, and their relative importance may be dictated by plant life-history differences.

AB  - The present study was carried out to determine the growth and survival rate, the environmental factors affecting these characteristics and the reproductive characteristics of Hair goats raised under farm conditions in the province of Adiyaman, Turkey, for the first time in the region, from birth to weaning (90 days). The birth weight data of 13,751 kids born to Hair goats raised in 48 different enterprises between 2016-2018 was acquired, and the weaning weight data of 12,855 kids were used in the study. As a general average over three years, the birth weight, 60-day live weight, weaning weight and daily live weight gain (DLWG) of the kids were 2.80 +/- 0.007, 11.34 +/- 0.041, 15.59 +/- 0.062 kg and 141.72 +/- 0.690 g, respectively. Among the environmental factors examined related to these characteristics, the effects of the dam's age, the enterprise, the year of birth, the gender and the birth type were found to be statistically significant (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.001). The average survival rate of kids in weaning was 93.48%. Aside from gender, the effect of the dam's age, year of birth and birth type on the survival rate was determined to be significant (p<0.001). In the study, litter size and twin birth rates were generally 1.10 and 8.71%, respectively. The results of this research, based on the above data, revealed Hair goat breeding to be sustainable and successful in the region.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that stressed plants employ epigenetic mechanisms to transmit acquired resistance traits to their progeny. However, the evolutionary and ecological significance of transgenerational induced resistance (t-IR) is poorly understood because a clear understanding of how parents interpret environmental cues in relation to the effectiveness, stability, and anticipated ecological costs of t-IR is lacking. Here, we have used a full factorial design to study the specificity, costs, and transgenerational stability of t-IR following exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to increasing stress intensities by a biotrophic pathogen, a necrotrophic pathogen, and salinity. We show that t-IR in response to infection by biotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens is effective against pathogens of the same lifestyle. This pathogen-mediated t-IR is associated with ecological costs, since progeny from biotroph-infected parents were more susceptible to both necrotrophic pathogens and salt stress, whereas progeny from necrotroph-infected parents were more susceptible to biotrophic pathogens. Hence, pathogen-mediated t-IR provides benefits when parents and progeny are in matched environments but is associated with costs that become apparent in mismatched environments. By contrast, soil salinity failed to mediate t-IR against salt stress in matched environments but caused non-specific t-IR against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens in mismatched environments. However, the ecological relevance of this non-specific t-IR response remains questionable as its induction was offset by major reproductive costs arising from dramatically reduced seed production and viability. Finally, we show that the costs and transgenerational stability of pathogen-mediated t-IR are proportional to disease pressure experienced by the parents, suggesting that plants use disease severity as an environmental proxy to adjust investment in t-IR.

AB  - Plants have evolved multiple defensive traits in response to herbivory; in turn, herbivore specialists evolved adaptive behaviours to avoid or tolerate such defences. Here, we employ milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) to test two defences, latex and trichomes, for their independent and interactive effects on behaviour and performance of monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus). Latex exuded upon damage and the density of leaf trichomes positively correlate across milkweed species, suggesting they may have evolved together as synergistic defences. Nonetheless, the complementary roles of these two traits have been little-studied. We focus on two behaviours: shaving, or the removal of trichomes, and chewing, which encompasses both deactivation of latex and leaf consumption. In an experiment with seven milkweed species, with and without manipulated latex flow, we found latex to be the primary determinant of reducing chewing, while both defences positively predicted shaving behaviour in the first instar. Next, we conducted a factorial experiment throughout the first three instars, manipulating latex and trichomes on a high-latex, high-trichome species, the woolly milkweed Asclepias vestita. On plants with latex and trichomes intact, caterpillars spent the most time shaving and least time chewing of all treatment groups, suggesting a possible synergism. These defence-driven behavioural effects decreased later in larval development. Latex and trichomes both impacted monarch performance, additively increasing mortality and reducing growth of survivors. Thus, latex and trichomes represent two important plant defences with effects on specialist herbivore behaviour and implications for insect fitness.

AB  - Granulosa cells (GCs) synthesize estrogens needed for follicular growth. However, the effects of androgen on estrogen production in buffalo GCs remain unclear. In this study, the impacts of testosterone on estrogen synthesis in buffalo GCs were examined. The results showed that testosterone that was added to cell medium at a concentration of 10-7 mol/L and applied to GCs for 48 or 72 h enhanced the estrogen synthesis of buffalo GCs. This study provides a theoretical basis for further exploration of ovarian endocrine mechanism for steroidogenesis.

AB  - Flooding is a major plant abiotic stress factor that is frequently experienced by plants simultaneously with other biotic stresses, including herbivory. How plant volatile emissions, which mediate interactions with a wide range of organisms, are influenced by flooding and by multiple co-occurring stress factors remains largely unexplored. Using Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (fall armyworm) as the insect pest and two maize (Zea mays, L. Poaceae) hybrids differentially marketed for conventional and organic production, we assessed the effects of flooding, herbivory, and both stress factors on the composition of blends of emitted volatiles. Headspace volatiles were collected from all treatment combinations seven days after flooding. We documented metrics indicative of biomass allocation to determine the effects of individual and combined stressors on plant growth. We also evaluated relationships between volatile emissions and indicators of soil chemical characteristics as influenced by treatment factors. Flooding and herbivory induced the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in similar ways on both maize hybrids, but the interaction of both stress factors produced significantly larger quantities of emitted volatiles. Thirty-eight volatile compounds were identified, including green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, an aldehyde, a benzoate ester, sesquiterpenes, a diterpene alcohol, and alkane hydrocarbons. The hybrid marketed for organic production was a stronger VOC emitter. As expected, plant biomass was detrimentally affected by flooding. Soil chemical properties were less responsive to the treatment factors. Taken together, the results suggest that flooding stress and the interactions of flooding and insect attack can shape the emission of plant volatiles and further influence insect-plant interactions.

AB  - Context Deer antler based active ingredients are known to have certain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, its potential hepatoprotective effect remains unclear. Objective This article reports the hepatoprotective effect of protein components in deer antler bases (R1) on lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (LPS/d-GalN)-induced acute liver injury (ALI) in mice, and explores its possible mechanism. Materials and methods The four separated and purified protein components of deer antler bases were screened and verified by the RAW264.7 cell inflammation model. In the in vivo experiment of LPS/d-GalN-induced ALI in mice, ALT, AST, SOD, CAT, GSH and MDA were detected. The liver histopathology was analysed, the COX-2 and iNOS proteins were analysed by immunohistochemistry, and 4-HNE was analysed by immunofluorescence staining. In addition, the effects on the MAPK pathway and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha pathway in liver proteins were explored. Results With isolated RA protein fraction pre-treated RAW264.7 cells, NO production decreased by 35.3% compared with the model group. The experimental results of ALI in mice induced by LPS/d-GalN show that R1 protein components can protect mice from ALI through anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects and reduce liver pathological damage in mice. The results also indicate that the R1 protein component may protect the liver by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK pathway and the NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha pathway induced by LPS/d-GalN. Conclusions The separated and purified R1 protein component of deer antler base has a good protective effect on LPS/d-GalN-induced liver injury, and may become a potential material for protecting against liver injury.

AB  - Simple Summary As the primary source of dietary energy, improving fat digestibility can have positive impacts on performance and profitability in pig production. Use of lysolecithin to improve fat and other nutrient digestibility may be able to increase the growth rate and efficiency of growing pigs. In the present study, a combination of lysolecithin, synthetic emulsifiers and monoglycerides was able to significantly increase nutrient and amino acid digestibility in growing pigs, driving significant increases in growth, efficiency and the economics of production. Two studies were conducted to determine the impact of an absorption enhancer containing a combination of lysophospholipids, monoglycerides and synthetic emulsifiers (LEX) on apparent ileal digestibility, metabolizable energy (ME), and growth performance of growing pigs. In the digestibility study, 12 male crossbred [Duroc x (Large White x Landrace)] pigs with an initial body weight (BW) of 30 kg were randomly allocated to two dietary treatments: (1) a positive control (PC) receiving standard diets formulated to 3100 kcal ME/kg, and (2) a negative control formulated with -100 kcal ME/kg and -2.5% AA content vs. PC and supplemented with LEX at 500 g/t. Apparent ileal digestibility of essential AA was significantly increased for lysine, methionine, threonine, histidine, isoleucine and phenylalanine in the LEX treatment (p < 0.05). Average uplift in AA digestibility as a percent of the PC was +1.88%; with greatest improvement for histidine (+4.22%). LEX supplementation effectively compensated energy deficiency of low-density diet and provided additional ME improvement compared to the PC diet (p < 0.05). A second study was conducted to evaluate LEX dose response on the growth performance of pigs fed a low nutrient density diet. Total 450 cross-bred pigs (240 males (castrated) and 210 females) [Duroc x (Large White x Landrace)] with an average initial BW of 7.19 kg were randomly allocated into 4 dietary treatments: (1) a positive control (PC) formulated with standard specifications, (2) a negative control formulated with -100 kcal ME/kg and -2.5% AA content vs. the PC (NC), (3) NC + LEX at 250 g/t (NC + 250) and (4) NC + LEX at 500 g/t (NC + 500). Results showed significant improvement with LEX supplementation on the final BW, average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of pigs of >50 kg body weight. Across the study, NC + 500 significantly increased ADG vs. PC and NC, and significantly reduced FCR compared to all other treatments. FCR of negative control diets improved by 9 and 15 points with the supplementation of 250 g/t and 500 g/t of LEX, respectively (p < 0.05). FCR in the NC + 250 diet was statistically similar vs. PC, which was significantly reduced compared to the NC. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the addition of an absorption enhancer containing a combination of lysophospholipids, monoglycerides and synthetic emulsifiers can improve growth performance in growing pigs, driven by increased nutrient digestibility and retention.

AB  - Simple Summary Meat goats are highly valued as excellent sources of lean dietary muscle-protein. However, the molecular mechanisms by which muscle cells and tissues are generated and the genes and signaling pathways regulating this process in meat goats are poorly understood. The present study applied currently conventional molecular-genetics methods and determined that the major isoform of the QKI gene drive the conversion of embryonic myoblast cells into mature muscle fiber and tissue. These genes activate other genetic factors and signaling pathways that are all implicated in the differentiation of muscle progenitor cells and the formation of mature, differentiated muscle tissue. Although future investigations will be necessary to elucidate the entire molecular mechanism involved, we believe that the discoveries reported herein will facilitate the genetic engineering of novel goat lines with enhanced musculature and, by extension, superior meat yield and quality, breeder profitability, and consumer satisfaction. The QKI genes encode RNA-binding proteins regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Goat QKI has six isoforms, but their roles in myogenesis are unclear. In this study, the six isoforms of the QKI gene were overexpressed in goat myoblast. Immunofluorescence, qPCR and Western blot were used to evaluate the effect of QKI on the differentiation of goat myoblast. An RNA-Seq was performed on the cells with the gain of the function from the major isoforms to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results show that six isoforms had different degrees of deletion in exons 6 and 7, and caused the appearance of different types of encoded amino acids. The expression levels of the QKI-1 and QKI-5 groups were upregulated in the biceps femoris and latissimus dorsi muscle tissues compared with those of the QKI-4, QKI-7, QKI-3 and QKI-6 groups. After 6 d of myoblast differentiation, QKI-5 and the myogenic differentiators MyoG, MyoD, and MyHC were upregulated. Compared to the negative control group, QKI promoted myotube differentiation and the myoblasts overexpressing QKI-5 formed large, abundant myotubes. In summary, we identified that the overexpression of the QKI gene promotes goat-myoblast differentiation and that QKI-5 is the major isoform, with a key role. The RNA-Seq screened 76 upregulated and 123 downregulated DEGs between the negative control and the QKI-5-overexpressing goat myoblasts after d 6 of differentiation. The GO and KEGG analyses associated the downregulated DEGs with muscle-related biological functions. Only the pathways related to muscle growth and development were enriched. This study provides a theoretical basis for further exploring the regulatory mechanism of QKI in skeletal-muscle development in goats.

AB  - Identifying how populations living in landscapes at the forefront of climate change observe and interpret ecological shifts offers critical insights into communication and motivation regarding environmental change and broader climate adaptation. The use of scientific indicators to monitor local change often relies on quantitative methodologies that do not necessarily reflect how varied individuals within a landscape measure and document change. As a result, there is a need to better understand how individuals and interest groups across shared landscapes track climate change impacts at the local level. We conducted 43 semi-structured interviews with residents and professionals living and working in and around the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, AZ, shortly after the 2020 Bighorn Fire to address this research gap. Specific biota emerged as socially defined "indicators" for monitoring environmental change and related processes. Selection and use of these indicators, including saguaro cacti and bighorn sheep, were embedded within varied place-based understandings in the Catalinas. We propose that the use of locally valued species for socially tracking longitudinal environmental change may benefit from the use of the term "charismatic indicators." Charismatic indicators may vary across landscapes and place-based understandings and merit further exploration. We conclude with insights and guidance for the potential identification and use of charismatic indicators of environmental change in both research and management.

AB  - Chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits psychological abnormalities during fear memory processing in rodent models. To simulate long-term impaired fear extinction in PTSD patients, we constructed a seven-day model with multiple prolonged stress (MPS) by modifying manipulation repetitions, intensity, and unpredictability of stressors. Behavioral and neural changes following MPS conveyed longitudinal PTSD-like effects in rats for 6 weeks. Extended fear memory was estimated through fear retrieval induced-freezing behavior and increased long-term serum corticosterone concentrations after MPS manipulation. Additionally, memory retrieval and behavioral anxiety tasks continued enhancing theta oscillation activity in the prefrontal cortex-basal lateral amygdala-ventral hippocampus pathway for an extended period. Moreover, MPS and remote fear retrieval stimuli disrupted sleep-wake activities to consolidate fear memory. Our prolonged fear memory, neuronal connectivity, anxiety, and sleep alteration results demonstrated integrated chronic PTSD symptoms in an MPS-induced rodent model.
   A prolonged stress rat model is presented, which is shown to result in some PTSD-like symptoms such as alterations in sleep pattern and neuronal connectivity.

AB  - Knowledge gaps exist on the feeding pattern and host range of bluetongue virus vectors, Culicoides species, associated with livestock in India. Adult midges were trapped with ultraviolet light traps at 13 household farms adjacent to human biotope. Host DNA was isolated from individual females (n = 101; blood engorged-82, gravid-4 and parous-15) and subjected to PCR amplification targeting CytB and 16S rRNA gene fragments followed by sequencing of amplified DNA samples. However, DNA sequences from only 71 individuals (70.3%) comprising of 10 Culicoides species were obtained. Blood meal analysis revealed at least 10 species that fed on five mammalian hosts including humans, but surprisingly none tested positive for birds. Results revealed that Culicoides innoxius tested positive for four not previously recognized species indicating a potential role as a vector species. Likewise, Culicoides shortti and Culicoides hegneri preferred goat and cattle respectively as hosts, whereas Culicoides palpifer preferred cattle along with buffalo as hosts, which is being reported for the first time. This is the first document on DNA-based blood meal identification and feeding preference of Culicoides midges associated with livestock in India.

AB  - Since embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were first identified, significant progress has been achieved. However, the establishment of buffalo ESCs (bESCs) is still unclear. This study was undertaken to explore the effect of the blastocyst stage on the isolation of bESCs. Firstly, our results indicated that the pluripotent genes were mainly expressed at the early stages of blastocyst, and the attachment and colony formation rates of bESCs derived from expanded blastocyst and hatched blastocyst were significantly higher than early blastocyst and blastocyst. In the meantime, bESCs showed positive alkaline phosphatase activity and expressed genes like OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, CDH1, KLF4, and TBX3. Immunofluorescence also confirmed the expression of OCT4, SOX2. Embryoid bodies expressing three marker genes were generated from the differentiation experiment, and fibroblast, epithelial, and neuron-like cells were induced. Moreover, naive-related genes KLF4, TBX3, primed-related genes FGF5, ACTA2 were expressed in the cells, but not REX-1. Immunofluorescence and western blot confirmed the FGF5 expression. Furthermore, bESCs could maintain pluripotency with the signal of LIF and bFGF. In summary, our results indicated that expanded blastocyst and hatched blastocyst are more suitable for bESCs isolation.

AB  - The impact of World War II on the physical landscape of British towns and cities as a result of airborne assault is well known. However, less newsworthy but arguably no less significant is the impact of the war on agriculture and the countryside, especially in South-East England. This paper outlines the building of an historical Geographical Information System (GIS) from different data sources including the National Farm Survey (NFS), Luftwaffe and Royal Air Force (RAF) aerial photographs and basic topographic mapping for the South Downs in East and West Sussex. It explores the impact and legacy of World War II on the agricultural landscape of this area through both the 'plough-up' campaigns aimed at increasing agricultural production and the occupation of farm land for military training purposes. Farms surrounding an area where extensive tracts of land were taken over for military training and defensive purposes on the Downs close to Brighton and the county town of Lewes in East Sussex are the focus of attention illuminating the beneficial and disruptive impacts of the government's drive to increase food output by bringing land into more productive use by means of a 'plough-up' campaign and using formerly agricultural land for military training. These changes contributed to the transformation of the region into "an arable monoculture" and the virtual disappearance of traditional sheep rearing in the post-war decades.

AB  - The postrhinal cortex (POR), the rodent homologue of the primate parahippocampal cortex (PHC), has been implicated in contextual and spatial processing. For instance, prior studies have demonstrated that permanent lesions of POR impair contextual fear conditioning. In contrast, permanent lesions of POR, specifically prior to training, do not impact auditory fear conditioning. In the current experiments, we examined the role of POR in the expression of auditory fear conditioning by using chemogenetics to silence neural activity in POR at the time of retrieval testing. Considering that extinction is context-dependent, and POR contributes to contextual memory, we hypothesized that POR would be necessary for expression of auditory fear conditioning following extinction. We found that POR inactivation during retrieval impaired freezing to an auditory cue that was tested in the conditioning context (A) after it had been extinguished in a different context (B). However, the involvement of POR was not specific to extinction. POR inactivation also impaired freezing to an auditory fear cue that had not undergone extinction. Thus, while prior studies have identified a role for POR in contextual fear conditioning, the current findings extend the functional role of POR to include the expression of auditory fear conditioning.

AB  - Deep-sea habitats are currently recognized as a hot spot for mercury (Hg) accumulation from anthropogenic sources, resulting in elevated concentrations of total mercury (THg) in deep-sea megafauna. Among them, deepsea sharks (Class Chondrichthyes) are characterized by high trophic position and extended longevity and are, therefore, at high risk for mercury contamination. Despite this, sharks are overexploited by fishing activity in increasingly deeper water, worldwide, imposing health risks to human consumption. While it is imperative to better understand long-term mercury contamination in deep-sea megafauna, few historical data sets exist to capture this process. Here we explore four decades (1985-2022) of THg accumulation in five species of deep-sea sharks ( G. melastomus, E. spinax, S. rostratus, C. granulosus, and D. licha) ) of the ultra-oligotrophic Southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS) sampled during 19 research cruises. We exhibited exceptionally high THg levels (per length/weight), the highest as 16.6 mu g g(-1) (wet wt.), almost entirely (98.9 %; n = 298 specimens) exceeding the limit for safe consumption (0.3-0.5 mu g THg g(-1) wet wt.). The maximal THg levels of the long-lived species D. licha and C. granulosus in the SEMS were enriched by a factor of similar to 7 and >10 compared to counterpart species from other oceanic areas, respectively. We attribute this to the ultra-oligotrophic conditions of the SEMS, which cause slower growth rates and dwarfism in deep-sea sharks, resulting in an extended exposure time to mercury contamination. In the long-lived species, C. granulosus and D. licha, a temporal increase of average THg levels of similar to 80 % was recorded between 1987-1999 and 2021-2022. This likely reflects the long-term accumulation of historical anthropogenic Hg in deep-sea environments, which is further amplified in marginal seas such as the Mediterranean, impacted by global air pollution crossroads and surrounded by land-based pollution sources. Future consumption of products from deep-sea sharks is potentially high risk to human health.

AB  - Simple Summary With the rapid development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, people need to rear a lot of livestock to meet demand for proteins. This also involves an increase in the production of livestock manure. The expanding rate of livestock manure has become a thorny issue, owing to characteristics such as plentiful nitrogen and abundant zoonotic pathogens. The saprophagous larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF) are often associated with animal manure and can significantly reduce the populations of different zoonotic pathogens in livestock manure. However, reports about the mechanisms of this phenomenon are scarce. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms of BSF larvae in reducing the zoonotic pathogens naturally found in pig manure. The results clearly showed that zoonotic pathogens in pig manure were significantly decreased after being treated with BSF larvae, and also suggested that the antimicrobial peptides produced by the BSF larvae and gut-associated bacteria are able to antagonize the zoonotic pathogens. This study will contribute to reveal the potential antagonistic mechanisms of BSF larvae against zoonotic pathogens and improve the safety of organic waste conversion by BSF larvae. Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae are often exposed to organic waste which harbors abundant zoonotic pathogens. We investigated the ability of BSF larvae to inhibit the zoonotic pathogens naturally found in pig manure. The zoonotic pathogens populations were detected by using selective medium during the conversion. Results showed that the viability of the zoonotic pathogens in pig manure was significantly affected. After eight days of conversion, the Coliform populations were undetected, and Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. decreased significantly on the eighth day. Antimicrobial assays of the purified recombinant defensin-like peptide 4 (DLP4) showed that this peptide exhibits inhibitory activity against S. aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and Escherichia coli in vitro. Bacteria BSF-CL and BSF-F were isolated from the larvae gut, and both inhibited the growth of S. aureus and E. coli, but Salmonella spp. was sensitive to the BSF-CL strain (but not to the BSF-F strain). The results from our experiments indicate that BSF larvae are capable of functionally inhibiting potential zoonotic pathogens in pig manure through a variety of mechanisms including antimicrobial peptides expression and the gut associate microorganisms. This study provides a theoretical basis for further study on the combined mechanism of BSF larvae immunity and its gut microbes against the zoonotic pathogens in pig manure.

AB  - Despite the fact that they are sessile organisms, plants actively move their organs and also use these movements to manipulate the surrounding biotic and abiotic environments. Plants maintain communication with neighboring plants, herbivores, and predators through the emission of diverse chemical compounds by their shoots and roots. These infochemicals modify the environment occupied by plants. Moreover, some infochemicals may induce morphophysiological changes of neighboring plants. We have used methyl-jasmonate (MeJa), a plant natural infochemical, to trigger communication between emitters and receivers Sorghum bicolor plants. The split roots of two plants were allocated to three different pots, with the middle pot containing the roots of both plants. We scored low stomatal conductance (g(S)) and low CO2 net assimilation (A) using the plants that had contact with the infochemical for the first time. During the second contact, these parameters showed no significant differences, indicating a memory effect. We also observed that the plants that had direct leaf contact with MeJa transmitted sensory information through their roots to neighboring plants. This resulted in higher maximum fluorescence (F-M) and structural changes in root anatomy. In conclusion, MeJa emerges as possible trigger for communication between neighboring sorghum plants, in response to the environmental challenges.

AB  - Jeryak is the F1 generation of the cross between Gannan yak and Jersey cattle, which has the advantages of fast growth and high adaptability. The growth and development of skeletal muscle is closely linked to meat production and the quality of meat. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of muscle growth differences between Gannan yak and Jeryak analyzed from the perspective of chromatin opening have not been reported. In this study, ATAC-seq was used to analyze the difference of chromatin openness in longissimus muscle of Gannan yak and Jeryak. It was found that chromatin accessibility was more enriched in Jeryak compared to Gannan yak, especially in the range of the transcription start site (TSS) +/- 2 kb. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicate that differential peak-associated genes are involved in the negative regulation of muscle adaptation and the Hippo signaling pathway. Integration analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq revealed overlapping genes were significantly enriched during skeletal muscle cell differentiation and muscle organ morphogenesis. At the same time, we screened FOXO1, ZBED6, CRY2 and CFL2 for possible involvement in skeletal muscle development, constructed a genes and transcription factors network map, and found that some transcription factors (TFs), including YY1, KLF4, KLF5 and Bach1, were involved in skeletal muscle development. Overall, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the key factors that impact skeletal muscle development in various breeds of cattle, providing new insights for future analysis of the molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in muscle growth and development.

AB  - Black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) (BSFL) are insect larvae with significant ecological and economic value. This study aims to investigate whether swill and manure had any effects on the transcriptome and metabolome of BSFL. Through high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we found that larvae fed with swill exhibited higher levels of gene expression, especially with the upregulation of genes related to energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and redox reactions. Metabolomics analysis showed a significant increase in energy metabolism-related metabolites, such as organic acids and amino acids, in the swill-fed larvae. In contrast, gene expression and metabolic characteristics in the pig manure-fed group indicated a higher stress response, with relevant genes and metabolites (such as short-chain fatty acids and antioxidants) showing significant upregulation. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses further supported these results, suggesting that swill promotes larval growth and metabolism, whereas pig manure induces the activation of stress response mechanisms. These findings offer clear molecular and physiological insights into the optimization of substrate selection for enhancing the performance of BSFL in waste management.

AB  - Airborne road and abrasive car parts particles penetrate into aquatic and soil environments, but also, settling on vegetation along highways, enter trophic chains as a result of consumption by herbivorous invertebrates. The effects of this exposure are poorly recognized. The study aimed to assess the toxicity of two traffic-connected materials: tread rubber (TR) particles and environmentally relevant field-collected road dust (RD), to the Tenebrio molitor larvae under laboratory conditions using a set of protective (heat shock protein - HSP70, metallothionein - Mts levels), immunity (lysozyme - Lys, defensin - Def levels) and digestive (protease, amylase, and celulase activities) biomarkers. ELISA assay was used for protein levels, while fluorimetric and spectrophotometric methods were used for enzymatic activity studies. RD and TR particles were characterized by SEM/EDS techniques. The representative TR particle sizes were within the range of 31 mu m and 274 mu m. For the RD, the size of the particles were 153-587 mu m. Fat body HSP70 levels were, on average, twice lower in groups exposed to RD particles. For fat body Mts, RD and TR caused the decrease while in the gut, the effect depended on the particle type. Gut lysozyme levels increased for both particles while in fat body this effect was made by RD. Digestive enzyme activity did not reflect exposure to TR and RD particles. RD induced changes in more experimental groups than TR. This may be due to the greater complexity of their composition. Further studies focusing on material type, concentration, exposure duration, and particle size are necessary to understand the effects of traffic-connected material on terrestrial herbivores.

AB  - The production of craft cheeses from goat milk in small farms in Ukraine is becoming increasingly widespread. The uniqueness of goat cheeses made from raw milk is attributed to the significant diversity of microbiological processes that occur during their ripening, involving natural strains of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and cheese mites. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the microbial composition of Caciotta and Canestrato goat cheeses during their ripening process. The number of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms (MAFAM) in Caciotta cheese was stable on the 10th day, the 1st, and the 12th month, and decreased by 1.18-1.27 lg CFU/g by the 24th month of ripening. The number of mold fungi and yeasts in Caciotta cheese peaked in the 1st month but they were not detected in the 12th and 24th months of ripening. Lactic acid bacteria in Caciotta cheese formed the basis of MAFAM and were represented by Lactobacillus plantarum on the 10th day and the 1st month of ripening, Lactobacillus brevis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides in the 12th month, and L. brevis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in the 24th month. In 24-month-ripened Caciotta cheese, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter ludwigii, E. durans, E. faecalis, and E. hirae were detected. Lactic acid bacteria in Canestrato cheese formed the basis of MAFAM and were represented by L. mesenteroides from the 10th day to the 3rd month of age, L. pseudomesenteroides in the 6th month, and L. plantarum in the 12th month. Canestrato cheese was characterized by a significant presence of mold fungi and yeasts in all ripening periods except for the 6th month. In 12-month-ripened Canestrato cheese, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus durans, E. hirae, and E. faecalis were isolated. Cheese mites, Acarus siro, in various stages of development were found in the rind of both cheeses starting from the 6th month of ripening. The results of the researchers provide new data on the microbiome of craft hard cheeses made from raw goat milk and can be used to develop methods for controlling the population size of A. siro mites during their ripening.

AB  - Animal species, encompassing both pollinators and herbivores, exhibit a preference for plants based on optimal foraging theory. Understanding the intricacies of these adaptive plant-animal interactions in the context of community assembly poses a main challenge in ecology. This study delves into the impact of adaptive interaction rewiring between species belonging to different guilds on the structure and stability of a 3-guild ecological network, incorporating both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Our findings reveal that adaptive rewiring results in sub-networks becoming more nested and compartmentalized. Furthermore, the rewiring of interactions uncovers a positive correlation between a plant's generalism concerning both pollinators and herbivores. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between a plant's degree centrality and its energy budget. Although network stability does not exhibit a clear relationship with non-random structures, it is primarily influenced by the balance of multiple interaction strengths. In summary, our results underscore the significance of adaptive interaction rewiring in shaping the structure of 3-guild networks. They emphasize the importance of considering the balance of multiple interactions for the stability of adaptive networks, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of ecological communities.
   Based on optimal foraging theory, the study of adaptive networks suggests that interaction rewiring can shape the structure of 3-guild networks, incorporating both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Minimising stress in intensive pig farms is paramount to raising immunocompetent pigs. This entails providing the pigs with living conditions (from birth to the point of slaughter) free of pain, stress, and suffering and simultaneously providing conditions that generate positive affective states. Our review aims to study the relationship between chronic stress, illnesses, their impact on antibiotic use (AMU), and potential housing and management improvements to tackle stress and AMU. According to the literature, pigs kept in crowded, barren conditions, with poor microclimatic conditions, and subject to painful and stressful weaning practices present redirected behaviours, poor immune-competence, and weaker bodies. In turn, pigs are more vulnerable to circulating pathogens and severe secondary infections, which is conducive to high AMU for the sake of the animals' health. Simultaneously, we compiled a list of possible solutions for the current poor environment and practices, including a call for the pig industry to broaden its concept of animal welfare beyond the current biological/productivist scope. We propose that advocating for an industry with enhanced animal welfare is a crucial response to the international call to combat antimicrobial resistance and the social demand for ethically sustainable animal production. Preventative measures, such as biosecurity and vaccinations, are essential but not sufficient to ensure high standards of health in pig production systems. Restrictive, barren housing and many widely used management practices that cause pain and stress predispose high-performance pigs reared in intensive systems to disease. In this context, antibiotics are used as part of the infrastructure that sustains health and high levels of production in pig farms. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global emergency affecting human and animal health, and the use of antibiotics (AMU) in intensive livestock farming is considered an important risk factor for the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria from animals to humans. Tackling the issue of AMR demands profound changes in AMU, e.g., reducing their use for prophylaxis and ending it for growth promotion. In support of such recommendations, we revise the link between animal welfare and AMU and argue that it is crucial to sustainably reduce AMU while ensuring that pigs can live happy lives. In support of such recommendations, we aimed to revise the link between animal welfare and AMU in pigs by analysing stress factors related to housing and management and their impact on pig welfare. In particular, we reviewed critical management practices that increase stress and, therefore, pigs' susceptibility to disease and reduce the quality of life of pigs. We also reviewed some alternatives that can be adopted in pig farms to improve animal welfare and that go beyond the reduction in stress. By minimising environmental and management stressors, pigs can become more immunocompetent and prepared to overcome pathogenic challenges. This outcome can contribute to reducing AMU and the risk of AMR while simultaneously improving the quality of life of pigs and, ultimately, maintaining the pig industry's social license.

AB  - Trichomes play a key role in both heavy metal tolerance and herbivory defense, and both stressors have been shown to induce increased trichome density. However, the combined effect of these stressors on trichome density in general, and specifically on metal-hyperaccumulating plants, has yet to be examined. The aim of this study was to test the effect of cadmium availability and herbivory on leaf trichome density and herbivore deterrence in the metal hyperaccumulator Helianthus annuus. To test this, H. Annuus plants were grown in control pots or pots inoculated with 10 mg/kg cadmium and were subjected to either no herbivory or simulated herbivory using mechanical damage and foliar jasmonic acid application. Herbivore deterrence was tested in a feeding assay using Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars. Interestingly, while the trichome density of H. annuus increased by 79% or 53.5% under high cadmium availability or simulated herbivory, respectively, it decreased by 26% when the stressors were combined. Furthermore, regardless of cadmium availability, simulated herbivory induced a 40% increase in deterrence of S. littoralis. These findings suggest that the combination of metal availability and herbivory might present excessive stress to hyperaccumulators. Moreover, they suggest that the risk of metal bioaccumulation in phytoremediation can be reduced by simulated herbivory.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) plays a pivotal role in management of tea plantation, with significant impacts on the growth, productivity, and nutrition status of tea plants. The existing methods for N content monitoring of tea leaves are complicated and can not realize in suite and in real time way. This study proposed a method for estimating the N content of tea plants in field conditions based on a combination of a multispectral imaging system and hyperspectral data. A total of 32 parameters were extracted from five tea gardens using calibrated multispectral images of the tea plant canopy, and 27 indices were selected by Pearson correlation analysis. A total of 28 wavelengths selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling from hyperspectral data were combined with 27 multispectral indices as the original data. Subsequently, five variables of fused data (H, VOG, BGI, 1664 nm and 1665 nm) were selected by variable combination population analysis based on the 55 combination parameters. Partial least squares regression, random forest regression, and support vector machine regression (SVR) models all showed excellent performance for both the calibration and prediction sets. The overall results indicated that the infused data of multispectral and hyperspectral data combined with SVR are effective in monitoring the N level under field conditions, and the R-2 (coefficient of determination) and root mean square error values of the prediction were 0.9186 and 0.0560, respectively. The findings of this study are important in retaining the nutritional and quality attributes of agricultural commodities.

AB  - Characterising host selection mechanisms and the performance of seed-predating insects on different hosts has broad implications for ecology and applied entomology.We assessed host selection and performance of endophagous seed-predating insects on three species of Copaifera, testing two hypotheses: (i) large-sized trees produce larger seeds and have higher levels of seed predation than their smaller congeneric relatives, and (ii) endophagous seed-predating insects that develop in larger-seeded trees exhibit higher body mass, lipid content, and muscle mass as they obtain higher amount of food resources.Unpredated seeds of the large-sized Copaifera langsdorffii showed greater mass than their smaller congeneric relatives C. arenicola and C. oblongifolia.Two species of endophagous seed-predating beetles (Rhinochenus brevicollis and Apion sp.) were found attacking seeds of the three Copaifera species. Rhinochenus brevicollis preyed on a higher percentage of seeds than Apion sp. The shrub C. oblongifolia had the highest percentage of seed predation, contradicting our original hypothesis that larger species have a higher percentage of seed predation.Rhinochenus brevicollis preyed on a higher percentage of seeds of larger-sized species than Apion sp. The higher dispersal ability of R. brevicollis associated with different patterns of plant species distribution may be the mechanism driving differential seed predation among Copaifera species.Adult insects that emerged from C. langsdorffii seeds showed higher body mass and lipidic content. It is likely that insects developing in larger seeds obtain a higher amount of food resources during their development. Finally, we observed a positive relationship between body weight and lipidic content in adults of R. brevicollis. We suggest that studies shedding light onto insect performance in different host-sized seeds are necessary to understand host selection by beetles.

AB  - Understanding coexistence between humans and threatened wildlife is a central focus in conservation. Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, harbors one of the largest populations of the critically endangered Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). The people who live alongside this population are affected by intensive crop foraging. Our study investigated the factors which influenced attitudes toward elephants. We then evaluated the implications of reported attitudes for future willingness to live with elephants. We surveyed 660 respondents in 22 villages around the park. People generally reported positive attitudes toward elephants (smartness 95%, usefulness 62%, importance 57%, and pleasantness 53%), apart from where human safety was concerned (safety 11%). Each dimension of attitude was explained by different factors including age, gender, knowledge of elephants, and distance to crop foraging locations. Most respondents (62%) expressed no willingness to coexist with elephants. Such willingness was lower when elephants were perceived to be more dangerous, but higher if beliefs in the benefits of elephants were greater. Efforts to improve crop foraging mitigation practice and to increase people's awareness of elephant benefits may promote support for their conservation. Through this study, we advocate the integration of social science to promote human-wildlife coexistence strategies, an approach that is currently limited in Indonesia.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and Cadmium (Cd) affect female reproduction. To date, toxicological research has focused on the effects of individual contaminants, whereas living beings are exposed to mixtures. This study analyzed the effects of a DEHP/Cd mixture on nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of sheep cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) compared with single compounds. COCs recovered from slaughterhouses-derived sheep ovaries were in vitro exposed to 0.5 mu M DEHP, 0.1 mu M Cd, or DEHP/Cd mixture at the same concentrations during 24 h of in vitro maturation (IVM). After IVM, oocyte nuclear chromatin configuration was evaluated, and bioenergetic/oxidative parameters were assessed on expanded cumulus cells (CCs) and matured oocytes (chi-square test and one-way ANOVA; p < 0.05). Under examined conditions, oocyte nuclear maturation was never impaired. However, COC bioenergetics was affected with stronger effects for the mixture than single compounds. Indeed, the percentages of matured oocytes with healthy mitochondrial distribution patterns were reduced (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 for mixture and single compounds, respectively). Oocyte mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ROS levels, and mitochondria/ROS co-localization were reduced, with the same significance level, in all contaminated conditions. CCs displayed increased ROS levels only upon mixture exposure (p < 0.001). In conclusion, in vitro exposure to the DEHP/Cd mixture affected COC quality in the sheep to a greater extent than separate compounds.

AB  - A study about the spatial distribution and density of common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) was conducted in two focal areas in Dabena Valley Forest, Western Ethiopia, from May 2016 to June 2018. These were Gassi Controlled Area (GCHA) in the southwestern part and Haro Aba Diko Controlled Hunting Area (HADCHA) in the northeastern part of the Valley. Population abundance and densities were analysed using distance sampling method. A total of 246 and 652 warthogs were counted in GCHA and HADCHA, respectively. The two study areas were significantly different during the wet season and during the dry season in the number of common warthog population per transect. During the dry season, HADCHA possessed more mean of cluster density (5.18/km(2)) than the GCHA (2.37/km(2)). Common warthog encounter rate ranged from 1.1 to 3.73/km during the wet season in both study areas. The two study areas did not show significant variation (chi(2) = 0.188, df = 1, p = 0.05) in the clusters of common warthog sightings. A high number of common warthog population are threatened by increasing anthropogenic activities. Common warthog's natural habitats and their buffer zones should be properly monitored: Cattle grazing and human encroachment should be prohibited.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a global public health concern. Antibiotic usage in pigs makes swine wastewater (SW) a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). SW is usually stored and treated in a three-chamber anaerobic pond (3-CAP) in medium and small pig farms in northern China. However, the yet unexplored presence of ARGs in SW during 3-CAP treatment may result in ARGs spreading into the environment if farmers apply SW to farmland as a liquid organic fertilizer. This study investigated the profiles of and changes in ARGs in SW during its treatment in 3-CAP over four seasons and analyzed the correlation between ARGs and bacterial phenotypes, along with the physicochemical parameters of the water. The results revealed that ARG abundance decreased considerably after 3-CAP treatment in April (47%), October (47%), and December (62%) but increased in May (43%) and August (73%). The ARG copies in the influent and other SW samples increased significantly from 107 copies/mL in April to 109 copies/mL in October and were maintained in December. The increase in ARG abundance was not as rapid as the growth of the bacterial population, resulting in lower relative abundance in October and December. Bacterial communities possessed more sul1 and tetM genes, which were also positively correlated with mobile genetic elements. After the 3-CAP treatment, 16% of antibiotics and 60% of heavy metals were removed, and both had a weak correlation with ARGs. Predicted phenotypes showed that gram-positive (G+) and gram-negative (G-) bacteria have different capacities for carrying ARGs. G+ bacteria carry more ARGs than G- bacteria. This study revealed the persistence of ARGs in SW after 3-CAP treatment over different seasons. Applying SW in the proper month will mitigate ARG dissemination to the environment.

AB  - Data on the biochemical analysis of liver tissue in bream from the Uglich Reservoir infected with trypanosomes are presented. It is found that the presence of parasites causes shifts in all the studied parameters: the concentrations of total protein, immune complexes, glucose and glycogen in comparison with control fish. The differences are statistically insignificant. In general, the pattern of the changes indicates a slight decrease in the plastic and energy resources of the host fish, as well as, indirectly, an increase in the antigenic load. The general clinical picture at the time of fish sampling is typical for the chronic stage of the disease under conditions of a low level of parasitemia. The results indicate the active participation of the liver in the response of fish to the introduction of the parasite.

AB  - Childhood and adolescent exposure to obesogenic environments has contributed to the development of several health disorders, including neurocognitive impairment. Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental window highly influenced by environmental factors that affect brain function until adulthood. Post-weaning chronic exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) adversely affects memory performance; physical activity is one approach to coping with these dysfunctions. Previous studies indicate that voluntary exercise prevents HFD's detrimental effects on memory; however, it remains to evaluate whether it has a remedial/therapeutical effect when introduced after a long-term HFD exposure. This study was conducted on a diet-induced obesity mice model over six months. After three months of HFD exposure (without interrupting the diet) access to voluntary physical activity was provided. HFD produced weight gain, increased adiposity, and impaired glucose tolerance. Voluntary physical exercise ameliorated glucose tolerance and halted weight gain and fat accumulation. Additionally, physical activity mitigated HFD-induced spatial and recognition memory impairments. Our data indicate that voluntary physical exercise starting after several months of periadolescent HFD exposure reverses metabolic and cognitive alterations demonstrating that voluntary exercise, in addition to its known preventive effect, also has a restorative impact on metabolism and cognition dysfunctions associated with obesity.

AB  - Named entity recognition (NER) in musk deer domain is the extraction of specific types of entities from unstructured texts, constituting a fundamental component of the knowledge graph, Q&A system, and text summarization system of musk deer domain. Due to limited annotated data, diverse entity types, and the ambiguity of Chinese word boundaries in musk deer domain NER, we present a novel NER model, CAELF-GP, which is based on cross-attention mechanism enhanced lexical features (CAELF). Specifically, we employ BERT as a character encoder and advocate the integration of external lexical information at the character representation layer. In the feature fusion module, instead of indiscriminately merging external dictionary information, we innovatively adopted a feature fusion method based on a cross-attention mechanism, which guides the model to focus on important lexical information by calculating the correlation between each character and its corresponding word sets. This module enhances the model's semantic representation ability and entity boundary recognition capability. Ultimately, we introduce the decoding module of GlobalPointer (GP) for entity type recognition, capable of identifying both nested and non-nested entities. Since there is currently no publicly available dataset for the musk deer domain, we built a named entity recognition dataset for this domain by collecting relevant literature and working under the guidance of domain experts. The dataset facilitates the training and validation of the model and provides data foundation for subsequent related research. The model undergoes experimentation on two public datasets and the dataset of musk deer domain. The results show that it is superior to the baseline models, offering a promising technical avenue for the intelligent recognition of named entities in the musk deer domain.

AB  - Insect egg deposition can induce plant defenses against their larvae. Previous studies have primarily focused on herbaceous plant defenses; however, little is known about how the Salicaceae respond to insect egg deposition and defend themselves against herbivores. By combining plant defense gene studies and bioassays, we investigated the effect of the coleoptera Plagiodera versicolora egg deposition on willow (Salix matsudana cv. 'Zhuliu') and examined the interactions at the plant resistance and transcriptome levels. RNA-seq data were utilized to analyze changes in the leaf transcriptome with and without oviposition, and also the changes in the leaf transcriptome of feeding-damaged leaves with and without prior oviposition. P. versicolora oviposition on willow leaves resulted in altered expression levels of transcripts associated with plant stress and metabolic responses. Compared with leaves with no oviposition, leaves with egg deposition showed a slight increase in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phytohormone signaling genes after larval feeding. The RNA-seq analysis revealed alterations in willow transcripts in response to leaf beetle infestations. Bioassays indicated that oviposition by P. versicolora on willows reduced subsequent larvae performance, suggesting that prior oviposition by P. versicolora could increase willows' resistance to larvae. This study advances our knowledge of how oviposition by coleoptera insects induces changes in the resistance of leaves to herbivory in the Salicaceae family.

AB  - In the early twentieth century, European mouflon was introduced in Croatia, while all introductions in Slovenia occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Although majority of the introductions were historically documented, occasional cases involving individuals of unknown origin have likely contributed to a mixed genetic pool in established colonies. To understand the impact of past management and the potential founder effects on contemporary mouflon populations, we performed the first genetic study of the species in these two countries. Utilising next-generation sequencing of both mitochondrial control region (mtDNA CR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC DRB exon 2), our study scrutinises the genetic diversity and structure of these populations. Additionally, the origins and genetic variability of mouflon in Croatia and Slovenia were compared with reference samples from Czech Republic, Sardinia (Italy), and Corsica (France). The mtDNA haplotype network showed that the majority of mouflon from Slovenia are closely related to mouflon from Sardinia, and only few shared the same haplotypes with mouflon from Croatia. Some mouflon from mainland Croatia share identical or closely related haplotypes with individuals from the initially established population in this country (on the Brijuni Archipelago), while others belong to a distinctly different cluster. We found five MHC alleles previously reported for mouflon in Europe, and genetic diversity was similar in both studied countries. We observed an excess of the Ovar-DRB1*07012/*07012 genotype, and only a few individuals exhibited the advantageous genotypes for parasite infection (Ovar-DRB1*0114 allele and Ovar-DRB1*0324/*0114 genotype). Genetic data showed that the population origins are generally in agreement with the written historical records, although we found signals of release of extra individuals into certain colonies.

AB  - As extreme weather events have become more frequently observed in recent decades, concerns about exposure to potential flood risk have increased, especially in underserved and socially vulnerable communities. Galena Park, Texas, is a socially vulnerable community that also confronts escalated physical vulnerabilities due to existing flood risks from Buffalo Bayou and the Houston Ship Channel as well as proximity to industrial facilities that emit chemical pollution. To better understand the underlying risks that Galena Park is facing, this research assesses and visualizes the existing contamination hazards associated with the chemical facilities within Galena Park. Through this process, we (1) compute the environmental, health, and physical hazards associated with industrial facilities, (2) spatially geocode the points of contamination sources and flood exposure, and (3) increase awareness of existing risk by visualizing and distributing related information using an ArcGIS Dashboard. The results indicate that there are 169 points of location from 127 industrial facilities, and 24 points were inducing potential chemicals. In total, 126 chemicals have potential physical, health, and environmental hazards. On average, each facility has 2.4 chemicals that could cause potential hazards with a range of zero to 57 chemicals. When examining the specific physical, health, and environmental risks associated with the chemicals, on average each facility has 14.6 types of risks associated with it. This includes, on average, 9.8 types of health hazards, 1.53 physical hazards, and 2.3 environmental hazards per facility. When analyzing the spatial relationship between the chemical exposure and the current flood risk using the Dashboard, it is noticeable that most of the industrial facilities are located in the south of Galena Park, near Buffalo Bayou, where a variety of industrial facilities are clustered. Through this study, we spatially mapped the existing risks in Galena Park that are not readily available to the community and risks that are not currently tangible or visible. The utility of ArcGIS Dashboards affords the opportunity to translate massive databases into digestible knowledge that can be shared and utilized within the community. This study also takes another step toward building community resilience by providing knowledge that can be used to prepare for and respond to disasters. Visualizing unseen risks and promoting awareness can enhance risk perception when supported by scientific knowledge. Further investigation is necessary to enhance preparedness behaviors, identify proper evacuation techniques and routes, and build community networks to comprehensively promote resilience to multi-hazard circumstances.

AB  - This research evaluated the growth, survival, proximate and fatty acid composition of water flea (Daphnia magna) fed baker's yeast (BY) and three types of microalgae diets. In this study, two freshwater microalgae; Botrycoccus braunii (BB) and Chlorella vulgaris (CV), one marine spray-dried microalgae, Nannochloropsis oculata (SDN), and baker's yeast were evaluated for herbivorous zooplankton Daphnia magna. Survival, reproduction and population density of Daphnia magna have been studied. Daphnia reproduction was enhanced by utilization of baker's yeast diet with increasing egg number, juvenile and adult female numbers among treatments during the experimental period. Daphnia fed SDN diet increased egg number only 7th day of experiment. Population density and survival was positively affected by utilization of baker's yeast at the end of the experiment. Protein levels enhanced by SDN diets while Daphnia fed Botrycoccus braunii diet showed the highest lipid and EPA content in Daphnia. Overall, each diet improved different part of nutrients in Daphnia biomass.

AB  - BACKGROUNDDeer-derived materials (antler, venison, fetus, penis, bone, tail, and others) are some of the most valuable traditional animal-based medicinal and food materials in China. In production, processing, and trade, the quality of deer products varies. The market is confusing, and counterfeit and shoddy products are common. There is an urgent need to establish an accurate identification method.RESULTSTwo pairs of primers suitable for identifying deer-derived medicinal materials were obtained by screening the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences of 18 species from nine genera of the deer family. The two primers were used to identify the species and adulteration of 22 batches of commercially available deer-derived products with a mini-barcode combining high-resolution melting (HRM) technology and methodical investigation. Deer-derived materials (sika and red deer) were correctly identified by species using varying DNA amounts (1 to 500 ng). The two pairs of primers COI-1FR and COI-2FR yielded melting temperatures (Tm) of 80.55 to 81.00 degrees C and 82.00 to 82.50 degrees C for sika deer, and 81.00 to 82.00 degrees C and 81.40 to 82.00 degrees C for red deer. Twenty-two batches of commercially available samples were analyzed by HRM analysis and conventional amplification sequencing, and it was found that the species samples had an error rate of species labeling of 31.8%. Four batches of samples were identified as mixed (adulterated) in the HRM analysis.CONCLUSIONThe combination of DNA mini-barcode with HRM analysis facilitated the accurate identification of species of deer-derived materials, especially the identification of samples in an adulterated mixed state.

AB  - Understanding how phytoplankton respond to their physical environment is key to predicting shifts in bloom dynamics under a changing climate. This research investigates phytoplankton dynamics in a seasonal coastal upwelling system of the eastern Great Australian Bight (GAB), South Australia, using > 10 years of in-situ mooring and CTD observations together with > 18 years of satellite and wind data. Earlier studies concluded that upwelling in the region is driven by interactions between upwelling-favourable winds associated with synoptic weather events during austral summer months (Jan-March) and the formation of a pool of nutrient -rich shelf-bottom water on the Lincoln Shelf, known as the Kangaroo Island (KI) Pool. Surface phytoplankton blooms in the upwelling centre, which form off the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula, are characterized by chlorophyll-a levels of-1-2 mg/m3. Our analysis of satellite chl-a data indicates the absence of surface phytoplankton blooms in the upwelling centre in more than a third of all upwelling seasons, despite the existence of statistically similar upwelling-favourable winds. The KI Pool is located-100 km upstream from the upwelling centre in a marine region that generally displays very low surface phytoplankton levels. Analysis of water-column data indicates strong interannual variability the KI Pool that is correlated with the intensity of surface phytoplankton blooms in the upwelling centre. The analysis also reveals the existence of substantial (-1 mg/m3 chl-a) subsurface phytoplankton blooms at depths between-20 and 70 m in shallower waters of the Lincoln Shelf, where nutrient-rich shelf-bottom water of the KI Pool reaches into the euphotic zone. Our data suggest that subsurface phytoplankton blooms, forming at depths that cannot be detected by satellites, represent a major driver of the upwelling ecosystem of the eastern GAB.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia, often caused by myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI). Men have a 1.5x higher prevalence of AF, whereas women show a higher risk for new onset AF after MI. However, the underlying mechanisms of how sex affects AF pathophysiology are largely unknown. In 72 pigs with/without ischemic heart failure (IHF) we investigated the impact of sex on ischemia-induced proarrhythmic atrial remodeling and the susceptibility for AF. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrophysiological studies were conducted to assess electrical remodeling; histological analyses were performed to assess atrial fibrosis in male and female pigs. IHF pigs of both sexes showed a significantly increased vulnerability for AF, but in male pigs more and longer episodes were observed. Unchanged conduction properties but enhanced left atrial fibrosis indicated structural rather than electrical remodeling underlying AF susceptibility. Sex differences were only observed in controls with female pigs showing an increased intrinsic heart rate, a prolonged QRS interval and a prolonged sinus node recovery time. In sum, susceptibility for AF is significantly increased both in male and female pigs with ischemic heart failure. Differences between males and females are moderate, including more and longer AF episodes in male pigs and sinus node dysfunction in female pigs.

AB  - Simple Summary: Prevotella is an abundant genus which plays an important role for lignocellulose digestion in goat rumen and is significant to the yield and quality of milk and meat in cows. In a previous study, we sequenced bacterial metagenome from Vietnamese native goat rumen to get 8.4 GB clean data and found very diverse genes related to lignocellulose degradation. However, due to the limitation in the metagenomic size, low amount of complete lignocellulase genes, and high bacterial diversity, further analysis was restricted. In this study, metagenomic deep sequencing was used to obtain 48.66 GB of reliable data, thus some lignocellulolytic enzymes were first seen and a picture of bacterial enzymes involved in lignocellulose digestion in the goat rumen was drawn. The loci for galactan-, xylan-, and arabinan-processing in Prevotella were observed for the first time. We confirm that Prevotella plays pivotal role for hemicellulose digestion and significantly participates in starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin conversion in the goat rumen. A gene coding endoxylanase was expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme was tolerant with some salts, detergents, and had high activity, thus is a good candidate for lignocellulose processing and as an animal feed food additive to effectively improve xylooligosaccharide production.
   Bacteria in rumen play pivotal roles in the digestion of nutrients to support energy for the host. In this study, metagenomic deep sequencing of bacterial metagenome extracted from the goats' rumen generated 48.66 GB of data with 3,411,867 contigs and 5,367,270 genes. The genes were mainly functionally annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy), and HMMER database, and taxonomically classified by MEGAN. As a result, 65,554 genes encoding for 30 enzymes/proteins related to lignocellulose conversion were exploited, in which nine enzymes were seen for the first time in goat rumen. Prevotella was the most abundant genus, contributing 30% hemicellulases and 36% enzymes/proteins for lignocellulose pretreatment, and supporting 98.8% of feruloyl esterases and 71.7% acetylxylan esterases. In addition, 18 of the 22 most lignocellulose digesting- potential contigs belonged to Prevotella. Besides, Prevotella possessed many genes coding for amylolytic enzymes. One gene encoding for endoxylanase was successfully expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme had high Vmax, was tolerant to some salts and detergents, worked better at pH 5.5-6.5, temperature 40-50 degrees C, and was capable to be used in practices. Based on these findings, we confirm that Prevotella plays a pivotal role for hemicellulose digestion and significantly participates in starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin digestion in the goat rumen.

AB  - One animal-based method to evaluate welfare is the presence of stress. In dairy ruminants, the responses to stressors include the activation of both neuroendocrine and autonomous nervous system that can be evaluated through an endocrine assessment. The present study aimed to validate a radioimmunoassay method for cortisol in buffalo milk. Three formulations (whole and skimmed milk and whey) and three solvents (methanol diethyl ether and dichloromethane) were tested: methanol was characterised by the best extraction efficiency (69.88%), whey cortisol concentrations showed a significant correlation with whole extracted milk and were not affected by fat content variation during the milking session. The RIA used in the present study showed good precision, sensitivity and specificity: the dilutions test indicated the high reproducibility of the results, overlapping of the dilution curve and standard curve highlighted high specificity and the lack of interfering factors by buffalo whey matrix. It is concluded that the present assay suits the cortisol measurement in buffalo milk and the ranges described could be employed in the calibration of a biosensing technologies directly integrated in milking parlour systems.

AB  - A human biomonitoring study was conducted in the community of Old Crow, Yukon, in 2019, finding that levels of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in plasma were elevated in the community relative to the general Canadian population. The aim of this study was to estimate dietary intake of both hexachlorobenzene, and the nutrient omega3 fatty acids from locally harvested traditional foods in Old Crow, with the aim of identifying possible regional sources of exposure. A stochastic model was constructed to estimate intake of both hexachlorobenzene and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Average predicted hexachlorobenzene exposure levels from traditional food consumption in Old Crow were below the tolerable daily intake of 1600-1700 ng/kg body weight/day in both average (18 ng/kg body weight/day) and short-term maximum (27 ng/kg body weight/day) exposure models. The primary contributors to average hexachlorobenzene intake were caribou fat, bone marrow, ribs, and kidneys, and Chinook salmon muscle. Average estimated dietary EPA + DHA intake levels from traditional foods were below the recommendation of 2.1 to 3.2 g of EPA + DHA per week in the average (1.6 g/week) exposure model, but above this recommendation in the short-term maximum model (3.3 g/week). The primary contributors to average EPA + DHA intake were the meat of Chinook, coho, and, chum salmon muscle, and whitefish muscle and eggs. The results of this study support the message that traditional foods continue to be an important source of nutrients and other health benefits and that the health benefits of traditional foods generally outweigh contaminant risks.

AB  - The growth of teeth and jaw bones is intimately linked in vertebrates, especially in mammals due to their specialized dentition and limited body growth. However, the relative patterns of growth and level of integration (i.e., co-variation) of these structures are insufficiently known, which hinders our ability to understand how the jaw bones accommodate the diverse dental shapes and eruption patterns observed in mammals. Here, we studied the cranial ontogenetic series of 23 ungulate species among artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and hyracoids having different dental shapes and eruption patterns. We evaluated the variation of the teeth-palate complex, as well as the co-variation of teeth and palate during growth using 3D geometric morphometrics. We found a major ontogenetic component common to all the species studied, corresponding to an elongated dental row relative to the palate in juveniles and vice versa in adults. This pattern agrees with the prolonged growth of the palate as compared to teeth during development but is also reminiscent of an intraspecific allometric pattern previously observed in some dwarf ungulates. Moreover, most artiodactyls, especially ruminants, departed from other ungulates in having a higher co-variation between the dental row and the palate. This stronger integration seen in ruminants might be associated with their inherited rapid growth and relatively fast eruption pattern. This is in contrast to ungulates with late eruption of last molars, whose teeth-palate complex might be less constrained, but further investigation is needed to substantiate these hypotheses and better understand the factors influencing covariations within the upper jaw.

AB  - Plants can defend themselves against herbivores by accumulating heavy metals. Plant defense includes inorganic (elemental) and organic defenses. However, for the hyperaccumulator invasive plant Phytolacca americana, what kind of impact will the enrichment of heavy metal Mn (Manganese) have on the defense of herbivorous insects and natural enemy insects? In this context, we studied the effects of hyperaccumulation of Mn on the defense mechanisms of Spodoptera litura and its natural enemies. The results showed that Mn treatment reduced the biomass of the native plant population (US) but had no significant effect on the invasive population (China). After feeding on both native and invasive populations, the weight of S. litura decreased with the increase in the concentration of Mn. Under high Mn treatment, the weight of S. litura feeding on the native population was higher than that of the invasive population. The Mn content in leaves of the native and invasive populations exhibited a decrease, while the Mn treatment increased the saponin content of the invasive population. We speculate that combining elemental and organic defenses against herbivores may be the primary mechanism promoting the invasion of P. americana into China after accumulating heavy metals. The heavy metal Mn in plants will transfer Mn to the third trophic level (natural enemy insects) through bottom-up effects, affecting the growth and development of the third trophic level. Overall, this has important implications for understanding how invasive plants adapt to soil heavy metal pollution and resistance to herbivorous insects.

AB  - The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as Asiatic elephant is facing a significant decline in its wild populations due to habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, leading to increased conflicts between humans and elephants. Preserving this iconic species is crucial, prompting researchers to explore various aspects of its biology, behavior, ecology and conservation efforts. In light of the profound importance of this subject, this study utilizes a descriptive systematic literature review (SLR) to examine global research trends on Asian elephants. Analyzing a dataset of 1780 articles spanning from 1914 to 2022, the study reveals a notable increase in publications, particularly since 2000, with 142 articles published in 2022 alone. This research provides a comprehensive overview of advancements in Asian elephant studies, promoting international collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers. While research from leading scientific countries can aid in conservation efforts, there is a call for more inclusive, participatory and fair approaches. The study demonstrates a commitment to Equity, Inclusion and Diversity (EID) by adopting a multifaceted approach that considers the needs, perspectives and contributions of diverse stakeholders. By addressing disparities and advocating for social justice within elephant conservation, the study emphasizes the urgent need for collective action in conservation, welfare improvement, conflict resolution, ecosystem balance and overall enhancement of understanding about Asian elephants. Serving as a valuable resource for policymakers, conservation organizations and researchers, the study not only synthesizes existing literature but also identifies research gaps, highlights areas requiring immediate attention, and offers collaborative opportunities for global scientists to contribute to the well-being and preservation of this majestic species.

AB  - Glomalin, a glycoprotein secreted by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs), exhibits multiple beneficial functions in regard to plant growth. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of exogenous easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP) in water and their effects on the quality of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a quarter-strength exogenous EE-GRSP solution (1/4 EE-GRSP), half-strength exogenous EE-GRSP solution (1/2 EE-GRSP), three-quarter-strength exogenous EE-GRSP solution (3/4 EE-GRSP), and full-strength exogenous EE-GRSP solution (full EE-GRSP) on plant growth, the root system architecture, leaf water status, and the tea quality of tea seedlings, along with examining the changes in the relative expression of water channel proteins (AQPs) in tea plants. The results indicated that exogenous EE-GRSP of different strengths had different effects on both the growth performance (height, leaf numbers, and biomass) and root architecture parameters of tea seedlings, and the best positive effects on plant growth and the root architecture appeared under the three-quarter-strength exogenous EE-GRSP treatment. Similarly, the exogenous EE-GRSP application also differently affected tea quality indicators, in which only the quarter- and half-strength exogenous EE-GRSP solutions significantly increased most of the indicators, including carbohydrates, tea polyphenols, total amino acids, catechins, and flavonoids. Moreover, the half- and three-quarter-strength exogenous EE-GRSP treatments significantly increased the leaf relative water content (LRWC), but all of the exogenous EE-GRSP treatments significantly decreased the leaf water potential (LWP). Furthermore, the expression of AQP genes in the root system of tea plants was related to the strength of the exogenous EE-GRSP treatments, and different genes were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated under the treatment of exogenous EE-GRSP at different strengths. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed that most of the relative expression of AQPs was significantly and positively correlated with tea plant growth, the root architecture, and the leaf relative water content, but negatively correlated with tea quality indicators; however, the expression of CsNIPs and CsSIPs was markedly and negatively correlated with plant growth performance. Therefore, we speculated that the application of exogenous EE-GRSP could facilitate plant growth and improve the quality indirectly by regulating the expression of root AQPs, thus ameliorating the water uptake and nutrient accumulation in tea plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Neospora caninum causes abortion and other reproductive challenges in livestock and leads to large economic losses every year. Wild pigs were evaluated for their potential role in the transmission of N. caninum, the parasite that causes neosporosis in cattle and other animals. Three assays were used to identify past or current exposure to N. caninum in wild pigs and histology was performed to determine if there was a pathology consistent with a N. caninum infection in the tissues that were evaluated. The following assays reported positive results: Kit A-67.8%, Kit B-12.5%, Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test-84.1%, and Histology-0%. Importantly, the assays used in this study were not congruent with all duplicate samples or between test types and demonstrate the need for a more reliable test to identify N. caninum infections in wild pigs to better assess their potential role in disease transmission. Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite, reported as a leading cause of cattle abortions and reproductive failure worldwide, costing the cattle industry approximately $1.3 billion annually. With wild pig (Sus scrofa) populations estimated at over six million in the United States, contact between wild pigs and livestock is inevitable, mainly because of the widespread geographic co-occurrence of the two species. As a known reservoir for numerous fungal, bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases, wild pigs are of particular importance for human and veterinary health relative to the prevention of infectious diseases. The seroprevalence of N. caninum in wild pig populations was previously documented in the United States, raising the question as to their exposure point of prevalence. This research screened 116 individual wild pigs for N. caninum using a variety of available assays. Using two different commercially available ELISA test kits, seroprevalence ranged from 12.5% to 67.8%. The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test resulted in our highest percent seroprevalence for these samples, at 84.1%. However, none of our samples showed any presence of N. caninum or associated pathologies via histological evaluation of representative tissues. Importantly, the assays used in this study were not congruent with all duplicate samples or between the test types used. The implications of these non-congruent results demonstrates that currently available testing assays produce variable results, underscoring the need for more reliable testing kits and a standardized methodology when assessing disease prevalence in wildlife, particularly for N. caninum in wild pigs, which impacts prevalence and comparability across studies.

AB  - Simple Summary: Pigs do not have endogenous enzymes capable of breaking some fiber components (xylans) found in cereal grains such as wheat. The unique capability of xylanase to break the xylan main chain and release bound glucose from the fiber structure makes it a suitable strategy to feed wheat-based diets to pigs, especially after weaning where, in addition to improving digestibility, xylanase can contribute to promote pig heath. We evaluated the effects of increasing levels of xylanase in wheat-soybean meal-based diets with reduced metabolizable energy on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fermentation products, and digesta viscosity in weaned pigs. As a result, xylanase did not affect growth indicators, such as body weight, average daily gain or feed efficiency. However, xylanase supplementation led to a lower incidence of diarrhea, especially in the second- and third-week post-weaning. In addition, nutrient digestibility, particularly fiber components, improved linearly, which was associated with a reduction in digesta viscosity in the colon and changes in cecal volatile fatty acid profiles. In conclusion, xylanase supplementation can improve fiber digestibility and reduce digesta viscosity in the hindgut, which could be related with decreasing the occurrence of looseness. However, its effects on growth were not expressive in wheat-based diets with energy reduction. (1) Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary xylanase addition on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, volatile fatty acids, and digesta viscosity at different digestive sites in weaned pigs fed wheat-soybean meal-based diets with reduced metabolizable energy. (2) Methods: A total of 312 weaned pigs (5.1 +/- 0.9 kg, 20 +/- 2 days of age) were assigned to one of six dietary treatments. The experimental diets were formulated in a three-phase nursery feeding program: phase 1 (d0-d7), phase 2 (d8-d21), and phase 3 (d22-d42). The experimental diets consisted of a wheat-soybean meal-based diet formulated to meet pig requirements (positive control, PC); the PC diet with a reduction of 100 kcal of metabolizable energy (ME) (negative control, NC); and the NC diet with either 900, 1800, 3600, or 7200 units of xylanase. Feed disappearance and body weight were measured at d7, 14, 21, and 42 in the nursery phase. The pen fecal score was assessed daily from d0 to d14 and three times a week from d15 to d28. On d21-d24 of the experiment (12 pigs per day), one pig per pen was selected for sample collection: ileal, cecal, and mid-colon digesta for viscosity and ileal digesta, feces for nutrient digestibility, and feces and cecal digesta for the measurement of volatile fatty acid. (3) Results: The addition of xylanase to the NC diets did not improve pig growth performance (body weight, feed conversion ratio, and average daily gain; p > 0.10) during the entire nursery phase. In Week 2 and Week 3, pigs fed xylanase had a lower (chi 2 < 0.05) incidence of fecal scores 3 and 4 (diarrhea) than the PC and NC diets. In addition, the apparent total tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber increased linearly (p < 0.1) in response to xylanase addition. Xylanase addition (900 to 7200 U) decreased digesta viscosity in the colon compared to the PC and NC diets. Furthermore, xylanase addition resulted in a lower (p < 0.05) concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and total volatile fatty acid in cecal samples compared to PC.
   The addition of xylanase resulted in greater acetic and valeric acid concentrations in cecal samples compared to the NC group (p < 0.10). (4) Conclusions: Xylanase addition can improve nutrient digestibility, particularly at the total tract level, and reduce viscosity in the hindgut, which could be related to decreasing the occurrence of looseness. However, its impact on growth performance was minimal in wheat-soybean meal-based diets with a reduction of 100 kcal of ME.

AB  - Fetal brain development depends on maternofetal thyroid function. In rodents and sheep, perinatal BPA exposure is associated with maternal and/or fetal thyroid disruption and alterations in central nervous system development as demonstrated by metabolic modulations in the encephala of mice. We hypothesized that a gestational exposure to a low dose of BPA affects maternofetal thyroid function and fetal brain development in a region-specific manner. Pregnant ewes, a relevant model for human thyroid and brain development, were exposed to BPA (5 mu g/kg bw/d, sc). The thyroid status of ewes during gestation and term fetuses at delivery was monitored. Fetal brain development was assessed by metabolic fingerprints at birth in 10 areas followed by metabolic network-based analysis. BPA treatment was associated with a significant time-dependent decrease in maternal TT4 serum concentrations. For 8 fetal brain regions, statistical models allowed discriminating BPA-treated from control lambs. Metabolic network computational analysis revealed that prenatal exposure to BPA modulated several metabolic pathways, in particular excitatory and inhibitory amino-acid, cholinergic, energy and lipid homeostasis pathways. These pathways might contribute to BPA-related neurobehavioral and cognitive disorders. Discrimination was particularly clear for the dorsal hippocampus, the cerebellar vermis, the dorsal hypothalamus, the caudate nucleus and the lateral part of the frontal cortex. Compared with previous results in rodents, the use of a larger animal model allowed to examine specific brain areas, and generate evidence of the distinct region-specific effects of fetal BPA exposure on the brain metabolome. These modifications occur concomitantly to subtle maternal thyroid function alteration. The functional link between such moderate thyroid changes and fetal brain metabolomic fingerprints remains to be determined as well as the potential implication of other modes of action triggered by BPA such as estrogenic ones. Our results pave the ways for new scientific strategies aiming at linking environmental endocrine disruption and altered neurodevelopment.

AB  - Rocky shores typically exhibit a variety of sedentary and free-moving forms of epibionts associated with the shells of mussel basibionts. This paper provides a first report on epibiotic bryozoans found on shells of the invasive Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck. More than 2500 mussels were collected between December 2019 and October 2020 from rocky shores during low spring tides across the south-southeast coast of South Africa. Ten percent of these mussels hosted epibiotic bryozoans. We examined a subset of these epibiotised mussels to assess the diversity of bryozoans. Three encrusting cheilostome species were identified: Chaperia atypica n. sp., Celleporella hyalina (Linnaeus), and Hippomonavella sp. This new species is the first Chaperia with avicularia and the first South African species with ooecia. This study highlights the biological diversity of epibiotic bryozoans on mussel shells and, given their differences in microtopography, the possibility that invasive species can provide a new substratum for rare, overlooked or undescribed species of epibionts.

AB  - Declining participation in hunting, especially among young adult hunters, affects the ability of state and federal agencies to achieve goals for wildlife management and decreases revenue for conservation. For wildlife agencies hoping to engage diverse audiences in hunter recruitment, retention, and reactivation (R3) efforts, university settings provide unique advantages: they contain millions of young adults who are developmentally primed to explore new activities, and they cultivate a social atmosphere where new identities can flourish. From 2018 to 2020, we surveyed 17,203 undergraduate students at public universities across 22 states in the United States to explore R3 potential on college campuses and assess key demographic, social, and cognitive correlates of past and intended future hunting behavior. After weighting to account for demographic differences between our sample and the larger student population, we found 29% of students across all states had hunted in the past. Students with previous hunting experience were likely to be white, male, from rural areas or hunting families, and pursuing degrees related to natural resources. When we grouped students into 1 of 4 categories with respect to hunting (i.e., non-hunters [50%], potential hunters [22%], active hunters [26%], and lapsed hunters [3%]), comparisons revealed differences based on demographic attributes, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Compared to active hunters, potential hunters were more likely to be females or racial and ethnic minorities, and less likely to experience social support for hunting. Potential hunters valued game meat and altruistic reasons for hunting, but they faced unique constraints due to lack of hunting knowledge and skills. Findings provide insights for marketing and programming designed to achieve R3 objectives with a focus on university students. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Considerable work indicates that instrumental responding is context-dependent, but the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Given the important role for the hippocampal formation in contextual processing, we hypothesized that reversible inactivation of the hippocampus would impair the context-dependence of active avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we used a two-way signaled active avoidance (SAA) task that requires rats to shuttle across a divided chamber during a tone CS in order to avoid a footshock US. After training, avoidance responding was assessed in an extinction test in both the training context and a novel context in a counterbalanced order. Rats performed significantly more avoidance responses in the training context than in the novel context, demonstrating the context-dependence of shuttle avoidance behavior. To examine the role of the hippocampus in the context-dependence of SAA, we reversibly inactivated either the dorsal (DH) or ventral hippocampus (VH) prior to testing. Inactivation of the VH eliminated the contextdependence of SAA and elevated avoidance responding in the novel context to levels similar to that expressed in the training context. In contrast, DH inactivation had no effect on avoidance in either context, and neither manipulation affected freezing behavior. Therefore, the integrity of the VH, but not DH, is required for the expression of the context-dependence of avoidance behavior.

AB  - This study explored the influence of pyrolysis temperatures on the properties of municipal sludge-based biochar (MSB) and evaluated the impact of MSB on humification and oxytetracycline (OTC, a broad-spectrum antibiotic) degradation in pig manure composting. Three types of MSB were produced from sewage sludge pyrolyzed at 300 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 700 degrees C, respectively. Results indicated that pyrolysis temperature adjusted the formation sequence of the functional groups in MSB, and higher pyrolysis temperatures enriched the aromaticity of the biochar and augmented the concentrations of humic precursor compounds. The MSB addition to pig manure composting enhanced the peak temperature and prolonged the thermophilic phase. Moreover, the MSB addition significantly increased the HI (humic acid/fulvic acid) values (1.6-2.57) compared with the control (1.28), with a more pronounced effect observed at higher biochar pyrolysis temperatures. Furthermore, the MSB reduced the half-life of OTC degradation (1.47-2.44 d) during composting, accelerating its degradation compared with the control (2.66 d). The study demonstrated that the MSB provided a substantial amount of humic precursor materials into the composting process while also expediting the degradation of organic matter, thereby enhancing the humification process. Moreover, the extended duration of the thermophilic phase accelerated the degradation of OTC and shortened its half-life. Notably, the MSB at 700 degrees C had the best performance compared with other MSBs.

AB  - Ghrelin has been well known as an orexigenic hormone that regulates appetite and energy metabolism in animals. Recent studies imply the regulatory function of ghrelin on ovary development, however, the mechanism about the effects of ghrelin on key hormonal receptors in ovary is far away from systematically understood. The present study aimed to analyze the tissue distribution of ghrelin and related genes and elucidate the regulation of ghrelin on key hormonal receptors in ovary of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). High expression of ghrelin and ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) was found in the ovary compared to heart, kidney, spleen, muscle, brain, liver, gill and intestine. To understand the regulatory function of ghrelin on ovarian development, the effects of ghrelin on the key hormone receptors participated in ovarian maturation were determined by ghrelin, acylghrelin and octanoic acid (substrate in the ghrelin acylation system) treatments with 1, 10 and 100 nM concentration. The in vivo study showed that all the 1, 10 and 100 nM ghrelin treatment stimulated folliclestimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) expression compared to the control. Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER alpha) was depressed by 10 nM acyl-ghrelin compared to the control, while ER beta 1 and ER beta 2 could be inhibited by 1 nM and 10 nM octanoic acid treatment compared to the control, respectively. The present results for the first time provided novel information about the regulatory role of ghrelin on key hormonal receptors in ovarian of grass carp providing potential new ideas for cultivating of grass carp broodstock.

AB  - Feeding activities by fishes are among the key ecological processes that sustain coral reef functioning. Those trophic-based processes are known to vary across space and across seasons or years. However, there is still little knowledge about their variability within and between days as well as whether these processes are dominated by the same species across time. Using remote underwater cameras, we quantified rates of three feeding activities (corallivory, herbivory and invertivory) for three one-hour time slots (morning, midday, afternoon) over two days on two coral reefs around Mayotte Island (Western Indian Ocean). Feeding activities were highly variable at within and between-day scales and concentrated in a few pulses. Herbivory was the highest in the afternoon which aligns with previous findings regarding activity of herbivorous fishes. Corallivory was the highest in the morning, which highlights the advantage of long-duration benthic remote underwater videos to accurately assess all trophic activities. Trophic-related processes were dominated by the same few species in both sites and across time of the day. This study pinpoints the importance of including within-day and between-day variations when studying ecological processes, as neglecting these variations may introduce biases into our understanding of these processes.

AB  - The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) has considerable value for conservation. However, their development has been limited to relatively few species of charismatic megafauna. Non-avian reptiles are incredibly speciose and up to a third are threatened with extinction, but progress developing and implementing ARTs into conservation programs has lagged other taxonomic groups. Here, we describe successful artificial insemination of an endangered snake using frozen-thawed semen within the context of a species recovery program. Six female Louisiana pinesnakes (Pituophis ruthveni) were inseminated with frozen-thawed semen from six donor males resulting in oviposition of two fertile cutches producing three viable hatchlings. Paternity of hatchlings was confirmed using genetic analyses. This is the first documented case of successful artificial insemination using frozen-thawed semen in a reptile and is a significant step forward in the conservation of reptiles. The methods described here hold the potential for zoos and conservation organizations to diversify reptile gene pools in captivity and the transfer of genetic material between wild populations and captive breeding programs. In addition, the ability to use frozen-thawed semen for AI emphasizes the conservation value of establishing cryobanks for reptile semen. The development and implementation of ARTs in recovery programs for reptiles has great conservation potential and warrants exploration across a broader range of species.

AB  - Batoid (rays and skates) populations are declining worldwide, with unknown ecological consequences due to lacking consolidated data on the trophic ecology of these species. Such trends are particularly disconcerting in Mexican waters, where batoids are heavily exploited by commercial fisheries. To assess the current state of knowledge of batoid diet in this region, we conducted a meta-analysis of 54 published stomach content analysis studies. Trophic niche was assessed from 44 total species, including variations due to sex, ontogeny, season, and region, as well as trophic overlap among species. The species assessed belonged to the taxonomic families Urotrygonidae, Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae, Mobulidae, Rhinopteridae, Aetobatidae, Gymnuridae, Rhinobatidae, Rajidae, Arhyncobatidae, and Narcinidae. Most of the diet studies to date were conducted in the Mexican Pacific (n = 24), whereas only three studies have come from the Mexican Atlantic, with 27 additional studies coming from other American countries from the tropical and subtropical region. Crustaceans were reported in more than 50% of the species assessed and were also generally the most important prey item, with either high (76%-100%) and medium-high (51%-75%) importance based on dietary indices from the literature reviewed. While the diet of 40 species (91%) consisted of more than one prey type, feeding strategy analysis (Levin and Shannon-Wiener indices) of 27 species indicated that 25 were specialists and two generalists. Species diets varied with ontogeny (20%), sex (11%), region (11%), and seasonality (9%). According to the reviewed studies, interspecific diet overlap was evident in 36% of species, mainly in the family Urotrygonidae. Batoids were grouped into four trophic guilds: crustacivores (68.1%), annelidivores (primarily polychaetes) (13.6%), molluscivores (11.3%), and piscivores (6.8%), based on the literature reviewed. This study showed that most of the batoids had a specialist crustacean-based diet. Future research should focus on species devoid of dietary data to encapsulate the trophic niche breadth of this group in Mexican waters, particularly from the Mexican Atlantic and surrounding regions.

AB  - Simple Summary The Cabra Blanca de Rasquera is a native goat breed from Catalonia (Spain) facing the danger of extinction. To preserve its genetic diversity, ex situ conservation programs for semen cryopreservation and the development of a genetic sperm bank are of major importance. However, the post-thaw sperm quality in this species is still a major concern. Therefore, the aim of this research work was to establish an approach in the thawing protocol of cryopreserved sperm bank doses of this breed in order to achieve a better post-thaw sperm quality and improve reproductive outcomes through artificial insemination. Since seminal plasma has been found to provide a source of nutrients, improve sperm motility, and prevent premature activation during migration of spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract, our study proposed to assess the effect of the addition of 20% seminal plasma (SP) during a 3 h incubation period under in vitro conditions mimicking the in vivo survivability of thawed sperm, in relation to donor age, the season of collection, and melatonin implants of the males in the non-breeding season. However, the strategy of adding seminal plasma to the sperm after thawing failed to improve buck post-thawed sperm quality, thus further investigation is needed. In order to achieve a higher post-thaw buck sperm quality, an approach in the thawing protocol of cryopreserved sperm doses under in vitro capacitation conditions mimicking the in vivo female environment was studied. Therefore, functional and kinetic characteristics of buck thawed sperm from males of different ages, the season of collection, and melatonin implanted males in the non-breeding season were assessed after 3 h of incubation in an in vitro fertilization (IVF) media with 20% of buck seminal plasma (SP). Previously, fresh ejaculates were collected via artificial vagina from eight males of the Cabra Blanca de Rasquera breed during two consecutive years in breeding and non-breeding periods. Prior to semen collection in non-breeding seasons, males were split into two groups: one group was implanted with melatonin, while the other was not. In each group, semen samples were pooled, centrifuged, and diluted in an extender containing 15% powdered egg yolk and 5% glycerol before freezing. After thawing, sperm were washed and incubated in three different media: (a) control media (modified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (b) IVF commercial media, and (c) IVF media + 20% SP. Sperm motility was evaluated by CASA, while plasma and acrosome membrane integrity, mitochondria activity, and DNA fragmentation were analysed by flow cytometer at 0 h and after 3 h incubation. A significant reduction in motility, mitochondrial activity, plasma, and acrosome membrane integrity were observed after incubation in the presence of SP, although similar to that observed in IVF media alone. DNA integrity was not affected under in vitro capacitation conditions, regardless of SP addition. In conclusion, the addition of SP failed to improve post-thaw buck sperm quality under in vitro conditions irrespective of male age, the season of collection, and melatonin implant.

AB  - Sitophilus zeamais (maize weevil) is one of the most destructive pests that seriously affects the quantity and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, little is known about the constitutive defense mechanism of wheat kernels against maize weevils. In this study, we obtained a highly resistant variety RIL-116 and a highly susceptible variety after two years of screening. The morphological observations and germination rates of wheat kernels after feeding ad libitum showed that the degree of infection in RIL-116 was far less than that in RIL-72. The combined analysis of metabolome and transcriptome of RIL-116 and RIL-72 wheat kernels revealed differentially accumulated metabolites were mainly enriched in flavonoids biosynthesis-related pathway, followed by glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. Several flavonoids metabolites were significantly up-accumulated in resistant variety RIL-116. In addition, the expression of structural genes and transcription factors (TFs) related to flavonoids biosynthesis were up-regulated to varying degrees in RIL-116 than RIL-72. Taken together, these results indicated that the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids contributes the most to wheat kernels defense against maize weevils. This study not only provides insights into the constitutive defense mechanism of wheat kernels against maize weevils, but may also play an important role in the breeding of resistant varieties.

AB  - Herbivore performance can be impacted by elevated CO2 or insecticides. However, there is insufficient data on how invasive and native species are affected by these dual stresses. Frankliniella occidentalis and F. intonsa are economically important pests. We evaluated the direct effects of elevated CO2 on the sensitivity of thrips to spinetoram, and recorded their population fitness, as well as measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activities in adults under short-term (3rd generation) and long-term (30th generation) exposures to these two stresses. Thrips' resistance to spinetoram was accelerated by elevated CO2, and was strongly displayed by F. occidentalis than by F. intonsa. In the 3rd generation, exposure to the two stresses significantly prolonged the longevity of adult F. occidentalis and increased its fecundity, sex ratio, and net reproductive rate (R0), whereas they only increased the fecundity of F. intonsa. Notably, the sex ratio of the former (2.15 +/- 0.35) was significantly higher than that of the latter (0.65 +/- 0.03). On the other hand, CYP450 activity in F. occidentalis was significantly lower than that of control. At the 30th generation, exposure to the two stresses reduced the population fitness of the two species. Additionally, the fecundity, sex ratio, R0, intrinsic rate of increase (r), and finite rate of increase (lambda) of F. occidentalis were significantly higher than that of F. intonsa. Besides, AChE activities in both species were significantly lower than that of the control. We concluded that increased CO2 and spinetoram may hasten the displacement of the native species, F. intonsa by the invasive species, F. occidentalis in the future.

AB  - Plants respond adaptively to herbivore stress in order to maintain fitness. Upon herbivore attack, plants emit blends of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that differ from those that are constitutively emitted. These defense responses are typically specific to the identity of the attacking herbivore and often linked to the herbivore's feeding guild (e.g. chewing, phloem-feeding). Herbivores use plant volatiles to locate suitable host plants and changes in volatile emissions can affect host-plant location. Therefore, herbivores from separate feeding guilds can interact indirectly through the modulation of plant responses. In this study we tested how damage by an herbivore from one feeding guild affected the host-plant choice of an herbivore from a separate feeding guild, and vice versa. A chewing herbivore, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and a phloem feeding herbivore, the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), were assayed in olfactometers to assess behavioral responses to odors emitted by potato plants (Solanum tuberosum) that were damaged by herbivores from the other feeding guild. Leptinotarsa decemlineata oriented more frequently towards undamaged plants compared to M. persicae damaged plants. Surprisingly, M. persicae preferred plants that were damaged by L. decemlineata, although previous studies had shown that they perform worse on these plants. Distinct differences were detected in the volatile profiles of herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants. Leptinotarsa decemlineata induced stronger volatile emissions compared to undamaged control plants, while M. persicae tended to suppress volatile emissions. These herbivores demonstrate contrasting induction of plant volatiles and behavioral responses. Exploring the nature of co-occurring herbivores and how they perceive potential hosts can play a significant role in understanding the ecological functions and community dynamics of plant plasticity and interactions with a variety of herbivores.

AB  - Bromeliads provide habitat and food resources for various organisms. Besides the nectar and pollen, the leaf and fruit tissues of these plants supply food for various animal groups. Among the groups that feed on bromeliads, herbivores are the ones that cause the most damage to these plants; among such organisms, some are well known, such as butterfly and moth caterpillars. Here we will describe some of the ecological relationships between the butterflies Strymon serapio and moths Castnia invaria in association with the rupicolous habitat-forming bromeliad Encholirium spectabile. In rocky outcrops of the Brazilian Semiarid Caatinga, S. serapio caterpillars were frequently observed in the blooms of E. spectabile and adults in the leaves, as well as adults of C. invaria. However, in C. invaria the larvae develop inside the bromeliads. Adults of both species were associated with E. spectabile throughout the year in the study area. We observed S. serapio eggs and larvae mainly during the beginning of the dry season, and the eggs of C. invaria, occur mainly during the rainy season. Regarding the daily activity period, the two species show diurnal habits. Caterpillars of S. serapio develop mutualistic relations with ants of the genus Crematogaster in the blooms of E. spectabile. This is the first record for this kind of ant-butterfly interactions taking place in Encholirum bromeliads, although they have already been cited for other species of Bromeliaceae. The record of these interactions in E. spectabile suggests that these bromeliads are relevant for local biodiversity, also regarding interactions with species of commercial interest, which use the E. spectabile as a host plant..

AB  - The primary function of cuticular hydrocarbons is to keep insects from losing water. However, cuticular hydrocarbons also may mediate chemical communication in a number of species. In this study, we investigated the effect of the extraction method, natal host, and age (maturation) on the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of the West Indian fruit fly, Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Cuticular hydrocarbons from female and male adults of different natal hosts (Mangifera indica L. or Spondias mombin L. [both Anacardiaceae]) and age were extracted by solvent extraction and direct contact solid-phase microextraction. Cuticular hydrocarbons were identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. In total, we recorded 12 compounds, but only 9 of them were identified. The identified cuticular hydrocarbons were linear alkanes (n-heneicosane, n-nonacosane, and n-hentriacontane), alkenes (n-heneicosene, n-tricosene, n-nonacosene, and n-hentriacontene), and branched alkanes (2-methyloctacosane and 2-methyl-triacontane). There were no qualitative differences between sampling techniques. The solvent extraction method extracted more cuticular hydrocarbons from flies reared on mango compared to those extracted from flies reared on hog plum. In contrast, solid-phase microextraction extracted a higher concentration of cuticular hydrocarbons from flies reared on hog plum than to those extracted from flies reared on mango. Higher levels of 2-methyl-octacosane and 2-methyl-triacontane were detected with solvent extraction than with solid-phase microextraction; the opposite occurred with hentriacontane and unknown compound 2. The compounds n-heneicosene, n-heneicosane, and n-tricosene were present in mature males but not in mature females; n-nonacosene was found only in the mature flies of both sexes.

AB  - Cell migration is orchestrated by molecular networks supporting motility. The scaffolds ERC1/ELKS and Liprin-alpha 1 sustain cell migration and invasion by assembling dynamic plasma membrane-associated platforms. ERC1/ELKS forms cytoplasmic condensates with liquid-like behavior. In this study we tested whether the ability of ERC1 to form condensates is relevant to its function in cell motility. We identified the shortest N-terminal region of ERC1 sufficient to drive phase separation in vitro and in cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching confirmed the dynamic behavior of ERC1(1-244) condensates. Surprisingly, deletion of ERC1(1-244) including an intrinsically disordered region did not abolish the ability of ERC1D Delta N to form condensates. Although the interactions of ERC1 Delta N with partners were unaffected, the biophysical properties of ERC1 Delta N condensates were altered, with consequences on cell motility. These findings highlight the importance of ERC1/ELKS to assemble functional networks, and show that altering the properties of ERC1-driven condensates interferes with tumor cell motility.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations force animals to adjust glucocorticoids (GCs) secretion and release to current conditions. GCs are a widely used proxy of an individual stress level. While short-term elevation in GCs is arguably beneficial for fitness components, previous studies have documented that the relationship between long-term baseline GCs elevation and fitness components can vary according to ecological and individual factors and according to the life-history of the species studied. Using longitudinal data on roe deer Capreolus capreolus from two populations facing markedly different environmental contexts, we tested whether baseline GC levels negatively correlate with body mass - a trait positively associated with demographic individual performance - on the short- to long-term. In support, higher baseline GC concentrations were associated to lighter body mass, both measured during the same capture event, in adults of both populations. Overall, we showed that despite the marked environmental and demographic differences between populations and despite the between-sex differences in life history (i.e. reproductive tactics), the relationship between body mass and GCs is consistent across environmental contexts, but might differ according to the life history stage of an individual. This work opens promising perspectives to further explore the relationship between GC and fitness-related traits according to life history stages in free-ranging mammals across seasonal and environmental contexts. The timing and context-dependence of GC levels highlight the complexity of studying stress responses in the wild.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil environment poses a serious threat to crop safety and even public health. In this study, the fate of ARGs in the soil was investigated during the growth period of pakchoi and after harvesting with the application of different kinds of fertilizers. The result showed that increasing rate of soil ARGs during the growth period of pakchoi followed the order of composted manure commercial fertilizer > mineral fertilizer. After harvesting, soil ARGs abundance treated with mineral fertilizer, commercial fertilizer or composted manure significantly increased by 0.63, 3.19 and 8.65 times (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with the non-fertilized soil. The ARGs abundance in the pakchoi treated with composted manure was significantly higher than that of treatments with mineral fertilizer and commercial organic fertilizer. These findings indicated the application of composted pig manure would significantly increase the pollution load of ARGs in farmland soil and plant, and also promote the proliferation of farmland ARGs. Principal component analysis suggested that bacterial communities might have a significant influence on ARGs changes during the growth period of pakchoi. Network analysis further indicated ARGs changes may be mainly related to their host bacteria (including Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia and Bacilli). The results provided a proper method and useful information on reducing transmission risk of ARGs and control the propagation of ARGs in agricultural activities.

AB  - Developing countries often grapple with the dual challenges of resource scarcity and poverty in their pursuit of sustainable industrial growth. This study offers a systematic and quantitative evaluation of forestry policy effectiveness in China since 2003-an area that has received limited attention in empirical policy analysis. Using text mining techniques in conjunction with the Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) Index, we construct a structured assessment framework to examine the internal coherence and implementation focus of key forestryrelated policies. Our analysis highlights the need to advance industrial ecology, especially in wood processing and paper manufacturing, and to develop ecologically centered industries focused on non-timber forest products. The evaluation points to a high policy consistency in sectors like paper and camellia oil production. However, a notable misalignment between policy agents and intended beneficiaries highlights the need for improved stakeholder engagement and adaptive policy design. We recommend enhancing participatory mechanisms and introducing market-based instruments to strengthen policy performance. The findings provide critical insights for ecological policy optimization and the sustainable transformation of forestry industries in China and other resource-constrained economies.

AB  - In a 70-day study, 36 Jabbali and Sahrawi bucks, aged 11 months, were utilized to evaluate the effects of different levels of spirulina dietary supplement (SP) on carcass characteristics, fatty acid profile, and meat quality traits in Omani goat breeds. The goats were put into six groups of six bucks, each at random. The diet consisted of a conventional concentrate feed ration (CFR) without spirulina (CON), and the CFR diet supplemented with spirulina at the levels of 2 g/head daily (T1) and 4 g/head daily (T2). In general, Sahrawi bucks showed a highly significant response to SP feeding compared with Jabbali bucks. The treatment groups, especially T1, showed a significant increase in average daily gain and carcass traits (body length, leg length, and the rack weight) compared with the CON group of Sahrawi bucks. The weights of omental and kidney fat were also significantly higher in T1 compared with CON and T2 groups of Sahrawi goats, while they were significantly higher in T2 compared with CON and T1 groups of Jabbali goats. Carcass profile and meat quality, including ultimate ph and meat color lightness (L*) were increased significantly with dietary spirulina in both LD and SM muscles of Sahrawi goats. Most of the Sfa, Mufa, Pufa, Pufa n-6, Pufa n-3, and n-6/n-3 ratios of the LD showed significant differences in diets supplemented with SP compared with CON for Sahrawi bucks, while some of them were significant in Jabbali bucks. The LD muscle of Sahrawi goats fed diets supplemented with SP of the T1 group significantly decreased in the amounts of pentadecanoic and margaric acids compared with the T2 and CON groups. The study concluded that incorporating SP (2 g and 4 g/head daily) into the diet of Omani goats, especially Sahrawi goats, can increase growth performance, as well as improve fatty acid composition and meat quality.

AB  - Introduction and Objective. Hippobosca equina (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), is a widespread blood-feeding ectoparasite associated with the forest ecosystem. The insect is characterized by a wide host range and low host specificity, which increases the risk of feeding on animals that constitute a reservoir of transmissible pathogens, including Bartonella spp. Materials and Method. Hippobosca equina adults were collected from humans and companion animals within a continental mesotrophic oak-pine mixed forest in eastern Poland. DNA was isolated by the ammonia method, and isolates obtained from single individuals were tested by PCR method for the presence of 5 vector-borne pathogens. In case of the positive results, the amplicons were sequenced and examined by a BLAST search. Results. The PCR analysis of DNA isolates obtained from 100 H. equina specimens revealed the presence of the RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene ( rpoB ) of the genus Bartonella, , in 1% of the studied insects, i.e. one H. equina female. The rpoB gene haplotype of Bartonella sp. reported in this study, was identical to a Bartonella sp. sequence obtained from deer keds in Lithuania, and very closely related to strains with zoonotic potential. None of the H. equina specimens studied was positive for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, , Babesia spp., and Coxiella burnetii. . Conclusions. The study indicates the need to screen the occurrence of Bartonella spp., both in potential vectors and reservoirs of this pathogen in various habitats.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the main critical organ during internal exposure of the body to radioactive particles (RPs). We performed an experimental study of the therapy for acute local injuries in the form of ulcerative gastroenteritis caused by irradiation of animals with artificial highly active RPs. The etiological factor was beta-radiation emitted by Dy-165 (42%), Pr-142 (45%), and Y-90 (13%) or U-235 fission products caused by thermal neutrons, simulating the radioactive decay of 10-hour-old nuclear fission products. Study of the specific activity of various chemical or biological substances was carried out on Wistar rats, outbred guinea pigs, and Prekos sheep. Radioactive particles were suspended by sparging in a 2.5% potato starch gel and injected into rodents intragastrically through a metal probe using a syringe. In experiments with sheep, RPs were given to animals with food. The efficacy of drugs for treatment of radiation injury with different mechanisms of action was tested: (i) drugs that increase natural resistance, (ii) drugs that have a local wound-healing effect, (iii) a saline laxative, and (iv) cholinomimetics. To evaluate the efficiency of treatment for radiation gastroenterocolitis, clinical and morphological parameters as well as survival rates were used. Good therapeutic efficacy of Glauber's salt, vinylin, carbacholinum, and pilocarpine, in combination with dimethyl sulfoxide and prodigiosan in combination with carbacholinum and bicillin-5, was found. It was manifested by a significant decrease in the intensity of injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, accelerated healing of radiation ulcers, and an increase in the survival rate of animals. Our results indicate the importance of further investigation of the treatments of local radiation injuries to the gastrointestinal tract caused by RPs, using new formulations, as well as complex application of pharmacological agents.

AB  - Misuse of insecticides such as thiamethoxam (TMX) not only affects the quality of tea but also leaves residues in tea. Therefore, exploring the metabolic mechanisms of TMX in tea plants can evaluate effects of pesticides on the environment and human health. Here, effects of TMX on tea plants were studied. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content reached a maximum of 12.59 nmol/g fresh weight (FW) on 1st d under X (the recommended dose: 0.015 kg a.i./ha) of TMX. Under 2 X (0.03 kg a.i./ha), the catalase, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activity were increased by 45.0 %, 55.5 %, and 49.7 % at 7 d respectively. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that TMX significantly affected amino acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis and glutathione metabolism, and induced the expression of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid dehydrogenase genes ( CsHDH1 and CsHDH3) and glutathione S-transferase gene ( CsGST1 ). The three genes were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana for the first time to verify the function of TMX degradation, with the degradation rate of 59.2 %-85.3 % at X. This study elucidated the response of tea plants to abiotic stress on the molecular-scale perspective, and the molecular approaches could serve as a model for the study on pesticide metabolism in plants. Synopsis: Degradation ability of CsHDH1, CsHDH3 and CsGST1 genes to thiamethoxam was verified for the first time, providing genetic resources for phytoremediation of pollutants.

AB  - Artificial light can affect eyeball development and increase myopia rate. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) degrades the extracellular matrix, and induces its remodeling, while tissue inhibitor of matrix MMP-2 (TIMP-2) inhibits active MMP-2. The present study aimed to look into how refractive development and the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in the guinea pigs' remodeled sclerae are affected by artificial light with varying spectral compositions. Three weeks old guinea pigs were randomly assigned to groups exposed to five different types of light: natural light, LED light with a low color temperature, three full spectrum artificial lights, i.e. E light (continuous spectrum in the range of similar to 390-780 nm), G light (a blue peak at 450 nm and a small valley 480 nm) and F light (continuous spectrum and wavelength of 400 nm below filtered). A-scan ultrasonography was used to measure the axial lengths of their eyes, every two weeks throughout the experiment. Following twelve weeks of exposure to light, the sclerae were observed by optical and transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the MMP-2 and TIMP-2 protein and mRNA expression levels in the sclerae. After four, six, eight, ten, and twelve weeks of illumination, the guinea pigs in the LED and G light groups had axial lengths that were considerably longer than the animals in the natural light group while the guinea pigs in the E and F light groups had considerably shorter axial lengths than those in the LED group. Following twelve weeks of exposure to light, the expression of the scleral MMP-2 protein and mRNA were, from low to high, N group, E group, F group, G group, LED group; however, the expression of the scleral TIMP-2 protein and mRNA were, from high to low, N group, E group, F group, G group, LED group. The comparison between groups was statistically significant (p<0.01). Continuous, peaks-free or valleys-free artificial light with full-spectrum preserves remodeling of scleral extracellular matrix in guinea pigs by downregulating MMP-2 and upregulating TIMP-2, controlling eye axis elongation, and inhibiting the onset and progression of myopia.

AB  - This study examines the isotopic potential of mammoth remains from three paleontological sites in the southeast of the West Siberian Plain (SEWS): Shestakovo, Krasnoyarskaya Kurya, and Volchia Griva. We analysed oxygen isotopes from 29 mammoth enamel and tusk samples and horse and deer enamel samples. We verified sample preservation using ATR-FTIR and obtained delta 18 Op, delta 18 Oc, and reconstructed delta 18 Ow values for 28-22 ka cal BP. Preservation assessments revealed variable preservation conditions. Our findings indicate an increase of 1.4 parts per thousand parts per thousand in reconstructed delta 18 Ow values from glacial levels at 28-23 ka to late-glacial conditions at ca. 17-15.5 ka, likely reflecting climatic warming at the end of the Pleistocene. The extensive fossil material at these sites offers significant potential for further Last Glacial Maximum studies.

AB  - Background. Caranx hippos is among the species of the jack family fished in Mexico, and it is of great economic importance and ecological. However, studies regarding its trophic anatomy are scarce. Objectives. Analyze and describe the visceral skeleton, visceral musculature, and dentition of C. hippos. Methods. 20 specimens of this species were fixed in formaldehyde, preserved in ethylic alcohol, and analyzed. Their anatomy was compared with the other four species of the Carangidae family of the Gulf of Mexico. Results. It is recognized that the organization of the buccopharyngeal cavity of C. hippos corresponds to the morpho-logical pattern of the piscivorous teleostean, nevertheless, some important characters are identified in the visceral skeleton, particularly in the palatine, hyomandibular, sphenoid, and suborbital 3 bones. Additionally, in the visceral musculature, some modifications of the dilatator operculi, levator arcus palatini, and adductor mandibulae muscles stand out. The presence of small plates with thin teeth is notable in several parts of the buccopharyngeal mucosa. Conclusions. The analysis of the buccopharyngeal cavity indicates that C. hippos is a species with carnivorous habits, mainly piscivorous.

AB  - Low temperatures greatly influence newly introduced species, and increased cold tolerance can facilitate their establishment in new environments. The invasive alien species Ambrosia artemisiifolia is distributed at high latitudes and altitudes, where it suffers more from cold stress than it would at low latitudes or altitudes. Whether cold stress influences the accumulation of cryoprotectants and cold tolerance in A. artemisiifolia, and further influences the cold tolerance of its biological control agent, Ophraella communa, through feeding remain unknown. We investigated the levels of cryoprotectants and metabolic changes in A. artemisiifolia. We found that the level of total sugar, trehalose, proline, and other cold responsible metabolites increased in A. artemisiifolia after rapid cold-hardening (RCH) treatment, when compared to normal plants. These indicated that RCH treatment could improve the cold-hardiness of A. artemisiifolia. We then investigated the levels of cryoprotectants and metabolic changes in O. communa. We found that O. communa fed on RCH-treated A. artemisiifolia had higher levels of total sugar, trehalose, proline, glycerol, lipid, lower water content, lower super-cooling point, and increased cold tolerance compared to O. communa fed on normal A. artemisiifolia. This suggested that O. communa fed on cold-hardened A. artemisiifolia could increase its cold tolerance. Results showed a trophic transmission in insect cold tolerance.

AB  - Main conclusion Elms, which have received insect eggs as a 'warning' of larval herbivory, enhance their anti-herbivore defences by accumulating salicylic acid and amplifying phenylpropanoid-related transcriptional and metabolic responses to hatching larvae. Plant responses to insect eggs can result in intensified defences against hatching larvae. In annual plants, this egg-mediated effect is known to be associated with changes in leaf phenylpropanoid levels. However, little is known about how trees-long-living, perennial plants-improve their egg-mediated, anti-herbivore defences. The role of phytohormones and the phenylpropanoid pathway in egg-primed anti-herbivore defences of a tree species has until now been left unexplored. Using targeted and untargeted metabolome analyses we studied how the phenylpropanoid pathway of Ulmus minor responds to egg-laying by the elm leaf beetle and subsequent larval feeding. We found that when compared to untreated leaves, kaempferol and quercetin concentrations increased in feeding-damaged leaves with prior egg deposition, but not in feeding-damaged leaves without eggs. PCR analyses revealed that prior insect egg deposition intensified feeding-induced expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), encoding the gateway enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Salicylic acid (SA) concentrations were higher in egg-treated, feeding-damaged leaves than in egg-free, feeding-damaged leaves, but SA levels did not increase in response to egg deposition alone-in contrast to observations made of Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results indicate that prior egg deposition induces a SA-mediated response in elms to feeding damage. Furthermore, egg deposition boosts phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in subsequently feeding-damaged leaves by enhanced PAL expression, which results in the accumulation of phenylpropanoid derivatives. As such, the elm tree shows similar, yet distinct, responses to insect eggs and larval feeding as the annual model plant A. thaliana.

AB  - Although anthropogenic change is often gradual, the impacts on animal populations may be precipitous if physiological processes create tipping points between energy gain, reproduction or survival. We use 25 years of behavioural, diet and demographic data from elephant seals to characterise their relationships with lifetime fitness. Survival and reproduction increased with mass gain during long foraging trips preceding the pupping seasons, and there was a threshold where individuals that gained an additional 4.8% of their body mass (26 kg, from 206 to 232 kg) increased lifetime reproductive success three-fold (from 1.8 to 4.9 pups). This was due to a two-fold increase in pupping probability (30% to 76%) and a 7% increase in reproductive lifespan (6.0 to 6.4 years). The sharp threshold between mass gain and reproduction may explain reproductive failure observed in many species and demonstrates how small, gradual reductions in prey from anthropogenic disturbance could have profound implications for animal populations.

AB  - Coccotorus beijingensis Lin et Li, 1990 belongs to Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Curculioninae, Anthonomini. It is a herbivorous insect that damages Celtis bungeana Blume (Ulmaceae) by affecting branch growth. The mitochondrial genome of C. beijingensis was sequenced and annotated to better identify C. beijingensis and related species. The total length of the C. beijingensis mitochondrial genome was 17,071 bp, contained 37 typical genes (13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes) and two control regions (total length: 2,292 bp). Mitochondrial genome composition, nucleotide composition and codon usage are similar to those of other sequenced Curculionidae mitogenomes. All protein-coding genes initiated with ATN and TTG codons and ended with TAA, TAG or incomplete stop codons (TA, T). In addition, analyses of pairwise genetic distances between individual PCGs in Curculionidae species showed that ATP8 was the least conserved gene, while COI was the most conserved. Twenty-one transfer RNAs had typical cloverleaf structures, while trnS1 lacked dihydrouridine (DHU) arms. ML and BI analyses, based on 13 PCGs and two rRNAs from ten species of Curculionidae, strongly support the relationships between C. beijingensis and species of the genus Anthonomus: ((An. eugenii+ An. rubi) + C. beijingensis + (An. pomorum+ An. rectirostris)) (BS = 100; PP = 1). Our phylogenetic analyses could mean that the genus Coccotorus should be sunk under Anthonomus, but more taxon sampling is needed to verify this result.

AB  - In 2008 the Italian government classified the Bussi sul Tirino area (Central Italy) as Site of National Interest destined to remediation which, unfortunately, has not yet begun. The decision followed >20 years of illegal dumping of industrial wastes, lasting from 1984 to 2005, that generated the biggest illegal toxic waste disposal site in Europe. The contamination profile of the site was mainly characterized by PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PAHs, chlorinated solvents, Hg, and Pb. Due to the health concern of the population and local authorities, an extensive monitoring and biomonitoring campaign was carried out in 2017-2018, checking the site-specific pollutants in local food (free-range hens' eggs, milk from grazing sheep and goats, wild edible mushrooms, and drinking water), environmental (air and freshwaters) and biological (human urine) matrices. A total of 314 samples were processed, obtaining 3217 analytical data that were compared with regulatory limits, when available, and values reported by international literature.
   The sum PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs ranged from 0.24 to 3.6 pg TEQ g(-1) fat, and from 0.46 to 8.3 pg TEQ g(-1) fat, respectively in milk in eggs, in line with the maximum levels established by CE Regulations except for an egg sample. As regards PAHs, all our results were lower than the literature data, as well as for Hg and Pb. Outdoor air showed levels of chlorinated solvents ranging from <LOD to 36 mu g m(-3), and freshwaters from 0.21 to 2.8 mu g L-1. All drinking water samples resulted compliant with the maximum levels established by the current EU directive.
   Despite the severe pollution of the illegal dumping site and the remediation not yet carried out, the local environment and the population living in Bussi and surroundings seem not to be affected by significant exposure to the toxics characterizing the landfill.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of forage species adapted to the tropical region of Ecuador on gas production, enteric methane, digestion, and ruminal fermentation. The tree forage evaluated were C. arborea, E. fusca, B. forficata, E. poeppigiana, C. argentea, G. sepium, C. tora, and F. macrophylla. Ruminal fluid of four adult sheep fistulated with permanent cannulas in the rumen was used in the in vitro gas production technique. The in vitro gas production parameters were lower (P < 0.05) in the C. arborea (A = 41.68 mL gas/g DM, c = 0.044%/h and Lag = 1.654 h) and the average gas production rate for B. forficata was 1.017 mL/h (P < 0.05). C. arborea presented higher (P = 0.0001) effective degradation and real DM digestibility (40.461 g/kg and 82.51 mg/g, respectively). With respect to VFA, the highest (P < 0.05) proportion of acetic, propionic, and butyric was observed in C. arborea, G. sepium, and E. poeppigiana (72.52, 23.09, and 7.44 mol/100 mol, respectively) and the lowest (P = 0.0001) ratio: acetic/propionic was observed in G. sepium (2.92 mol/100 mol). The content of NH3-N (mg/L) showed no difference. The lowest (P = 0.0001) methane production was observed in C. arborea (1.23 mL CH4/g DM). The use of forage species of tropical climate rich in secondary metabolites in ruminant diets has the capacity to reduce the gas production and enteric methane; however, this is at the expense of the reduction of the fermentation of organic matter in the rumen.

AB  - The objective of the present research was the examination of how varying proportions of an acorn diet affects the deposition of subcutaneous fat and the composition of fatty acids (FAs) in Yuxi black pigs. Ninety pigs (with a balanced sex ratio and a similar weight 99.60 +/- 2.32 kg) were stochastically assigned to the control group (CON) and the dietary acorn experimental groups (AEG). The CON was fed basal diets and the AEG1, AEG2, AEG3, and AEG4 groups were provided with dietary regimens comprising twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty per cent acorns, respectively. Each group consisted of six pigs, with three replicates. The breeding cycle was four months. The results demonstrated that, in comparison with the CON group, the lean meat rate was significantly increased in all test groups (p < 0.05), while in backfat thickness, loin eye area, carcass weight and slaughter rate was no significant difference (p > 0.05). The serum TC/HDL (total cholesterol divided by high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) and TG/HDL (Triglyceride divided by high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) levels in the AEG1 and AEG2 groups were significantly lower than the CON group (p < 0.05). There was no significant effect on the composition of FAs (p > 0.05). The number of fat cells in subcutaneous back fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat was significantly increased, and the area of fat cells was decreased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of ATGL and HSL expression in the subcutaneous back fat, as well as ACC, FAS, ATGL, PPAR gamma, and HSL expression in the subcutaneous abdominal fat, were significantly increased in the AEG2 group compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of ACC, FAS, FABP4, PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, and FAS/HSL in the subcutaneous back fat, as well as FABP4, C/EBP alpha, and FAS/HSL in the subcutaneous abdominal fat, were significantly lower in the AEG2 group compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it has been found that a 30% acorn diet can inhibit subcutaneous fat deposition and enhance the nutritional value of pork and the health of Yuxi black pigs.

AB  - A decades-long decline in hunting participation jeopardizes state wildlife agency funding amid growing conservation and management challenges. College students are being recognized by states and non-governmental organizations as an important population for hunter recruitment and retention, fueling a proliferation of learn-to-hunt programs on college campuses. Nearly 3,000,000 students attend college in a state where they are not a resident and may face constraints to hunting. We analyzed hunting license residency statutes in each state to determine whether non-resident college students were addressed in statutes or policies, catalog statutory provisions that may exclude populations of students from hunting, and document how students' residency status affects the price of a deer and small game license. Nationwide, 29 states have statutes allowing non-resident college students to hunt at a resident rate. Among these states, we identified a patchwork of statutory requirements for non-resident students to be eligible for resident-rate licenses, including waiting periods, age restrictions, credit restrictions, and unclear or onerous purchasing procedures. Non-resident college students fell into a gray area of licensing policy in the 21 states without statutes addressing this group. In these states, students often needed to pay non-resident hunting license rates. Hunting licenses were substantially more expensive for non-resident college students in states without statutes addressing students, and license sales data from Montana, USA, indicated that high license prices are a constraint for student hunters. With college students becoming a focal point for hunter recruitment efforts, we identify statutory constraints to recruiting and retaining hunters on college campuses and help improve the effectiveness of learn-to-hunt programs on college campuses.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the levels of copper, zinc, and cobalt minerals in the blood serum of sheep under different nutritional conditions. The study was conducted on 1-2-year-old, healthy Norduz sheep raised at the Agricultural Research and Implementation Center of Van Yuzuncu Yil University. A total of 30 sheep made up three equal groups: a control group (group C; n=10) and two experimental groups (groups 1 and 2; n=10 in each group). Randomly selected animals from all the groups were grazed on low-quality pastures during a 4-week experiment. Each animal in group C was supplied with a total of 900 g day(-1) of feed containing 850 g day(-1) of mixed grass-clover and 50 g day(-1) of barley. Each animal in groups 1 and 2 was supplied with 850 g day(-1) of mixed grass-clover and weekly increasing quantities of barley during the experiment as follows: 915 g day(-1) in the first week, and 945 g day(-1), 960 g day(-1), 980 g day(-1), in the second, third and fourth weeks, respectively. Animals in the second group were additionally fed with 500 g day(-1) of feed concentrate per head throughout the 4-week experimental period, unlike the other groups. This study determined that - in addition to pasture grazing - feeding with mixed grass-clover hay, extra barley and concentrates should be provided to ensure adequate Cu levels. Moreover, it was also found that pasture grazing could be sufficient for Zn intake, in contrast to Co levels, which fall below normal limits even if the quality of a diet is improved.

AB  - A predator-prey interaction occurs between the asterinid seastars Meridiastra calcar and Parvulastra exigua, which are sympatric on the shores of southeast Australia. These seastars are important as omnivorous predators/scavengers (M. calcar) and surface grazing herbivores (P. exigua). Meridiastra calcar inhabits the lower shore, whilst P. exigua occupies the mid to high shore and they can co-occur in the mid-intertidal zone. Parvulastra exigua exhibits a fleeing response when they encounter M. calcar. We investigated this response to determine the cues that elicit this behaviour. We also determined if M. calcar moves toward P. exigua. Physical contact with M. calcar resulted in an 8.6-fold increase in velocity of P. exigua compared to basal locomotion. Water conditioned by M. calcar (chemosensory cue only) also elicited an increase in velocity, but this was lower, a 3.5-fold increase. The escape trajectory of P. exigua was most linear, 180 degrees away from the point of touch when contacted with M. calcar. In contrast, while touch with a sham stimulus elicited some movement, velocity was low, and the direction of movement was not linear away from the point of stimulation. Meridiastra calcar did not move toward P. exigua in choice experiments, and this was not altered if P. exigua had been damaged. Our results suggest that the escape response of P. exigua is elicited by a physical touch from M. calcar and that they detect chemosensory cues from this predator. Chemosensory cues emanating from M. calcar populations in the lower intertidal zone may influence the behaviour of P. exigua to remain higher on the shore. This first study of a predator-prey interaction in intertidal seastars suggests that this behaviour influences their distribution across the tidal gradient.

AB  - The pathophysiology of epilepsy has been historically grounded on hyperexcitability attributed to the oversimplified imbalance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I) in the brain. The decreased inhibition is mostly attributed to deficits in gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing (GABAergic) interneurons, the main source of inhibition in the central nervous system. However, the cell diversity, the wide range of spatiotemporal connectivity, and the distinct effects of the neurotransmitter GABA especially during development, must be considered to critically revisit the concept of hyperexcitability caused by decreased inhibition as a key characteristic in the development of epilepsy. Here, we will discuss that behind this known mechanism, there is a heterogeneity of GABAergic interneurons with distinct functions and sources, which have specific roles in controlling the neural network activity within the recruited microcircuit and altered network during the epileptogenic process.

AB  - The present study aimed to use an in vitro follicle culture (IVFC) biotechnique as a tool to evaluate the influence of whole flaxseed as a feed supplementation in the diet on the in vitro development of caprine early antral follicles (EAFs) and further embryo production. In total, 18 adult goats were homogeneously allocated into two diet groups: Control and Flaxseed. EAFs from both experimental groups (300-400 mu m) were isolated and cultured in vitro for 18 days. After IVFC, recovered cumulus-oocyte complexes were submitted to in vitro maturation, and subsequently to IVF and in vitro embryo culture. The endpoints evaluated were follicular growth and morphology, oocyte recovery rate and diameter, sperm penetration, pronuclei formation, embryo development, and estradiol production. The addition of the whole flaxseed in the diet did not affect (P > 0.05) follicular growth and diameter. A higher (P < 0.05) percentage of oocytes >= 110 mu m was recovered from the flaxseed treatment. However, the sperm penetration rate was higher (P < 0.05) in the control treatment when compared with the flaxseed treatment, but no differences were found regarding the rate of fertilization nor cleaved embryos. In conclusion, dietary flaxseed increased the recovery rate of fully grown oocytes, but it did negatively affect the sperm penetration rate, even though there was no further effect on the cleavage rate.

AB  - Plants encounter a myriad of biotic and abiotic stresses throughout their life cycle, among which aphids pose a significant challenge as herbivorous insect pests. Aphids cause both direct damage through feeding and indirect damage by transmitting viruses. Given the growing concerns about insecticide resistance and the non-target effects of synthetic insecticides, there is an urgent need to develop novel pest control strategies that are dependent on plant defence strategies. In this study, we assessed the effects of exogenous prohydrojasmon (PDJ), a derivative of jasmonic acid, at 24 h (PDJ(24)) and 48 h (PDJ(48)) post-treatment on the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae), feeding on Brassica juncea L. (Brassicaceae). The impact of PDJ treatments was assessed by conducting performance bioassays (survival and fecundity) and behavioural bioassays (settlement and attraction to volatiles in an olfactometer). Our findings reveal that the exogenous application of PDJ did not significantly affect on the performance and behaviour of B. brassicae at 24-h post-treatment. However, PDJ treatment significantly reduced the performance of B. brassicae at 48-h post-treatment, and affected the behaviour in terms of reduced settlement on and attraction to volatiles of PDJ-treated plants. These results suggest that PDJ has the potential to effectively induce defences in Brassica against sucking pests. This study provides valuable insights into possibility of employing PDJ as an alternative approach for sustainable pest management in agriculture.

AB  - The effects of soil invertebrates (earthworms) and AM fungus fertilizers were observed alone and together on the growth of Punica granatum and on the reproduction of herbivores (Aphis punicae). Pomegranate plants were grown individually in pots containing sandy, silty, and clay soil. Plants were grown in soil containing: a) no added fauna, b) earthworms, c) AM fungus fertilizers, and d) AM fungus fertilizers and earthworms. As a result of the study, the highest number of shoots were observed in worm + fertilizer applied treatments and the lowest in the only worm used treatments. There was a significant difference between control (Pk) and worm + fertilizer (Psg) groups in shoot number (P<0.05). The greatest height growth was observed in worm applied treatment while the lowest was observed in control. Control, worm and worm + fertilizer groups differed significantly in terms of salinity content. Plant height negatively, but shoot numbers positively correlated with soil phosphorous content (P<0.05). There was a positive correlation between shoot numbers and K2O contents of treatment group soils. Aphid performance was strongly influenced by the presence of worm + fertilizer (Psg). In the presence of only worms (Ps), the numbers of adult and juvenile aphids were significantly increased at the first and second generations. Aphid death rate is the highest in worm + fertilizer (Psg) and lowest in the control treatment (Pk) for the first generation. These results suggest that different soil types and treatments affect plant growth parameters positively but do not sufficiently affect aphid population changes.

AB  - Apple tree canker is a serious disease caused by species of Cytospora. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is one of the most important apple-producing areas in China. However, losses due to apple Cytospora canker have seriously damaged the apple industry and affected the economic development of the apple growers in this region. In this study, we used morphological characteristics combined with multilocus phylogenetic analyses of the ITS, act, rpb2, tef1 and tub2 loci to identify isolates from apple ( Malus domestica) and wild apple (M. sieversii). As a result, C. hippophaopsis sp. nov. from M. sieversii and C. shawanensis sp. nov. from M. domestica were discovered and proposed herein. Pathogenicity tests were further conducted on 13 varieties of apple and wild apple, which confirmed C. hippophaopsis and C. shawanensis as canker pathogens. Meanwhile, C. hippophaopsis is generally more aggressive than C. shawanensis on the tested varieties of apple and wild apple.

AB  - Simple Summary Biodiversity protection is one of our most important challenges today. Local animal breeds, as an essential piece of cultural heritage, form integral part of the biodiversity of individual countries and regions. Cryopreservation of sperm is one of the powerful tools for the conservation of animal genetic resources by creation of gene banks containing long-term stored genetic material. Cryopreservation of ram sperm faces several obstacles, such as the possible influence of individuality and breed characteristics on resistance to damage caused by low temperatures. In our research, we deal with the investigation of these differences between various breeds bred in Central Europe.
   The aim of our research was to compare three Slovak sheep breeds in the quality parameters of cryopreserved sperm. The ejaculates of Slovak Dairy (SD), Native Wallachian (NW), and Improved Wallachian (IW) sheep rams (n = 12) were collected by electro-ejaculation. Heterospermic samples were created from suitable ejaculates, separately for each breed (at least 90% of total and 80% of progressive motility). Samples were equilibrated in a Triladyl (R) diluent and frozen by automated freezing. Sperm samples were subjected to the motility, morphology, (CASA), viability and apoptosis (DRAQ7/Yo-Pro-1), fertilizing capability (penetration/fertilization test (P/F) in vitro) and acrosomal status (transmission electron microscopy) assays before freezing and after thawing. It was found that there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) between the evaluated breeds in motility, viability, apoptosis, morphological properties, and fertilizing ability of cryopreserved sperm. Significant differences occurred in acrosomal status. Our results demonstrate that the use of the selected cryopreservation protocol is suitable for at least three different sheep breeds, which can greatly benefit the biodiversity protection and simplifies the creation of an animal genetic resources gene bank.

AB  - Simple Summary In large-scale meat sheep farming, detecting aggressive behavior in sheep can help to reduce mortality rates and regulate sheep density within the pen. Traditional manual detection methods are time-consuming and laborious, while contact sensor detection methods can be costly and unsuitable for large-scale farming models. In recent years, with advancements in deep learning, a lightweight group sheep for aggressive behavior detection model is proposed. This method can efficiently detect aggressive behavior in group sheep under large-scale farming models.Abstract Sheep aggression detection is crucial for maintaining the welfare of a large-scale sheep breeding environment. Currently, animal aggression is predominantly detected using image and video detection methods. However, there is a lack of lightweight network models available for detecting aggressive behavior among groups of sheep. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for image detection of aggression behavior in group sheep. The proposed model utilizes the GhostNet network as its feature extraction network, incorporating the PWConv and Channel Shuffle operations into the GhostConv module. These additional modules improve the exchange of information between different feature maps. An ablation experiment was conducted to compare the detection effectiveness of the two modules in different positions. For increasing the amount of information in feature maps of the GhostBottleneck module, we applied the Inverted-GhostBottleneck module, which introduces inverted residual structure based on GhostBottleneck. The improved GhostNet lightweight feature extraction network achieves 94.7% Precision and 90.7% Recall, and its model size is only 62.7% of YOLOv5. Our improved model surpasses the original model in performance. Furthermore, it addresses the limitation of the video detection model, which was unable to accurately locate aggressive sheep. In real-time, our improved model successfully detects aggressive behavior among group sheep.

AB  - Microcystins-common hepatotoxins produced by cyanobacteria-have been detected in a wide range of organisms, though research examining the trophic transfer of microcystins and whether microcystins bioaccumulate or biomagnify in food webs has generated contradictory results. Here, we explored the trophic transfer of microcystins from the herbivorous water flea, Daphnia pulex, to the predatory larvae of a damselfly, Enallagma sp. We tested the hypotheses that microcystins transfer from the tissue of herbivorus zooplankton to that of predatory invertebrates and that these toxins biomagnify across trophic levels. We also assessed the relative contribution of toxin transfer from the gut and tissue of Daphnia pulex to Enallagma sp. We found that microcystins are effectively sequestered in the tissue of Daphnia pulex, and that these sequestered toxins are then transferred to the tissue of Enallagma sp. The contribution of gut contents to toxin transfer was negligible. Contrary to the pattern predicted by biomagnification, we found that the concentration of microcystins decreased with increasing trophic levels. Our results support the hypothesis that microcystins can be transferred trophically, but do not support the hypothesis that microcystins biomagnify from lower to higher trophic levels. Conversly, we observe biodilution in this system. These results have consequences for the impact of microcystins across trophic levels in a changing world with increasing intensity and duration of harmful algal blooms.

AB  - Cold stress in low-temperature environments can trigger changes in gene expression, but epigenomics regulation of temperature stability in vital tissues, including the fat and diencephalon, is still unclear. Here, we explore the cold-induced changes in epigenomic features in the diencephalon and fat tissues of two cold-resistant Chinese pig breeds, Min and Enshi black (ES) pigs, utilizing H3K27ac CUT&Tag, RNA-seq, and selective signature analysis. Our results show significant alterations in H3K27ac modifications in the diencephalon of Min pigs and the fat of ES pigs after cold exposure. Dramatic changes in H3K27ac modifications in the diencephalon of Min pig are primarily associated with genes involved in energy metabolism and hormone regulation, whereas those in the fat of ES pig are primarily associated with immunity-related genes. Moreover, transcription factors PRDM1 and HSF1, which show evidence of selection, are enriched in genomic regions presenting cold-responsive alterations in H3K27ac modification in the Min pig diencephalon and ES pig fat, respectively. Our results indicate the diversity of epigenomic response mechanisms to cold exposure between Min and ES pigs, providing unique epigenetic resources for studies of low-temperature adaptation in large mammals.

AB  - Thermal acclimation is a key process enabling ectotherms to cope with temperature change. To undergo a successful acclimation response, ectotherms require energy and nutritional building blocks obtained from their diet. However, diet is often overlooked as a factor that can alter acclimation responses. Using a temperate omnivorous fish, opaleye (Gireila nigricans), as a model system, we tested the hypotheses that (1) diet can impact the magnitude of thermal acclimation responses and (2) traits vary in their sensitivity to both temperature acclimation and diet. We fed opaleye a simple omnivorous diet (ad libitum Aftemia sp. and Ulva sp.) or a carnivorous diet (ad libitum Artemia sp.) at two ecologically relevant temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C) and measured a suite of whole-animal (growth, sprint speed, metabolism), organ (cardiac thermal tolerance) and cellular-level traits (oxidative stress, glycolytic capacity). When opaleye were offered two diet options compared with one, they had reduced cardiovascular thermal performance and higher standard metabolic rate under conditions representative of the maximal seasonal temperature the population experiences (20 degrees C). Further, sprint speed and absolute aerobic scope were insensitive to diet and temperature, while growth was highly sensitive to temperature but not diet, and standard metabolic rate and maximum heart rate were sensitive to both diet and temperature. Our results reveal that diet influences thermal performance in trait-specific ways, which could create diet trade-offs for generalist ectotherms living in thermally variable environments. Ectotherms that alter their diet may be able to regulate their performance at different environmental temperatures.

AB  - Simple Summary Dairy products derived from mountain-origin milk are recognized for their superior composition, which can positively impact sensory and nutritional attributes. This study delves into the alterations in milk composition, nutritional quality, and antioxidant properties within the context of semi-intensive goat farming in mountainous regions, specifically during the post-weaning to end-of-lactation phase. The research was conducted in Greece, a region known for its prevalent mountain livestock farming systems. The study unearthed noteworthy fluctuations in milk yield and gross composition over the data collection period. The composition of milk fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids, exhibited a discernible correlation with forage intake, leading to enhanced nutritional lipid quality indices with prolonged grazing duration. Additionally, the study identified an upswing in total phenolic content towards the study's conclusion, suggesting potential health benefits. Importantly, milk physicochemical properties remained relatively stable throughout the study, with no significant changes observed. In summary, this research offers valuable insights into the dynamics of milk composition and quality within semi-intensive goat farming systems situated in mountainous regions. These findings can prove invaluable to cheese manufacturers and farmers striving to elevate the quality of milk produced in mountainous regions under semi-intensive management systems.Abstract Dairy products from mountain-origin milk are known for their superior composition and quality. This study aimed to examine changes in composition, nutritional quality, and antioxidant properties of milk from semi-intensively managed goats in mountainous regions during the post-weaning to end-of-lactation period. Bulk tank milk samples from 10 farms were collected bi-weekly in the period from March to September. The farms were situated in regions with an average altitude of 772.20 m above sea level. The results revealed significant variations in milk composition, with fluctuations in fat, protein, lactose, and total solids. Milk yield per doe showed seasonal differences, with the highest yield in April and the lowest in September. Fatty acid composition exhibited changes throughout the sampling period, with variations in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nutritional indices, such as the atherogenicity index and thrombogenicity index, remained within the recommended values. Antioxidant properties, including total phenolic content, DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS, showed significant differences, with higher values toward the end of the study. Milk pH, electrical conductivity, brix value, and refractive index also exhibited variations, while density and freezing point remained relatively stable. The study provided valuable information that can be used to develop breeding and feeding plans to achieve uniform milk quality in mountainous regions.

AB  - Simple Summary When endophyte-infected tall fescue is consumed by grazing livestock it can cause persistent vasoconstriction resulting in fescue toxicosis. Legumes are commonly utilized in livestock production to improve diet quality. Legumes also contain vasodilatory isoflavones that have been shown to alleviate fescue toxicosis in goats and grazing cattle. Different legumes contain varying levels and types of isoflavones. A pen study was conducted to determine if isoflavone supplementation via red clover, white clover, or soybean meal can mitigate vasoconstriction associated with fescue toxicosis in goats. Rumen fistulated Wether goats were assigned to each legume treatment at equal levels of supplementation by weight. Goats were subjected to a fescue toxicosis challenge with toxic tall fescue seed, and the carotid artery area was monitored using Doppler ultrasonography. All isoflavone treatments were able to partially mitigate vasoconstriction. Red clover, with the greatest concentration of isoflavones, was the most effective. These results demonstrate that red clover, white clover, and soybean meal supplementation can be used to reverse the vasoconstriction associated with fescue toxicosis in goats despite differences in isoflavone concentration and composition. The impact of this research is a legume-derived phytochemical that can be applied in ruminants consuming toxic tall fescue to reverse fescue toxicosis and improve animal health and productivity. Ergot alkaloids produced by a fungal endophyte that infects tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum; (E+ TF) can induce constriction of the vasculature in ruminants, resulting in "fescue toxicosis". Legumes contain isoflavones that have been demonstrated to prevent and reverse E+ TF vasoconstriction. Several legumes are conventionally utilized in ruminant production, but can vary in both isoflavone concentration and composition. A feeding study was conducted to determine if isoflavone supplementation via red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (Trifolium repens), or soybean (Glycine max) meal can alleviate vasoconstriction when wether goats were challenged with E+ TF seed. The basal diet was chopped grass hay ad libitum. Carotid luminal areas were obtained pre- and post-ruminal infusions of E+ TF seed (15 mu g kg BW-1 ergovaline + ergovalanine +/- red clover, white clover, or soybean meal at 2.61 mg kg BW-1). When goats were challenged with E+ TF seed, the mean carotid luminal areas decreased by 56.1% (p < 0.01). All treatments were able to partially mitigate vasoconstriction, with red clover being the most effective (+39.8%), and white clover and soybean meal eliciting an intermediate response (+30%, p < 0.01). Results indicate that legumes can relax vasoconstriction in goats consuming ergot alkaloids, despite differences in isoflavone profile and concentrations.

AB  - We determined the levels of 52 organic pesticides (OPs), including 17 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 14 organophosphate pesticides (OPPs), 8 organic nitrogen pesticides (ONPs), and 13 pyrethroids (PYRs) for four types of contour feathers (breast, tail, back, and wings) from three species of migratory birds overwintering in the Tibetan Plateau. The studied species included the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), a long-distance migratory omnivore; common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), a mid-distance migratory omnivore; and barheaded goose (Anser indicus), a short-distance migratory herbivore. The primary and emerging pollutants included malaoxon and paraoxon from the OPP group, and alachlor and metalaxyl from the ONP group, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the levels of OP from different types of feathers, suggesting the suitability of contour feathers for biomonitoring. Significant species-level differences were observed between the levels of OP, with common snipe > Pacific golden plover > bar-headed goose. Pesticide levels were generally higher for feathers from omnivorous species. Additionally, species with longer migration distances tended to have higher pesticide levels for feathers, indicating migratory birds could influence the global transport of pollutants.

AB  - The study aimed to map and predict land use and land cover change dynamics in a human-wildlife mediated landscape of Save Valley Conservancy (SVC), south-eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe. In April 2018, remote sensing was used to quantify land use and land cover changes between 1990 and 2015 based on satellite images acquired from North Atlantic Space Agency (LANDSAT TM, path 170 raw 73). Household surveys were administered using a structured questionnaire to 100 communal settlers to collect biophysical/socioecological data on explanatory variables which included; density of human and livestock, fuelwood consumption and area under cultivation. The study used multicriteria evaluation procedure based on dynamic adjustments of socio-ecological data to generate transitional probability maps of SVC. Thresholds of socio-ecological data were then computed in the Markov-cellular automata model through a multi-objective land allocation procedure and a cellular automata spatial filter in order to simulate future land use and land cover maps of 2020, 2030 and 2040 for SVC. If the Zimbabwe land reform and its agricultural resettlement program is not properly coordinated and planned in the study area, the study predicted a continuing downward trend in woodland cover category and a significant upward trend of land under agriculture. For the period 1990 to the 2040s, the woodland cover is likely to decrease by 46.7% changing into agricultural land use and/or bare land in SVC. Future land use and land cover simulations indicated that if the current land use and land cover trends continue unabated across the study area without a holistic sustainable agricultural land-wildlife management plan and community development measures, severe woodland degradation will occur. The study recommends ecological restoration and/or re-planning on agriculture-wildlife land use and zonation, delineating agriculture and human settlement in the southern part of the conservancy while the northern part of SVC is exclusively reserved and protected for wildlife management.

AB  - In response to egg deposition or feeding by insect herbivores, plants release specific blends of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the herbivores. In nature, plants are often simultaneously attacked by multiple herbivores that may induce different signaling pathways, thus affecting the volatile blends and interfering with the attraction of natural enemies. The mechanisms underlying such interference remain largely unknown. Here, we show that co-infestation of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with the whitefly Bemisia tabaci reduces the volatile emissions induced by Pieris rapae caterpillars, resulting in reduced attraction of the larval parasitoid Cotesia rubecula. Hormone and gene expression analyses, followed by assays with various Arabidopsis mutants, revealed that this interference by B. tabaci is the result of antagonistic crosstalk between jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, involving the transcription factor NPR1 but not WRKY70. In contrast, B. tabaci co-infestation had no impact on the attraction of an egg parasitoid to egg-induced volatiles of P. rapae. These differential effects of the whitefly on the behavior of the two parasitoids were confirmed in greenhouse assays. This study provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the recruitment of different parasitoids by plants and could help in developing effective biocontrol strategies.
   This study reveals how co-infestation by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci interferes with plant chemical defenses against caterpillars, affecting the recruitment of natural enemies and providing insights for improved pest management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Innovations in the value chain of traditional meat products, leading to higher quality or healthier products, can support the niche market for local pig breeds and contribute to their more sustainable conservation. In this context, the present study investigated whether the quality traits of smoked dry-cured ham derived from the local Turopolje pig could be improved by including acorns in the animal's diet or by innovations in processing methods, such as smoke reduction. The results show that feeding acorns to pigs increased the processing yield but had a limited effect on the quality of the dry-cured ham, as only a few differences in the physicochemical, textural or colour parameters and volatile profile were observed. However, some sensory attributes, such as odour typicality, were affected by the acorn diet. Conversely, this innovation in processing led to a significant reduction in smoke-derived volatile compounds and an improved texture to the lightly smoked hams, as shown by both instrumental and sensory analysis.Abstract The Turopolje pig (TP) is a local Croatian pig breed that almost became extinct in the second half of the 20th century. Today, the TP is still endangered, and a new conservation strategy based on products with higher added value is needed to preserve the breed. There is little information on the quality of TP meat products such as smoked and dry-cured ham, including the impact of natural feeds or processing innovations such as smoke reduction. This study, therefore, investigated the effects of the animal's diet (either conventionally fed or acorn-supplemented) and the processing method (standard or lightly smoked) on the quality traits of dry-cured TP ham. Twenty hams, evenly distributed among the treatments, were processed for 15 months and then analysed for physicochemical and textural traits, volatiles and sensory profile. The hams from acorn-supplemented pigs lost less weight during processing (p <= 0.05). Otherwise, the diet had no significant effect on most examined ham traits. The exceptions were protein content and the texture parameter hardness, which decreased (p <= 0.05), and the degree of proteolysis and colour parameters, which increased (p <= 0.05) as a result of acorn supplementation. However, these effects were generally small and varied between the inner (m. biceps femoris) and outer (m. semimembranosus) muscles. Furthermore, acorn supplementation was associated with less typical ham odour and lower sensory scores for sweetness and colour uniformity (p <= 0.05). The smoke reduction had no effect on the physicochemical and colour properties but resulted in a significant reduction (p <= 0.05) in the volatile phenolic compounds and an improved texture to the hams. This was reflected both in reduced (p <= 0.05) hardness, identified in the instrumental analysis, and in an increased (p <= 0.05) softness, solubility and moistness, identified in the sensory evaluation. To summarize, the quality of the TP ham under the conditions studied was only slightly affected by acorn supplementation, whereas reduced smoking had a more significant effect, which was mainly reflected in an improved texture.

AB  - Context Human modification of landscapes poses a significant threat to wildlife, particularly in Africa where population growth and land conversion are expected to increase. Habitat loss and fragmentation have led to declines in wildlife populations, highlighting the need to identify and preserve critical habitats, including core use areas and connectivity between them. Most recently, the identification of habitat corridors has become a key objective. Objectives Our study objectives are to (1) empirically quantify connectivity across the Kunene-Etosha landscape in Northwestern Namibia using GPS tracking data on wild African elephants, and (2) assess the landscape features (i.e., geologic, biotic, and human-made) influencing connectivity and corridor types (e.g., fast movement corridors versus slow multi-use movement corridors). Methods We used GPS telemetry data from 66 elephants collared in Northwestern Namibia to empirically quantify connectivity using a graph theoretic approach and assess landscape features influencing connectivity. Based on the 'movescape' approach, we identify different types of corridors and examined how landscape features differed across these corridors using multiple regression models on locations classified into different types of use categories by machine learning algorithms. Results Our results revealed strong variation in connectivity across the landscape, with paths of high connectivity near water sources between the study areas. We found that factors related to water sources and human presence primarily influenced connectivity. Water holes serve as hubs across the ecosystem for both male and female elephants with lower use areas peripheral to areas with water. Connectivity between Kunene and Etosha National Park was relatively rare among the collared elephants, but we highlight the key areas used to move between the two regions. Conclusion Water was the key feature structuring space use, and human presence influenced connectivity between water points, highlighting the importance of landscape planning in relation to limited water sources and human activities. Our results suggest that focusing management efforts on areas where water is limited for both elephants and humans will be important to reduce conflict and maintain ecosystem connectivity.

AB  - High-carbohydrate (HC) diets may lead to the deterioration of the antioxidant and immune properties of Yellow River carp and the healthy development of the industry. Studies in mammals have found that sea buckthorn flavonoids (SF) improve antioxidant and immune performance. Therefore, this study comprehensively evaluated the effects of SF on Yellow River carp using in vitro and feeding trials with an HC diet. Control (C, 27.23 %), high-carbohydrate (HC, 42.99 %), and HC + SF (0.1 %, 0.2 %, and 0.4 %) groups were studied in a 10-week aqua-culture experiment. The main findings were as follows: (1) SF scavenged O2 center dot-, center dot OH, and DPPH free radicals in vitro, which gradually increased with the SF concentration. (2) The antioxidant and immune performance of Yellow River carp was enhanced by dietary supplementation with SF, which involved the regulation of activities of antioxidant and immune enzymes, as well as their changes at the transcription and protein levels. In terms of antioxidant properties, compared to the HC group, HC + SF significantly decreased the activities of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and the contents of H2O2 and malondialdehyde in the serum and hepatopancreas. The activities of glutathione, glutathione-Px, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total antioxidant activity in the HC-diet group. In contrast, the addition of SF increased antioxidant enzyme activity. In the hepatopancreas and muscles, SF regulated and activated Nrf2-Keap1, a key signaling pathway for oxidative stress. SF significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of downstream genes (gr, ho-1, cat, and sod) regulated by nrf2. In terms of immune performance, 0.4 % SF markedly increased the activity of immune-related enzymes. SF inhibited the gene expression of pro-inflammatory factors induced by the HC diet and promoted the gene expression of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, the resistance of Yellow River carp to Aeromonas hydrophila was enhanced by SF. In summary, SF supplementation can reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory harm caused by the HC diet and improve the antioxidant and immune performance of Yellow River carp to varying degrees.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions (HWIs) are increasingly common human disturbances as development continues to remove wildlife habitats. Documenting HWI is critical for environmental protection agencies to develop strategies and management decisions that meet the needs of both people and wildlife. However, evaluation of the frequency and types of HWI at broad spatial scales (e.g., national or regional level) can be costly and difficult to implement by managers. In this study, we apply a novel method for the evaluation of patterns of HWI in urban areas by using publicly available data from emergency calls (ECs) placed by inhabitants of Romania's urban areas. We used information from 4601 ECs placed at the Romanian National Emergency Call System 112, which consisted of (1) wildlife species, (2) spatial location, (3) date and time, and (4) a short description of the emergency. Of the 318 analyzed cities, 300 cities documented ECs on HWI between 2015 and 2020, with roe deer and brown bear being the most frequently mentioned species. We recorded an increasing trend in HWI-related ECs in 73% of the urban areas over the five-year period. We mapped the large-scale distribution of HWI by species and type of interactions in order to capture variations at the national level. Further, we analyzed the social and the biophysical factors potentially influencing the occurrence and frequency of HWI. The results showed that social factors have the same effect on all species, while the effect of the biophysical factors varied between species. Particularly, the presence of large natural habitats, represented by forests, influenced the number of calls only for brown bears. Seminatural landscapes with agricultural land have a different influence in terms of effect and significance for the considered species. Our results suggest that publicly available data from ECs can be used for the rapid assessment of HWI and for evaluating trends and predictors of HWI at broad spatial scales.

AB  - Seabed pockmarks are among the most prominent morphologic structures in the oceans. They are usually interpreted as surface manifestation of hydrocarbon fluids venting from sediments. Here we suggest an alternative hypothesis of pockmark formation based on latest multibeam echosounder data with a centimeter resolution. In the North Sea, >40,000 enigmatically shaped shallow depressions or 'pits' with a mean depth of 0.11 m were documented, that do not resemble known pockmark morphologies. Combining the new echosounder data with information from behavioral biology, physical oceanography, satellite remote sensing and habitat mapping, we conclude that harbor porpoises excavate sediments during benthic foraging. By grubbing the seabed, they cause sandeels to escape from the sediment and initiate the formation of seafloor pits. Time-lapse data reveals that the initially feeding pits serve as nuclei for scouring and eventually merge into larger scour-pits. With the immense number of vertebrates in the ocean, such megafauna-driven macro-bioturbation reshapes the seafloor, modulates sediment transport, and ultimately impacts associated ecosystems on a global scale.

AB  - Santa Ines and Dorper sheep are the most popular breeds in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The former is of local origin and less intensively selected for productivity, and the latter is an introduced exotic breed selected for meat production. Dorper lambs are heavier at birth than Santa Ines lambs, which might increase the need for birth assistance, negatively influencing the newborn and maternal behaviours. Dorper lambs grow faster, most likely influencing their behavioural strategies during lactation, depending less on their mother than Santa Ines lambs. The aim of this study was to compare the behaviours of Santa Ines and Dorper ewes and their lambs at birth and throughout lactation. A complementary aim was to determine if being single or twin lambs impact differently according to the breed. Twenty-five Santa Ines ewes and their 32 lambs (18 single and 14 twins) and 21 Dorper ewes and their 26 lambs (16 single and 10 twins) were used in the study. Mother-offspring behaviours were recorded from birth until 63 days after lambing. Dorper ewes had a greater incidence of dystocia (P = 0.02) and longer labour (P = 0.0001) than Santa Ines ewes. At birth, Santa Ines ewes displayed a greater frequency of lowpitched bleats (P = 0.0006) and tended to spend more time grooming their lambs than Dorper ewes (P = 0.07). Immediately after birth, Santa Ines lambs shook their head earlier than Dorper lambs (P = 0.003). The litter size effects were unrelated to the breed: ewes of single deliveries groomed their lambs earlier (P = 0.04), and those that delivered twins spent more time grooming the first lamb delivered (P = 0.01). Over the first two weeks after parturition, Santa Ines ewes displayed higher frequencies of head-up postures (P = 0.0001), high-pitched bleats (P = 0.02) and smelled their lambs more times (P = 0.0001) than Dorper ewes. Santa Ines lambs were closer to their mother when grazing (P = 0.0001), while Dorper lambs were closer to their mother when lying down (P = 0.049). In conclusion, Santa Ines sheep shows a stronger ewe-lamb bond than Dorper soon after parturition, and such differences persist at least until 9 weeks after lambing. The ewe-lamb bond was weaker in twin than single lambs, without differences in the degree of its strength between Santa Ines and Dorper sheep.

AB  - Resource specialist herbivores may suppress antipredator strategies to access scarcely available key resources, while proactive antipredator behaviors should be favored by generalists or when resources are abundant. We quantified the relative effects of predation- (top-down) and resource-driven (bottom-up) constraints on spatiotemporal patterns of landscape use by a prey community in a dynamic system under low predator abundance, and investigated how prey manage the risk posed by predators with different hunting strategies. We fitted Royle-Nichols co-abundance models to camera-trapping data collected between 2017 and 2019 in Bicuar National Park (Angola), to assess spatial association/segregation across predator-prey dyads, while accounting for the effects of water and food availability during dry and wet seasons. We further estimated pairwise seasonal differences in diel activity overlap between predator and prey. We failed to detect spatiotemporal proactive antipredator responses either toward the cursorial or ambush predator. The community-wide predator-prey association patterns we found support that predation pressure is insufficient to displace prey from their preferred habitats or to adjust their endogenous clock, and support predominantly bottom-up regulated behaviors. We suggest that, in landscapes where predator density is low, limited perception of risk may prevent the employment of proactive antipredator behavior.

AB  - The resource availability hypothesis predicts that plants adapted to infertile soils have high levels of anti-herbivore leaf defences. This hypothesis has been mostly explored for secondary metabolites such as phenolics, whereas it remains underexplored for silica-based defences. We determined leaf concentrations of total phenols and silicon (Si) in plants growing along the 2-million-year Jurien Bay chronosequence, exhibiting an extreme gradient of soil fertility. We found that nitrogen (N) limitation on young soils led to a greater expression of phenol-based defences, whereas old, phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils favoured silica-based defences. Both defence types were negatively correlated at the community and individual species level. Our results suggest a trade-off among these two leaf defence strategies based on the strength and type of nutrient limitation, thereby opening up new perspectives for the resource availability hypothesis and plant defence research. This study also highlights the importance of silica-based defences under low P supply.

AB  - Simple Summary The Chinese Hu sheep is well-known for its high fertility and early sexual maturity. Rams reach sexual maturity at the age of six months. This study investigated differential crude fat content, fatty acid composition and related metabolism genes localization and expression in cauda epididymis between high and low fertility Hu sheep at six months old. The crude fat content was positively correlated with epididymal weight. High expression of SREBP1 and EVOVL2 in high fertility Hu sheep may lead to the higher n-3 PUFA content, especially DHA, providing a basis for understanding the relationship between fertility and sperm storage environment. The epididymis is an organ that transports, matures and stores sperm, and has functions such as secretion and absorption. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compositions in sperm membrane were changed during the process of epididymis maturation and influence the male fertility. This study aimed to investigate differences in crude fat and fatty acid content in cauda epididymis between high and low fertility of Hu sheep. One hundred and seventy-nine Hu ram lambs were fed from 56 days to 6 months under the same environment. After the feeding trial, all rams were slaughtered, and the body weight, testicular weight, epididymal weight and sperm density were measured. Pearson correlation analysis showed significantly moderate positive correlation between epididymal weight and sperm density and testicular weight. Eighteen rams were selected and divided into the high fertility group (H, n = 9) and low fertility group (L, n = 9) according to the epididymal weight, sperm density and histomorphology. The crude fat content, fatty acid profile and genes related to fatty acid metabolism were detected. The crude fat content, total fatty acid, total n-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA) content of cauda epididymis in high fertility group was significantly higher than those in low fertility group (p < 0.05). However, the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA was significantly lower than that in group L (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry results showed that SREBP1 and ELOVL2 were expressed in pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium and smooth muscle cells. The mRNA expression of SREBP1 (p = 0.09) and ELOVL2 (p < 0.05) in the high fertility group were increased. In conclusion, the high expression of SREBP1 and ELOVL2 may contribute to high n-3 PUFA content in cauda epididymis of high-fertility Hu sheep.

AB  - In insects, temperature and diet quality during larval development are two fundamental factors affecting key life history traits that, in turn, determine an individuals' fitness. Life-history theory predicts that within species, individuals attain larger sizes when developing under colder temperatures (i.e., temperature-size rule) or on high-quality diet (i.e., allowing for more effective resource acquisition and development). Here, I studied how temperature and host-plant identity affect growth rate, larval development time and size at maturity in Aglia tau L. (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae: Agliinae), a univoltine capital breeding moth. I further examined whether and to what extent these environmental variables influence the degree of sexual size dimorphism. Caterpillars were reared under two contrasting temperature regimes (constantly 18 and 23 degrees C) and fed with three natural host plants, that is, Carpinus betulus L. (Betulaceae), Fagus sylvatica L. (Fagaceae) and Prunus padus L. (Rosaceae). A full-factorial analysis of variance design was used to test for effects of temperature and host identity on life history traits and to account for possible interactive effects. Contrary to theory, the body sizes of males and females were maintained at higher temperatures or even increased when reared on the highest quality host plant (Prunus padus). As predicted, the high-quality host allowed for overall larger body sizes in both sexes and further resulted in a higher degree of sexual size dimorphism. The study highlights the need to account for diet effects when studying temperature-induced life history responses in insects and to consider further traits that may influence species-specific reaction norms.
   I investigated how diet and temperature affect life-history traits and sexual size dimorphism in Aglia tau L. (Lepidoptera, Saturniidae), a capital-breeding moth. I found that this species does not follow the temperature-size rule as body sizes were maintained when caterpillars were reared at higher temperatures. I further found that low-quality hosts caused smaller body sizes and a reduced degree of sexual size dimorphism. image

AB  - The study aimed to assess the influence of cryostress on RNA integrity and functional significance in sperm fertilizing ability. The fresh and post-thawed buffalo sperm (n = 6 each) samples were evaluated for their functional attributes, and sperm total RNA was subjected to transcriptome sequencing followed by validation using real-time PCR and dot blot. Overall, 6911 genes had an expression of FPKM > 1, and among these 431 genes were abundantly expressed (FPKM > 20) in buffalo sperm. These abundantly expressed genes regulate reproductive functions such as sperm motility (TEKT2, SPEM1, and PRM3, FDR = 1.10E-08), fertilization (EQTN, PLCZ1, and SPESP1, FDR = 7.25E-06) and the developmental process involved in reproduction (SPACA1, TNP1, and YBX2, FDR = 7.21E-06). Cryopreservation significantly (p < 0.05) affected the structural and functional membrane integrities of sperm. The expression levels of transcripts that regulate the metabolic activities and fertility-related functions were compromised during cryopreservation. Interestingly, cryostress induces the expression of genes involved (p < 0.05) in chemokine signaling (CX3CL1, CCL20, and CXCR4), G-protein coupled receptor binding (ADRB1, EDN1, and BRS3), translation (RPS28, MRPL28, and RPL18A), oxidative phosphorylation (ND1, ND2, and COX2), response to reactive oxygen species (GLRX2, HYAL2, and EDN1), and immune responses (CX3CL1, CCL26, and TBXA2R). These precociously expressed genes during cryopreservation alter the signaling mechanisms that govern sperm functional competence and can impact fertilization and early embryonic development.

AB  - Herbivores making space use decisions must consider the trade-off between perceived predation risk and forage quality. Herbivores, specifically snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), must constantly navigate landscapes that vary in predation risk and food quality, providing researchers with the opportunity to explore the factors that govern their foraging decisions. Herein, we tested predictions that intersect the risk allocation hypothesis (RAH) and optimal foraging theory (OFT) in a spatially explicit ecological stoichiometry framework to assess the trade-off between predation risk and forage quality. We used individual and population estimates of snowshoe hare (n = 29) space use derived from biotelemetry across three summers. We evaluated resource forage quality for lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium), a common and readily available forage species within our system, using carbon:nitrogen and carbon:phosphorus ratios. We used habitat complexity to proxy perceived predation risk. We analyzed how forage quality of blueberry, perceived predation risk, and their interaction impact the intensity of herbivore space use. We used generalized mixed effects models, structured to enable us to make inferences at the population and individual home range level. We did not find support for RAH and OFT. However, variation in the individual-level reactions norms in our models showed that individual hares have unique responses to forage quality and perceived predation risk. Our finding of individual-level responses indicates that there is fine-scale decision-making by hares, although we did not identify the mechanism. Our approach illustrates spatially explicit empirical support for individual behavioral responses to the food quality-predation risk trade-off.

We determined the effect of xylazine-sedation with or without regional infiltration of lidocaine on behavior (tail movements, struggles, vocalizations) and plasma cortisol. Thirty-six goat kids were randomly assigned to six experimental groups (n = 6). The control group (Con) received no treatment at all. The control-disbudded group (ConD) was disbudded without sedative or anesthetic treatment. The control-xylazine (Cxyl) group received 0.05 mg/kg of intravenous xylazine and was not disbudded. Group XylD was administered intravenous xylazine and disbudded 3 minutes later. Group XLD was treated with xylazine as XylD, plus local administration of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine (Pisacaina, PiSA, Mexico) to block the lacrimal and infratrochlear nerves 15 minutes before disbudding. In group Sim, the disbudding procedure was only simulated with no sedative, anesthesia, or disbudding. Disbudding was filmed to analyze behaviors, heart rate (HR) was recorded, and blood samples were taken before and after the procedure to measure cortisol. XylD and ConD kids showed higher cortisol levels than Con and XLD during the first 20 minutes after disbudding (P < 0.05). HR showed a significant increase in ConD kids and a significant decrease in xylazine-treated groups (P < 0.05). More vocalizations were recorded in ConD kids (18.5 +/- 4; P < 0.05) and showed no difference compared with XylD animals (13.3 +/- 4; P > 0.05). Both XylD and XLD kids displayed a lower total behavioral response than the ConD group (34.3 +/- 9.9, 19.6 +/- 9.9, and 70.0 +/- 9.9, respectively; P < 0.05). In conclusion, thermal disbudding induces physiological and behavioral responses indicative of acute pain. Sedation with xylazine did not control these responses unless combined with a nerve block using local infiltration of 2% lidocaine. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticides negatively affect the environment and human health, primarily through bioaccumulation in the food system. The detection of pesticides in the agriculture system is needed to reduce their negative impacts. Furthermore, there are several conventional methods such as chromatography, etc. available to detect and quantify the different types of pesticides, but these methods have limitations including higher cost, requirement of complex methodology, expertise and specialized gear and are inappropriate for real-time field screening. To overcome the challenges posed by conventional methods, nanotechnological approaches are gaining huge popularity in agriculture sector as nano-sensing strategies played an important role for remediation, detection and pollution control in the environment. Nano-sensors have potential advantages such as low cost, selectivity, sensitivity, robustness and real-time monitoring of the pesticides present in the food system and helps in improving the crop productivity management. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the importance and role of nanotechnology approaches in the agriculture sector for real time detection of pesticides. This review also describes the different types of biosensors such as optical, enzymatic, colorimetric, electro-chemical, potentiometric and immune sensors while highlighting their mechanism and nanoparticle interactions in the agriculture sector for pesticide detection. The recent study on the development of low-cost nanoparticle based nano sensors for pesticide detection is focused on gathering detailed information using databases such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science, etc.

AB  - Wool-focused economies yielded a pastoralist materiality that visibly shaped the lived experiences of Central Asian populations today. In this paper, we investigate the earlier application of fibers through a key mountain corridor for social interactions during Prehistory. We focus on the site of Chap 1 located in the highlands of the Tien Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan where researchers have found a complex agropastoral subsistence culture was established from at least ca. 3,000 BCE. The perishable materials that would have accompanied the early spread of cultural and technological traditions related to fiber-based crafts throughout this area are under-documented due to poor organic preservation. Hence, there has been little consideration of the role that textiles played in highland occupation and how woven fabrics might have facilitated settlement in the extreme climates of Central Asia. We address this ongoing problem through a multi-application survey of Chap's unpublished textile evidence preserved as impressions in coarseware ceramics of its Final Bronze Age. We consider evidence that sheep wool formed a key cultural adaptation for surviving the extreme winters of Central Asia's highland regions.

AB  - Agricultural soils are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that related with intensive fertilizer input. Biochar is widely used to mitigate GHGs, which may interact with soil water content impacting GHG emissions. Camellia oleifera fruit shell (FS) and spent mushroom substrate (MS) are ideal biochar feedstocks. However, the impact of water content and biochar on soil GHG emissions has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we examined CH4 and N2O emissions from C. oleifera plantation soils as affected by biochar (derived from MS or FS, 1 g 25 g(-1) soil), water content (60%, 120%, 240% or 360% water holding capacity, WHC), and fertilization (control or chicken manure, CM 2.5 g 25 g(-1) soil). We determined the abundance of related microbial functional genes to obtain the underlining mechanisms. The results showed that higher N2O emissions occurred in soils with 120%WHC, due to increased abundance of AOA, AOB and nirS. MS or FS biochar differed in their effects on soil GHG emissions with different WHC. MS biochar was higher in pH, C/N and specific surface area, and mitigated more N2O emissions from soils with CM and 120%WHC relative to FS biochar (by 92.9% and 34.6%, respec-tively). MS biochar significantly decreased abundance of nitrification related functional genes (AOA, AOB) in soils with 120%WHC and CM, which explained the decrease in N2O emissions. However, MS biochar increased cumulative CH4 emissions from flooded soils via increase in mcrA abundance. Thereby, biochar feedstocks should be considered in CH4 and N2O mitigations from soils with different water contents.

AB  - The testis is an important organ for maintaining fertility in males, and testis size is positively correlated with ejaculate volume, sperm motility, thus fertility. Spermatogenesis-associated 6 (SPATA6) is an evolutionarily conserved testis-specific gene reported in many species. However, the effect of SPATA6 expression levels on testicular development and the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on testis and epididymis phenotype in sheep have not been studied. The purpose of the research was to investigate the expression profile of SPATA6 and its effect on testicular development and to confirm the effect of SNPs on the testis and epididymis phenotype. In this study, we detected a 1245bp coding sequence (CDS) of SPATA6 and encoded 414 amino acids. The expression levels of SPATA6 were significantly higher in the testis than in other tissues and gradually increased with testis development. Moreover, the expression level in the large testis was significantly higher than that in the small testis at six months. A total of 11 SNPs were detected in the coding region of SPATA6 by cDNA-pooling sequencing and improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) methods. Correlation analysis showed that SNP2 (c. 3631C > G) significantly affected left epididymis weight (LEW) and right epididymis weight (REW), and SNP10 (c. 937 A > G) significantly affected REW. And the combined genotype of SNP1 (c. 4245 G > A) and SNP2 significantly affected REW. The current study concluded that SPATA6 plays an important role in testicular development and the SNPs significantly associated with the epididymis phenotype can provide molecular markers for the early selection of high-fertility Hu sheep.

AB  - With the steady increase in litter sizes, artificial rearing is becoming widely used to raise surplus piglets. The study aimed to evaluate the potential impacts of artificial rearing on behaviour and immune function in piglets. A total of 240 piglets were divided into three groups: piglets reared by the sow until weaning on day 35 (CON group), piglets artificially reared from day 7 (AR7 group), and piglets artificially reared from day 21 (AR21 group). Behavioural observation was conducted for 8 hours weekly, and the elimination position was recorded on days 7, 21, and 35. Serum and hair samples were collected to measure immunoglobulins and cortisol concentration, respectively. The results revealed that piglets in the AR7 group exhibited less frequent milk-drinking, exploring, and playing, but more frequent belly nosing and oral manipulation of conspecifics. Moreover, artificial rearing affected the elimination sites of AR7 piglets on day 21, but this phenomenon was not observed on day 35. In addition, the AR7 piglets had higher levels of cortisol and CRP, as well as lower levels of IgG and IgA compared to the CON piglets. The AR21 piglets also had a higher CRP level compared to the CON piglets. In conclusion, artificial rearing, initiated either from day 21 or day 7, negatively affected behavioural expression and immune function. Artificial rearing from day 7 was found to be the most physiologically detrimental.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, the numerical increase of the roe deer population in Italy has shifted attention to new tools for the management of these populations. The use of biometric data for a correct assessment of the status of ungulate populations is now a standardized and commonly used procedure. In this study, we tried to verify whether, in addition to biometric analyses, morphometrics could be used as a supplementary tool for roe deer management. The study of geometric morphometry has made a major impact by aiding technological and methodological advances. By using Cartesian coordinates of reference points, this method is capable of capturing morphologically distinct shape variables, which can be used as rapid indicators of the status of populations, and thus have the potential to be very useful for wildlife management. The analysis of body shape variability has always been a central element in biology. More recently, geometric morphometry has developed as a new field in shape analysis, with the aim to study body morphological variations and the identification of their causes. In wildlife management, geometric morphometry could be a useful tool to compare the anatomical structures of an organism and quantify its geometric information in order to relate them to environmental factors, thus identifying the causes and effects of the variation and acting management and/or conservation plans. The aim of our study is to evaluate the relationship between roe deer mandible shape and trophic resources available during autumn and winter. We applied a geometric morphometry approach consisting of a Relative Warp analysis of landmark data in 26 roe deer fawn mandibles. Each sample was assigned to an age category and to an environmental category based on the territory carrying capacity. The mandible shape of samples under 8 months of age is likely influenced by the availability of trophic resources. Our findings suggest that the mandible shape is a reliable instrument to assess resource availability. Geometric morphometry could thus represent an additional tool for roe deer management.

AB  - We investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation used as a model for producing neurodevelopmental disorders on hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviors in rat offspring by exploring the antioxidant effects of alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (50 mu g/kg body weight) at gestational days 15 and 16. AGIQ was administered in the diet to dams at 0.5% (w/w) from gestational day 10 until weaning at postnatal day 21 and then to offspring until adulthood at postnatal day 77. During postnatal life, offspring of LPS-injected animals did not show neuroinflammation or oxidative stress in the brain. At weaning, LPS decreased the numbers of type-2b neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and PCNA(+) proliferating cells in the subgranular zone, FOS-expressing granule cells, and GAD67(+) hilar interneurons in the dentate gyrus. In adulthood, LPS decreased type-1 neural stem cells, type-2a NPCs, and GAD67(+) hilar interneurons, and downregulated Dpysl3, Sst, Fos, Mapk1, Mapk3, Grin2a, Grin2b, Bdnf, and Ntrk2. In adults, LPS suppressed locomotor activity in the open field test and suppressed fear memory acquisition and fear extinction learning in the contextual fear conditioning test. These results indicate that mid-gestation LPS injections disrupt programming of normal neurodevelopment resulting in progressive suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity of newborn granule cells by suppressing GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter signals and BDNF/TrkB signaling to result in adult-stage behavioral deficits. AGIQ ameliorated most aberrations in hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, as well as behavioral deficits. Effective amelioration by continuous AGIQ treatment starting before LPS injections may reflect both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects during gestation and neuroprotective effects of continuous exposure through adulthood.

AB  - Improving the recovery of organic matter and phosphorus (P) from hazardous biowastes such as swine manure using acidic substrates (ASs) in conjunction with aerobic composting is of great interest. This work aimed to investigate the effects of ASs on the humification and/or P migration as well as on microbial succession during the swine manure composting, employing multivariate and multiscale approaches. Adding ASs, derived from wood vinegar and humic acid, increased the degree of humification and thermal stability of the compost. The P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses demonstrated compost P was in the form of struvite crystals, Ca/Al-P phases, and Poly-P (all inorganic P species) as well as inositol hexakisphosphate and Mono-P (organophosphorus species). However, the efficiency of P recovery could be improved by generating more struvite by adding the ASs. The flows among nutrient pools resulted from the diversity in the dominant microbial communities in different composting phases after introducing the ASs and appearance of Bacillus spp. in all phases. These results demonstrate the potential value of ASs for regulating and/ or improving nutrients flow during the composting of hazardous biowastes for producing higher quality compost, which may maximize their beneficial benefits and applications.

AB  - At present, twice-a-year pruning is usually adopted for the tea garden, in which only spring tea is picked. Effects of different times and heights of summer pruning on tea trees are unknown. Here the effects of summer pruning on 'Jin Guan Yin' oolong mature tea trees were studied. The results showed that pruning at 30 cm (summer pruning at 30 cm above the cut surface of spring pruning) on Jul 25 could benefit to the growth of lateral branches, whereas two pruning treatments in August reduced their growth vigor. Pruning at 30 cm could also provide a benefit by decreasing the ratio of total tea polyphenols to free amino acids (TP/AA), an important factor in tea quality. Pruning at 30 cm and two pruning in August all significantly enhanced the contents of ester catechins ['(-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)+(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG)'] as compared to conventional summer pruning. Pruning on Aug 15 (summer pruning at 20 cm on Aug 15) had the lowest (EGCG+ECG)%. In addition, enhanced AA content induced by pruning at 30 cm was significantly associated with enhanced transcription of glutamine synthetase (CsGS) or glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (CsGOGAT). In a word, the summer pruning at 30 cm on Jul 25 was best to benefit the growth of lateral branches and spring tea yield and quality, whereas pruning on Aug 15 had the worst comprehensive effects.

AB  - Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), a precursor of creatine, is partially degraded in the rumen when unprotected. While GAA has shown promise as a feed additive, its optimal dose for ruminants remains unclear. This study investigated the dose-response effects of GAA on in vitro ruminal fermentation and greenhouse gas production in fattened sheep. Rumen inoculum from two Pelibuey sheep (30 kg +/- 2 kg) fed a 50:50 forage: concentrate diet was used to test seven GAA doses: 0 (GAA0, control), 500 (GAA0.5), 1000 (GAA1), 1500 (GAA1.5), 2000 (GAA2), 2500 (GAA2.5), and 3000 (GAA3) mg/kg DM (dry matter). A completely randomized design was employed. GAA0.5 produced significantly higher total gas than GAA2. The CH4 production was similar across doses, except for GAA2.5, which was significantly higher than GAA0 and GAA0.5. GAA exhibited quadratic relationships with total gas production and linear relationships with CH4 and CO production but no significant effect on H2S. GAA linearly increased DM digestibility without significantly affecting ruminal fermentation profiles. GAA inclusion strongly influenced crude protein (CP) digestibility and degradability kinetics, with varying effects at different time points. The rate constant for degradation of the insoluble but potentially degradable CP fraction was highest with GAA1. In conclusion, GAA supplementation at GAA0.5 improved total gas production without increasing CH4 emissions, implying enhanced fermentation efficiency and improved performance. GAA's impact on CP digestibility varied with incubation time. These findings provide insights into developing optimal GAA dose/level supplementation that is effective in fattening sheep, though further in vivo studies are warranted to validate these effects and explore long-term impacts on rumen microbial populations and protein utilization.

AB  - Phytoparasitic mites of the superfamily Eriophyoidea Nalepa live and feed on mature leaf surfaces, between leaf bud scales, and (though less commonly) on flowers or fruits. In this study, we focused on the seasonal associations of two eriophyoid species, Shevtchenkella serrata (Nalepa 1892) with the Norway maple tree (Acer platanoides L.), and Brevulacus reticulatus Manson 1984 with the common oak (Quercus robur L.). These species have complex life cycles with two morphologically different, seasonal female forms, the protogyne and deutogyne. In B. reticulatus, both forms retain all the major generic characteristics but in S. serrata only the protogynes conform to the diagnosis of Shevtchenkella, whereas the deutogynes have the typical traits of Anthocoptes. We confirmed the conspecificity of the protogynes and deutogynes of both eriophyoid species by sequencing a barcode fragment of the Cox1 gene from which we obtained four pairwise identical sequences: ON920305/ON920306 (S. serrata) and ON920307/ ON920308 (B. reticulatus). In addition, taxonomical studies on Shevtchenkella and Brevulacus resulted in new synonymies and combinations: (1) Oxypleurites obtusus Roivainen 1947 is considered a deutogyne of S. serrata and treated as a junior synonym of S. serrata; (2) two rhyncaphytoptine species from North America are transferred from the genus Rhyncaphytoptus to Brevulacus: B. albus (Keifer 1959) comb. nov. and B. atlanticus (Keifer 1959) comb. nov.; and (3) one species, B. salicinus Soika et al. 2017, is excluded from Brevulacus and transferred to Rhyncaphytoptus: Rhyncaphytoptus salicinus (Soika et al. 2017) comb. nov. Apart from distinct morphological deuterogyny in S. serrata and B. reticulatus, we observed the persistent association of S. serrata with the generative organs of the maple tree, A. platanoides, leading to transmission to the next host generation via the seed-containing winged fruits (samaras) and subsequent colonization of seedlings. In B. reticulatus, similar synchronization with host-plant dispersal was not detected; however, in mid-summer, temporary colonization of immature acorns and feeding was observed. Additional studies conducted in various ecosystems and including different ecological groups of plants, especially anemochorous plants, are needed to estimate the frequency of the association of eriophyoids with plant generative organs, seeds and seedlings to better understand what role in mite ecology such associations may play.

AB  - Lysozyme is used as a food preservative, biological medicine, and infant food additive as a natural anti-infective chemical having bactericidal activity and abundantly secreted in mammals' milk, saliva, etc. We systematically analyzed the 16 coding LYZ genes (C and G-type) in buffalo and cattle to elucidate their evolutionary perspective thoroughly by evaluating an evolutionary relationship, motif patterning, physicochemical attributes, gene, and protein structure, as well as the functional role of the mammary gland-specific expressed buffalo and cattle LYZ genes precisely while considering expression levels difference and the interaction sites variation with bacteria envisaged the potential ability of buffalo LYZ protein with enhanced antibacterial effect. Thus, we speculated that the buffalo mammary glands expressed lysozyme has good antibacterial activity. This study on the buffalo lysozyme gene family not only provides comprehensive insights into the genetic architecture and their anti-bacterial effect but also offers a theoretical basis for the development of new veterinary drugs and animal health care for mastitis, as well as a new molecular genetic basis to study food or medical lysozyme.

AB  - This paper investigates Tao (Yami) people's various engagement with pigs as social agents. How do Tao people make sense of the encounter with this non-human? Pongso no Tao, in Taiwan, is the territory of the Tao, an indigenous community belonging to the Austronesian-speaking peoples. In Tao's onto-cosmological conceptions, the entanglement between animals and humans participate in the blurring of the interspecies boundaries, making it possible to apprehend alterities as intentional beings. The flying fish may be the most respected animal on the island, however the Suidae play a key role in Tao's life too. In Pongso no Tao, raising pigs is a sign of commitment to interpersonal relationships. Therefore, offering and receiving pig meat are far from being empty gestures; they have deep social meanings and implications, especially the obligation to "return".

AB  - Filamentous fungi are being globally explored for the production of industrially important bioactive compounds including pigments. In the present study, a cold and pH tolerant fungus strain Penicillium sp (GEU_37), isolated from the soil of Indian Himalaya, is characterized for the production of natural pig-ments as influenced by varying temperature conditions. The fungal strain produces a higher sporulation, exudation, and red diffusible pigment in Potato Dextrose (PD) at 15 degrees C as compared to 25 degrees C. In PD broth, a yellow pigment was observed at 25 degrees C. While measuring the effect of temperature and pH on red pigment production by GEU_37, 15 degrees C and pH 5, respectively, were observed to be the optimum con-ditions. Similarly, the effect of exogenous carbon and nitrogen sources and mineral salts on pigment production by GEU_37 was assessed in PD broth. However, no significant enhancement in pigmentation was observed. Chloroform extracted pigment was separated using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography. The two separated fractions i.e., fractions I and II with Rf values 0.82 and 0.73, exhibited maximum light absorption, lmax , at 360 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Characterization of pigments using GC-MS showed the presence of the compounds such as phenol, 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) and eicosene from fraction I and derivatives of coumarine, friedooleanan, and stigmas-terole in fraction II. However, LC-MS analysis detected the presence of derivatives of compound carot-enoids from fraction II as well as derivative of chromenone and hydroxyquinoline as major compounds from both the fractions along with other numerous important bioactive compounds. The production of such bioactive pigments under low temperature conditions suggest their strategic role in ecological resilience by the fungal strain and may have biotechnological applications.(c) 2023 British Mycological Society.

AB  - Simple Summary: Environmental enrichment for pigs in the pre-slaughter room aims to provide a more comfortable and stimulating environment for the animals during the period before slaughter. This can help reduce the stress of transport and improve pig welfare, which can also have positive impacts on reducing the number of animal injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of environmental enrichment and lairage of pigs in the slaughterhouse on behavioral responses and number of skin lesions. The main results proved that environmental enrichment did not influence skin lesion score or behavioral responses, while the lairage time at slaughter did not influence the number of lesions on the animals. We concluded that environmental enrichment during lairage in a commercial slaughterhouse did not significantly reduce skin lesions or influence the behavior of pigs; that is, the use of simple metal chains as environmental enrichment is not efficient in improving animal welfare in slaughterhouses. Different resources, such as environmental enrichment, are being evaluated in order to minimize animal stress and promote better conditions during the life cycle of animals, as consumers are increasingly concerned about animal welfare issues. Lairage represents an important stage in the swine production chain and is directly related to animal welfare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lairage time in the slaughterhouse and environmental enrichment on the level of skin lesions and behavioral responses in pigs. A total of 648 finishing pigs of both sexes were assessed before and after lairage at the slaughterhouse with a five-point scale (0 = none, to 4 = >= 16 superficial lesions or >10 deep lesions). After lairage (after slaughter), lesions were also classified according to their source (mounting, fighting, and handling). Pigs were distributed into two treatments groups during lairage: with environmental enrichment (EE) on the pen, with hanging metal chains, and with no enrichment (NE). Behavior was monitored during the first four hours of lairage. Proportional odds, mixed linear model for longitudinal data, and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to analyze the relation between treatments, skin lesions, and behavior. The simple metal chains did not affect skin lesion score or pigs' behavior (p > 0.05), whereas lairage duration influenced standing (SA), sitting (S), lying (L), idleness (I), and drinking water (D) (p < 0.001). The main source of skin lesions was handling, which did not differ between treatments (EE and NE) (p > 0.05). It was observed that the severity of the lesions (highest scores of 3, 4, and 5) increased in the different anatomical regions of the pigs when compared before and after slaughter, with the exception of the frontal area, which was the same (p = 0.7547). Lairage time has a proportional relation with skin lesions, and hanging chains at the slaughterhouse pens was not enough to reduce the number of lesions and to change pig behavior.

AB  - Fat deposition in sheep tails is as a result of a complicated mechanism. Mongolian sheep (MG) and Small Tail Han sheep (STH) are two fat-tailed Chinese indigenous sheep breeds while DairyMeade and East Friesian (DS) are two thin-tailed dairy sheep breeds recently introduced to China. In this study, population genomics analysis was applied to identify candidate genes associated with sheep tails based on an in-depth whole-genome sequencing of MG, STH and DS. The selective signature analysis demonstrated that GLIS1, LOC101117953, PDGFD and T were in the significant divergent regions between DS and STH-MG. A nonsynonymous point mutation (g.27807636G>T) was found within GLIS1 in STH-MG and resulted in a Pro to Thr substitution. As a pro-adipogenic factor, GLIS1 may play critical roles in the mesodermal cell differentiation during fetal development affecting fat deposition in sheep tails. This study gives a new insight into the genetic basis of species-specific traits of sheep tails.

AB  - The shipping of liquid preserved semen is common practice in animal breeding and prior to cryopres-ervation for gene banking. Vibration emissions during transport may be harmful to spermatozoa. Therefore, strategies to minimize agitation-induced sperm injury are needed. The aim was to examine whether the type of semen extender, time after semen processing and the temperature in simulated transport conditions influence the response of boar spermatozoa to agitation stress. In Experiment 1, boar semen samples (n = 16) extended in Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) or Androstar Plus (APL) medium were filled in 90 mL tubes and shaken for 4 h at 200 rpm either at 22 degrees C or 17 degrees C. Samples were then stored at 17 degrees C for 144 h. In Experiment 2, semen samples (n = 11) extended in Androstar Premium were shaken either directly after filling at 22 degrees C or 20 h later after cooling to 5 degrees C. Samples were stored at 5 degrees C for 144 h. In Experiment 1, sperm motility and viability were lower (p < 0.05) in the shaken samples compared to the controls. The temperature, extender and the storage length had no effect on the agitation-induced loss of sperm quality. Sperm quality traits were higher in samples stored in APL compared to BTS. In Experiment 2, sperm motility at 24 h was reduced (p < 0.05) in those samples shaken at 22 degrees C but not at 5 degrees C. Sperm viability, membrane fluidity and mitochondrial membrane po-tential were not affected in either of the treatment groups. Extended boar semen designed for 17 degrees C storage and shipped on the day of collection is sensitive to agitation stress. In contrast, spermatozoa slowly cooled to 5 degrees C and shaken 20 h after processing are more resistant to agitation-induced shear forces and interfacial phenomena. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BackgroundAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a viral disease that affects pigs and wild boars providing economic burden in swine industry.Methods and resultsIn this study, we investigated the effect of deleting the ASFV multigene family 110 (MGF110) fragment (1 L-5-6 L) on apoptosis modulation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Gene expression in swine peripheral blood macrophages infected with either the parental "Volgograd/14c" strain or the gene-deleted "Volgograd/D(1L-5-6L) MGF110" strain was analyzed. Caspase-3 activity was 1.15 times higher in macrophages infected with the parental ASFV strain compared to the gene-deleted strain. Gene expression analysis of Caspase-3 (Cas-3), Interferon-A (IFN-A), Tumor Necrosis Factor A (TNF-A), B-cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), Interleukin-12 (IL-12), and Heat Shock Protein-70 (HSP-70) using RT-qPCR at various time points after infection revealed significant differences in expression profiles between the strains. The peak expression of cytokines (except NF-kB) occurred at 24 h post-infection with the "Volgograd/D(1L-5-6L) MGF110" strain. In samples infected with the ASFV "Volgograd/14c" strain, the most intense expression was observed at 72 and 96 h, except for Bcl-2 and NF-kB, which peaked at 6 h post-infection. The cytokine expression trend for the "Volgograd/D(1L-5-6L) MGF110" strain was more stable with higher expression values.ConclusionThe expression trend for the parental strain increased over time, reaching maximum values at 72 and 96 h post-infection, but the overall expression level was lower than that of the gene-deleted strain. These findings suggest that deleting the multigene family 110 members (1 L-5-6 L) contributes to ASFV attenuation without affecting virus replication kinetics.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate and compare the physiological performance of different genetic groups of sheep, by physiological variables and serum hormone levels, in a hot weather environment. Thirty sheep from five genetic groups were used: Santa In & ecirc;s (SI), 1/2 Dorper + 1/2 Santa In & ecirc;s (DO), 1/2 Il & ecirc; de France + 1/2 Santa In & ecirc;s (IF), 1/2 Suffolk + 1/2 Santa In & ecirc;s (SK), and 1/2 Texel + 1/2 Santa In & ecirc;s (TX). The readings and records of physiological parameters (respiratory rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), auricular cavity temperature (ACT), and surface temperature (ST)) were carried out at 7:00 am, 1:00 pm, and 7:00 pm, in 12 non-consecutive days. The collections of blood samples for hormone analysis (triiodothyronine (T-3), thyroxine (T-4), and cortisol (CORT)) is in four consecutive days. The environmental conditions of the experimental period caused a thermal discomfort in the sheep, but not a state of thermal stress. The thermolysis mechanisms, sensitive (ST and ACT) and latent (RR) processes, were enough to maintain their homeostasis (RT). The results showed that crossbred breeds presented a higher metabolism and were more efficient at dissipating heat through thermolysis than the SI breed. The crossbred breeds were efficient at dissipating heat through the elevation of body surface temperature and respiratory rate, mainly SK and TX, i.e., crossbred breeds, despite the wool cover, used thermoregulatory mechanisms that promoted lower variation of RT. The analysis of variance showed significant effects (P < 0.05) to the time factor in the responses of T-4 and T-3, and to the breed factor in the responses of CORT, T-4, and T-3. We did not observe interaction between the factors to any of the hormonal variables. Therefore, we can state that the effect of time was independent of breed and vice versa. Thyroid hormones presented lower blood concentration in the mornings (4.03 +/- 0.82, T-4; 65.08 +/- 10.6, T-3), increasing their concentration in the afternoon (4.60 +/- 1.03, T-4; 70.16 +/- 14.17, T-3). The thyroid hormones presented a normal circadian rhythm, with the exception of SK. Air temperature (AT) showed greater correlation with physiological variables than enthalpy (H) did, in the experimental conditions. However, H showed correlation with T-4 and T-3. The adaptive profile of the genetic groups under study are different, but the IF genetic group showed better performance under environmental conditions.

AB  - As the environment is getting warmer and species are redistributed, consumers can be forced to adjust their interactions with available prey, and this could have cascading effects within food webs. To better understand the capacity for foraging flexibility, our study aimed to determine the diet variability of an ectotherm omnivore inhabiting kelp forests, the sea urchin Echinus esculentus, along its entire latitudinal distribution in the northeast Atlantic. Using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analyses, we determined the diet and trophic position of sea urchins at sites in Portugal (42 degrees N), France (49 degrees N), southern Norway (63 degrees N), and northern Norway (70 degrees N), and related these results to the local abundance and distribution of putative food items. With mean estimated trophic levels ranging from 2.4 to 4.6, omnivory and diet varied substantially within and between sites but not across latitudes. Diet composition generally reflected prey availability within epiphyte or understorey assemblages, with local affinities demonstrating that the sea urchin adjusts its foraging to match the small-scale distribution of food items. A net "preference" for epiphytic food sources was found in northern Norway, where understorey food was limited compared to other regions. We conclude that diet change may occur in response to food source redistribution at multiple spatial scales (microhabitats, sites, regions). Across these scales, the way that key consumers alter their foraging in response to food availability can have important implication for food web dynamics and ecosystem functions along current and future environmental gradients.

AB  - Camellia japonica is a native tree species with high economic value that is widely cultivated in southern China. In recent years, canker disease has been observed in camellia plantations in Zhejiang Province, China, with the disease incidence rate in some plantations exceeding 20%. Canker disease severely affects the trunks and branches of C. japonica in China, but the causal agent has not yet been identified. In this study, the pathogen was isolated from infected C. japonica tissues through a conventional tissue isolation approach. Species identification was conducted using morphological methods combined with multilocus phylogenetic analysis. Pathogenicity was tested based on Koch's postulates. The results showed that the pathogen could be isolated from the diseased bark of C. japonica 'Hongluzhen'. The pathogen was identified as Nectria pseudotrichia based on morphological, cultural, and molecular traits. The inoculation of the pathogen into C. japonica 'Hongluzhen' caused necrotic lesions on healthy seedlings, and the fungus N. pseudotrichia could be re-isolated from such lesions. Therefore, N. pseudotrichia is the causal agent of canker disease affecting C. japonica in China.

AB  - Simple Summary The study evaluated the mutation effects of BSCL2 variants on slaughter and fattening characteristics and meat quality traits. These mutations were selected based on variant calling analysis and chi test results within subcutaneous fat RNA-seq data. Potential genetic markers revealed significant genotype/allele distribution variations between high- and low-fat pigs. We suggested that the proposed variant calling derived from RNA-seq data might help develop genetic markers for complex pig traits. The results pinpoint that the selection of the BSCL2 G allele (rs341493267) could increase backfat thickness in pigs. In addition, observed polymorphisms also affected meat percentage, loin mass, and eye area. BSCL2 encodes seipin, a transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein associated with lipodystrophy and severe metabolic complications, including diabetes and hepatic steatosis. In pigs, BSCL2 expression increases during adipocyte differentiation. In the present study, we identified significant gene variants associated with fat deposition (FD)-related processes based on subcutaneous fat tissue RNA-seq data. In the association study, to prove our hypothesis, three Polish pig breeds were included: Zlotnicka White (ZW, n = 72), Polish Landrace (PL, n = 201), and Polish Large White (PLW, n = 169). Based on variant calling analysis and chi(2) tests, BSCL2 mutations showing significantly different genotype/allele distribution between high- and low-fat pigs were selected for a comprehensive association study. Four interesting BSCL2 variants (rs346079334, rs341493267, rs330154033, and rs81333153) belonging to downstream and missense mutations were investigated. Our study showed a significant decrease in minor allele frequency for two BSCL2 variants (rs346079334 and rs341493267) in PL pigs in 2020-2021. In ZW, BSCL2 mutations significantly affected loin and ham fats, meat redness, and growth performance traits, such as feed conversion and daily feed intake. Similar observations were noted for PLW and PL, where BSCL2 mutations influenced fat depositions and meat traits, such as loin eye area, loin mass and fat, carcass yield, and growth performance traits. Based on the observation in pigs, our study supports the theory that BSCL2 expressed in subcutaneous fat is involved in the FD process.

AB  - Extant diversity for phenotypic traits is an essential criterion to be considered when ordering priorities for conservation and improvement of animal genetic resources. Concretely, the characterisation of the distinctive body morphometry of a particular group of animals can aid in the design of selective breeding programs, given the strong correlation between body morphology and productive function. The present research aims to characterise an endangered autochthonous camel breed (Canarian camel), mainly relegated to leisure riding, for its body morphology, with a double objective: to explore the phenotypic diversity and structure of the breed for zoometric traits and assess the zoometric profile of this genetic resource that supports its differentiation from other camel breeds. Overall, the results highlight the existence of a high degree of diversity, which may be linked to genetic factors for zoometric traits in an endangered autochthonous breed with traditional in situ breeding schemes, which predicts the success of the implementation of genetic improvement schemes for such functional characteristics. This phenotypic diversity in body morphology could also be a tool for the evaluation of new functional niches within the efforts of functional valorisation of this camel breed for its sustainable conservation. Body morphology traits in the studied camel breed are significantly influenced by sex, physiological status and coat colour.

AB  - Herbivorous insects harbor a variety of insect-specific viruses (ISVs) some of which are considered to be valuable biological agents for potential applications in biological defense and control strategies. Leaf beetles with chewing mouthparts are particularly known for their capacity to disrupt plant tissue while feeding, often creating openings that can act as entry points for plant pathogens. In this study, we have identified two new negative-sense RNA viruses infecting the leaf beetle Aulacophora indica, an important member of the Chrysomelidae family. These recently discovered viruses belong to the viral families Nyamiviridae and Chuviridae and have been preliminarily named Aulacophora indica nyami-like virus 1 (AINlV1) and Aulacophora indica chu-like virus 1 (AIClV1), respectively. The complete genomic sequences of these viruses were obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. Detailed analysis of their genomic structures has confirmed their similarity to other members within their respective families. Furthermore, analysis of virus-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) demonstrated a high abundance and typical vsiRNA pattern of AINlV1 and AIClV1, offering substantial evidence to support their classification as ISVs. This research enhances our understanding of viral diversity within insects.

AB  - Simple Summary Previous studies have demonstrated a reduced response to sire growth breeding values when there is poor ewe nutrition, resulting in lighter lambs. The current study has demonstrated that production factors which influence lamb growth, such as birth type, rear type, or sire breed, have a similar effect. The reduced growth in lambs is quantified in this study to provide lamb producers with realistic expectations of lamb growth, when high growth sires are used in combination with production factors which influence growth. Lamb growth can be optimised with genetic selection using sire Australian sheep breeding values, however, breeding value expression has been shown to be reduced with poor nutrition. It was therefore hypothesised that the genetic potential for lamb growth would also be reduced, where production factors such as multiple births limit growth. Live weights at birth, weaning, and post-weaning were collected from more than 18,000 lambs produced over five years and eight locations of the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre Information Nucleus Flock experiment, and the impact of environment, production factors, and genotype was determined using mixed effects regression. The genetic potential for lamb growth was moderated by environment, multiple births, and sire type (p < 0.05). Twin lambs achieved 76% of the expected weight gain at weaning and 58% post-weaning. For triplet lambs weight gains were drastically less at approximately 30% of the expected gain at the same time points. Lambs born to maternal sires consistently had the poorest response to genetic selection, achieving approximately half the expected weight gain. Hence, producers need to temper expectations for growth based on genetic selection, or employ mitigation strategies such as precision feeding, the use of alternate breeds, or place emphasis on the genetic merit of other desirable traits.

AB  - Simple Summary The need for effective and efficient means of mass depopulation of swine is critical, given foreign animal diseases, natural disasters, and other hazards that threaten swine production. Mass depopulation methods that can be applied to swine at all ages under field conditions are important due to the varying sizes and differing handling methods across the stages of swine development. The American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines for Mass Depopulation contain limited options for procedures under constrained circumstances that can be applied rapidly across all sizes of pigs. Previous work has shown that water-based foam can be as effective as carbon dioxide for adult swine depopulation, but without CO2 supply, expensive equipment, and potential human health hazards. The present study demonstrates that water-based foam is also effective for depopulating, in suckling (18 to 24 days) and finisher (63 to 100 days) pigs. When combined with previous findings, water-based foam is a depopulation method that can be applied rapidly and effectively to all ages in the swine production cycle. The threat of foreign animal disease introduction through contaminated animal products, feed ingredients, and wildlife vectors have highlighted the need for additional approved methods for mass depopulation of swine under emergency scenarios, especially methods that can be applied to pigs across all production phases. The market disruption within the swine industry due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated this lack of preparation. The objective of this study was to validate water-based foam as a mass depopulation method for suckling (18 to 24 days of age) and finisher stage (63 to 100 days of age) pigs. Finisher pigs (n = 31, originally 32 but one finisher pig died prior to foaming), allocated as 9 triads and 1 set of 4 pigs, in 10 total replicates, and suckling pigs (n = 32), randomly allocated to two replicates, were completely covered in water-based medium-expansion foam for a 15-min dwell time in a bulk container. Container fill time for the trials were 6.5 +/- 0.68 s and 5.3 +/- 0.03 s for finisher and suckling pig replicates, respectively. Average (+/- SD) time for cessation of movement was 105 +/- 39.1 s (s) for finisher pigs and 79.5 +/- 10.5 s for suckling pigs. After completion of the 15-min dwell time in the foam, all pigs were confirmed dead upon removal from the container. The results from the present study suggest that the use of water-based foam can be an effective means of mass depopulation for suckling and finisher stage pigs, supporting previous research on the application to adult swine.

AB  - Background: The frequent occurrence of extreme temperature events causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. Therefore, delving into the differences in the physiological and molecular mechanisms of heat stress across different sheep breeds is crucial for developing effective management and breeding strategies. Methods: This study explores the differences in heat tolerance mechanisms between Hu sheep and Xinggao sheep by comparing their growth performance under normal and heat stress conditions, as well as examining the differences in physiological, biochemical, and antioxidant indicators related to heat tolerance, serum metabolomics, and gut microbiomics in a heat stress environment. Results: The results indicate that with changes in the temperature-humidity index (THI), Hu sheep exhibit superior stability in respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) fluctuations compared to Xinggao sheep. In terms of biochemical indicators and antioxidant capacity, the levels of creatinine (Cr) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in Hu sheep serum are significantly higher than those in Xinggao sheep. In comparison, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels are significantly lower. Metabolomic results showed that, compared to Hu sheep, Xinggao sheep exhibited higher cortisol (COR) and dopamine (DA) levels under heat stress conditions, a stronger lipid mobilization capacity, and elevated levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites. Furthermore, gut microbiome analysis results indicate that Hu sheep demonstrate stronger cellulose degradation capabilities, as evidenced by significantly higher abundances of microorganisms such as Ruminococcus, Fibrobacter, and Bacteroidales_RF16_group, compared to Xinggao sheep. Conclusions: In summary, Hu sheep exhibit stronger heat tolerance compared to Xinggao sheep. These findings provide an important theoretical basis for the breeding and selection of heat-tolerant meat sheep varieties and offer strong support for the region's livestock industry in addressing the challenges posed by global warming.

AB  - Hippodamia convergens-the convergent lady beetle, has been used extensively in augmentative biological control of aphids, thrips, and whiteflies across its native range in North America, and was introduced into South America in the 1950s. Overwintering H. convergens populations from its native western range in the United States are commercially collected and released across its current range in the eastern USA, with little knowledge of the effectiveness of its augmentative biological control. Here we use a novel ddRADseq-based SNP/haplotype discovery approach to estimate its range-wide population diversity, differentiation, and recent evolutionary history. Our results indicate (1) significant population differentiation among eastern USA, western USA, and South American populations of H. convergens, with (2) little to no detectable recent admixture between them, despite repeated population augmentation, and (3) continued recent population size expansion across its range. These results contradict previous findings using microsatellite markers. In light of these new findings, the implications for the effectiveness of augmentative biological control using H. convergens are discussed. Additionally, because quantifying the non-target effects of augmentative biological control is a difficult problem in migratory beetles, our results could serve as a cornerstone in improving and predicting the efficacy of future releases of H. convergens across its range.

AB  - Purpose The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an ethyl acetate extract of Artemisia ludoviciana on the viability of adult Fasciola hepatica parasites and eggs. Methods The collection of plant material was performed as described in previous reports. The dried material was macerated with ethyl acetate. Ovicidal assays were performed at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L A. ludoviciana extract. Bioassays of fasciolicidal efficacy in adult specimens of F. hepatica were performed at extract concentrations of 125, 250, 375 and 500 mg/L. The effects of triclabendazole, a reference drug, and artemisinin were also evaluated. Results The ovicidal effectiveness of the extracts obtained after 16 h of incubation at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L was 48%, 52%, 87%, 89% and 92%, respectively (p < 0.05), and the fasciolicidal efficiencies during the first 24 h post-treatment ranged from 82 to 100% (p < 0.05). In both cases, scanning electron microscopy revealed damage to the shells of the eggs treated with the extract, compromising their stability. In adult fasciolae, alterations to the integument that resulted in its erosion and detachment were observed. Histopathological studies of the affected specimens revealed damage to the tegumentary and subtegumentary cells and alterations in the ovaries, testicles and intestine. This damage was more severe after treatment with the extract than after treatment with the other compounds. Methods Extract of A. ludoviciana causes damage to the tegument, intestine, ovaries, testes and eggs of F. hepatica.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to elucidate the evolution of African Suidae and the molecular basis of their unique phenotypes, thereby attempting to fill these gaps. To this end, we performed the genome assembly and annotation of warthogs and Kenyan domestic pigs to identify the genetic resources responsible for warthog resistance against African swine fever. Our results showed that genes in the warthog genome relate to its adaptation to the African environment and that the gene lactate dehydrogenase B could be considered a tolerance gene to African swine fever. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because our results provide valuable resources and data support for future evolutionary research on African pigs and genetic research adapted to unique local geographic environments in Africa. Additionally, the results of this study provide a new candidate gene for understanding the resistance mechanisms of warthogs against African swine fever. Background: As warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) have innate immunity against African swine fever (ASF), it is critical to understand the evolutionary novelty of warthogs to explain their specific ASF resistance. Methods: Here, we present two completed new genomes of one warthog and one Kenyan domestic pig as fundamental genomic references to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of ASF tolerance. Results: Multiple genomic variations, including gene losses, independent contraction, and the expansion of specific gene families, likely molded the warthog genome to adapt to the environment. Importantly, the analysis of the presence and absence of genomic sequences revealed that the DNA sequence of the warthog genome had an absence of the gene lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) on chromosome 2 compared with the reference genome. The overexpression and siRNA of LDHB inhibited the replication of the African swine fever virus. Combined with large-scale sequencing data from 42 pigs worldwide, the contraction and expansion of tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) gene families revealed that TRIM family genes in the warthog genome are potentially responsible for its tolerance to ASF. Conclusion: Our results will help improve the understanding of genetic resistance to ASF in pigs.

AB  - The hippocampus (HPC) is essential for navigation and memory, tracking environmental continuity and change, including navigation relative to moving targets. CA1 ensembles expressing immediate-early gene (IEG) Arc and Homer1a RNA are contextually specific. While IEG expression correlates with HPC-dependent task demands, the effects of behavioral demands on IEG-expressing ensembles remain unclear. In three experiments, we investigated the effects of context switch, sustained presence, and task demands on dorso-proximal CA1 IEG+ ensembles in rats. Experiment 1 showed that the size of IEG+ (Arc, Homer1a RNA) ensembles dropped to baseline during uninterrupted 30-min exploration, reflecting familiarization, unless a context switch was present. Context specificity of the ensembles depended on both environment identity and timing of the context switch. Experiment 2 found no effect of HPC-dependent mobile robot avoidance or HPC-independent avoidance of a stationary robot on IEG+ ensembles beyond mere exploration. Experiment 3 replicated these findings for c-Fos protein. The data suggest that IEG+ ensembles are driven by a context switch and shrink over time during sustained presence in the same environment. We found no evidence of task demands or their change affecting the size, stability over time, or task-specificity of IEG+ ensembles. These results shed light on the temporal dynamics of CA1 IEG+ ensembles, and their control by contextual and behavioral factors.

AB  - The concentrations and distributions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), poly-chlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the whole blood and meat of eight typical edible animals (chicken, donkey, horse, cattle, rabbit, sheep, duck, and pig) were illustrated. Total concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and PCBs (on a basis of liquid volume) in animal bloods were 142-484 pg/L and 46-62 ng/L, respectively. Total concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs (on a basis of dry weight (dw) and lipid weight (lw)) in animal meat samples were 0.47-1090 pg/g dw (0.47-4513 pg/g lw) and 7.2-23 ng/g dw (10-776 ng/g lw), respectively. TEQs for both PCDD/Fs and PCBs in animal blood and meat samples were (67 ?? 27) pg/L and (5.3 ?? 14) pg/g dw (24 ?? 56 pg/g lw), respectively. Besides, the dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were also es-timated. Chicken and pig contributed more TEQs than other animals. Chicken contributed the most (95%) with high toxicity, followed by pig (3.4%) with high consumption. The dietary intake of chicken might pose risks to consumers who prefer to eat chicken products, who should comprehensively consider the essential nutrients and contaminants in food during dietary intake. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is one of the most important factors affecting meat quality and is closely associated with the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) which facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into the mitochondria. However, the role of how CPT1A regulates the IMF formation remains unclear. Herein, we established the temporal expression profile of CPT1A during the differentiation of goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. Functionally, the knockdown of CPT1A by siRNA treatment significantly increased the mRNA expression of adipogenic genes and promoted lipid deposition in goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. Meanwhile, a CPT1A deficiency inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis significantly. CPT1A was then supported by the overexpression of CPT1A which significantly suppressed the cellular triglyceride deposition and promoted cell proliferation although the cell apoptosis also was increased. For RNA sequencing, a total of 167 differential expression genes (DEGs), including 125 upregulated DEGs and 42 downregulated DEGs, were observed after the RNA silencing of CPT1A compared to the control, and were predicted to enrich in the focal adhesion pathway, cell cycle, apoptosis and the MAPK signaling pathway by KEGG analysis. Specifically, blocking the MAPK signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor (PD169316) rescued the promotion of cell proliferation in CPT1A overexpression adipocytes. In conclusion, the expression variation of CPT1A may reconstruct the lipid distribution between cellular triglyceride deposition and cell proliferation in goat intramuscular precursor adipocyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CPT1A promotes the proliferation of goat adipocytes through the MAPK signaling pathway. This work widened the genetic regulator networks of IMF formation and delivered theoretical support for improving meat quality from the aspect of IMF deposition.

AB  - Plants and herbivores have co-existed for millions of years, leading to complex relationships. Recent studies of plant-insect interactions have focused on important implications of plant defenses on insect immunity. Plants express defenses against herbivores through the production of toxic secondary chemicals, which may alter immune responses. The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, has been shown to use toxic secondary chemicals (cardenolides) of milkweed plants (Asclepias spp.) to help reduce parasitism. However, little is known about the interaction of these secondary chemicals on the insect immune response. Therefore, we reared monarch caterpillars on five different milkweed species with varying cardenolide levels and measured their immune response to an immune stimulus. In particular, we measured a humoral immune response, in the form of anti-microbial growth, following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial cell wall component. We show that the immune challenge caused a strong humoral immune response in monarch caterpillars. However, the response did not vary with milkweed species and cardenolide concentrations. Our results suggest that the toxins of milkweeds do not directly impact the humoral immune response.

AB  - Chromatin regulators constitute a fundamental means of transcription regulation, which have been implicated in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopment disorders (NDDs). Supt16, one of candidate genes for NDDs, encodes the large subunit of facilitates chromatin transcription. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, Supt16(+/-) mice was generated, modeling the neurodevelopment disorder. Abnormal cognitive and social behavior was observed in the Supt16 (+/-) mice. Simultaneously, the number of neurocytes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is decreased, which might be resulted from the impairment of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) in the SVZ. Supt16 haploinsufficiency affects the proliferation and apoptosis of mNSCs. As the RNA-seq and chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing assays showed, Supt16 haploinsufficiency disrupts the stemness of mNSCs by inhibiting MAPK signal pathway. Thus, this study demonstrates a critical role of Supt16 gene in the proliferation and apoptosis of mNSCs and provides a novel insight in the pathogenesis of NDDs.

AB  - The nematodes of the genus Oesophagostomum Molin, 1861 parasitize in the large intestine of ruminants and are widely represented in the terrestrial ecosystems of many countries of the world. One of the most common species of this genus in small ruminants is Oesophagostomum venulosum Rudolphi, 1809. The validity of this species was established using morphological and molecular genetic methods, the importance of which is still relevant. The aim of our research was to determine the morphological and metric characteristics of O. venulosum nematodes isolated from domestic goats in Ukraine. The differential parameters of mature males and females of nematodes of this species are described and illustrated, and the obtained data is analyzed in the context of the findings of other authors. The taxonomic morphological characters of O. venulosum include the presence of a pronounced cuticular vesicle at the head end, inner and external corona radiata, cervical papillae located behind the esophagus; in males, the presence of prebursal papillae in front of the tail bursa and features of its structure, thin and tubular spicules and features of the structure of their proximal and distal ends; in females, features of the structure of the tail end, vulva and its location. 35 morphometric indicators were determined and proposed to be used in the identification of O. venulosum in males, and 29 indicators in females. Of these, 20 parameters characterize the general body structure (the length and width of the nematode, the dimensions of the mouth capsule, cervical vesicle, esophagus, the length of the inner and outer radial crowns, the location of the nerve ring and cervical papillae, as well as their sizes). In male nematodes of this species, 15 indicators characterize the metric parameters of the reproductive system (the size of the spicules in their various parts, gubernaculum, genital cone, genital papillae and their location, the width of the copulatory bursa). In females, 7 indicators are described that characterize the length of the vagina, the ovipositor, the location of the vulva and anus, the width of the body in the area of the vulva and anus, as well as two metric parameters of eggs. The identified and described morphometric characters of O. venulosum males and females based on microscopic studies can be an economical and effective method for researchers to accurately identify nematodes of this species. The information obtained in this study can contribute to the timely planning of control and prevention strategies for the parasitism of these nematodes on goat farms.

AB  - Camellia sinensis is an industrial crop characterized by specific secondary metabolites, which provide numerous benefits to human health. Previous researches reveal that the secondary metabolism of tea plants is significantly affected by various environmental factors, especially light intensity. However, the epigenetic mechanism underlying these high light-induced changes remains systematic research. In this study, physiological analysis suggested that increased photosynthetic product was rapidly converted into other organic compounds in adaptation to high light. The metabolite landscape by widely targeted metabolome revealed 219 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in high light, with substantial upregulated DAMs accumulated in 'amino acids and derivatives' and 'alkaloids'. The landscape of nine crucial histone modifications showed the distribution diversity in the genome and the complex relationship with gene expression. Integrated analysis of stomatal development, metabolome, epigenome, and transcriptome indicated that the dynamics of histone modifications (H3K4ac, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me2, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) on gene regions were closely related to the expression of regulatory genes in stomatal development and enzyme genes in secondary metabolic pathways, leading to stomatal density and metabolite changes in high light. Furthermore, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 were identified as key histone modifications, regulating critical genes under high light, including CsEPFL9, CsYODAb, CsF3 ' Hb, CsCHSc, CsANRa, CsDFRb-2, CsAlaDC, CsAAP1, CsGGT2, CsXMPP, Cs7-NMT, CsPORC, and CsPSY. These results suggest the pivotal role of histone modifications in the high light-induced stomatal density and secondary metabolite changes of tea plants.

AB  - In modern pig farming, it is vital to improve growth performance while reducing environmental impacts and feed costs. However, production systems often face challenges with nutrient utilization and waste management. For this reason, researchers are exploring alternative feed additives to improve efficiency and sustainability. Several studies have shown that eco-friendly additives can improve growth and digestion, but their effects at different dietary protein levels remain unclear. Therefore, this experiment evaluated the effects of adding eco-friendly additives to normal and low-protein diets on finishing pigs. Our results confirmed that eco-friendly additives were effective in improving growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and meat quality while reducing ammonia emissions, making it a beneficial and sustainable feed additive. This study contributes to promoting green farming and achieving sustainable pork production. Especially under the conditions of resource scarcity and rising environmental demands, efficient and eco-friendly feeding strategies have become key to industry development. We evaluated the effects of supplementing an eco-friendly additive (EFA) in diets with normal and low protein (-2% CP) levels on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, gas emission, fecal score, meat quality, and blood profile in finishing pigs. In this 10-week (70-day and 7-day adaptation period) feeding experiment, 200 crossbred pigs [Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire)] with an initial average body weight (BW) of 55.05 +/- 3.35 kg were used. The pigs were randomly assigned to four treatment groups in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with five pigs per replicate group, including two gilts and three barrows per pen, and each treatment group was repeated 10 times. The experimental treatments included the following: two protein levels (normal CP and -2% CP) and two EFA levels (0% and 0.5% EFA). The results showed that pigs fed high-protein + EFA diets had a significantly higher ADG from weeks 0-5 compared to the high-protein control group (p < 0.05). From weeks 5-10 and overall, both high-protein + EFA and low-protein + EFA groups had a higher ADG than the low-protein - EFA group (p < 0.05). At week 10, the low-protein + EFA group showed significantly higher nitrogen digestibility and significantly lower ammonia emissions compared to the high-protein - EFA group (p < 0.05). Both EFA supplementation and protein level had significant effects on ammonia emissions. The fecal score was not significantly affected (p > 0.05). In blood profiles, NPY was higher in the high-protein + EFA group than in the low-protein - EFA group (p < 0.05). In terms of meat quality, both EFA-supplemented groups had a higher WHC compared to the low-protein - EFA group, while the high-protein + EFA group had a greater LMA (p < 0.05) and lower drip loss on day 7 after slaughter (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementing low-protein diets with EFA can effectively enhance the growth performance of finishing pigs, mitigate environmental pollution, and offer feeding advantages while lowering feed costs.

AB  - Aesculus L. (buckeye and horse chestnut) are woody plant species with important horticultural and medicinal values. Aesculus seeds are widely used as biomedicine and cosmetic ingredients due to their saponins. We report a chromosomal-scale genome of Aesculus wilsonii. Sequences amounting to a total of 579.01 Mb were assembled into 20 chromosomes. More than half of the genome (54.46%) were annotated as repetitive sequences, and 46,914 protein-coding genes were predicted. In addition to the widespread gamma event with core eudicots, a unique whole-genome duplication (WGD) event (17.69 Mya) occurred in Aesculus after buckeye differentiated from longan. Due to WGD events and tandem duplications, the related synthetic genes of triterpene saponins unique to Aesculus increased significantly. Combined with transcriptome characterization, the study preliminarily resolved the biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoid saponins like aescin in A. wilsonii genome. Analyses of the resequencing of 104 buckeye accessions revealed clear relationship between the geographic distribution and genetic differentiation of buckeye trees in China. We found that the buckeye species found in southern Shaanxi is A. wilsonii rather than A. chinensis. Population dynamics analysis further suggests that the population size and evolution of existing buckeye species have been influenced by climate fluctuations during the Pleistocene and recent domestication events. The genome of A. wilsonii and population genomics of Aesculus provide a resource for future research on Hippocastanaceae. These findings will contribute to the utilization and diversity protection of Aesculus.

AB  - Anaerobically digested liquid pig manure (LPM) is enriched with nutrients and thus can be used as an alternative nutrient source and substitute for chemical fertilizer (CF) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) farming. However, there are concerns regarding the contamination of the surrounding water due to the discharge of ponding water containing dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) from rice paddies fertilized using LPM. This study investigated the effects of the co-application of fly ash (FA) and zeolite (Z) amendments (FAZ amendments) on the concentration of DOC, N, and P in the ponding water of rice paddies fertilized with LPM at two different rates (standard (LPMS) and double (LPMD) at 11 and 22 g N m-2, respectively). Rice was cultivated using four nutrient treatments, including no input, CF (11 g N m-2), LPMS, and LPMD, with or without FAZ amendments. When FAZ was not amended, LPMS and LPMD application increased the DOC concentration by 32% and 41%, respectively, compared to CF treatments (11 g N m-2), reflecting a high DOC concentration in LPM. The total N and P concentrations in the ponding water were lower in LPMS treatment (by 5 and 8%, respectively) but higher (by 94% and 47%, respectively) in LPMD treatment compared to CF treatments in the absence of FAZ, indicating a high potential for water pollution with a double LPM application rate. With a given nutrient treatment, FAZ amendments decreased DOC by 15-39%, supporting the immobilization of DOC by Z. FAZ consistently decreased the NH4+ concentration by 6-51% across the nutrient treatments, likely via the sorption of NH4+ onto the negatively charged sites of Z, but its effect on total N concentration was not consistent. Unexpectedly, total P concentration increased (by 77-167%) following the FAZ amendment. FAZ amendments tended to increase rice biomass and grain yield for LPM treatments, but these rice growth parameters were poor compared to CF regardless of FAZ amendment. Our results show that the application of LPM as a complete replacement for CF may hamper rice yield while increasing the likelihood of water pollution with DOC and P, although the co-application of FAZ may help to reduce rice yield loss and decrease DOC and NH4+ concentrations.

AB  - Insulin dysfunction of diabetes mellitus (DM) disorders the glucose metabolism in Sertoli cells (SCs), resulting in the impairment of spermatogenesis.Insulin signaling system in Sertoli cells (SCs) plays an important role in regulating lactate secretion. Heat treatment could increase the lactate secretion of boar SCs, but whether heat treatment participates in lactate secretion by improving the sensitivity of insulin is unknown. In the current study, the primary SCs from 21-day-old boar were employed to treat with 100 nM insulin for 24 h or heat treatment (43 ?, 30 min). Heat treatment strengthened the effect of insulin on the effect of lactate secretion. In addition, heat treatment increased the expression of insulin induced insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), but reduced the expression of miR-7-5p. Using dual luciferase reporter assay and Western blot, the study found that IRS2 is a potential target gene of miR-7-5p. Heat treatment also enhanced the Phosphorylation of insulin-stimulated PI3K/Akt, and increased lactate secretion by promoting the expression of Glucose Transporter 3 (GLUT3), Lactate Dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). Furthermore, miR-7-5p inhibitor could partly mimic the effects of heat treatment on lactate production of SCs, indicating that heat treatment improves insulin sensitivity by regulating the expression of miR-7-5p/IRS2/PI3K/Akt. These results reveal a novel miRNA-mediated mechanism of heat treatment on the regulation of lactate metabolism production, and suggest that targeting miR-7-5p is a probably therapeutic method to insulin dysfunction-induced metabolic diseases.

AB  - The Camellia oleifera industry is hindered by the substandard quality of its fruits and the low yield of camellia seed oil. Although soil factors have been shown to affect the productivity of this plant, the relationship between C. oleifera characteristics and soil properties and nutrients remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated soil factors within the central distribution area of this species. Our findings revealed that this plant thrives in acidic soils with a medium cation exchange capacity. There were moderate differences in the main and medium element contents in the soils, while the variation of microelements was significant. Overall, C. oleifera cultivated soils were poor, with an uneven distribution of soil nutrients. Most of the shape characteristics of camellia fruits showed moderate variability, whereas dry kernel rate and oil content exhibited minor variability. The fatty acid profiles remained stable across different planting sites, but there were higher variations in the content of active compounds. Fruit shape characteristics were primarily influenced by soil properties, while soil nutrients mainly affected the seeds and kernels of the fruit. Minor fatty acid content could be influenced by soil properties and nutrients, except for total nitrogen (TN), which specifically affected the content of palmitic acid and oleic acid. There was no significant correlation between soil factors and sterols, polyphenols, and tocopherols, while squalene was affected by soil properties. Our study highlights the importance of considering soil properties and nutrients in the cultivation of C. oleifera and emphasizes the need for rational fertilizer application.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the expression and function of lysine-specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B) in yak cumulus cells (CCs) in order to reveal the mechanisms by which KDM4B regulates biological characteristics and function of CCs. The cellular location of KDM4B and the methylation pattern of H3K9 were detected using immunofluorescence (IF) staining in CCs. The mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (BCL-2, HAX1 and BAX) and genes related to the estrogen pathway (ESR2, CYP17 and 3B-HSD) were estimated by qRT-PCR after knockdown of KDM4B expression by siRNA in yak CCs. Then, a proliferation assay, Annexin V-FITC staining, and ELISA were utilized to explore the effects of KDM4B silencing on CCs proliferation, apoptosis, and estrogen (E-2) secretion, respectively. The results showed that KDM4B is located in the nuclei of yak CCs and is distributed in a dotted pattern. Knockdown KDM4B induced a decrease in cell proliferation, an increase in apoptotic rate and a reduction in the levels of E-2 secretion of CCs. Additionally, the methylation patterns of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 were significantly increased in CCs transfected with KDM4B siRNA-1 (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression level of apoptosis promoting BAX genes was significantly upregulated, but 3B-HSD, ESR2 and anti-apoptotic HAX1 genes were significantly downregulated in transfected CCs (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of embryos developing from the 2-cell stage to blastocysts was lower in the siRNA-1 transfection group than that of the control group (28.6 +/- 2.9% vs 40.4 +/- 2.4%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicates that KDM4B regulates the biological characteristics and physiological function of yak CCs mainly through changing the methylation patterns of H3K9 and related gene expression levels.

AB  - Simple Summary Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii are apicomplexan parasites with a worldwide distribution and both infect cattle. While the importance of N. caninum is mainly linked to reproductive losses, concern has been raised about the role of beef as a source of food-borne toxoplasmosis in humans. Little is known about the prevalence of these parasites in cattle in Portugal. This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for N. caninum and T. gondii in naturally exposed cattle from different geographical areas in the country. Results point to a low but widespread seroprevalence of T. gondii, while that of N. caninum was found to be in the same range as reported in other Mediterranean countries. Distribution of both parasites may be explained by common climate factors and management practices identified as significant predictors of infection in the study. Neospora caninum has a worldwide economic impact as an important cause of abortion in cattle, while Toxoplasma gondii, another abortifacient pathogen, is globally a major foodborne zoonotic threat. The study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for the two parasites in cattle in Portugal. A total of 612 sera from 35 farms were tested by an in-house p30 ELISA for T. gondii and p38 ELISA for N. caninum. T. gondii positive and suspicious sera were confirmed by p30 Western blot or IFAT. T. gondii and N. caninum animal seroprevalence was 9.2% (95%CI 7.1-11.7) and 17.2% (95% CI 14.4-20.4) and herd seroprevalence was 51.4% (95% CI 35.6-67.0) and 68.6% (95% CI 52.0-81.5), respectively. At the univariable level, climate area and precipitation of wettest month, driest month, driest quarter, and warmest quarter were significant predictors of seropositivity for both. N. caninum seropositivity was more likely in the region Norte, densely populated areas, and intensive production, and the probability of T. gondii seropositivity decreased with herd size. Results confirm the need to consider neosporosis in the differential diagnosis of cattle reproductive disorders in Portugal and may be valuable to inform source attribution models for human toxoplasmosis.

AB  - Aerobic composting can recycle nutrients from animal manure. Adding microorganism inoculants is an effective way to accelerate composting process. The study aimed to evaluate effects of inoculating with microbial agents on nitrogen conversion and bacterial community succession in pig manure composting. 3 composting treatments were conducted including no microbial inoculant (CK), inoculating thermophilic degrading bacteria (T1), and compound commercial microbial agents (T2). The results showed that T1 advanced the time for entering the thermophilic stage (>50 degree celsius), and accelerated organic matter degradation. T1 produced more NH3 than other treatments. TN in group T1 and T2 was significantly greater than CK in composting maturity stage (after 14-15 d, T <= 40 degree celsius). (Final C/N)/(Initial C/N) of group T1 and T2 was 0.66, 0.65, and GI was 90.7 and 87.6, respectively. T1 improved the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria at the phylum level and increased Bacillus genera at genus level during the composting process. In conclusion, we demonstrated that pig manure composting added to thermophilic degrading bacteria effectively improved the quality of compost.

AB  - Follicular atresia is primarily caused by granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis, although the mechanisms are largely unknown. Ufmylation is a recently identified ubiquitin-like post-translational modifier that plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Ufmylation on GC apoptosis during goat follicular atresia. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) and its target DDRGK domain containing 1 (DDRGK1) proteins were identified in granulosa cells (GCs) isolated from all stages of preantral follicles and from healthy (HF), early atretic (EF) and progressed atretic (PF) antral follicles. The expression levels were higher in GCs derived from antral atretic follicles than healthy follicles. Although the viability of GCs was not affected after overexpression of UFM1, siRNA-mediated UFM1 silencing significantly inhibited GC proliferation and induced apoptosis. Notably, components of the ufmylation pathway were significantly upregulated in GCs induced by the ER stress agent tunicamycin (Tm) and thapsigargin (Tg), but not affected by oxidative stress inducer H2O2. Furthermore, UFM1 silencing markedly increased the apoptosis of GCs upon Tg treatment by stimulating the ER stress-related gene expression. Our results provide evidence that UFM1 and its target DDRGK1 are expressed in the goat GCs during follicular development and atresia, and ufmylation may play an important role in the prevention of ER stress but not oxidative stress-induced GCs apoptosis.

AB  - Simple Summary As an indigenous animal living in the Tibetan plateau, the Tibetan sheep is well adapted to high-altitude hypoxia, and the lungs play an important role in overcoming the hypoxic environment. To reveal the physiological and proteomic basis of Tibetan sheep lungs during their adaptation to hypoxia, we studied the lungs of Tibetan sheep at different altitudes using light and electron microscopy and proteome sequencing. The results showed that in the lungs of Tibetan sheep occurred a series of physiological changes with increasing altitude, and some important proteins and pathways identified by proteome sequencing further support these physiology findings. These changes at the physiological and molecular levels may facilitate the adaptation of Tibetan sheep to high-altitude hypoxia. In conclusion, these findings may provide a reference for the prevention of altitude sickness in humans. The Tibetan sheep is an indigenous animal of the Tibetan plateau, and after a long period of adaptation have adapted to high-altitude hypoxia. Many physiological changes occur in Tibetan sheep as they adapt to high-altitude hypoxia, especially in the lungs. To reveal the physiological changes and their molecular mechanisms in the lungs of Tibetan sheep during adaptation to high altitudes, we selected Tibetan sheep from three altitudes (2500 m, 3500 m, and 4500 m) and measured blood-gas indicators, observed lung structures, and compared lung proteome changes. The results showed that the Tibetan sheep increased their O-2-carrying capacity by increasing the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and Hematocrit (Hct) at an altitude of 3500 m. While at altitude of 4500 m, Tibetan sheep decreased their Hb concentration and Hct to avoid pulmonary hypertension and increased the efficiency of air-blood exchange and O-2 transfer by increasing the surface area of gas exchange and half-saturation oxygen partial pressure. Besides these, some important proteins and pathways related to gas transport, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis identified by proteome sequencing further support these physiology findings, including HBB, PRDX2, GPX1, GSTA1, COL14A1, and LTBP4, etc. In conclusion, the lungs of Tibetan sheep are adapted to different altitudes by different strategies; these findings are valuable for understanding the basis of hypoxic adaptation in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Background and Aims Invasive species usually demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse environments, successfully inhabiting a wide variety of regions. This adaptability often links to genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity, leading to latitudinal trends in phenotypic traits. In this study, we collected seeds of the invasive plant Phytolacca americana from different latitudes and planted them in homogeneous gardens to investigate the latitudinal variation of P. americana phenotypic traits and to evaluate the effects of herbivory and heavy metals on plant growth, defence and reproductive characteristics.Methods Phytolacca americana seeds from different latitudes were planted in a homogeneous garden. For the experimental treatment, the seeds were divided into four groups: a heavy metal treatment group and its corresponding control group, and a cover treatment group with its corresponding control group. After the fruits matured, their growth, reproduction and defence indicators were measured.Key Results Significant latitudinal trends were observed in P. americana's growth and defence characteristics, including changes in branch number, underground biomass, total biomass and leaf tannin content. Compared with previous field surveys on P. americana, our study found that the latitude trends in growth structure and defence traits were consistent, but the latitudinal trend of reproductive structure was different. Moreover, heavy metals and herbivory substantially influenced the plant's growth, reproduction and defence mechanisms, further shaping its latitudinal patterns.Conclusions The observed phenotypic variations in P. americana across latitudes can be largely attributed to the synergistic effects of phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation. At a broader geographical scale, adaptations to heavy metal stress and herbivory pressure among different P. americana populations involve distinct trade-offs related to growth, reproduction and defence strategies.

AB  - Leaching and screenhouse experiments were conducted to study the effect of co-application of biochar and fertilizer on soil nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfate (SO42-) leaching, kinetics, and maize dry matter weight (DMW). Treatments consisted of biochar (0, bone char (BC), and wood char (WC) at 10 t ha(-1)) and fertilizer (0, poultry manure (PM), cattle manure (CM), goat and sheep manure (GSM), and NPK (20-10-10) at 120 kg N ha(-1)). Soil column and pot experiments were arranged in a completely randomized design. Results showed that BC reduced the amount of NH4+, NO3-, PO43- and SO42- leached in NPK amended soils by 27.9, 35.5, 25.2 and 25.9%, respectively. Soil treated with manure had significantly higher cumulative release of NO3-, PO43-, and SO42- than BC+manure by 20.4, 10.8, and 17.7%, respectively, and WC+manure by 26.3, 13.6, and 15.8%, respectively. The co-application of BC+manure had higher DMW, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) uptake in maize plant than WC+manure by 27.6, 50.7, 45.1, and 38.5%, respectively. The first-order kinetic had a better fit of NO3-, PO43-, and SO42- mineralization than the second-order. The initial NO3-, PO43-, and SO42- release constants were positive for all amendments, with the highest value in PM treated soil, and the lowest values in the lower potential mineralizable biochars. A highly significant (p <=.01) linear relationship (R-2 > 0.90) exhibited between the studied nutrients. The study concluded that biochar application reduces nutrient leaching and decreases mineralizable N, P, and S in manure.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Tolerance to heat stress (HS) is an important economic trait in goats to maintain dairy farm profitability. We studied the effect of a climatological index of temperature and relative humidity (THI) on test day record (TD) of fat and protein yield (fpy) in the three main Spanish dairy goat breeds (Florida, 126.825 TD, Malaguena, 141.856 TD and Murciano Granadina, 62.834 TD), analysing the nature of the fpy response throughout the THI on the weeks of lactation (DIM) trajectories. The results showed the existence of a double genotype environment interaction between DIM and THI and a depression in the fpy level in animals kept in the hot zone (THI > 25) compared with those in the cold zone (THI <= 16). This negative impact is equivalent to 13 to 30 days in production. We propose an alternative to select animals by using a principal analysis of the estimated breeding value for each goat breed across DIM and THI scales. The results of this study show that this procedure is a powerful tool to select the most productive and heat-tolerant animals, thus contributing to the increased profitability of autochthonous Spanish goat breeds.
   We studied the effect of the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) (i.e., the average of temperature and relative humidity registered at meteorological stations) closest to the farms taken during the test day (TD), for total daily protein and fat yields (fpy) of the three main Spanish dairy goats. The data were from Florida (11,244 animals and 126,825 TD), Malaguena (12,215 animals and 141,856 TD) and Murciano Granadina (5162 animals and 62,834 TD) breeding programs and were studied by different linear models to estimate the nature of the fpy response throughout the THI and the weeks of lactation (Days in Milk, DIM) trajectories. The results showed an antagonism between THI and DIM, with a marked depression in the fpy level in animals kept in the hot zone of the THI values (THI > 25) compared with those in the cold zone (THI <= 16), with a negative impact equivalent to production of 13 to 30 days. We used a Reaction Norm model (RN), including THI and DIM as fixed covariates and a Test Day Model (TDM), to estimate the genetic (co)variance components. The heritability and genetic correlations estimated with RN and TDM showed a decreased pattern along the scale of THI and DIM, with slight differences between breeds, meaning that there was significant genetic variability in the animal's ability to react to different levels of THI, which is not constant throughout the DIM, showing the existence of genotype-environment interaction. The breeding values (BV) of all animals for each level of THI and DIM were subject to a principal component analysis, and the results showed that 89 to 98% of the variance between the BV was explained by the two first eigenvalues. The standardized BV were weighted with the corresponding eigenvector coefficients to construct an index that showed, in a single indicator, the most complete expression of the existing genetic variability in the animals' ability to produce fpy along the trajectories of THI and DIM. This new option will make it easier to select animals which are more productive, and with better adaptability to heat stress, as well as enabling us to exploit genetic variations in the form of the response to heat stress to be adapted to different production systems.

AB  - In South Africa, the agricultural sector is a crucial pillar of the economy, with the livestock and grain industries playing significant roles in ensuring food security, fostering economic growth, and providing employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas. This research addresses the relatively unexplored relationship between the livestock and grain industries in South Africa. This study employs a comprehensive approach using a VAR/VECM framework alongside VECM Granger causality tests, Toda Yamamoto causality tests, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition analysis. The main findings of this study demonstrate a long-run relationship among the study variables, with consistently low error correction terms indicating slow short-term adjustments. Significant long-run relationships were observed between grain feed prices and livestock prices, where yellow maize and soybean prices affect live weaner prices, while beef carcass prices influence yellow maize prices. Overall, the results highlight the pivotal role that yellow maize plays as a link between the South African livestock and grain markets. The study concluded that policy formulation for the South African agricultural sector must consider the interconnected nature of the grain and livestock markets to achieve sustainable and effective outcomes.

AB  - Tea waste (TW) has a protein content of approximately 30% and the potential to replace other protein sources. However, the effect of dietary TW supplement is still ambiguous. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of three levels of a dietary TW supplement on the performances and physiological changes in goats. Nine multiparous crossbred Saanen lactating goats were arranged in three replicates of a 3 x 3 Latin square. The three groups of goats were fed with 0, 5, or 10 by weight [wt%] dry matter [DM] basis TW, respectively, for a 21-day period. All diets were a total mixed ration (TMR) containing a 40:60 (DM basis) ratio of concentrate: roughage. The goats were weighed at 15 and 21 days. Faeces and urine were collected during the last 7 days of each period. The TW addition had no effect on the DM intake (DMI), DMI% and body weight. The milk protein content in goats on a 10 wt% TW diet was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of goats on the other diets. The milk lactose of both TW diets significantly decreased when compared to the control diet (p < 0.01). Goats with 5 and 10 wt% TW tended to decrease digestibility of crude protein (p = 0.10). There were no changes in the DM digestibility, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, triglyceride, total protein, ruminal pH, ammonia-nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid (A), propionic acid (P), A:P ratio, nitrogen balance, allantoin excretion and methane emission among treatments. Diets with 5 or 10 wt% TW (DM basis) could be used to replace other plant protein sources.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural areas to waterbodies is a worldwide concern. However, the effect of soil source and transport factors, such as clay (C) content and slope (S), on the magnitude of the P transport in Brazilian subtropical soils is still understudied. The objectives of this study were i) to quantify the loss of P fractions by runoff in areas receiving pig slurry application and with variations in S and C content; ii) propose an environmental critical limit model of P (P-threshold) for Brazilian subtropical soils. Thus, two series of experiments were conducted from2016 to 2018, one under a Nitisol with 642 g kg(-1) of C and another under a Cambisol with 225 g kg(-1) of C. The treatments were four P rates (0, 56, 112 and 224 kg P ha(-1) year(-1)) superficially applied as pig slurry, on Tifton (Cynodon sp) pasture, and three S (10, 20 and 30% in the Nitisol and 15, 25 and 35% in Cambisol). P losses increased in both soils as the S and P rates rose. The Nitisol showed P losses three times higher than the Cambisol. Soil S above 25% promotes P losses at a rate three times higher than in soil below this limit. Therefore, we propose a P-threshold model for Mehlich-1 extractable P levels for Brazilian subtropical soils as: "P-threshold = (42.287 + C) - (0.230 S + 0.0123 C S)" in soils with a S <= 25% and "P-threshold = (42.287 + C) - (-0.437 S + 0.039 C S)" in soils with a S >25%, where both C and S are shown in percentage. The soil clay content and slope are aggravating factors to the P transfer process, thusmust be considered in suitable models to predict the P losses risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hu sheep is a renowned prolific local sheep breed in China, widely distributed across the country due to its excellent reproductive performance. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the high fecundity of Hu sheep is crucial for improving the litter size of ewes. In this study, we genotyped 830 female Hu sheep using the Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip and performed genetic diversity analysis, selection signature detection, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for litter size. Our results revealed that the Hu sheep population exhibits relatively high genetic diversity. A total of 4927 runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments were detected, with the majority (74.73%) being short in length. Different genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH, FHOM, FGRM, and FUNI) ranged from -0.0060 to 0.0126, showing low levels of inbreeding in this population. Additionally, we identified 91 candidate genomic regions through three complementary selection signature methods, including ROH, composite likelihood ratio (CLR), and integrated haplotype score (iHS), and annotated 189 protein-coding genes. Moreover, we observed two significant SNPs related to the litter size of Hu sheep using GWAS analysis based on a repeatability model. Integrating the selection signatures and the GWAS results, we identified 15 candidate genes associated with litter size, among which BMPR1B and UNC5C were particularly noteworthy. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the reproductive performance and breeding of high-fecundity lines of Hu sheep.

AB  - To investigate the effects of tea polyphenols (TPs) on the growth and carbohydrate metabolism of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), 0 (control group), 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg kg(-1) TPs were added to the basal diet and fed to grass carps for 8 weeks. The results show that 500 mg kg(-1) group exhibited the significantly highest feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and specific growth rate (SGR) (p < .05) and significantly higher activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (p < .05). The livers of the control group and 500 mg kg(-1) group were subjected to RNA-Seq, and the expressions of glycogen phosphorylase (PYG) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) genes were upregulated, while that of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) was downregulated, and these promoted glycogen catabolism. The expressions of glucokinase (GK), PK, 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) genes were upregulated to promote glucose catabolism. The results indicate that 500 mg kg(-1) TPs could upregulate the expressions of some genes that promote carbohydrate decomposition, increase the activities of carbohydrate decomposition enzymes and enhance the utilization of carbohydrates, thereby improving the FCE and SGR.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study focused on improving the growth rates of Inner Mongolian cashmere goats (IMCGs) by identifying the most effective genomic selection methods for early growth traits. Faster growth rates are important for farmers because they can lead to increased meat production, ultimately enhancing the economic value of these goats. We analyzed data from 2256 cashmere goats, looking at traits such as birth weight, weaning weight, daily weight gain, and yearling weight. By using advanced statistical models, we aimed to determine which method would provide the most accurate predictions for breeding values based on genetic information. Our research found that specific factors like birth year, herd, sex, birth type, and the age of dams play important roles in growth traits. Among the models we tested, the one that included additive genetic effects from both the individual and its mother, as well as environmental effects, was best. Notably, the method known as ssGBLUP offered the highest accuracy in predicting breeding values, making it the preferred choice for breeding programs aimed at enhancing growth rates in IMCGs. In conclusion, we recommend using the ssGBLUP method for improving breeding efficiency in the growth traits of IMCGs. This study aimed to identify the best model and method for the genomic selection of early growth traits in Inner Mongolian cashmere goats (IMCGs). Using data from 50,728 SNPs, the phenotypes (birth weight, BW; weaning weight, WW; daily weight gain, DWG; and yearling weight, YW) of 2256 individuals, and pedigree information from 14,165 individuals, fixed effects were analyzed using a generalized linear model. Four single-trait animal models with varying combinations of individual and maternal effects were evaluated using the ABLUP, GBLUP, and ssGBLUP methods. The best model was selected based on a likelihood ratio test. Five-fold cross-validation was used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Birth year and herd significantly affected BW (p < 0.05) and WW, DWG, and YW (p < 0.01), while sex, birth type, and dam age had highly significant effects on all traits (p < 0.01). Model 4, incorporating direct and maternal additive genetic effects, maternal environmental effects, and their covariance, was optimal. Additionally, ssGBLUP achieved the highest GEBV accuracy (0.61-0.70), outperforming the GBLUP and ABLUP methods. Thus, ssGBLUP is recommended for enhancing the genetic progress in IMCGs. Under the best method, the heritability estimates for BW, WW, DGW, and YW were 0.11, 0.25, 0.15, and 0.23, respectively.

AB  - Dairy goat's lactation persistence forces farmers at limiting nutrient supply to reduce yield at dry-off. Omitting dry period could be a solution, but metabolic effects of this practice have never been tested. Eight Alpine (AL) and 12 Saanen (SA) goats approaching their second kidding blocked by breed and number of kids carried (single - SIN - or double - DOU) were allocated to one out of two groups (4 AL and 6 SA; 5 SIN and 5 DOU in each group). At -42 +/- 7 days from kidding (DFK), they were either dried off (DR) or milked continuously until kidding (CL). Body condition score (BCS) was assessed, and blood samples were collected at -10, -3, 5, 12, and 29 DFK to determine metabolic profile. Milk yield and composition were assessed at -56, 7, 31, 62, and 97 DFK. Compared with DR, CL had higher plasma reactive oxygen metabolites and liver enzymes. Compared with DR counterparts, AL-CL had higher nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) at -10, whereas SA-CL had lower NEFA at -3 DFK. CL goats had lower BCS, higher plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and urea before kidding, but higher glucose at -3 and 5, lower NEFA at 5 and 12, and higher BCS at 29 DFK. CL goats had lower haptoglobin and myeloperoxidase at -3 and 5 DFK, paired with higher albumin, cholesterol, and paraoxonase at 12 DFK. Omitting dry period mitigated the inflammatory condition around kidding in dairy goats, possibly accounting for an improved energy balance in early lactation, despite body reserve mobilisation prepartum was greater under continuous lactation.
   Omitting dry period accrued prepartum energy deficit in dairy goats but improved their postpartum energy balance.Omitting dry period mitigated acute phase response and inflammation in dairy goats during the late gestation and early lactation phases.Omitting dry period in high-yielding goats could allow for a smoother transition to the new lactation coping with the limitations hindering the dry-off procedures.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a toxic organophosphorus insecticide, is widely used in agriculture to protect crops (eg., maize) from pests. The use of CPF in crops can result in accumulation in crop seeds, such as corn seeds, which is a primary feed ingredient in pigs. Pigs in China, which is an important source of animal-derived protein in the Chinese diet, account for over 50 % of the raised pig population in the whole world. Therefore, CPF may pose a potential risk to the health of non-target organisms (pigs and humans) through the food chain. However, whether CPF can damage porcine intestine remains unknown. Selenium (Se), an essential trace element, was reported to have antioxidant and anti-toxic effects. Tight junction (TJ) is an important mechanism of intestinal injury and pyroptosis is a new hotspot in the field of toxicology. Hence, we wanted to investigate whether CPF can damage pig intestine and whether selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) supplement can alleviate CPF-induced pig intestine damage, and to study corresponding mechanism from the three aspects of OS, pytoptosis, and TJ. We established a model of SeNPs alleviating damage caused by CPF in intestinal porcine enterocytes (IPEC-J2 cells), and found that SeNPs alleviated CPF-induced oxidative stress (OS), pyroptosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction in IPEC-J2 cells. Interestingly, OS, pyroptosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction had serial relations, and ROS/Nrf2/ Caspase-1/Occludin and ROS/Nrf2/Caspase-1/ZO-1 pathways played a role. Notably, ROS and Caspase-1 played an initial and important role, respectively. Our study added new information on pesticides-caused damage to non-target organisms, and provided new idea, insight, and targets to mitigatie pesticides-induced toxic effect on non-target organisms.

AB  - Gap junctional connection (GJC) in the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) provides necessary support for message communication and nutrient transmission required for mammalian oocyte maturation. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is not only a prerequisite for regulating oocyte meiosis, but also the key intercellular factor for affecting GJC function in COCs. However, there are no reports on whether cAMP regulates connexin 37 (Cx37) expression, one of the main connexin proteins, in sheep COCs. In this study, the expression of Cx37 protein and gene in immature sheep COC was detected using immunohistochemistry and PCR. Subsequently, the effect of cAMP on Cx37 expression in sheep COCs cultured in a gonadotropin-free culture system for 10 min or 60 min was evaluated using competitive ELISA, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blot. The results showed that the Cx37 protein was present in sheep oocytes and cumulus cells; the same results were found with respect to GJA4 gene expression. In the gonadotropin-free culture system, compared to the control, significantly higher levels of cAMP as well as Cx37 gene and protein expression were found in sheep COCs following treatment in vitro with Forskolin and IBMX (100 mu M and 500 mu M)) for 10 min (p < 0.05). Compared to the controls (at 10 or 60 min), cAMP levels in sheep COCs were significantly elevated as a result of Forskolin and IBMX treatment (p < 0.05). Following culturing in vitro for 10 min or 60 min, Forskolin and IBMX treatment can significantly promote Cx37 expression in sheep COCs (p < 0.05), a phenomenon which can be counteracted when the culture media is supplemented with RP-cAMP, a cAMP-specific competitive inhibitor operating through suppression of the protein kinase A (PKA). In summary, this study reports the preliminary regulatory mechanism of cAMP involved in Cx37 expression for the first time, and provides a novel explanation for the interaction between cAMP and GJC communication during sheep COC culturing in vitro.

AB  - Spawning of invasive smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) was studied in 2020 and 2021, in Lake Nojiri, Nagano, Japan. Male smallmouth bass began nest construction once water temperatures reached 14 degrees C, and eggs progressed to fry dispersal in approximately 2 weeks. The main spawning season was in late May through early June, with a smaller second peak of nests in late June through early July. Nests were constructed primarily under dock cover, and nest size and depth were positively correlated with male body size. Of the nests that received eggs, nearly all progressed successfully to fry dispersal. Time lapse videos of male guarding behavior revealed that as nests progressed, males rotated less and were suspended off the bottom substrate. Similarly, the presence of egg predators was determined by experimental removal of guarding males. Freshwater gobies (Rhinogobius kurodai) were the only egg predators observed and arrived on all nests in the egg stage. However, only a handful of gobies visited each nest, the total number of eggs predated was low, and eggs or alevins in the progressed stage were rarely predated. These results indicate that in Lake Nojiri, smallmouth bass spawning is highly successful and egg predators appear to have minimal effect on egg survival. The stable smallmouth bass fishery without stocking at this lake is likely a product of these favorable spawning conditions. The lack of native egg predators may also be a driving factor in the continued spread of smallmouth bass throughout Japan.

AB  - Fungi living within a plant (i.e., endophytic fungi) can directly affect the growth of the host plant or have indirect effects by affecting levels of damage to the plant caused by insect herbivory or plant pathogens. Greenhouse and field trials were conducted to investigate the endophytic effects of the fungus Beauveria bassiana on wheat, on the wheat-feeding Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), and on the wheat pathogen, Fusarium culmorum (Nectriaceae), which causes root and crown rot disease. Conidia of B. bassiana were applied to wheat either by foliar spray, soil drench, or seed treatment. Seed treatment with conidia provided the highest re-isolation percentages: 91.7% in leaves, 95.8% in stems, and 91.7% in roots. Inoculated plants were taller and had greater wet and dry weights compared to control plants. In both greenhouse and field studies, E. integriceps that were fed inoculated plants laid eggs that were less likely to hatch. Inoculations reduced the incidence of root and crown rot disease by 42% under greenhouse conditions. These results document the potential of using endophytic infections of B. bassiana in wheat as a control measure for Sunn pest and root and crown rot disease.

AB  - Plastic waste, particularly from packaging materials, has become a significant environmental concern due to its slow degradation and widespread use. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), commonly used in plastic bags and packaging, is resistant to biodegradation due to its hydrophobic backbone and high thermal stability. This study aimed to investigate the potential of plastic-degrading bacteria isolated from the microbiome of Swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) to degrade LDPE plastic. Twelve bacterial isolates were screened for plastic-degrading capabilities using Pseudomonas-Centimide agar, and identified via 16S rDNA sequencing. Four strains, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC13620 (accession no. MK332579.1), Khon Kaen University (KKU)-LDPE4, KKU-LDPE5, KKU-LDPE8, and KKU-LDPE9, exhibited high cellulolytic activity based on cellulose and starch hydrolysis. The biodegradation and biofilm formation potential of these strains were evaluated in in vitro gas fermentation experiments conducted over 10, 20, and 30-day incubation periods. Results showed that P. aeruginosa KKU-LDPE4 significantly enhanced microbial population growth, from log 6.6-7.9 CFU/mL, and increased the pH from 6.60 to 6.62 by the end of the 30-day incubation. Additionally, carbon dioxide production increased significantly (p < 0.05), along with a weight loss of 2.66 % in the LDPE fragments, while methane production remained negligible. These findings suggest that P. aeruginosa KKU-LDPE4 holds promise as an effective microbial candidate for LDPE plastic biodegradation. The study highlights the potential of using bacterial strains for eco-friendly solutions to plastic waste degradation.

AB  - 1. Behavioural variation at the individual level has been shown to play an important role in animal ecology and evolution. Whereas most studies have focused on subadult or adult subjects, neonates have been relatively neglected, despite studies showing that neonates can exhibit consistent inter-individual differences during early developmental stages.
   2. Steroid hormones, including glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) and androgens (e.g. testosterone), play a crucial role in foetal development and maturation and could therefore drive neonate behaviour, although this relationship is poorly understood in wild animal populations.
   3. Our study addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the association between neonate fallow deer Dama dama fawn inter-individual variability in behavioural response to human handling and hair cortisol and testosterone levels.
   4. We found strong evidence that individual neonates display repeatable differences in the way they cope with a risky situation during their first days of life, and showed how these differences are linked to cortisol and testosterone levels accumulated in utero. We showed that, when both steroids are included in the same model, neonates with high cortisol and low testosterone levels coped in a more proactive way with human handling (higher heart rate during handling and shorter latency to leave when released) compared to those with low cortisol and high testosterone levels (lower heart rate and longer latency to leave). These results provide novel insights into the proximate mechanism leading to neonate inter-individual variation in a wild population of large mammals.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with Artemisia ordosica crude polysaccharide (AOCP) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant and immunity capacity, rumen fermentation parameters, and the microbiota of cashmere goats. A total of 12 cashmere goats (2 years old) with similar weight (38.03 +/- 2.42 kg of BW +/- SD) were randomly divided into two dietary treatments with six replicates. The treatments were as follows: (1) control (CON, basal diet); and (2) AOCP treatment (AOCP, basal diet with 0.3% AOCP). Pre-feeding was conducted for 7 days, followed by an experimental period of 21 days. The results showed that the ADG; feed/gain (F/G); and the digestibility of DM, CP, and ADF of cashmere goats in the AOCP group were greater than in the CON group (p < 0.05). Still, there was no significant effect on the digestibility of EE, NDF, Ca, and P (p > 0.05). Compared to the CON group, AOCP increased BCP, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, and TVFA concentrations (p < 0.05), but it reduced the protozoa numbers of acetate and A/P (p < 0.05). The serum CAT, GSH-Px, T-SOD, 1L-6, and NO levels were higher in AOCP than in the CON group (p < 0.05). The addition of AOCP increased the Sobs and Ace estimators (p < 0.05) and reduced the Simpson estimator in the ruminal fluid compared to the CON group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the AOCP group increased the colonization of beneficial bacteria by positively influencing GSH-Px and IL-6 (norank_f__F082, unclassified_p__Firmicutes), as well as bacteria negatively associated with F/G (norank_f__norank_o__Bacteroidales, unclassified_p__Firmicutes, and norank_f__F082). It decreased the colonization of potential pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas and Escherichia-Shigella) (p < 0.05) compared to the CON group. In conclusion, 0.3% AOCP improves the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant status, immune function, rumen fermentation, and microflora of cashmere goats.

AB  - The presence of wild hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) in Colombia due to the establishment of Pablo Escobar's private zoo in the 1980s has led to tourism activities centered on this non-native megafauna. Here, I argue that promoting hippo-based tourism in Colombia is ecologically detrimental, potentially dangerous, and, ultimately, unsustainable. Furthermore, I contend that the economic benefits of such tourism go to a few inexperienced operators and provide minimal economic spillover to local communities. The article proposes alternative strategies, including the creation of a museum dedicated to educating the public about the relationship between drug trafficking, illegal wildlife trade, and invasive species to mitigate the perceived economic loss from discontinuing hippo tourism. I conclude that this type of tourism may seem economically attractive in the short term but its risks and challenges far outweigh any potential benefits, calling for a more responsible, science-based approach to managing this unique conservation challenge.

AB  - In this study, we cryopreserved pig spermatozoa using carboxylated poly-L-lysine (CPLL) as the cryoprotectant to determine its efficacy. Pig spermatozoa were placed in a freezing extender containing 3% (v/v) glycerol and different CPLL concentrations. The motility indices of the spermatozoa cryopreserved with 0.25% (v/v) CPLL at 6 (59.3), 9 (53.7), and 12 (26.2) h after thawing were significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than those of the spermatozoa cryopreserved without CPLL (53.7, 40.1, and 17.5 at 6, 9, and 12 h after thawing, respectively). The concentration of CPLL in the freezing extender did not affect the ability of frozen-thawed spermatozoa to fertilize oocytes in vitro. However, the blastocyst formation rate of embryos derived from spermatozoa cryopreserved with 0.25% CPLL (24.6%) was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of embryos derived from spermatozoa cryopreserved without CPLL (11.2%). The conception rate of the sows inseminated with spermatozoa cryopreserved with 0.25% CPLL (72.2%) was not significantly different from that of the sows inseminated with spermatozoa stored at 17 & DEG;C (81.3%). However, the mean number of total piglets born to the former (10.0) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of total piglets born to the latter (13.4). The results showed that CPLL in the freezing extender maintained the motility of frozen-thawed pig spermatozoa and improved the in vitro development of embryos produced by in vitro fertilization. In addition, we have demonstrated that piglets could be obtained with artificial insemination using spermatozoa cryopreserved with CPLL.

AB  - The horse chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, Deschka and Dimic, is a moth that has invaded most of Europe since it was first recorded in Macedonia near Lake Ohrid in 1985. It attacks horse chestnut trees and causes aesthetic and vitality problems. The parasitism rate, other mortality rates, and parasitoid structure were studied during a five-year survey at six sites in the Czech Republic. The results showed that the total parasitism rates varied from 1.9% to 20.5%, with an average of 7.2%, similar to other those published studies. The parasitism rate was significantly related to year, the developmental stage of C. ohridella, latitude, and greenery maintenance but not to C. ohridella population density, altitude, or area size. In contrast, the total other mortality rates varied from 13.7% to 59.5%, with an average of 31%, but overall temporal changes in the values indicated a declining trend. The parasitoid complex was predominantly polyphagous parasitoids of the family Eulophidae, similar to that found previously in south-eastern Europe. The results further revealed that the most abundant parasitoid species, Minotetrastichus frontalis (Nees), was gradually replaced by Pediobius saulius (Walker). The increasing abundance of P. saulius is thus an interesting adaptation of an autochthonous parasitoid to a new host.

AB  - Simple Summary High heat load (HL) can adversely affect livestock health and cause significant production losses as a result of alterations of many physiological functions including nutrient metabolism, oxidative status, blood constituent levels, and gut dysbiosis. Effects of high HL could vary with breed of hair sheep (i.e., Dorper, Katahdin, and St. Croix) as well as region of the United States of America with different climatic conditions where they originated. Differences among the three sheep breeds in levels of a number of blood constituents were observed. Different HL conditions also altered concentrations of several blood metabolites and constituents, including hemoglobin, oxygen concentration, creatinine, heat shock protein, thyroxine, and cortisol. However, there were no interactions between breed and HL for most blood variables, suggesting similar resilience to high HL. In addition, only a few differences among or interactions involving region suggest that the breeds are highly adapted to diverse climatic conditions. Forty-six Dorper (DOR), 46 Katahdin (KAT), and 43 St. Croix (STC) female sheep (initial body weight of 58, 59, and 46 kg, respectively, SEM = 1.75; 3.3 +/- 0.18 years of age, 2.6-3.7), derived from 45 commercial farms in four regions of the USA (Midwest, Northwest, Southeast, and central Texas), were used to evaluate responses in blood constituent concentrations to increasing heat load index (HLI) conditions. There were four sequential 2 weeks periods with target HLI during day/nighttime of 70/70 (thermoneutral zone conditions), 85/70, 90/77, and 95/81 in period 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. A 50% concentrate pelletized diet was fed at 53.3 g dry matter/kg body weight(0.75). The analysis of most constituents was for samples collected on the last day of the second week of each period at 13:00 h; samples for cortisol, thyroxine, and heat shock protein were collected in week 2 and 8. Previously, it was noted that resilience to high HLI conditions was greatest for STC, lowest for DOR, and intermediate for KAT. There were few effects of region. Other than hemoglobin concentration, there were no interactions between breed and period. Blood oxygen concentration was greatest (p < 0.05) among breeds for STC (5.07, 5.20, and 5.53 mmol/L for DOR, KAT, and STC, respectively; SEM = 0.114) and differed among periods (4.92, 5.26, 5.36, and 5.52 mmol/L for period 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; SEM = 0.093). There were breed differences (i.e., main effects; p < 0.05) in glucose (50.0, 52.6, and 52.1 mg/dL; SEM = 0.76), urea nitrogen (17.2, 17.3, and 19.4 mg/dL; SEM = 0.33), creatinine (0.991, 0.862, and 0.802 mg/dL; SEM = 0.0151), total protein (6.50, 6.68, and 6.95 g/l; SEM = 0.017), triglycerides (28.4, 29.1, and 23.5 mg/dL; SEM = 0.87), and cortisol (6.30, 8.79, and 6.22 ng/mL for DOR, KAT, and STC, respectively; SEM = 0.596). Differences among periods (p < 0.05) were observed for lactate (27.9, 25.3, 27.8, and 24.0 mg/dL; SEM = 0.99), creatinine (0.839, 0.913, 0.871, and 0.917 mg/dL; SEM = 0.0128), total protein (6.94, 6.66, 6.60, and 6.65 g/l; SEM = 0.094), and cholesterol (60.2, 56.5, 58.3, and 57.6 mg/dL for period 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; SEM = 1.26). In addition, the concentration of cortisol (7.62 and 6.59 ng/mL; SEM = 0.404), thyroxine (5.83 and 5.00 mu g/dL; SEM = 0.140), and heat shock protein (136 and 146 ng/mL for week 2 and 8, respectively; SEM = 4.0) differed between weeks (p < 0.05).
   In conclusion, the lack of interaction between breed and period with different HLI conditions suggests that levels of these blood constituents were not highly related to resilience to high HLI.

AB  - Animals living at high altitudes are challenged by the extreme environmental conditions of cold temperature and hypobaric hypoxia. It is not well understood how high-altitude birds enhance the capacity of metabolic thermogenesis and allocate metabolic capacity in different organs to maximize survival in extreme conditions of a cold winter. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the largest and highest plateau globally, offering a natural laboratory for investigating coping mechanisms of organisms inhabiting extreme environments. To understand the adaptive strategies in the morphology and physiology of small songbirds on the QTP, we compared plasma triiodothyronine (T-3), pectoralis muscle mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and state IV capacities, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator alpha (PGC-1 alpha), adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), uncoupling protein (UCP), and adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) alpha 1 mRNA in the pectoralis and liver of Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) from high-altitude (3,230 m), medium-altitude (1400 m), and low-altitude (80 m) regions. Our results showed that high-altitude sparrows had greater body masses, longer wings and tarsometatarsi, but comparable bill lengths relative to medium- and low- altitude individuals. High-altitude sparrows had higher plasma T-3 levels and pectoralis muscle mitochondrial COX capacities than their lowland counterparts. They also upregulated the pectoralis muscle mRNA expression of UCP, PGC-1 alpha, and ANT proteins relative to low-altitude sparrows. Unlike pectoralis, high-altitude sparrows significantly down-regulated hepatic AMPK alpha 1 and ANT protein expression as compared with their lowland counterparts. Our results contribute to understanding the morphological, biochemical, and molecular adaptations in free-living birds to cope with the cold seasons in the extreme environment of the QTP.

AB  - Seasonal mammals register photoperiodic changes through the photoneuroendocrine system enabling them to time seasonal changes in growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To a varying extent, proximate environmental factors like ambient temperature (T-a) modulate timing of seasonal changes in physiology, conferring adaptive flexibility. While the molecular photoneuroendocrine pathway governing the seasonal responses is well defined, the mechanistic integration of nonphotoperiodic modulatory cues is poorly understood. Here, we explored the interaction between T-a and photoperiod in tundra voles, Microtus oeconomus, a boreal species in which the main impact of photoperiod is on postnatal somatic growth. We demonstrate that postweaning growth potential depends on both gestational and postweaning patterns of photoperiodic exposure, with the highest growth potential seen in voles experiencing short (8 h) gestational and long (16 h) postweaning photoperiods-corresponding to a spring growth program. Modulation by T-a was asymmetric: low T-a (10 & DEG;C) enhanced the growth potential of voles gestated on short photoperiods independent of postweaning photoperiod exposure, whereas in voles gestated on long photoperiods, showing a lower autumn-programmed growth potential, the effect of T-a was highly dependent on postweaning photoperiod. Analysis of the primary molecular elements involved in the expression of a neuroendocrine response to photoperiod, thyrotropin beta subunit (tsh & beta;) in the pars tuberalis, somatostatin (srif) in the arcuate nucleus, and type 2/3 deiodinase (dio2/dio3) in the mediobasal hypothalamus identified dio2 as the most T-a-sensitive gene across the study, showing increased expression at higher T-a, while higher T-a reduced somatostatin expression. Contrastingly dio3 and tsh & beta; were largely insensitive to T-a. Overall, these observations reveal a complex interplay between T-a and photoperiodic control of postnatal growth in M. oeconomus, and suggest that integration of T-a into the control of growth occurs downstream of the primary photoperiodic response cascade revealing potential adaptivity of small herbivores facing rising temperatures at high latitudes.

AB  - BACKGROUND Global climate change will result in increasingly arid weather that will have a significant impact on agriculture. The occurrence dynamics of plants, phytophagous insects and their natural enemies under drought conditions have attracted much attention. The consequences could be useful for controlling insect herbivores. Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) is one of the most important pests of potato, and causes serious damage to potato production. Arma chinensis (Fallou) is a parasitoid of L. decemlineata. However, how drought will affect tritrophic interactions between potato and these insects remains unknown. RESULTS In this experiment, L. decemlineata and A. chinensis were released onto potato plants under water stress. Thereafter, plant height, stem diameter and yield of potato, growth and reproduction of L. decemlineata, and the longevity of A. chinensis adults were periodically recorded. The results showed that drought had crucial effects on height, stem diameter and yield of potato (p < 0.05); it also had a significant impact on pre-oviposition period, oviposition days, fecundity and life table parameters in L. decemlineata (p < 0.05). Moreover, drought significantly reduced the longevity (p < 0.05) and survival rate of A. chinensis adults. The longevity of adult A. chinensis was only 29.00 +/- 3.00 days and the harvest rate of L. decemlineata adults was only 1.42% +/- 0.07% under drought treatment. CONCLUSION In this experiment, we evaluate the bottom-up effects of drought on tritrophic interactions involving potato, L. decemlineata and A. chinensis, and discuss the implications of the findings for integrated pest management programs involving the pest. Promising future research directions are proposed. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is among the most potent genotoxic and carcinogenic mycotoxins and is a major source of distress for the growing poultry sector. On the other hand, distillery yeast sludge or distillery sludge (DS) is a byproduct of molasses-based industries. It is often treated as a waste despite containing abundant nutrients particularly protein, basic amino acids, and vitamins along with other macro and micronutrients. This study was designed to investigate the oxidative stress and immunological alterations induced by AFB1 and their amelioration by dietary supplementation with DS. For this purpose, 360 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly divided into twelve groups (30 birds each) and fed different combinations of AFB1 (100, 200, or 600 mu g/kg) and DS (5 or 10 g/kg) for 42 days. The parameters under consideration were body weight, feed conversion ratio (FCR), relative organ weights, histopathological examination of different visceral organs, total antioxidant capacity, antibody response to intravenous injection of sheep red blood cells, in situ lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin-P, and phagocytic potential through a carbon clearance assay system. The results of this study established that DS supplementation ameliorated AFB1-associated oxidative stress and ameliorated toxicopathological and immunological anomalies in groups given AFB1 at 100 mu g/kg and 200 mu g/kg; however, little to no relief was observed in birds fed AFB1 at 600 mu g/kg. The determination of the actual ratio of the AFB1 to the DS for substantiating the ameliorating effects requires further investigation.

AB  - Context. In vitro embryo production in pigs is an important tool for advancing biomedical research. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) circumvents the polyspermy problems associated with conventional IVF in porcine. However, the suboptimal efficiency for ICSI in pigs requires new strategies to increase blastocyst formation rates. Aim. To investigate novel methods for assisted activation using the zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (PHEN), and to improve embryo developmental competence and quality of ICSI porcine blastocyst. Methods. ICSI embryos were treated with PHEN after or before sperm injection, recording pronuclear formation, blastocyst rate and the expression of SMARCA4, OCT4, SOX2 and CDX2. Key results. Neither electrical nor PHEN significantly improves pronuclear formation rates before or after ICSI. Following in vitro culture to the blastocyst stage, no significant differences were observed in developmental rates among the groups. Moreover, the use of PHEN did not alter the total cell number or the expression of OCT4, SOX2 and CDX2 in pig ICSI blastocysts. Conclusions. Assisted oocyte activation with PHEN does not affect the preimplantation development of ICSI-derived pig embryos. Implications. These results hold significance in refining and advancing the application of assisted oocyte activation techniques. They offer insights into addressing fertility issues and propelling advancements in human and animal reproductive medicine.

AB  - We retrospectively analysed data from heterospermic and homospermic boar semen for motility and morphology during a 2-year period. Homospermic doses were also evaluated for viability, acrosome integrity, DNA fragmentation, osmolality and pH. Additionally, we investigated the effect of temperature upon arrival and the agreement between viability and motility as evaluating tool. We observed lower (p < .05) total motility (TM) and normal sperm morphology within summer and fall. Conversely, lower (p < .05) progressive motility (PM) was found at the beginning and end of each year. Viability and acrosome integrity were reduced (p < .05) in summer months but not exclusively, suggesting that samples could be compromised by transport temperature. Sperm DNA fragmentation was <6% with a small variation. Medium osmolality and pH slightly changed (p < .05). Sperm count was not source of variation on sperm parameters. Sample temperature upon arrival correlated with PM and VSL (p < .05), while motility was reduced <12 degrees C (p < .05). Homospermic doses were less affected by season and arrival temperature, having better parameters (p < .05) than contemporaneous heterospermic samples but influenced by genetic line (p < .05). We found a high agreement between viable acrosome-intact sperm and TM, especially when TM was >= 80%. Our data verify the improvement of sperm quality during time as sperm count/dose does not affect quality, but season effect persists regardless of ejaculate selection at the stud. Homospermic doses exhibited better parameters than heterospermic doses, seemingly being more resilient to temperature variations, suggesting that selection for sperm quality within boars selected by growth traits can improve the product quality.

AB  - The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptide SQPK was selected by in silico digestion and virtual screening from goat beta-casein, and its effect and regulatory mechanism on function of endothelial cells was further evaluated. The results showed that SQPK exhibited relatively good ACE inhibition capacity (IC50 = 452.7 mu g/mL). Treatment with 25 mu g/mL SQPK for 12 h significantly elevated nitric oxide (NO) production, stimulated eNOS expression (p < 0.05) and affected the transcriptomic profiling of EA. Hy926 cells. In particular, SQPK stimulated the expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines (CXCL1/2 and IL6) but depressed encoding mesenchymal markers (FN1 and CNN3). Furthermore, SQPK modified the expression of genes involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Therefore, the selected peptide SQPK may exert potential protective effects on the function of endothelial cells by inhibiting the EndMT.

AB  - Aphids that attack canola (Brassica napus L.) exhibit feeding preferences for different parts of canola plants, which may be associated with brassica-specific glucosinolates. However, this idea remains untested. Furthermore, canola aphid species employ different strategies for tolerating glucosinolates. While the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), excretes glucosinolates, the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) sequesters them. Given the different detoxification mechanisms, we predicted that both aphid species and aphid feeding location would affect prey suitability for larvae of the predator, Hippodamia convergens (Guerin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We hypothesized that aphids, specifically glucosinolate-sequestering cabbage aphid, reared on reproductive structures that harbor higher glucosinolates concentrations would have greater negative effects on predators than those reared on vegetative structures which have lower levels of glucosinolates, and that the impact of aphid feeding location would vary depending on the prey detoxification mechanism. To test these predictions, we conducted experiments to compare 1) glucosinolates profiles between B. brassicae and M. persicae reared on reproductive and vegetative canola structures, 2) aphid population growth on each structure, and 3) their subsequent impact on fitness traits of H. convergens. Results indicate that the population growth of both aphids was greater on reproductive structures, with B. brassicae having the highest population growth. B. brassicae reared on reproductive structures had the highest concentrations of glucosinolates, and the greatest adverse effects on H. convergens. These findings suggest that both aphid-prey species and feeding location on canola could influence populations of this predator and, thus, its potential for biological control of canola aphids.

AB  - Small mammals undergo thermoregulatory adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions. Whereas small heterothermic mammals can employ torpor to save energy in the cold, homeothermic species must increase heat production to defend normothermia through the recruitment of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, we studied thermoregulatory adaptation in an obligate homeotherm, the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), captured from a subpopulation living in a mesic, temperate climate with marked seasonal differences. Basal metabolic rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) and summit metabolic rate (M-sum) increased from summer to winter, with NST and M-sum already reaching maximal rates in autumn, suggesting seasonal preparation for the cold. Typical of rodents, cold-induced metabolic rates were positively correlated with BAT mass. Analysis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and UCP1 content, however, demonstrated that thermogenic capacity declined with BAT mass. This resulted in seasonal differences in NST being driven by changes in BMR. The increase in BMR was supported by a comprehensive anatomical analysis of metabolically active organs, revealing increased mass proportions in the cold season. The thermoregulatory response of R. pumilio was associated with the maintenance of body mass throughout the year (48.3 +/- 1.4 g), contrasting large summer-winter mass reductions often observed in Holarctic rodents. Collectively. bioenergetic adaptation of this Afrotropical rodent involves seasonal organ adjustments influencing BMR, combined with a constant thermogenic capacity dictated by trade-offs in the thermogenic properties of BAT. Arguably, this high degree of plasticity was a response to unpredictable cold spells throughout the year. Consequently, the reliance on such a resource-intensive thermoregulatory strategy may expose more energetic vulnerability in changing environments of food scarcity and extreme weather conditions due to climate change, with major ramifications for survival of the species.

AB  - In recent decades, glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica have made the largest contribution to mass loss from the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet. Glacier retreat and acceleration have led to concerns about the stability of the region and the effects of future climate change. Coastal thinning and near-synchronous increases in ice flux across neighbouring glaciers suggest that ocean-driven melting is one of the main drivers of mass imbalance. However, the response of individual glaciers to changes in ocean conditions varies according to their local geometry. One of the largest and fastest-flowing of these glaciers, Pine Island Glacier (PIG), underwent a retreat from a subglacial ridge in the 1940s following a period of unusually warm conditions. Despite subsequent cooler periods, the glacier failed to recover back to the ridge and continued retreating to its present-day position. Here, we use the ice-flow model & Uacute;a to investigate the sensitivity of this retreat to changes in basal melting. We show that a short period of increased basal melt was sufficient to force the glacier from its stable position on the ridge and undergo an irreversible retreat to the next topographic high. Once high melting begins upstream of the ridge, only near-zero melt rates can stop the retreat, indicating a possible hysteresis in the system. Our results suggest that unstable and irreversible responses to warm anomalies are possible and can lead to substantial changes in ice flux over relatively short periods of only a few decades.

AB  - Layer manure (LM) and spent mushroom substrate (SMS) are two kinds of nitrogen (N) rich solid wastes generate in the poultry breeding and agriculture production. Composting is an effective way to recycle the LM and SMS. However, a large amount of N in the LM and SMS was lost via volatilisation during composting, with negative environmental and economic consequences. This study investigated the effect of incorporating biochar at the ratio of 5%, 10%, and 15% (w/w) during co-composting of LM and SMS on ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxide (N2O) volatilisation and N retention. After the 35-day composting, the results showed that the pile temperature and seed germination index in biochar treatments were significantly improved in comparison with control treatment. The nitrogen in all treatments was lost in the form of N2O (0.05 similar to 0.1%) and NH3 (13.1 similar to 20.2%). Likewise, the total nitrogen loss was 28.9%, 20.3%, and 24.9%, respectively, of which N2O-N accounts for 0.05 similar to 0.10%. Compared with control treatment, the total amount of NH3 volatilisation in biochar treatments of 5%BC, 10%BC and 15%BC was decreased by 21.2%, 33.1%, and 26.1%, respectively. The total amount of N2O emission was decreased by 39.0%, 13.2%, and 1.6%, respectively. Adding 10% and 15% biochar can significantly reduce NH3 volatilisation while adding 5% biochar treatment didn't significantly reduce NH3 emissions but showed the best performance in reducing N2O emission. The addition of 10% biochar in co-composting of LM and SMS is the recommended dosage that exhibited the best performance in improving composting quality and reducing nitrogen loss.

AB  - AI-driven precision agriculture applications can benefit from the large data source that remote sensing (RS) provides, as it can gather agricultural monitoring data at various scales throughout the year. Numerous advantages for sustainable agricultural applications, including yield prediction, crop monitoring, and climate change adaptation, can be obtained from RS and artificial intelligence. In this work, we proposed a fully automated optimized self-attention fused convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for land use and land cover classification using RS data. A new contrast enhancement equation has been proposed and utilized in the proposed architecture for the data augmentation. After that, a fused self-attention CNN architecture was proposed. The proposed architecture initially consists of two custom models named IBNR-65 and Densenet-64. Both models have been designed based on the inverted bottleneck residual mechanism and dense blocks. After that, both models were fused using a depth-wise concatenation and append a self-attention layer for deep features extraction. After that, we trained the model and performed classification using neural network (NN) classifiers. The results obtained from the NN classifiers are insufficient; therefore, we implemented a Bayesian optimization and fine-tuned the hyperparameters of NN. In addition, we proposed a quantum hippopotamus optimization algorithm for the best feature selection. The selected features are finally classified using fine-tuned NN classifiers and obtained improved accuracy of 98.20, 89.50, and 91.70%, and the highest precision rate is 98.23, recall is 98.20, and F1-score is 98.21, respectively, for SIRI-WHU, EuroSAT, and NWPU datasets. Moreover, a detailed ablation study was conducted, and the performance was compared with SOTA. The proposed architecture shows improved accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and computational time performance.

AB  - Simple Summary The bone marrow is regarded as an indicator of the health status in ungulates, because it is not only a source of fat but also it contains minerals, vitamins, and fatty acids. These substances affect the functioning of the organism, especially in unfavorable conditions such as winter. However, the relevant concentrations of fatty acids for healthy deer bone marrow are not known; their contents can be modified by various nutrition, although for ruminants there are some limitations. Unfortunately, studies on the composition of bone marrow fatty acids or their changes are scarce, especially in relation to the youngest deer. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the fatty acid composition of the bone marrow of farmed fallow deer fawns after the pasture period and the winter feeding. The results obtained in the study indicate that, notwithstanding inclement weather conditions in winter, providing the animals with appropriate housing conditions on the farm as well as their optimal feeding resulted in better condition and nutritional status of the animals, which is indicated by a more favourable composition and profile of fatty acids in bone marrow, compared to the optimal summer grazing period for ruminants. There are few studies on the composition of fatty acids and how they change the bone marrow fat of young animals depending on nutrition. Therefore, the proximate and fatty acid composition of metatarsal bone marrow from fawns of farm fallow deer after a summer of grazing and the winter feeding was compared. Due to the size and nature of the data, parametric or nonparametric tests were used. Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatographic analysis. After the winter feeding, bone marrow contained more fat (83.11% vs. 75.09%, p < 0.05) and less fat free dry matter (5.61% vs. 13.76%, p < 0.05) compared to the pasture period. Moreover, there was a significantly higher amount of saturated fatty acids (23.34% vs. 21.60%, p < 0.001), more trans fatty acids (2.99% vs. 2.34%, p < 0.005), and conjugated linoleic acid isomers (1.04% vs. 0.83%, p < 0.01), compared to post winter feeding, which in turn contained significantly more total cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (54.65% vs. 58.90%, p < 0.001). The percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (including n-3 and n-6) was not affected by feeding season. In conclusion, it was shown that young male farm fallow deer were better nourished after the winter period, during which they were kept in properly prepared rooms and fed fodder prepared by people.

AB  - Neonicotinoid seed treatment (NST) is a routine practice used worldwide to control insect pests in a variety of crops, including maize (Zea mays mays L.). However, previous work indicates that systemic insecticides can compromise plant defenses, counteracting efforts to control insect pests. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of thiamethoxam-neonicotinoid seed treatment on the resistance of two maize genotypes (B73 and MC 4050) against the major non-target pest, fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). In preference and performance assays, we evaluated the effect of NST on fall armyworm behavior and biology. We also determined the influence of NST on induced plant defenses, quantifying phytohormone levels and plant volatile emissions, in treatments with and without fall armyworm herbivory. NST did not affect caterpillar host preference, however it reduced caterpillar performance on the genotype B73 across both maize growth stages (V4 and V6). NST-treated B73 plants also had lower induced volatile production (V4 stage) compared to untreated herbivore-damage plants and lower constitutive salicylic acid (V6 stage). In contrast, MC 4050 was not affected by the insecticide, regardless of growth stage. In conclusion, we found that the effects of NST on maize defenses vary by plant genotype and growth stage, suggesting growers may need to tailor their selection of plant genotypes to avoid negative impacts of NST on plant resistance and ultimately pest control.

AB  - Exogenous fibrolytic enzymes can improve nutrient digestibility of feeds high in fibrous content offered to Egyptian lactating buffaloes. The proposed cellulase exclusively produced in-farm using Penicillium Chrysogenum showed higher activity in previous in vitro studies. That is why it was chosen to get tested against a well-known commercial source of cellulase enzyme from the Egyptian markets for its efficiency in increasing milk productivity and composition. Profiles of amino acids and fatty acids were also recorded. The initial results highlighted a superiority of the produced enzyme (FENZ) against the commercial source (CENZ). It was also clear that FENZ can preserve higher proportions of fatty acids in the milk, primarily conjugated linoleic acid. Based on the idea rationale, our conclusion is to promote setting a small cellulase production unit in each farm in Egypt to decrease the cost of feeding by using agricultural and agro-industrial waste during the cellulase production and feeding process.
   The experiment was conducted to study the effects of supplementing a cellulase enzymes cocktail to lactating buffaloes' diet, on the nutrient intake, nutrient digestibility, and milk production performance and composition. Twenty-four lactating Egyptian buffaloes were assigned into one of the following treatments: CON-control consisted of a total mixed ration, CENZ-the total mixed ration supplemented by a commercial source of cellulase enzyme, FENZ-the total mixed ration supplemented with cellulase enzyme cocktail produced in-farm. Supplementing the diet with the in-farm source of cellulase (FENZ) had a significantly higher impact on crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility. However, FENZ tended to increase the EE digestibility compared to CENZ. FENZ showed significantly higher nutrient digestibility percentages compared to other groups. Supplementing the diet with cellulase enzymes (CON vs. ENZ) significantly increased the daily milk yield and the fat correct milk yield; both yields were significantly higher with FENZ than all groups. Oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid concentration were significantly higher with cellulase enzymes supplementation (CON vs. ENZ) and the conjugated linoleic acid concentration. Supplementing fungal cellulase enzyme produced on a farm-scale has improved milk productivity, fat yield, and milk fat unsaturated fatty acids profile in lactating buffaloes.

AB  - Simple Summary The cilia- and flagella-associated protein 43 (CFAP43) gene plays an important role in the formation of flagella and cilia, and limited research has been conducted on the effect of this gene on animal body traits. Herein, the relationships between three insertion/deletion polymorphisms (L-13, L-16, and L-19) of the goat CFAP43 gene and body traits were analyzed in 1827 Shaanbei white cashmere goats. The findings showed that L-13 was related to chest depth; L-16 was associated with body length, chest width, cannon circumference, and back height; L-19 was associated with body length, chest circumference, and cannon circumference. The ideal genotypes for most of these traits are the deletion/deletion or insertion/deletion genotypes, which is consistent with previously published ideal genotypes for litter size at these loci; therefore, these loci are expected to be molecular markers for improving both body traits and litter size traits. The cilia- and flagella-associated protein 43 (CFAP43) gene encodes a member of the cilia- and flagellum-associated protein family. Cilia on the cell surface influence intercellular signaling and are involved in biological processes such as osteogenesis and energy metabolism in animals. Previous studies have shown that insertion/deletion (InDel) variants in the CFAP43 gene affect litter size in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats, and that litter size and body traits are correlated in this breed. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is a significant relationship between InDel variants within the CFAP43 gene and body traits in SBWC goats. Herein, we first investigated the association between three InDel variant loci (L-13, L-16, and L-19 loci) within CFAP43 and body traits in SBWC goats (n = 1827). Analyses revealed that the L-13, L-16, and L-19 loci were significantly associated with chest depth, four body traits, and three body traits, respectively. The results of this study are in good agreement with those previously reported and could provide useful molecular markers for the selection and breeding of goats for body traits.

AB  - Abiotic stressors, such as salt stress, can reduce crop productivity, and when combined with biotic pressures, such as insect herbivory, can exacerbate yield losses. However, salinity-induced changes to plant quality and defenses can in turn affect insect herbivores feeding on plants. This study investigates how salinity stress in tomato plants (Solanum Lycopersicum cv. Better Boy) impacts the behavior and performance of a devastating insect pest, the tomato fruitworm caterpillar (Helicoverpa zea). Through choice assays and performance experiments, we demonstrate that salt-stressed tomato plants are poor hosts for H. zea, negatively affecting caterpillar feeding preferences and growth rates. While changes in plant nutritional quality were observed, the primary factor influencing insect performance appears to be direct ionic toxicity, which significantly impairs multiple life history parameters of H. zea including survival, pupation, adult emergence, and fecundity. Plant defense responses show complex interactions between salt stress and herbivory, with two proteinase inhibitor genes - PIN2 and AspPI, showing a higher induced response to insect herbivory under salt conditions. However, plant defenses do not seem to be the main driver of reduced caterpillar performance on salt-treated plants. Furthermore, we report reduced oviposition by H. zea moths on salt-treated plants, which was correlated with altered volatile emissions. Our findings reveal that H. zea exhibits optimal host selection behaviours for both larval feeding and adult oviposition decisions, which likely contribute to its success as an agricultural pest. This research provides insights into the complex interactions between abiotic stress, plant physiology, and insect behaviour, with potential implications for pest management strategies in saline agricultural environments.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites of wild and domestic animals, act as vector of various pathogens such as bacteria, nematodes, viruses, protozoa, spirochetes and rickettsia etc. Dairy industry plays an important role in providing various products such as milk, meat, proteins and carbohydrates. Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) as domesticated animal was found highly infested with ticks in district Dera Ismail Khan. The knowledge about tick species found on buffaloes in Dera Ismail Khan was acknowledge before this study. To full fill this research gap, the present study was conducted to check the tick prevalence and tick infestation on buffalo in this area of KPK Pakistan. Five species; Dermacento rmarginatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Hae. sulcate, Rhipicephalus microplus and Hyalomma anatolicum belonging to four genera were recorded in the study area. Among species, Hy. anatolicum was widely distributed in all tehsils of Dera Ismail Khan followed by D. marginatus, Hae. Punctata, Hae. Sulcate and Rh. microplus. The results showed that overall tick prevalence on buffalo was 67%. The maximum tick infestation was recorded in month of June and July while minimum in April. Tick growth, development, activity and reproduction was highly affected with climatic conditions. The high population of ticks was collected from tail while lowest from ear. The significant difference (p<0.00) was recorded in the prevalence of tick infestation in all study areas or tehsils. Younger and female animals were highly infested than older and male. The current study provides significant data to adopt the proper control measures against ticks.

AB  - Key messageTreatment with methyl jasmonate can slow down the healing of stem bark wounds in Norway spruce seedlings.In woody plants, healing of bark wounds is a tolerance trait involved in recovery from stem damage. Yet, little is known on how wound healing may be affected by plant protection treatments such as methyl jasmonate application (MeJA, a plant hormone triggering increased resistance to pests). Here, we examined if MeJA can affect healing of an existing and a subsequently inflicted stem wound on Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings, the effect of treatment on plant growth, and potential trade-offs between healing and resistance to insect damage. Seedlings from 18 full-sib families were mechanically wounded (or not) on the lower stem and treated with MeJA (or water) one week after. Two months later, another wound was inflicted and wound area was measured during six months. Growth of non-wounded and wounded seedlings were compared, and correlations between family estimates of healing rates and field insect damage were examined. We found that MeJA slowed down wound healing. For the first and second wound, respectively, MeJA-treated seedlings experienced 15% and 9% slower healing rates, and wounds remained 58% and 69% larger in size compared to water-treated seedlings. Stem wounding and MeJA together were more detrimental to seedling diameter than height growth, relative to each treatment alone. Finally, resistance to field insect damage and wound healing rates were not significantly correlated. We conclude that MeJA-mediated seedling protection may trade-off with bark wound healing, which may be negative for seedling vigor. However, further studies are needed to evaluate if such effects outweigh the benefits that MeJA provides.

AB  - Simple Summary The old indigenous breeds of pig kept in Poland are currently an important element in the preservation of livestock biodiversity. In turn, the basis for the commercial production of fattening pigs are inter-breed hybrids. Today, one of the most important challenges facing pig producers is to obtain meat with specific nutritional and taste qualities. The aim of this study was a comparative analysis of the nutritional quality of meat and the health-promoting properties of intramuscular fat from pigs of the native Pulawska breed and its crossbreeds with the Polish Large White breed and the DanBred hybrids. Significantly, the meat of pigs of the Pulawska breed despite the lowest intramuscular fat content contained the lowest amount of saturated fatty acids, showed the most favourable PUFA/SFA ratio and the best values of atherogenic and thrombogenic indices compared to both other genetic groups. Meat from the fattening pigs of the Pulawska breed also tended to have a high protein content with the highest nutritional quality index value and a high concentration of indispensable amino acids, including histidine. The nutritional quality of meat and the health-promoting properties of intramuscular fat from randomly selected rearing pigs of the native Pulawska breed (PUL, n = 15) and its crossbreeds with the Polish Large White breed (PLW x PUL, n = 16) and the DanBred hybrids (DAN, n = 17) were compared. The typical commercial fattening period was carried out up to 80 days of age. The initial body weight of PUL weaners was 30.55 kg (& PLUSMN;3.98 kg), that of PLW x PUL weaners was 30.00 kg (& PLUSMN;4.29 kg) and that of DAN weaners was 30.70 kg (& PLUSMN;3.40 kg). The protein content and energy value of the complete feeds (Grower and Finisher) were 165 and 155 g/kg, and 12 and 11.8 MJ/kg, respectively. The research material consisted of samples of Longissimus lumborum and Semimembranosus. The chemical analyses included the determination of proximate composition, fatty acid content and amino acid concentration. The lowest fat content was found in the meat of the Pulawska pigs, while the highest was found in the DanBred fattening pigs. The highest content of SFAs and MUFAs was found in the meat of DanBred hybrids, while it was significantly lower in Pulawska pigs. The genetic group did not affect the content of PUFAs, including n-3 and n-6. Significantly lower and more favourable atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were found for the intramuscular fat of Pulawska pigs. The very limited effect of the genetic group on amino acid content was observed, except for that of serine, histidine and lysine. In general, the meat of pigs of the Pulawska breed showed the highest nutritional value and the most favourable health-promoting properties.

AB  - Anthropogenic litter in the environment is a globally pervasive contamination issue with harmful impacts on human and ecological health from exposure to both macroscale (>= 5 mm) and microscale (<5 mm) litter. To assess the prevalence, distribution, and drivers of plastic and nonplastic litter in the environment, we assessed anthropogenic litter abundance and characteristics at 10 sites across an urban catchment (Deer Creek near St. Louis, MO) in October 2022. Macroscale litter was evaluated within the channel bed, and stream water and sediment were sampled to assess anthropogenic microparticle content. The abundance of all macrolitter types ranged from 0.03 to 1.42 counts/m(2), while plastic macrolitter ranged from 0.00 to 0.61 counts/m(2). Plastic films (e.g., bags) were the most common (34.7%) type of plastic macrolitter that we found. Microparticles in water were below the limit of detection at all sites, while in sediment they had concentrations ranging from below the limit of detection to 84.28 counts/kg (with confirmed detections at 6 of 10 sites). Macroscale and microscale litter abundances across the watershed did not correlate, suggesting different sourcing and distribution drivers for the two debris size categories. Macroplastics correlated strongly and positively with impervious surface area and stream discharge, implying a combined influence of land use and hydrology on their deposition. Our findings suggest that the relationship between macroscale and microscale litter might vary depending on local sourcing and transport mechanisms.

AB  - Over the years, different solutions were developed and tested to reduce the emissions of ammonia and particulate matter from the livestock facilities. The environmental performances of these solutions were not always evaluated in detail. This study examines the environmental footprint of pig production at farm gate, with a focus on emissions from housing. Using Life Cycle Assessment, the environmental impact of pig production in a transition farm in Spain and in two finishing farms in Italy was evaluated considering three scenarios (one baseline and two of them involving an air treatment technology: wet scrubber or dry scrubber). The study goal was to quantify the environmental footprint of pig production in different scenarios, identify key environmental hotspots, and to assess impact reduction efficiency due to the two assessed technologies, analyze the environmental trade-offs that come with the use of these technologies, and identify potential for improvements. Both wet and dry scrubbers showed potential for reducing emissions in pig housing, affecting environmental impact categories related to air pollutants such as particulate matter, acidification and eutrophication. However, there were trade-offs between emissions reduction and categories related to energy and resource use. The infrastructure and consumables required to operate the scrubber added to the impacts compared to the baseline. The dry scrubber showed a more favorable balance between emission reduction and trade-offs. In this regard, results were similar for the Spanish and Italian farms, although there were slight variations. Scrubbers had a

AB  - Antipredator behaviors allow prey to mitigate the impacts of their predators. We investigated antipredator responses of two herbivore species, roe deer and European hare, and one mesopredator, red fox, toward predation risk imposed by lynx and wolf. We collected data (using camera traps) on visitation frequency and vigilance behavior to olfactory predator stimuli during 158 standardized scent trials in five areas across Europe, where lynx and wolves either occurred or had been absent for centuries. After a period without scent, trial sites were either marked with lynx or wolf urine, or butyric acid (unspecific scent used to contrast species-specific scent responses). We expected the two herbivores to respond aversively (reduced visitation frequency, and increased vigilance) to predator urine, while red foxes (scavengers) might adopt a risk-sensitive exploration strategy by increasing vigilance near predator urine without reducing visitation frequency. For all species, we expected stronger responses toward the ambush predator lynx than to the pursue predator wolf (cryptic predator hypothesis). If prey responds more strongly to predator stimuli when coexisting with the predator, we expected stronger reactions to predator urine in areas where predators occurred (naive prey hypothesis). Roe deer significantly avoided lynx urine and butyric acid, but not wolf urine. However, roe deer visitation frequency did not differ between scent treatment with large carnivore urine and butyric acid (suggesting that roe deer generally avoid areas with unfamiliar scent), or between areas where large carnivores were present and absent. Hares did not significantly avoid predator urine. Red foxes were attracted to lynx urine in sympatry, but not in allopatry with large carnivores. They increased vigilance rates in the presence of lynx urine independent of sympatry/allopatry with large carnivores. These findings generally confirm our expectations of predator avoidance by herbivores, and attraction combined with increased vigilance of mesopredators. In all species, lynx urine elicited stronger responses than wolf urine (although not significantly different), which to some extent conforms to the cryptic predator hypothesis. We found no support for the naive prey hypothesis. However, higher attraction of red foxes to lynx urine in sympatric situations might indicate that positive responses by scavengers are learning based.

AB  - Understanding factors that influence real-world public conservation behaviors is critical for developing successful conservation policies and management actions. Citizens of Colorado, USA recently passed a ballot initiative to restore the gray wolf to its former range within the state. The >3 million votes offer an unprecedented opportunity to test factors that influenced decisions to support or oppose this conservation action. We created spatial linear regression models to assess the relationship between support for wolf restoration and (1) the presidential vote, (2) distance to conservation intervention (i.e., proposed wolf reintroduction and existing wolves), and measures of (3) livelihood and (4) demographics using precinct-level data. Our results demonstrate the strong relationship between support for wolf restoration and political support for the Democratic candidate for president in the 2020 election, and highlight how other factors, including increased age, participation in elk hunting, and proximity to the reintroduction region were associated with less support. Our findings underscore the critical role of politicization on public conservation action and the need to develop outreach and engagement strategies to mitigate polarization.

AB  - Most current decision-making research focuses on classical economic scenarios, where choice offers are prespecified and where action dynamics play no role in the decision. However, our brains evolved to deal with different choice situations: "embodied decisions". As examples of embodied decisions, consider a lion that has to decide which gazelle to chase in the savannah or a person who has to select the next stone to jump on when crossing a river. Embodied decision settings raise novel questions, such as how people select from time-varying choice options and how they track the most relevant choice attributes; but they have long remained challenging to study empirically. Here, we summarize recent progress in the study of embodied decisions in sports analytics and experimental psychology. Furthermore, we introduce a formal methodology to identify the relevant dimensions of embodied choices (present and future affordances) and to map them into the attributes of classical economic decisions (probabilities and utilities), hence aligning them. Studying embodied decisions will greatly expand our understanding of what decision-making is.

AB  - Simple Summary The mineral content of the antler bone is one of the determinants of its mechanical strength, which directly affects success in competition with rivals. Therefore, this research aimed to analyze the concentration of five macroelements (Ca, P, Mg, K, Na) and nine trace elements (Li, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo) in three characteristic antler sections, depending on the age of farmed fallow deer (Dama dama). The highest mean concentrations of macroelements (except K) were recorded in the youngest animals. With age and distance from the skull, Ca, P, Mg and Na contents decreased, while K increased. Higher mean concentrations of most trace elements (Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn) were recorded in 3-year-old fallow deer in the distal antler positions. With an increase in the age, body mass and antler mass of farmed fallow deer, the concentration of Ca, P, Mg, K, Mn, Cu and Zn decreased in the studied tissue, whereas the Li concentration increased. There was a directly proportional relationship between the age and body mass of the animals, age and antler mass, and body mass and antler mass. The mineral content of the antlers reflects the nutritional status and specific stage of bone growth in cervid males. Therefore, this research aimed to analyze the concentration of Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, Li, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se and Mo in three characteristic antler positions selected based on the observation of fights between males. These were compared between farmed fallow deer (Dama dama) of different ages. The mineral compositions of tissues were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The highest mean concentrations of macroelements (except K) were recorded in the youngest animals aged 2 or 3 years in the proximal position of the antlers. With age and distance from the skull, Ca, P, Mg and Na contents decreased, while K increased. Higher mean concentrations of most trace elements (Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn) were recorded in 3-year-old animals in antler distal positions. With an increase in the age, body mass and antler mass of fallow deer, the concentration of Ca, P, Mg, K, Mn, Cu and Zn decreased (-0.414 <= R <= -0.737, p < 0.05) in the studied tissue, whereas Li increased (0.470 <= R <= 0.681, p < 0.05). The obtained results confirm that the antlers' chemical composition changes with age, also changing the Ca:P ratio.

AB  - Simple Summary Currently, feeding ruminants high-grain (HG) diets is a common feeding pattern, but this practice can have detrimental effects on these animals in the form of altering their gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to explore the structural and functional responses of jejunal digesta- and mucosa-associated microbiota to the low-grain as well as non-pelleted and pelleted high-grain (HP) diets. The results indicated that different diets altered the composition of digesta- and mucosa-associated microbiota, and the abundance of acid-producing bacteria was increased in both jejunal digesta and mucosa after the HG and HP diets. Meanwhile, the HP diets somewhat changed the impact of the HG diets, as HP diets reduced the proliferation of pro-inflammatory bacteria in the jejunal digesta and mucosa when compared to HG diets. In the present study, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing to uncover the impacts of non-pelleted (HG) or high-grain pelleted (HP) diets on the microbial structure and potential functions of digesta- and mucosa-associated microbiota in the jejunum of Hu sheep. Here, we randomly assigned 15 healthy male Hu sheep into three groups and fed the control diets (CON), HG, and HP diets, respectively. The experiment period was 60 days. The HP diets had the same nutritional ingredients as the HG diets but in pelleted form. At the finish of the experiment, the jejunal digesta and mucosa were gathered for microbial sequencing. The results of PCoA and PERMANOVA showed that different dietary treatments had significant impact (p < 0.05) on digesta- and mucosa-associated microbiota in the jejunum of Hu sheep. For specific differences, HG diets significantly increased (p < 0.05) the abundance of some acid-producing bacteria in both jejunal digesta (Bifidobacterium, OTU151, and OTU16) and mucosa (Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Bifidobacterium) of Hu sheep compared with the CON diets. Besides the similar effects of the HG diets (increased the acid-producing bacteria such as Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, and Shuttleworthia), our results also showed that the HP diets significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the abundance of some pro-inflammatory bacteria in the jejunal digesta (Mogibacterium, and Marvinbryantia) and mucosa (Chitinophaga, and Candidatus Saccharimonas) of Hu sheep compared with the HG diets. Collectively, these findings contributed to enriching the knowledge about the effects of HG diets on the structure and function of intestinal microbiota in ruminants.

AB  - The acquisition of behaviours that enhance the acceptability of new feeds could improve the performance and animal welfare in the pig industry. Pigs may learn individually by trial and error and/or by social learning to consume and prefer new flavoured feeds. However, there is little information regarding the effects of learning on the palatability of those flavours. This study aimed to investigate possible changes in pigs? hedonic responses, estimated by the mean consumption time per approach (CT/A), for flavours previously learnt through individual experiences (Experiment 1) and socially by a brief interaction with an experienced conspecific (Experiment 2). A total of 96 nursery pigs were used to study their preference, acceptability and palatability for flavours previously learnt about. Flavours were associated with 4% sucrose (Experiment 1) or with a demonstrator that recently consumed the flavour (Experiment 2). Those flavours or positive conditioned stimulus (CS+) were compared with control flavours that were not positively conditioned (CS-). In experiment 1, pigs preferred (P = 0.010) and tended to accept more (P = 0.069) of the CS + than CS- in water solutions. Nevertheless, no palatability differences were found (P = 0.875). In experiment 2, observer animals had a higher intake of CS + following interaction with demonstrators that consumed the same flavoured feed (P = 0.041). Snout to snout interaction time between those demonstrators and observers tended to present a positive correlation with CT/A (r = 0.497, P = 0.1). Thus both individual trial and error learning, and social learning, increased pigs acceptance of, and preference for, food flavours. However, only social learning modified the pattern of consumption with the observation of a correlation between changes in the CT/A ratio and the degree of snout to snout contact time between demonstrators and observers. Thus the mechanisms and effects of social and individual learning appear to differ at least partially. Regardless of mechanism, the fact that associative learning can increase food flavour consumption suggests that interventions based on associative learning may be beneficial for addressing welfare problems in pig production linked to low consumption, in particular with respect to weaning where the low consumption may relate to the inexperience of the animals.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the potential of plant-based and agro-industrial by-products as valuable sources of bioactive compounds for animal feed formulation. This study aims to evaluate the impact of dietary supplementation with Olea europaea L. leaf extract on the fatty acid composition of pig muscle. Thirty commercial hybrid pigs (Large White x (Landrace x Duroc)), with an initial body weight of 169 +/- 7.90 kg and an average age of 10 +/- 1 months, were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (n = 15 per group): one fed a standard diet containing Sulla (C) and the other receiving the same diet enriched with olive leaf extract (OL). Over 90 days, the OL group was supplemented with 300 mg/head/day of olive leaf extract, primarily containing oleuropein diglucoside, luteolin-7-glucoside, and verbascoside. The phenolic content, antioxidant activity, bioactive compounds, and fatty acid profiles of both meats and diets were analyzed. Results showed that OL supplementation did not significantly affect the chemical composition of the meat or pig performance, but it did influence the lipid profile. Specifically, OL supplementation led to a significant reduction in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and an increase in oleic acid, thus enhancing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Moreover, the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the meat was significantly reduced, suggesting potential improvements in the nutritional and functional quality of pig meat, enhancing the nutritional and functional quality of the meat by improving its fatty acid profile.

AB  - The upper reaches of the Taojia River have been impacted by unregulated logging linked to non-ferrous metal mining, resulting in significant mineral waste accumulation. Composting has shown promise in reducing heavy metal (HM) contamination in agricultural soils. This study included two segments: the first examined the effects of sheep manure (SM) and chicken manure (CM) with different concentrations on lead (Pb) dynamics in vegetable soils. The second applied the most effective method identified in segment one to assess Pb, cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) in soil, paddy, and straw in rice fields. Results showed that both compost types increased soil pH to mildly alkaline levels, with SM causing dose-dependent rises (insignificant between 2% and 5%) and CM inducing non-proportional alkalinity. CM compost significantly enhanced soil organic matter (SOM: 0.606-0.660 g/kg) compared to SM (0.414-0.495 g/kg). Total nitrogen (TN) spiked at 2% SM (0.172 g/kg) but plateaued until 10% SM (0.210 g/kg), while CM linearly increased TN with dosage. Total phosphorus (TP) rose proportionally with SM but remained unchanged under CM. For Pb immobilization, 5% SM reduced DTPA-Pb to 11.877 mg/kg, but 10% SM increased it (14.006 mg/kg), whereas 10% CM achieved optimal passivation (11.561 mg/kg). Correlation analyses linked compost dosage to SOM, TP, and available Pb (p < 0.05), with soil pH showing minimal direct influence. In rice fields, 10% CM elevated soil pH (7.10 vs. 6.71), TP, and total Zn/Cu/Pb/Cd but reduced Pb/Cd in paddy and straw. Heavy metal speciation revealed strong inter-state correlations (excluding exchangeable Pb), with soil pH and TP significantly influencing Zn, Cu, and Cd levels. These findings demonstrate CM compost's dual role in improving fertility and mitigating Pb/Cd uptake, though Zn/Cu accumulation risks require careful management.

AB  - The key to fighting a biological invasion may lie in understanding every variable that can explain its success. The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) states that when an invader arrives to a new environment, the absence of its common enemies (predators, parasites and competitors) facilitates the invasion success. The Horseshoe whip snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis) has been recently introduced from the Iberian Peninsula to the island of Ibiza, and it is currently threatening the only endemic vertebrate, the Ibiza wall lizard (Podarcis pityusensis). We hypothesized that the snake invasion success is caused by the absence of natural predators, and we checked the ERH by relating the tail breakage rate to predation pressure. The invasive population showed a much lower incidence of tail breakage than the source population, which is in agreement with the almost absence of snake predators among the Ibizan reduced and naive native vertebrate community. These results confirm the ERH, and support the prolongation of invasive snake trapping campaigns.

AB  - Revealing peculiarities of the course of physiological and biochemical processes in the formation of parameters of ejaculate allows effective correlation of biological completeness of spermatozoids based on the use of chelate compounds of limiting microelements, particularly copper. The study was focused on determining changes in processes of spermatogenesis during correction of mineral nutrition. In the experiment, we used adult boars of the same age, live weight and quality of ejaculates. They consumed copper citrate during the 45 day experiment in doses higher than the norm by 10% (1.5 mg per 1 kg of combined feed) and 20% (3 mg per 1 kg of combined feed) compared with the control. We determined difference in the effects of different doses of copper citrate on the formation of parameters of ejaculates in sire boars. Addition of the mineral additive to the feed in the doses 10% exceeding the norm promoted increase in the parameters of functional activity of spermatozoids - mobility and survival - on day 45 of the intake, which occurred against the background of acceleration of peroxidation processes (increase in the concentration of thiobarbituric acid of active compounds) and activation of the system of antioxidant protection - increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and decrease in the level of catalase in the sperm. At the same time, we observed increase in the morphometric parameters of spermatozoids - general length, width, length and volume of the head. On day 30, sire boars that had been consuming copper citrate in the amounts 20% above the norm were observed to have increase in concentration of spermatozoids, their mobility and survivability, though a decrease was seen in the morphometric parameters of the gametes. Further intake of this element caused increase in the amount of abnormal forms of spermatozoids. Under the action of this additive, we determined increase in the amount of metabolites of lipid peroxidation - conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acids of active compounds, and also weakening of the system of antioxidative protection - decrease in the content of reduced glutathione and accumulation of dehydroascorbic acid. Thus, the intake of copper citrate in the amounts of 10% above the norm facilitated morpho-functional parameters of spermatozoids by activating the system of antioxidant protection. It would be promising to conduct further research to determine the effects of copper citrate on the processes of activation and capacitation of spermatozoids and fertilization of oocytes in in vivo and in vitro conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUNDSalicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a jasmonic acid (JA) derivative, are elicitors that induce and activate plant defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens. The mite Brevipalpus yothersi colonizes various economically important crops and can be a vector for phytophagous viruses. Previous studies have demonstrated that Arabidopsis colonization by B. yothersi triggers the expression of SA and JA pathway genes. However, it remains unclear whether the performance and population growth of B. yothersi on Coffea arabica genotypes are affected by the induction of defense mechanisms (exogenous application of SA and MeJA), as well as its interaction with the population growth of a predatory phytoseiid mite.RESULTSFecundity, fertility, and survival of B. yothersi were affected by SA and MeJA but not by C. arabica genotypes Oro Azteca, Talisman, and Maragogipe. Phytophagous mite population growth was affected by coffee genotypes and elicitor treatment in the greenhouse, but only by elicitor treatment in the field cage. The population growth of predatory phytoseiid mites was affected by genotype and elicitor treatment.CONCLUSIONExogenous application of SA and MeJA on C. arabica genotypes affect the performance and population growth of B. yothersi, as well as the population growth of predatory phytoseiid mites. Our results may be useful to improve control methods for arthropods of agricultural importance. SA and MeJA present promising options that can be integrated into pest management strategies, especially in vulnerable crops such as coffee, and specifically to control the mite B. yothersi, a well-known vector of phytopathogenic viruses.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a 12-week diet versus diet plus aerobic and resistance exercise programme on acylated ghrelin (AG), desacylated ghrelin (DAG), and ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) concentrations in girls with obesity. We randomised 30 adolescents with obesity to a 12-week aerobic and resistance exercise group (EG) or a control group (CG). At baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, we measured their body composition, lipid profile, glucose, AG, DAG, and GOAT concentrations. In the EG, the body fat percentage decreased by 2.37% and was significantly lower than that in the CG. The DAG concentrations significantly increased by 48.3% and 27.4% in the EG and CG, respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks, DAG concentrations were significantly higher in the EG than in the CG. AG concentrations were higher at week 12 than at baseline in both groups. In both groups, the GOAT concentrations increased at weeks 8 and 12; however, no between-group differences were observed in the changes in GOAT concentrations. This study showed increased DAG concentrations and non-significant changes in AG and GOAT concentrations after a 12-week aerobic and resistance exercise programme in girls with obesity. These findings suggest that an aerobic and resistance exercise programme influences appetite-regulating hormones, mainly through changes in DAG concentrations.

AB  - Simple Summary The buffalo industry has great importance in the state of Para, within the Amazon biome, contributing to society in economic and cultural ways. For this reason, it is necessary to understand the disorders that affect this species, such as polioencephalomalacia (PEM), which has not been reported in the Brazilian literature. This is the first study about PEM in buffalo in the Amazon biome. This work describes five disease cases in buffaloes, presenting their clinical, macroscopic and histopathological findings.Abstract The epidemiological and clinical pathological aspects of polioencephalomalacia (PEM) in five buffaloes in the Amazon biome are described. Epidemiological data were obtained during the clinical visit in which buffalos were submitted to an examination of the nervous system. The diagnosis of PEM was based on epidemiological, clinical-pathological, and histopathological findings, similar to findings in other ruminants. In the clinical examination, all buffaloes had a body score between 2.5 and 3 (scale from 1 to 5), with decreased alertness, postural changes, marked hypermetria when stimulated to move, total or partial blindness demonstrated by colliding with the corral structures, head pressing and circumduction of the hindquarters when supported on the thoracic limbs, opisthotonos, muscle tremors, convulsions, paddling movements, sialorrhea, decrease in palpebral and pupillary reflexes, and eyeball rotation placing the pupillary slit in a vertical position. At necropsy, mild lesions characterized by edema and flattening of the cerebral convolutions were observed. A histopathological examination showed laminar necrosis of the cerebral cortex. The cause of PEM in the studied buffaloes was not established, which indicates the need for further studies to elucidate this disease in the species, particularly in the Amazon region.

AB  - Simple Summary With the increased development of pig farming intensification, air quality and odor emissions in pig houses are gradually attracting attention. Among them, ammonia is considered to be an important environmental indicator of pig house. Excessive accumulation of ammonia can seriously affect the growth status of pigs and also cause a potential health risk to farm workers. Therefore, it is very important to recognize the changes of ammonia in pig houses and to discharge ammonia in time for the welfare farming of pigs. In this study, three traditional machine learning algorithms and three deep learning algorithms were selected to predict the ammonia concentration in a pig house. Based on them, important environmental parameters and promising algorithms were screened out and the algorithms were evaluated for optimization. The results of the study can provide a reference for air quality regulation in pig houses. Accurately predicting the air quality in a piggery and taking control measures in advance are important issues for pig farm production and local environmental management. In this experiment, the NH3 concentration in a semi-automatic piggery was studied. First, the random forest algorithm (RF) and Pearson correlation analysis were combined to analyze the environmental parameters, and nine input schemes for the model feature parameters were identified. Three kinds of deep learning and three kinds of conventional machine learning algorithms were applied to the prediction of NH3 in the piggery. Through comparative experiments, appropriate environmental parameters (CO2, H2O, P, and outdoor temperature) and superior algorithms (LSTM and RNN) were selected. On this basis, the PSO algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the algorithms, and their prediction performance was also evaluated. The results showed that the R-2 values of PSO-LSTM and PSO-RNN were 0.9487 and 0.9458, respectively. These models had good accuracy when predicting NH3 concentration in the piggery 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, and 2 h in advance. This study can provide a reference for the prediction of air concentrations in pig house environments.

AB  - Early embryonic development may be affected by adrenal hyperactivity in stressful situations which may lead to endocrine changes in the embryo environment. A sensitive period in porcine embryo development is the 4-cell stage when the embryo genome activation occurs. A mixed in vivo-in vitro system was implemented to test whether an altered milieu around this stage could affect embryo development and blastocyst quality in the porcine model. After in vitro maturation and fertilisation, presumptive zygotes were exposed for 24 h to plasma collected after ovulation from adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treated, non-ACTH-treated sows; and, medium without plasma, supplemented with bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, embryo development and differences in gene expression were tested among treatments. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ between treatments. Blastocyst quality by morphology assessment was similar when all the resulting blastocysts were included in the analysis. However, when only expanded blastocysts (and onwards) were included in the analysis, the blastocysts from the non-ACTH plasma group showed better quality score. Blastocyst quality by morphological assessment was not mirrored by the transcription levels of various important genes for embryo development whose gene expression profile did not significantly differ among groups. It is likely that the effect of the altered environment provided by plasma from ACTH-treated sows was too short to affect embryo development. Therefore, a brief exposure to an altered endocrine environment may not have harmful consequences for the embryo once fertilisation occurs. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) is one of the most important pests of palm plants. It has expanded rapidly and posed a serious threat to related plants in recent years. To study the impact of climatic conditions on it and its distribution under current and future climatic conditions, the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and ArcGIS software were used for the first time to predict the potential distribution of O. rhinoceros in China under climate change in this work. The results showed that the distribution range of O. rhinoceros was 92.42-120.81 degrees E, 17.07-37.10 degrees N under current climatic conditions. The highly suitable area was 58,298.61 km(2), which is equal to 0.61% of China's land area. The area of highly suitable areas increased by 5.48%-39.43% under different scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) in the future (2050s, 2090s) compared with the current distribution, which implied that the distribution of the pest will further expand. The precipitation in the wettest month (bio13), the minimum temperatures in November (tmin11), the minimum temperatures in July (tmin7) and the precipitation in September (prec9) were determined to be the key environmental variables affecting the distribution of O. rhinoceros. This work has important guiding significance for developing effective O. rhinoceros monitoring, prevention and control methods. We suggest that relevant departments take measures as soon as possible to control the spread of this pest.

AB  - The Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) is a species which could potentially be evaluated as threatened, but data on its natural history in wild conditions are still insufficient. The diet in wildlife of C. hoffmanni was studied through of microhistological analysis of indigestible fragments of leaves found in 43 feces samples collected of the 47 samples found in an Andean forest reserve south of Bogota, Colombia. Four samples were highly decomposed and were not collected. A reference collection was made of 29 tree species where the feces were found or two-toed sloth were observed, to compare with the plant fragments found in the feces. Seventeen species and six fragments of foliar epidermis of undetermined species were identified in sloth diet. Based on this analysis, C. hoffmanni is a generalist folivore, ingesting a wide variety of plant leaves. Based on frequency of occurrence, relative frequency, and percent cover by volume, Brunellia sibundoya, Cordia cylindrostachya, Citharexylum sp., Quercus humboldtii, and Clethra fagifolia made up most (74%) of the diet of C. hoffmanni in an Andean forest. Comparing the plant species found in the feces with the reference collection, C. hoffmanni appears to deposit feces at the base of the trees that it consumes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of selected Lactobacillus strains, previously isolated from spontaneously fermented foods, as starter cultures in the production of organic dairy products-acid-rennet goat's cheeses under industrial conditions. The basic composition and the effect of starter cultures on the physicochemical, microbiological, sensory as well textural properties during the production and storage of goat's cheese were evaluated. Lactic acid bacteria count in cheese samples was at a high level of about 8 log CFU/g. The cheeses made with Levilactobacillus brevis B1 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Os2 bacterial cultures additions have showed more favorable Lipid Quality Indices than for the control one with the addition of acid whey. The time of ripening of the cheeses significantly (p < 0.005) changed their consistency-they became softer and more elastic and less moist. It is possible that the selected cultures of L. brevis B1 and L. plantarum Os2 isolated from traditional cheeses can be successfully applied to goat's milk cheese production.

AB  - The central dopaminergic system is implicated in the regulation of various physiological processes and behavioral responses, including social behavior. Although long-term individual housing of rodents is well known to alter their behavioral and neurochemical parameters, data interpretation remains ambiguous. In this work, we studied the effects of long-term social isolation on the behavior and state of the central dopaminergic system in male C57Bl/6 mice. The animals of the experimental group, aged 40-42 days, were housed singly in individual cages for six weeks, while the age-matched mice of the control group were housed in a group. Isolation did not affect locomotor and exploratory activity in the open field test compared to group housing. At the same time, singly-housed animals demonstrated a longer duration of social contacts in a resident- intruder model, as well as a weakened stereotypical behavior in the marble burying test compared to group-housed rats. These behavioral changes were accompanied by an increase in striatal mRNA levels of the genes encoding dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Moreover, the level of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) decreased in the hypothalamus and increased in the frontal cortex in singly-housed compared to group-housed mice. The results provide a better insight into the effects of long-term social isolation on the behavior and dopaminergic system in mice.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine whether single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was more effective for studying the goat pancreas. Pancreas tissues from three healthy 10-day-old female Xiangdong black goats were processed into single-cell and single-nucleus suspensions. These suspensions were then used to compare cellular composition and gene expression levels following library construction and sequencing. Both scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq were eligible for primary analysis but produced different cell identification profiles in pancreatic tissue. Both methods successfully annotated pancreatic acinar cells, ductal cells, alpha cells, beta cells, and endothelial cells. However, pancreatic stellate cells, immune cells, and delta cells were uniquely annotated by scRNA-seq, while pancreatic stem cells were uniquely identified by snRNA-seq. Furthermore, the genes related to digestive enzymes showed a higher expression in scRNA-seq than in snRNA-seq. In the present study, scRNA-seq detected a great diversity of pancreatic cell types and was more effective in profiling key genes than snRNA-seq, demonstrating that scRNA-seq was better suited for studying the goat pancreas. However, the choice between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq should consider the sample compatibility, technical differences, and experimental objectives.

AB  - It is increasingly important to understand animal migratory movements because climate disruption is shifting plant and animal phenology at different rates across the world. We applied a Markov state-switching model to telemetry data of a long-distance migrant, the barnacle goose, to detect migratory movement and relate it to three proximate environmental factors: photoperiod, daily mean temperature and forage plant phenology. Spring migratory movements towards the breeding grounds were most closely related to forage plant phenology (measured by accumulated growing degree days, GDDs); high GDDs values were associated with a greater probability of transiting to a more northerly site, suggesting that spring migration is closely aligned with primary productivity. Autumn migration from the breeding grounds was most closely related to temperature; higher temperature values were associated with a greater probability of remaining settled at the current site, suggesting that autumn migration is closely aligned with atmospheric conditions. Understanding the relative influence of different environmental factors on migratory patterns may in turn provide us with insight into how continued climate disruption could influence northern migratory systems.

AB  - Biochar adsorption materials have a good removal effect on ammonia nitrogen in piggery biogas slurry. However, the cost of biochar adsorption material is still high. If these materials can be recycled several times, the cost can be signif-icantly reduced. Therefore, this paper investigated a new process of biochar adsorption material (C@Mg-P) pyrolysis cycle for reducing ammonia nitrogen in piggery biogas slurry. The effects of pyrolysis process conditions (pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time) and number of recycling times on reducing ammonia nitrogen in biogas slurry by C@Mg-P were studied, a preliminary investigation on the reaction mechanism of C@Mg-P for reducing ammonia ni-trogen in biogas slurry was conducted, and the economic feasibility of the pyrolysis recycling process was analyzed. It was found that the NH3-N elimination efficiency by C@Mg-P was 79.16 % under the optimal conditions of 0.5 h and 100 degrees C. Second, C@Mg-P removed 70.31 % NH3-N after recycling 10 times. Chemical precipitation, ion exchange, physical adsorption and electrostatic attraction were the potential reaction mechanisms for NH3-N reduction by C@ Mg-P. Moreover, C@Mg-P had a good decolorization effect on piggery biogas slurry with a 72.56 % decolorization rate. Compared with the non-pyrolyzed recycling process, the proposed process saved 80 % of the cost, thus represent-ing an economically possible approach for pig manure biochar application in wastewater denitrification treatment.

AB  - Dental calculus, or tartar, is a mineralized biofilm that develops on the teeth, and is often observed on the teeth of the South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis. This structure can provide details on paleoecological, paleoenvironmental and paleopathological aspects of a species. However, characterization of tartar in N. platensis is lacking. The aim of this study was to provide a macromorphological characterization of tartar on N. platensis molars, and evaluate its prevalence, distribution patterns and severity. A total of 117 molariforms from Brazilian Quaternary fossiliferous assemblages were analyzed. Thirty-five (29.9%) molars presented tartar. The majority displayed moderate severity. Calculus was present at least on one inteloph(id) of each molar, and prevailed on the posterior region. It predominated on lower and third molars. Adult individuals showed a predominance compared to juveniles. These patterns in N. platensis are probably due to the susceptible oral environment, molar morphology, mature age and tooth replacement. These results suggest that N. platensis and probably other proboscideans were relatively susceptible to tartar development.

AB  - The G9a/G9a-like protein (GLP) histone lysine dimethyltransferase complex and downstream histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) repressive mark have recently emerged as key transcriptional regulators of gene expression programs necessary for long-term memory (LTM) formation in the dorsal hippocampus. However, the role for hippocampal G9a/GLP complex in mediating the consolidation of spatial LTM remains largely unknown. Using a water maze competition task in which both dorsal hippocampus-dependent spatial and striatumdependent cue navigation strategies are effective to solve the maze, we found that pharmacological inhibition of G9a/GLP activity immediately after learning disrupts long-term consolidation of previously learned spatial information in male mice, hence producing cue bias on the competition test performed 24 h later. Importantly, the inhibition of hippocampal G9a/GLP did not disrupt short-term memory retention. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed increases in global levels of permissive histone H3K9 acetylation in the dorsal hippocampus and dorsal striatum at 1 h post-training, which persisted up to 24 h in the hippocampus. Conversely, H3K9me2 levels were either unchanged in the dorsal hippocampus or transiently decreased at 15 min post-training in the dorsal striatum. Finally, the inhibition of G9a/GLP activity further increased global levels of H3K9 acetylation while decreasing H3K9me2 in the hippocampus at 1 h post-training. However, both marks returned to vehicle control levels at 24 h. Together, these findings support the possibility that G9a/GLP in the dorsal hippocampus is required for the transcriptional switch from short-term to long-term spatial memory formation.

Changes on exploratory behaviorafter its lesions are similar to ones following more extensive or completelesions of the hippocampus.

AB  - Simple Summary A shortage of high-quality roughage jeopardises the Chinese mutton sheep industry. The development of new roughage resources is important to safeguard the health and welfare of the sheep, to save costs, increase efficiency and improve resource utilization. Mulberry leaves have high nutritional value and have been used in herbivore production for a long time in China. However, fresh mulberry leaves are not easy to preserve, and dried mulberry leaves readily lose nutrients in the conservation process. Ensiling mulberry leaves can reduce the anti-nutritional constituents, mainly phytic acid and tannin, while reducing any nutrient loss. In this study, mulberry silage replaced part of a maize silage-based diet for fattening Hu lambs. The effects of mulberry silage on the growth of the lambs, their gastrointestinal tissue morphology, rumen fermentation parameters and bacterial diversity were investigated. The results showed that using mulberry silage in place of 20-40% of the maize silage in the diet of Hu lambs promoted their growth, while maintaining satisfactory digestion. Maize silage has a significant environmental impact on livestock due to its high requirement for fertilizer and water. Mulberry has the potential to replace much of the large amount of maize silage grown in China, but its feeding value in the conserved form needs to be evaluated. We fed Hu lambs diets with 20-60% of the maize silage replaced by mulberry silage, adjusting the soybean meal content when increasing the mulberry silage inclusion rate in an attempt to balance the crude protein content of the diets. Mulberry silage had higher crude protein and lower acidic and neutral detergent fiber contents compared to maize silage. Replacing maize silage and soyabean meal with mulberry silage had no effect on the feed intake and growth rate of Hu lambs. However, the rumen pH increased, the acetate to propionate in rumen fluid increased, and the rumen ammonia concentration decreased as mulberry replaced maize silage and soyabean meal. This was associated with an increase in norank_f__F082 bacteria in the rumen. Rumen papillae were shorter when mulberry silage replaced maize silage, which may reflect the reduced neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the original silage. In conclusion, mulberry silage can successfully replace maize silage and soyabeans in the diet of Hu lambs without loss of production potential, which could have significant environmental benefits.

AB  - Simple Summary Parasites are a major health problem in tropical goat husbandry. Among the parasites, gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) play an important role. The control of GINs relies on the use of synthetic anthelmintics. Their use for decades has resulted in frequent GIN resistance to these treatments. Therefore, there is a need to target only the animals in need of treatment to reduce the selection for GIN resistance. The difficulty is in finding easy to use pathophysiological indicators such as anemia (with FAMACHA (c), estimation of eye mucosal color), loss of weight (with body score), or hair roughness. These indicators can be used by farmers after the promotion and help of agricultural advisory services. Laboratory examinations such as the excretion of GIN eggs in feces are very useful in estimating the infection of goats, but are costly and thus remain the exception. Eighteen farmers participated in semi-directive interviews to appreciate their relation to goat GIN infection and the solutions they considered. Seventeen were investigated for GIN infection. The average infection by GINs was high, with a wide range from one farm to another. The frequency of anthelmintic treatments was negatively related to the use of body score, FAMACHA (c), and hair roughness. GIN were not a major issue for traditional farmers. This is due to the important use of indicators and the belief in their value, which provides comfort to farmers that the parasites are being controlled. Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) are a major health problem in tropical goat husbandry. The control of GIN has been nearly exclusively reliant on the use of anthelmintic treatments. Their wide use has provoked the appearance and diffusion of anthelmintic resistance. Therefore, there is a need to use anthelmintics only when they are really needed. This strategy of targeted selective treatment (TST) has been recommended. The selection of animals to be treated has been based either on the objective measures of GIN intensity (fecal nematode egg counts) performed in the laboratory or on indirect assessment such as anemia (FAMACHA (c)), diarrhea score or weight gains, particularly in sheep. The roughness of hair has also been proposed in goats. These indicators can be handled by the farmer. Their opinion on the importance of GINs, and the indicators that they are ready to accept and use have very rarely been studied. Goat for meat production is important in the French West Indies (especially in Guadeloupe) and GIN infection may significantly alter this production. Eighteen farmers participated in semi-directive interviews in order to appreciate their relation to goat GIN infection and the solutions they considered. Seventeen farms were investigated for fecal nematode egg counts, FAMACHA (c), body score, and roughness of hair. The average infection by GINs was high (average fecal egg count 1562 and standard deviation 2028) with a wide range from one farm to another (from 0 to 25,000 eggs of GIN per gram of feces). The Haemonchus genera was predominant (54%), followed by Trichostrongylus (37%) and Oesophagostomum (9%). Young goats were less infected than adult goats since they were not yet grazing; males were more infected than females; and the Creole breed was more infected than the other breeds. Among the farming types, the professional ones were less infected compared with the traditional or mixed agriculture and husbandry farms. Those using targeted selective treatment did not have a significantly higher GIN infection than those treating the whole herd.
   Most of the characteristics were related and multivariate analysis could not match the intensity of GIN infection with any parameter. The frequency of anthelmintic treatments was negatively related to the use of body score, FAMACHA (c), and hair roughness. The use of semi-directive interviews provided a wider understanding of the strategies and problems of farmers. The farmers valued their animals very much and diseases, in general, were a preoccupation, whereas parasites were not a major issue for traditional farmers. This is due to the important use of indicators and the belief in their value that gives comfort to the farmers that the parasites are being controlled. The extension services have well diffused the practice of indicators to the goat farmers of Guadeloupe, with some depending less on anthelmintics to control the gastrointestinal nematodes by using targeted selective treatments.

AB  - Implications of optimal contribution selection for litter size in the Black Slavonian pig were analysed using 23,882 litter records from 6764 sows. To obtain population parameters, pedigree analysis was performed for 7367 animals. The average inbreeding coefficient was 2.87%, the average inbreeding rate was 1.96%, and the effective population size was 25.52. The average maximum number of generations traced back was 4.12 and the average number of full generations was 1.17. Selection candidates were chosen using the following criteria: animals had no culling date in the record; animals had sufficient pedigree depth and an estimated breeding value. Using these criteria, 8 boars among 24 and 386 sows among 2028 were defined as selection candidates. Two scenarios were tested. The first scenario was based on the application of the traditional optimal contribution selection with the maximisation of genetic gain and restricting the mean kinship in the offspring accounting also for breeding values. The second scenario was based on minimising inbreeding by restricting the average kinship of the population. In the first scenario, different kinship constraints between candidates resulted in changing the number of selected animals and changed the average breeding values such that the number of selected candidates increased when the kinship constraint was stronger, with a simultaneous decrease in breeding values. The second scenario resulted in increased inbreeding when the additional weight on genetic gain was added. The results of the study showed that the use of optimal contribution selection in Black Slavonian is possible, however, with additional efforts to improve pedigree and data quality.

AB  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), as a representative of the Cervidae family, are particularly sensitive to negative environmental stimuli due to their need to maintain increased vigilance during feeding. Intensive hunting seasons are undoubtedly also a stressful factor for this species. The aim of this study was to analyze the cortisol levels in the hair of male roe deer collected at the beginning and the end of the hunting season in eastern Poland. In total, hair samples from 26 individuals collected in May and 31 individuals collected in September were analyzed. The concentration of cortisol in the hair was determined using the EIA kit. It was shown that the concentration of cortisol was significantly higher in samples collected in September compared to those collected in May (Pr. > |t| = 0.0017). Moreover, the age of animals and carcass mass did not significantly affect the concentration of the tested hormone. In summary, the concentration of cortisol in the fur of male roe deer depended on the season and was not influenced by the carcass mass or age of the animals studied.

AB  - Free ammonia (FAN) inhibition is commonly encountered during high solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD) of pig manure. The performance of HSAD is highly related to its operational water regime; however, little information is available regarding the dynamics of free ammonia with varied water regimes. In this work, four treatments were set with equal amount of water supply but varied addition frequencies, i.e. add once but at different times in treatments T1 and T2, add twice in T3 while it was three times in treatment T4. Results showed that the whole methanogenic process ran smoothly with the average methane gas production rate maintaining at 191.1 LCH4/ kgVSadded. Although a higher methane gas production rate of 217.4 LCH4/kgVSadded was achieved in T1, one time water addition triggered a higher ammonia inhibition potential. Cumulative FAN release was 6.03 mgFAN/ kgVSadded in T1 while the balance between FAN and ammonia tended to the fraction of FAN. In T4, cumulative FAN of 5.07 mgFAN/kgVSadded was evolved, which was lower than that in T1 but similar to the situation in T2. The lowest FAN was observed in T3, indicating that a moderate frequency of dilution might be conducive to alleviate free ammonia inhibition.

AB  - Plants of Eruca sativa from a desert population produce less vegetative biomass, flower earlier and possess higher density of trichomes than plants from a more mesic Mediterranean habitat. When eliciting plant defense mechanisms with methyl-jasmonate (MJ), trichome formation was exclusively enhanced in plants of the Mediterranean ecotype. To test the relative costs of defenses, ecologically-important traits were monitored in non-elicited plants of the two ecotypes and when defenses were induced by MJ. Opposing the expected tradeoffs of induced defense, MJ- elicita-tion significantly delayed bolting and flowering in plants of the desert ecotype but not in the Mediterranean ones. Moreover, MJ did not impose costs on fitness-related traits, i.e. fruit and seed production, nor differences between plants of the two ecotypes were found. It is suggested that early flowering in plants of the desert ecotype provide a mean to escape both the abiotic stressful environment as well herbivory, while induced defense in the Mediterranean ecotype was favored in habitats of more stressful biotic interactions. The results are discussed in light of the optimal defense theory and resource availability hypothesis.

AB  - Fifty-eight litters (16 from primiparous gilts and 42 from multiparous sows) were used, with a total number of 750 piglets involved in the study. Birth weight was stratified into three groups: low (<1.02 kg; LBW), normal (1.02-1.62 kg; NBW), and high (>1.62 kg; HBW). A creep feeding diet was offered to piglets in a creep feeder in 29 litters from day 7 until their weaning. Piglet mortality was recorded daily. Traceability was ensured up to the point of carcass splitting and subsequent meat analysis. Each carcass was eviscerated and weighed individually. Sixty-nine piglets were selected for the microbiome analysis (35 from the control group and 34 from the creep feeding group). Feces samples from the rectum were obtained at three time points (three days prior weaning, a week after weaning, and before the slaughtering of the pigs). Mortality during lactation was influenced by birth weight, with LBW piglets exhibiting a six-fold higher mortality rate than HBW. Creep feeding did not impact piglet mortality. Heavier piglets demonstrated greater weight gain when subjected to creep feeding, while the growth potential of lighter piglets was reduced. Variation in creep feeding consumption based on birth weight also affected microbiome composition, with high-birth-weight piglets displaying higher alpha diversity than low- and normal-birth-weight piglets seven days after lactation. Alpha diversity is indicative of gut health, with higher values suggesting greater stability and adaptability to different feed sources. In conclusion, the immediate impacts of creep feeding appear to be most prominent during lactation and potentially early postweaning. These short-term effects are modulated by birth weight, with HBW piglets demonstrating the greatest benefits from the implementation of creep-feeding practices.

AB  - Insoluble proanthocyanidins are reported as plant defence compounds against herbivorous insects. This is the first report to demonstrate the occurrence of insoluble proanthocyanidins in plants of the Polygonaceae family. In this study, we identified a mutant Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) cultivar, 'Hokkai T10', that lacks insoluble proanthocyanidins accumulation in leaves and shows a role in defence against common cutworm (Spodoptera litura Fabricius). We did not detect insoluble proanthocyanidins in p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde stain in 'Hokkai T10'. The expression of the trait should be regulated by at least one recessive gene named iPA. The leaves of 'Hokkai T10' were ingested in larger amount by S. litura than the wild type. This fact supports the hypothesis that insoluble proanthocyanidins have a role in protection against insects. This is the first report to demonstrate a resistance role of insoluble proanthocyanidins using insect preference. In addition, the germination rate of 'Hokkai T10' was significantly higher than wild type; indicating to show firstly the effects of insoluble proanthocyanidins on seed germination.

AB  - The results of artificial insemination (AI) are adversely affected by changes in sperm motility and function throughout the cryopreservation procedure. The proteome alterations of frozen-thawed spermatozoa with various levels of freezability in dairy goats, however, remain largely unknown. To discover differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and their roles in dairy goat sperm with high or low freezability (HF or LF), we conducted 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics analysis, the results of which are presented in this work. Additionally, we explored the underlying processes that may lead to the variations in sperm freezing resistance. A total of 263 DEPs (Fold Change > 2.0, p-value < 0.05) were identified between the HF group and LF group in frozen-thawed dairy goat spermatozoa. In our Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the DEPs were mostly associated with the regulation of biological processes, metabolic processes, and responses to stress and cellular component biogenesis. Our Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis also revealed that the DEPs were predominantly engaged in oxidative phosphorylation, N-Glycan biosythesis, and cysteine and methionien metabolism. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed 14 potential proteins (NUDFB8, SDHC, PDIA4, HSPB1, etc.) that might influence the freezability of dairy goat sperm. These findings shed light on the processes underlying alterations in the proteome and sperm freezability, aiding further research on sperm cryopreservation.

AB  - In the United States, citizens and policymakers heavily rely upon Environmental Protection Agency mandated regulatory networks to monitor air pollution; increasingly they also depend on low-cost sensor networks to supplement spatial gaps in regulatory monitor networks coverage. Although these regulatory and low-cost networks in tandem provide enhanced spatiotemporal coverage in urban areas, low-cost sensors are located often in higher income, predominantly White areas. Such disparity in coverage may exacerbate existing inequalities and impact the ability of different communities to respond to the threat of air pollution. Here we present a study using cost-constrained multiresolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMDcc) to identify the optimal and equitable placement of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors in four U.S. cities with histories of racial or income segregation: St. Louis, Houston, Boston, and Buffalo. This novel approach incorporates the variation of PM2.5 on timescales ranging from 1 day to over a decade to capture air pollution variability. We also introduce a cost function into the sensor placement optimization that represents the balance between our objectives of capturing PM2.5 extremes and increasing pollution monitoring in low-income and nonwhite areas. We find that the mrDMDcc algorithm places a greater number of sensors in historically low-income and nonwhite neighborhoods with known environmental pollution problems compared to networks using PM2.5 information alone. Our work provides a roadmap for the creation of equitable sensor networks in U.S. cities and offers a guide for democratizing air pollution data through increasing spatial coverage of low-cost sensors in less privileged communities.

AB  - Simple Summary Excessive fat deposit is one of the major problems in finishing Ningxiang pigs, and adversely affects the breeding. The study aimed to investigate the effects of diet with betaine supplementation (basal diet + 0.2% betaine) on the growth performance, slaughter performance, meat quality and the genes expression related to fat deposition in finishing Ningxiang pigs. The results indicated that diet with betaine supplementation decreased back fat thickness and fat percentage, and increased the lean meat percentage as well. In addition, it reduced the fat deposition by regulating the genes expression. These findings provided a reference for breeding Ningxiang pigs. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of diet with betaine supplementation on the growth performance, carcass quality and fat deposition in finishing Ningxiang pigs. A total of 24 Ningxiang pigs (43.6 +/- 5.34 kg of average body weight) was randomly divided into two groups, with 6 replicates per treatment and 2 pigs per replicate. The treatments included a control group (basal diet) and a test group (basal diet + 0.2% betaine). The whole trial lasted 81 days. At the end of the experiment, one pig (close to the average body weight of all experimental pigs) per replicate was slaughtered to determine the carcass traits, meat quality and the mRNA expression levels of genes relate to fat deposition (one pig per replicate was randomly selected and fasted for 12 h, n = 6). Results indicated that growth performance was not changed with betaine supplementation. However, dietary with betaine supplementation decreased back fat thickness and fat percentage, and increased the lean meat percentage as well (p < 0.05). In addition, diet with betaine supplementation reduced drip loss, water loss, cooking loss, shear force and b x 24 h value of meat (p < 0.05). There was no difference in total moisture, ether extract and crude protein of longissimus thoracis between the control and test group. Dietary with betaine supplementation decreased ether extract and total cholesterol (p < 0.05) in liver. Dietary with betaine supplementation upregulated the mRNA expression levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), while downregulated the mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) in subcutaneous fat of back (p < 0.05). Besides, dietary with betaine supplementation upregulated the fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) mRNA expression of longissimus thoracis in finishing Ningxiang pigs (p < 0.05). These results showed that diet supplemented with betaine could improve the slaughtering performance and meat quality, and regulate the genes expression to affect the fat deposition in finishing Ningxiang pigs.

AB  - The effects of exogenous additives (biochar, calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, and spent mushroom substrate) on humification process and heavy metal passivation during pig manure composting were investigated. The aerobic composting trial were carried out in 60 L reactors for 49 d. The calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, biochar, and spent mushroom substrate amendment treatments all accelerated the organic matter degradation and increased the temperature, decreased the volatile fatty acid content by 45%-49.0% and promoted humification of the compost (increasing the humic acid content and humus index). The biochar passivated Cu best, calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer passivated Zn best (passivation rate 13.85%), and spent mushroom substrate passivated Cd, Cr, and Pb best (passivation rates 25.47%-47.91%). The additives amendment improved Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, and Pb passivation performance by promoting composting humification process.

AB  - The production of wool is an economic burden and an issue for sheep breeders in many countries of the European Union because shorn greasy wool is defined as an animal byproduct (category 3) and must be sent to landfill as a special waste if not addressed in the textile supply chain. Nevertheless, wool is an important source of nitrogen, with high potential as agricultural renewable and sustainable organic fertilizer. To apply wool to soil, any contamination from harmful bacteria (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.) should be excluded. In this study, we developed sheep wool pellets to test their suitability for use as an organic fertilizer. Wool was rich in N (12% of dry material) and was mixed to spruce sawdust at sawdust: wool ratios of at 2:1; 1:1 (v/v) to increase soil organic carbon. Despite the different mix of wool and sawdust, pellets were similar in size (diameter and length), and the content of the elements suited the requirements of fertilizers and did not present harmful bacteria after pelletization. Therefore, wool pellets may represent a feasible solution to provide sheep wool with an added value, introducing it in a circular economy process. However, further study is needed to test the effects of the produced fertilizing pellets in real cropping systems.

AB  - Relative copy number of mitochondria was estimated for the potential association with the expression of mitochondrial coded stress related genes in bubaline spermatozoa. Semen samples were collected from buffalo bulls under two extreme temperature-humidity index conditions: hot summer and winter. Based on the semen quality, the bulls were categorized: exhibiting poor semen quality during hot summer as "seasonally affected," while those maintaining good semen quality throughout the year, as "seasonally not affected". The average mitochondrial copy numbers were lower during hot summer (15.42 f 1.2368) compared to winter (17.29 f 0.72) in both the groups. Furthermore, within the hot summer period, bulls classified as seasonally affected exhibited significantly lower mitochondrial copy numbers (12.86 f 1.343) than their seasonally unaffected counterpart (17.97 f 1.34). These results suggest a potential role of mitochondria in influencing semen quality, particularly in response to impaired scrotal thermoregulation during the summer season. Although the fold change in apoptotic genes (BCL2, MCL1, CASP3, and BAK) and oxidative panel genes (CAT, SOD, GPx, ATF4, and FOXO-3), did not differ significantly across the groups, differences were observed between the seasons. Further, to understand the role of copy number in apoptosis and ROS scavenging across the seasons and the groups, the generalized mixed model was employed. The results conveyed a significant negative interaction of copy number with the expression of CAT gene and significant positive interaction of copy number with the apoptotic gene panel. Our findings underscore the significant role of mitochondrial copy numbers in domestic buffalo spermatozoa in managing the challenges of thermoregulation posed by harsh tropical conditions.

AB  - A maternal high-fat diet (HFD) provokes changes in the offspring's brain's structure, function, and development. These changes may cause neuropsychiatric disorders in the early life of offspring the basis of which may be memory impairment. In this study, the effects of maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation on the short-term memory in adolescent and young adult offspring were evaluated. We analyzed the expression of genes encoding the glutamatergic transporters in the hippocampus to verify the association between changes in glutamatergic transporters and behavioral changes in offspring. Next, we examined whether maternal diet-induced changes in the mRNA levels of genes encoding the NMDA receptor subunits and the AMPA receptor subunits, as well as BDNF in this structure in offspring. All significant changes were validated at the protein level. We found that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation disrupts short-term memory in adolescent and young adult fe-males. The latter change is likely related to the dysregulation of hippocampal levels of GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors and of reduced levels of BDNF. In summary, we showed that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation triggered several changes within the glutamatergic system in the hippocampus of rat offspring, which may be related to producing behavioral changes in offspring.

AB  - Interest in the conversion of manure in biogas via anaerobic digestion (AD) is growing, but questions remain about the biosafety of digestates. For a period of one year, we monitored the impact of three mesophilic agricultural biogas plants (BPs) mainly fed with pig manure (BP1, BP3) or bovine manure (BP2) on the physico-chemical parameters, the composition of the microbial community and the concentration of bacteria (E. coli, enterococci, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridioides difficile). The BP2 digestate differed from those of the two other BPs with a higher nitrogen content, more total solids and greater abundance of Clostridia MBA03 and Disgonomonadacea. Persistence during digestion ranked from least to most, was: Campylobacter (1.6 to >2.9 log(10) reduction, according to the BP) < E. coli (1.8 to 2.2 log(10)) < Salmonella (1.1 to 1.4 log(10)) < enterococci (0.2 to 1.2 log(10)) and C. perfringens (0.2 to 1 log(10)) < L. monocytogenes (-1.2 to 1.6 log(10)) < C. difficile and C. botulinum (=0.5 log(10)). No statistical link was found between the reduction in the concentration of the targeted bacteria and the physicochemical and operational parameters likely to have an effect (NH3, volatile fatty acids and total solids contents, hydraulic retention time, presence of co-substrates), underlining the fact that the fate of the bacteria during mesophilic digestion depends on many interacting factors. The reduction in concentrations varied significantly over the sampling period, underlining the need for longitudinal studies to estimate the impact of AD on pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  - Non-invasive genetic sampling can facilitate the identification of individual animals across a landscape, with applications to management and conservation. Fecal material is a readily available source of DNA, and various methods exist for collecting fecal samples for DNA preservation. In particular, swab methods offer considerable promise, but their utility in real-world field contexts remains relatively untested. We systematically compared multiple genetic fecal sampling methods across all stages of data collection and analysis, including sampling in the field, DNA extraction in the lab, and identification of individuals using microsatellite genotyping. We collected 112 fecal samples from black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in the field in Mendocino County, California, across a range of sample conditions of unknown age. We systematically compared the efficiency, ease, and genotyping success of three methods for field collection and storage of ungulate fecal samples: whole pellets in ethanol, whole dry pellets in paper envelopes, and cotton swabs in buffer. Storage method, sample condition, and their interaction predicted genotyping success in the top binomial GLMMs. We found that swabbing pellets resulted in the greatest percentage of individually identifiable genotypes (81%, compared to 60% for dry samples and 56% for ethanol), despite lower DNA concentrations. While swabbing pellets requires a greater time investment in the field, the samples are easier and safer to store and transport, and subsequent labwork is more efficient as compared to whole-pellet collection methods. We, therefore, recommend the swab method for most contexts. We provide additional recommendations and field protocols based on subsequent collection of 2284 swab samples for a larger monitoring study of the deer population, given that this large number of samples spanned a range of sample conditions and time spent in storage.

When damaged by insect herbivores, plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that can affect pest performance, recruit biocontrol agents, and trigger defence responses in neighboring plants. While plant communication via HIPVs has been well-documented over the past few decades, key aspects, such as the specific biochemical mechanisms underlying defence activation in neighboring plants and the variation in response to herbivory, remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of HIPVs released by aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae)-infested Brassica napus (emitter) plants on neighboring uninfested conspecific plants (receiver). After 48 h exposure, emitter plants were discarded, and receiver plants were utilized in bioassays to assess aphid performance (fecundity and survival), preference, as well as amino acid and glucosinolates contents of receiver host plants. Results revealed that receiver plants showed a significant reduction in aphid fecundity, although no significant effect on aphid survival was observed. Aphid feeding preference was significantly altered, with B. brassicae showing a reduced preference for receiver plants. Additionally, significant increases in some key amino acids and total concentrations were recorded in receiver plants. Glucosinolates (GSs) analysis showed a significant change in total GS content, with a significant increase in the individual GSs, glucoiberin (GIB), and glucoraphanin (GRA). Current findings provide evidence that receiver plants activate their defence mechanism against B. brassicae by altering amino acid and glucosinolate levels. This study highlights the potential of HIPVs to enhance sustainable pest management strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The relationships between nutritive elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, K, Ca and Mg) and toxic metals (Pb and Cd) can inform the assessment of health status of red deer, which are exposed to pollution in their natural environment. These elements in the longissimus lumborum muscle, hair and selected organs of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) were analysed. The study revealed many significant correlations between the levels of elements and their high variability in individual tissues and organs. The accumulation of a specific metal in a tissue or organ can reduce its concentration in another matrix or promote increased content in another tissue or organ.
   The aim of the study was to analyse correlations and variability between the levels of mineral elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, K, Ca and Mg) and toxic metals (Pb and Cd) in the longissimus lumborum muscle, hair and selected organs of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.). The levels of mineral elements were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy (F-AAS). The levels of Pb and Cd were analysed by means of electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ET-AAS). Of all analysed microelements, the highest concentration (in g center dot kg(-1) of dry weight) was found for Fe in the liver. Considering all macroelements, the highest level was found for K in the longissimus lumborum muscle. Particularly remarkable was the high level of Pb in the muscle and hair of red deer. The level of Cd in the hair was four to five times lower than in other samples. The study revealed many significant correlations between the levels of certain elements in individual tissues and organs. There were significant correlations between Cu-Fe (r(xy) = 0.650; p <= 0.01), Pb-Cu (r(xy) = -0.863; p <= 0.01) and Cd-Ca (r(xy) = -0.743; p <= 0.01) in testicles. For kidneys, a significant negative correlation was found for K and Na (r(xy) = -0.779; p <= 0.01) and for Ca and Cd (r(xy) = -0.695; p <= 0.01), and a positive correlation between Cu and Mn (r(xy) = 0.693; p <= 0.01). In the liver, significant negative correlations were found between Ca-K (r(xy) = -0.654; p <= 0.05), Cd-Fe (r(xy) = -0.651; p <= 0.05) and Pb-Cu (r(xy) = -0.627; p <= 0.05). In the muscle, only single significant correlations were found between Cd and Mn (r(xy) = 0.648; p <= 0.05). The highest number of significant correlations were recorded for the hair, among others between Na-K (r(xy) = 0.760) and Ca-Zn (r(xy) = 0.709) at p <= 0.01. The study revealed high variability in the levels of mineral elements and selected toxic metals in tissues, organs and hair of red deer. Additionally, this research confirmed that the accumulation of a specific metal in a tissue or organ can reduce its concentration in another matrix or promote its increased content in another tissue or organ.

AB  - Plants can defend themselves against herbivores by accumulating heavy metals. Plant defense includes inorganic (elemental) and organic defenses. However, for the hyperaccumulator invasive plant Phytolacca americana, what kind of impact will the enrichment of heavy metal Mn (Manganese) have on the defense of herbivorous insects and natural enemy insects? In this context, we studied the effects of hyperaccumulation of Mn on the defense mechanisms of Spodoptera litura and its natural enemies. The results showed that Mn treatment significantly reduced the biomass of the native plant population (US) but had no significant effect on the invasive population (China). After feeding on both native and invasive populations, the weight of S. litura decreased significantly with the increase in the concentration of Mn. Under high Mn treatment, the weight of S. litura feeding on the native population was higher than that of the invasive population. The Mn content in leaves of the native and invasive populations exhibited a significant decrease, while the Mn treatment increased the saponin content of the invasive population. We speculate that combining elemental and organic defenses against herbivores may be the primary mechanism promoting the invasion of P. americana into China after accumulating heavy metals. The heavy metal Mn in plants will transfer Mn to the third trophic level (natural enemy insects) through the "bottom-up effects", affecting the growth and development of the third trophic level. Overall, this has important implications for understanding how invasive plants adapt to soil heavy metal pollution and resistance to herbivorous insects.

AB  - Rectal thermometers are commonly used to assess animal health, but non-invasive methods like thermal imaging are gaining popularity for their ease. This study explores using infra-red thermography to measure eye temperatures as a proxy for body temperature in buffaloes. Among 280 adult female buffaloes, rectal temperature averaged 38.26 +/- 0.38 degrees C, while eye temperature averaged 36.99 +/- 0.47 degrees C. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation (0.674, p < 0.001) between eye and rectal temperatures in adult buffaloes. Moderate correlations were also found between rectal temperature and ambient temperature (0.488, p < 0.001), as well as with ocular temperature (0.488, p < 0.001), while the correlation with humidity was low (0.176, p < 0.05). Regression modelling incorporating rectal and eye temperatures, ambient temperature, and humidity revealed that ocular temperature and ambient temperature significantly affect rectal temperature. The developed equation RT = 20.377 + 0.465(AET) + 0.024(AT) accurately predicts rectal temperature in buffaloes, with R-2 of 51.6%, RMSE = 0.272, and AIC = 71.601 indicating satisfactory variability. These findings highlight the potential of thermal imaging as a diagnostic tool and provide insights into temperature measurement interrelationships. HIGHLIGHTS center dot The study highlights infra-red thermal imaging as a non-invasive technique for remotely measuring the core temperature of buffaloes. center dot There is a significant and high correlation (p < 0.001) between rectal temperature (RT) and average eye temperature (AET) in buffaloes, indicating proportional shifts in AET with changes in RT. center dot The relationship between rectal temperature (RT) and average eye temperature (AET) is quantified by the equation RT = 20.377 + 0.465(AET) + 0.024(AT), derived from a regression model with R-2 of 51.6% and absence of autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson = 1.318), where AT represents ambient temperature.

AB  - Incompletely reproductively isolated species often segregate into different microhabitats, even when they are able to survive and reproduce in both habitats. Longer term evolutionary factors may contribute to this lack of cross-habitat persistence. When reproductive interference reduces immigrant fitness, assortative mating, including self-fertilization, increases immigrants' fitness in a single generation, but longer term, inbreeding depression may reduce the chance of population persistence. Two California monkeyflower species repeatedly segregate into drier and wetter areas in their zone of sympatry. To test whether inbreeding depression may contribute to the maintenance of this segregation pattern, we transplanted outbred and successively inbred Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nudatus into their native habitats and heterospecific habitats. We measured germination, survival, and seed set and found that recurrent selfing reduced all aspects of fitness in both species, most strongly in foreign habitats. A simulation model, parameterized from the transplant experiment, found that inbreeding reduced fitness to such an extent that sequentially inbred populations of either species would be unable to persist in heterospecific-occupied habitats in the absence of continued gene flow. These results demonstrate that individual immigrants are unlikely to form persistent populations and thus, inbreeding depression contributes to the absence of fine-scale coexistence in this species pair.

AB  - Context. Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) emission is increasing due to substantial technological progress. The results of previous research provided evidence that ELF-EMF may exert changes in molecular mechanisms that control female reproduction. Aims. We hypothesised that short-term ELF-EMF treatment alters the DNA methylation level of genes in the endometrium. Hence, the research aimed to determine the methylation level of selected genes whose expression was altered in response to ELF-EMF radiation in the endometrium of pigs during the peri-implantation period (days 15-16 of pregnancy). Methods. Porcine endometrial slices (100 +/- 5 mg) were collected during the peri-implantation period and exposed to ELF-EMF at a frequency of 50 Hz for 2 h in vitro. The control endometrium was not exposed to ELF-EMF. The level of DNA methylation in the promoter regions of EGR2, HSD17B2, ID2, IL1RAP, MRAP2, NOS3, PTGER4, SERPINE1, VDR and ZFP57 was tested using qMS-PCR. Key results. In the endometrium exposed to ELF-EMF, the level of methylation of HSD17B2, MRAP2, SERPINE1, VDR and ZFP57 was not altered; the level of methylation of EGR2, ID2 and PTGER4 increased, and the level of methylation of IL1RAP and NOS3 decreased. Conclusions. ELF-EMF may alter the level of DNA methylation in the endometrium during the peri-implantation period. Implications. Changes in the DNA methylation induced by ELF-EMF may affect the transcriptomic profile of the endometrium and disturb physiological processes accompanying implantation and embryo development.

AB  - Specialist phytophagous insects have a narrow hostplant range for optimal development and survival. Mismatches between female oviposition preference and larval performance can lead to high fitness costs. Understanding the mechanistic basis of this decoupling can help us understand evolutionary constraints and aid in predicting outcomes of error-prone oviposition. We investigated the causes for preference-performance mismatches in a specialist native herbivore laying eggs on an invasive toxic plant. Transcriptomic analyses revealed host-plant-specific gene expression signatures in larvae feeding on different plants, while there was no differential gene expression in gustatory/olfactory organs of adult females with different oviposition preferences. However, genomic analysis revealed significant genetic differentiation in several genes underlying signal transduction in adult females with different oviposition preferences. The larvae feeding on toxic plants showed lower expression of specialized detoxification enzymes and higher expression of general digestive enzymes, indicating the inability of larvae to detoxify toxic compounds present in the toxic plants. We additionally found that genes related to successful detoxification and adaptive feeding were enriched in larvae feeding on native plants, while genes related to toxic responses, apoptosis, and accelerated development were enriched in larvae feeding on toxic plants. Our findings dissect the underlying mechanisms behind a preference-performance mismatch, quantifying the impact of error-prone oviposition on larval performance in a specialized species interaction.

AB  - Inoculation with rhizobacteria and feeding by herbivores, two types of abiotic stress, have been shown to increase the production of secondary metabolites in plants as part of the defense response. This study explored the simultaneous effects of inoculation with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03 (a PGPR species) and herbivory by third-instar Spodoptera frugiperda larvae on essential oil (EO) yield and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in Ocimum basilicum plants. The density of glandular trichomes was also examined, given that they are linked to EO production and VOC emission. Herbivory increased EO content, but inoculation on its own did not. When combined, however, the two treatments led to a 10-fold rise in EO content with respect to non-inoculated plants. VOC emissions did not significantly differ between inoculated and non-inoculated plants, but they doubled in plants chewed by the larvae with respect to their undamaged counterparts. Interestingly, no changes were observed in VOC emissions when the treatments were tested together. In short, the two biotic stressors elicited differing plant defense responses, mainly when EO was concerned. PGPR did not stimulate EO production, while herbivory significantly enhanced it and increased VOC emissions. The combined treatment acted synergistically, and in this case, PGPR inoculation may have had a priming effect that amplified plant response to herbivory. Peltate trichome density was higher in inoculated plants, those damaged by larvae, and those subjected to the combination of both treatments. The findings highlight the intricate nature of plant defense mechanisms against various stressors and hint at a potential strategy to produce essential oil through the combined application of the two stressors tested here.

AB  - Magnaporthe oryzae is placed first on a list of the world's top ten plant pathogens with the highest scientific and economic importance. The locus MGG_07173 occurs only once in the genome of M. oryzae and encodes the phosphotransfer protein MoYpd1p, which plays an important role in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway for osmoregulation. Originating from this locus, at least three MoYPD1 isoforms are produced in a signal-specific manner. The transcript levels of these MoYPD1-isoforms were individually affected by external stress. Salt (KCI) stress raised MoYPD1_T0 abundance, whereas osmotic stress by sorbitol elevates MoYPD1_T1 levels. In line with this, signal-specific nuclear translocation of green fluorescent protein-fused MoYpd1p isoforms in response to stress was observed. Mutant strains that produce only one of the MoYpd1p isoforms are less virulent, suggesting a combination thereof is required to invade the host successfully. In summary, we demonstrate signal-specific production of MoYpd1p isoforms that individually increase signal diversity and orchestrate virulence in M. oryzae.

AB  - Context Oocyte vesicles, or vacuoles, have been described using transmission electron microscopy in most species. In sheep and cow oocytes, vesicles constitute up to 30% of the cytoplasm, their volume decreases during maturation and is lower in poorer quality oocytes, suggesting they are important for oocyte competence. However, the composition and function of these organelles is unknown. Aim This study aimed to ascertain the content of oocyte vesicles and examine the effect of different fixation methods on the size and preservation of these organelles. Methods Sheep oocytes were centrifuged to segregate organelles then stained with organelle-specific fluorescent dyes (Nile Red, LysoTracker, Fluo-4-AM and TMRM) and imaged by live cell confocal microscopy. The oocytes were fixed with either glutaraldehyde or paraformaldehyde and prepared for electron microscopy to confirm the distribution of organelles and compare ultrastructure and organelle size. Key results Nile Red staining has identified that vesicles contain lipid that is different to that in the osmium-stained lipid droplets observed by electron microscopy. Lipid droplets and vesicles were significantly smaller when prepared for electron microscopy compared to live cell imaging. Organelles were less likely to be fully segregated following centrifugation in oocytes prior to maturation (20%) compared to oocytes after maturation (77%; P < 0.0001). Conclusions Oocyte vesicles are lipid storing organelles that may be important for oocyte quality. Implications This study highlights the importance of lipid for oocyte quality and the need for further research to identify the optimal fatty acid content for in vitro maturation media and oocyte competence.

AB  - Understanding the natural diet of grazing sheep can help fulfill their nutritional requirements and positively affect the quality of their meat. Emerging fecal DNA (fDNA) metabarcoding technology can provide more accurate estimates for the dietary composition of free-ranging animals. This study has shown that pasture feeding can promote deposition of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Tan lambs' muscle and decrease the ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids (FAs), and thus, we investigated the dietary composition of grazing lambs using fDNA metabarcoding to assess the prevalence of medicinal herbage plants in their diet. Herein, based on the full-time natural pasture grazing and 4-h natural pasture grazing with indoor feeding patterns, the herbage taxa (Bassia scoparia, Euphorbia humifusa, Arnebia euchroma, and Salsola sp.) most correlated to n-3 PUFAs were highlighted to elucidate how diversification in dietary components was associated with the muscle FA profile of lambs. Our findings provide experimental evidence for future feeding research.

AB  - The p53 protein is a transcriptional regulatory factor and many of its functions require that it forms a tetrameric structure. Although the tetramerization domain of mammalian p53 proteins (p53TD) share significant sequence similarities, it was recently shown that the tree shrew p53TD is considerably more thermostable than the human p53TD. To determine whether other mammalian species display differences in this domain, we used biophysical, functional, and structural studies to compare the properties of the p53TDs from six mammalian model organisms (human, tree shrew, guinea pig, Chinese hamster, sheep, and opossum). The results indicate that the p53TD from the opossum and tree shrew are significantly more stable than the human p53TD, and there is a correlation between the thermostability of the p53TDs and their ability to activate transcription. Structural analysis of the tree shrew and opossum p53TDs indicated that amino acid substitutions within two distinct regions of their p53TDs can dramatically alter hydrophobic packing of the tetramer, and in particular substitutions at positions corresponding to F341 and Q354 of the human p53TD. Together, the results suggest that subtle changes in the sequence of the p53TD can dramatically alter the stability, and potentially lead to important changes in the functional activity, of the p53 protein.

AB  - Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus) is a woody shrub with various characteristics that have made it useful in agroforestry systems. Recently, a biomass gasification power plant (BGPP) is engaging in extending calliandra plantations because of calliandra's high heating value. Since the byproduct of BGPP is biochar, widely known for helping CO2 mitigation, this research aims to integrate biochar application into calliandra plantings. Experiments evaluating biochar applications were implemented on a new farm in Indonesia's Kundur Island, yielding calliandra wood for BGPP and fresh leaves for sheep farming. Chicken manure that had been co-composted with biochar was provided as fertilizer. In nursery experiments, the application of 1.1 kg m(-2) biochar provided the greatest qualified seedlings. A field experiment showed that 1 or 1.25 kg m(-2) biochar application yielded the most sizable wood and fresh leaves. The soil covering with biochar increased the yield of wood and fresh leaves, suggesting biochar mulching could be used for subsequent batches of calliandra regeneration. Thus, this study concluded that the application of biochar benefited calliandra nursery planting, field planting, and shoot regeneration. With a stable monthly temperature, the experiment site could have insufficient calliandra growth due to distinct dry and wet seasons. The regression analysis showed a strong correlation (R-2 > 0.878) between wood production and rainfall, suggesting the growth of calliandra could be predicted from rainfall forecasts. Therefore, a calliandra agroforest system with biochar application and sufficient rainfall could enable a sustainable biomass supply for both BGPP and sheep farming.

AB  - Simple Summary Fructooligosaccharides, including inulin, are prebiotics involved in the regulation of bacterial flora, intestinal health, and metabolism in animals. Oligosaccharides and inulin-containing plants are the subject of numerous studies around the world. Inulin is an important oligosaccharide, considered a prebiotic in the diet of humans and animals. In this study, we examined the effect of the supplementation of probiotic bacteria in the diet with inulin or dried Jerusalem artichoke tubers on the performance, pig meat quality, and fatty acid profile of meat and backfat, which provided novel information on the use of these additives in livestock production. An improvement in the antioxidant status of meat and in the water-holding capacity, as well as a reduction in the shear force after the addition of both prebiotics can be mentioned as the pertinent results. However, the meat sensory traits were unchanged by supplementation with the prebiotics and probiotics. This study forms part of the current global work on feed additives that support animals' health and concurrently allow the use of antibiotic treatments to be limited. Therefore, the results of this experiment are of great practical importance and can be proposed for use in pig farming as part of the intensive work which is underway across the EU to reduce the use of antibiotics. In addition, meat with higher quality and a longer shelf life derived from pigs fed with feed containing additives of natural origin are sought by consumers who value healthy and safe food. In this experiment, we investigated the effect of the supplementation of probiotic bacteria in the diet with inulin or dried Jerusalem artichoke tubers on the performance, meat quality, and fatty acid composition in the meat and backfat of fatteners. One hundred and forty-four crossbred pigs (PIC x Penarlan P76) were divided into six groups and fattened from 30 to 114 kg. The meat proximate composition, pH, color, texture, shear force, water-holding capacity, sensory attributes, and thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances were measured. Normal post-mortem meat glycolysis was demonstrated and no meat defects were present. The chemical constituents in muscle tissues were similar, except for intramuscular fat (IMF). The addition of the prebiotics resulted in a higher IMF level, whereas a significantly lower content was found after the probiotic supplementation. Meat from both prebiotic groups was lighter, less red, and more yellow and showed a higher hue angle. The addition of both prebiotics significantly improved the antioxidant status of meat (by approximately 16% and 18%) and the water-holding capacity (less free water and higher M/T ratios), but reduced shear force (by 17%, p <= 0.05) and hardness (by 39% and 35%, respectively, p <= 0.05). The addition of the prebiotics and probiotics had no effect on any of the evaluated sensory attributes.

AB  - The chemical and nutritional characteristics of the four distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) were determined for dry matter (DM), mineral matter (MM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and gross energy analyzed (GEa), from which the values of gross energy (GE), digestible energy (DE), metabolizable energy (ME) and net energy (NE) were estimated. There were differences in the contents of EE, NDF, GEa, GE, DE, ME and NE between the lots. A total of 40 barrows with an initial weight of 72.69 +/- 5.66 kg were assigned to a randomized block design, fed diets containing 0, 100, 200 and 300 g kg(-1) DDGS for 28 days and were subjected to performance assessment. The inclusion of DDGS in the diets did not affect daily feed intake (DFI), daily weight gain (DWG) or feed conversion (FC) but linearly reduced the final weight. Based on the results of the performance and prices of ingredients in the local market, we calculated the costs of feed, revenue and gross operating profit (GOP). Inclusions of DDGS in pig diets reduced costs and revenues but did not affect GOP. DDGS presented chemical and nutritional variation between the lots. Levels of inclusion up to 300 g kg(-1) DDGS do not affect finishing pig performance and profitability.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study aims to explore whether ferulic acid (FA), as an exogenous antioxidant, could improve the quality of goat semen during liquid storage at 17 degrees C. Semen was collected from three black-headed goat bucks and stored at 17 degrees C with different concentrations of FA. The effect of FA on semen quality was evaluated via semen quality detection and antioxidant index analysis. The results showed that adding 50 mu mol/L of FA significantly improved the semen quality from 1 to 5 days. Furthermore, supplementing semen with 50 mu mol/L of FA preserved at 17 degrees C for 3 days had no significant effect on fertility. Overall, adding 50 mu mol/L of FA in dilution improved the quality of goat semen stored at 17 degrees C.
   This study investigated the effect of different concentrations of ferulic acid (FA) on the quality of goat semen preserved at 17 degrees C. First, semen was collected from three black-headed goat bucks using an artificial vagina. Then, the mixed semen was diluted with basal dilutions containing different concentrations of FA (0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mu mol/L) and stored at 17 degrees C. Sperm total motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were measured during semen storage. The results showed that sperm total motility, plasma membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity were significantly improved in the 50 mu mol/L FA group compared with the control group (0 mu mol/L) on days 1-5, and the level of T-AOC significantly increased, while the contents of ROS and MDA significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the goats' conception rate showed that supplementing semen with 50 mu mol/L FA preserved at 17 degrees C for 3 days had no significant effect on fertility. Taken together, our findings suggest that adding 50 mu mol/L FA in dilution at 17 degrees C can improve goat bucks' semen quality.

AB  - Determining when and under what conditions a species is active is essential to understanding its natural history and ecological niche. Estimating daily activity periods traditionally requires substantial field effort, especially for small mammals that are difficult to observe. Camera traps provide exact activity times but can be challenging to apply effectively for small mammals. We used a relatively new approach for camera trap surveys, the Adapted-Hunt Drift Fence Technique (AHDriFT), and for the first time demonstrate its efficacy to determine small mammal activity periods. We set 15 AHDriFT arrays in northern Ohio wet meadows from 10 March to 06 October 2019. We produced high-resolution daily activity periods for 10 small mammal species. We also modeled how temporal, weather, and spatial covariates influenced the activity of the five most frequently observed species. We generally found that small mammals at our study sites were most active from late summer into fall and decreased their activity on days with heavy precipitation. Jumping mice and deer mice were most active in the relatively sparse vegetation of forest-meadow edges, while voles and shrews displayed opposite trends. Five species had more nuanced daily activity periods than their historic descriptions, suggesting that AHDriFT can refine broad activity categorizations. We provide a precise hourly assessment of the daily activity periods for some of the most abundant and widespread North American small mammals.

AB  - Plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that mediate interactions with organisms in the surrounding community, such as herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Understanding on plant attractiveness for insects can help to design intercropping systems, such as trap crops. Here we present the results of laboratory tests designed to compare the attractiveness of cabbage (Brassica oleracea), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica), turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa), and yellow rocket (Barbarea stricta) to Plutella xylostella and its natural enemy, the parasitoid wasp, Diadegma semiclausum. Plants were selected based on the results of a cabbage intercropping field experiment and a screening of VOC emissions of a variety of landrace Brassica plants both intact and damaged by P. xylostella. Plutella xylostella selected turnip and B. stricta over cabbage and broccoli in oviposition tests. Reproductive success of Diadegma semiclausum in oviposition tests was higher on host larvae feeding on turnip plants compared to cabbage and broccoli, while B. stricta was not tested. According to principal component analyses, volatile blends emitted by turnip and B. stricta differed from each other as well as from other plants, while volatile blends emitted by cabbage and broccoli were more similar, both when intact and when damaged by P. xylostella.

AB  - Simple Summary Paratuberculosis is a chronic incurable bacterial infection widespread all over the world in ruminants. The disease impacts animal health and welfare and causes significant economic losses in animal productions. This survey investigated the spread of paratuberculosis in northern Italian dairy goat farming by serological testing. Contextually, a welfare and biosecurity assessment through a standardized protocol was conducted. More than half (19 out of 33, 58%) of the investigated farms were infected, with a mean intra-herd prevalence of 7.4%. Welfare assessment showed quite favorable average results, although in 24% of the farms the welfare level was poor. On the contrary, 58% of the farms showed an unsatisfactory biosecurity level. Our results provide information on the spread of paratuberculosis in dairy goat farms of northern Italy. For this relevant disease, official prevalence data in goat breeding are still scarce. Moreover, the present work highlighted the low level of biosecurity measures implemented by the farmers. Paratuberculosis is a notable infectious disease of ruminants. Goats appear to be particularly susceptible. The survey aimed to investigate the spread of paratuberculosis in Italian goat farming and evaluate whether the presence of the disease could be influenced by welfare and biosecurity deficiencies. A serological survey for paratuberculosis in 33 dairy farms in northern Italy was conducted. Contextually, animal welfare and biosecurity were assessed, using a standardized protocol of 36 welfare indicators and 15 biosecurity indicators which assigns to each farm a welfare and biosecurity score from 0 (any application) to 100% (full application). An overall result of less than 60% was considered insufficient. Nineteen farms (58%) tested positive for paratuberculosis, with a mean intra-herd seroprevalence of 7.4%. Total welfare ranged from 39.56 to 90.7% (mean 68.64%). Biosecurity scores ranged from 10.04 to 90.01% (mean 57.57%). Eight farms (24%) showed poor welfare conditions (welfare score < 60%) and 19 (58%) an unsatisfactory biosecurity condition (biosecurity score < 60%). With respect to the explorative character of the study, an indicative association between seven welfare and biosecurity indicators and paratuberculosis seropositivity was identified. The presence of paratuberculosis in northern Italy dairy goat farms was confirmed. The welfare and biosecurity assessment protocol proved to be an accurate tool, capable of identifying critical points for managing health, welfare and productivity.

AB  - Sea buckthorn, an important ecological and economical tree species, have remarkable drought and salt resistance. The plant-specific transcription factor TCPs play important roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, in sea buckthorn, the molecular mechanism of TCP proteins and their involvement in drought stress are unknown. Here, we found that the expression of HrTCP20 was significantly up-regulated in sea buckthorn under drought stress. Overexpression of HrTCP20 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD), polyphenol oxidase (POD), and chlorophyll (SPAD) content was significantly increased by 1.37 and 1.35 times. However, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content decreased by 0.51 times. Our studies further confirmed that silencing HrTCP20 by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) led to a decrease in the content of defense enzymes, relative water content (RWC), and an increase of relative electrical conductivity (REC). Silencing HrTCP20 also caused the jasmonic acid (JA) content to decrease in the VIGS-treated tree. Interestingly, we found that JA accumulation content and the expression of HrLOX2, an essential enzyme for JA synthesis, was significantly inhibited in HrTCP20-silenced sea buckthorn under drought stress. Yeast two-hybrid analysis also showed that HrTCP20 is directly bound to HrLOX2. Taken together, the HrTCP20 transcription factor was a positive regulator in drought resistance of sea buckthorn. Further, our findings will provide comprehensive insights into the forest tree defence system of drought stress.

AB  - During shearing, animals' welfare is adversely affected and acute stress occurs. Once animal perceives a threat, it develops behavioral, autonomic, endocrine or immune responses to maintain homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of eye temperature assessment by infrared thermography (IRT) to evaluate acute stress response in sheep undergoing a shearing procedure. From each animal, blood sampling, rectal and eye temperature assessment were performed before shearing (T-PRE), 5 (T-POST5) and 60 (T-POST60) minutes after the end of shearing procedure. On blood samples the serum cortisol concentrations were evaluated. Rectal temperature (T-RECTAL) was measured using a digital thermometer. Thermographic acquisitions of eye temperature were performed from the eye total area (T-EYE) and from three regions of interest (lateral canthus, TROI-1; central cornea, TROI-2; medial canthus, TROI-3). One-way analysis of variance showed a significant increase of serum cortisol concentration, T-RECTAL, T-EYE and TROI-3 (p < 0.001). Serum cortisol was positively correlated with TTRECTAL and TROI-3 at T-POST5 and T-POST60. T-RECTAL resulted positively correlated with TROI-3 at TPRE, T-POST5 and T-POST60. Agreement between TRECTAL and each eye temperature considered (TEYE, TROI-1, TROI-2, TROI-3) has been shown by Bland-Altman plots at each time point of monitoring period. The findings obtained in the current survey suggest that the medial canthus is the most suitable region for eye temperature measurement to asses stress response in animals. Moreover, this study highlighted the usefulness of IRT as an immediate and noninvasive physiological measure to assess stress response in sheep.

AB  - The current conflicting neuroimaging findings of insomnia disorder (ID) may be attributed to heterogeneity in ID. The present study aims to clarify the high heterogeneity in ID and examine the objective neurobiological subtypes of ID by using a novel machine learning method based on gray matter volumes (GMVs). We recruited 56 patients with ID and 73 healthy controls (HCs). The T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained for each participant. We investigated whether the ID has higher interindividual heterogeneity in GMVs. Then, we used a heterogeneous machine learning algorithm by discriminative analysis (HYDRA) to identify subtypes of ID with features of brain regional GMVs. We found that patients with ID have higher interindividual variability than HCs. HYDRA identified two distinct and reliable neuroanatomical subtypes of ID. Two subtypes showed significantly different aberrance in GMVs compared with HCs. Specifically, subtype 1 exhibited widespread decreased GMVs in some brain regions, including the right inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left precuneus, right middle cingulate, and right supplementary motor area. Subtype 2 only demonstrated increased GMVs in the right superior temporal gyrus. Additionally, the GMVs of altered brain regions in subtype 1 were significantly correlated with daytime functioning, but in subtype 2, they were significantly correlated with sleep disturbance. These results explain conflicting neuroimaging findings and propose a potential objective neurobiological classification contributing to ID's precise clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Three composts used in this study consisted of uneven percents of bovine, ovine, fowl manures, green waste and olive pomace. In vitro evaluation of four doses of the composts extracts against mycelial growth of Pythium ultimum, Phytopythium mercuriale and Phytophthora citrophthora associated to apple and peach seedlings decline showed their efficacy. The highest mycelial growth inhibition percent was obtained with 10% dose, with more than 73.10%, 64.6% and 32.22% of P. ultimum, P. mercuriale and P. citrophthora mycelial inhibition respectively. For in vivo tests, the three composts T1 T2 and T3 reduced the root browning index of peach plants inoculated with P. citrophthora by 66.67%, 55.67% and 55.67%, respectively and apple plants inoculated with P. mercurial by 74.91%, 62.55% and 74.91%. In the case of P. ultimum, T1 and T2 reduced its severity on peach plants by 87.5% and T1 reduced its severity on apple plants. The three treatments also improved the growth of peach plants inoculated with P. citrophthora and apple plants inoculated with P. mercuriale. T2 compost and its extract improved the root weight of peach plants inoculated with P. ultimum by52.18%. This study also showed a significant correlation between the disease index severity on peach plants and the percentage of olive pomace and the polyphenol content of the composts used. In addition, there is a significant correlation between the root weights of peach seedlings inoculated with P. citrophthora and the percentage of bovine, sheep and poultry manure.

AB  - Plant leaves are utilized by various shelter-building insects. Some insects are constrained in their host plant use by the difficulty in modifying leaves into shelters, while others may cope through different construction methods. Here, we show that the leaf-rolling weevil Phymatapoderus pavens (Coleoptera, Attelabidae) constructs two types of leaf rol & x217c; on Boehmeria silvestrii (Urticaceae) according to the shape of the leaf. Female weevils make leaf rolls using the whole leaf when the leaf is small and weakly lobed, whereas they use only one of the lateral lobes when the leaf is large and deeply lobed. Both types were found within a population and each functioned as a site for the growth of offspring. Weevils bite the leaf veins differently when constructing each of these leaf rolls, suggesting that the leaf roll type is determined before the leaf is rolled. Compared with another leaf-rolling weevil species, Apoderus praecellens (Coleoptera, Attelabidae), which makes leaf rolls on similarly lobed leaves of Isodon umbrosus var. hakusanensis (Lamiaceae), P. pavens utilizes a wider range of leaf shapes because these weevils are able to construct leaf rolls on the lateral lobes of the leaves. Differences in leaf-rolling behaviour, leaf venation pattern, and the relative size of weevils and leaves are factors affecting the results.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Cyclical droughts affecting arid and semiarid regions promote direct negative impacts on agriculture, with deficits of water availability for the maintenance of crops destined for human supply and animal production, with direct and indirect socioeconomic effects. Although livestock rearing is one of the few viable economic activities for these regions, forage production in terms of quantity and quality is a critical obstacle to support the herd over the year. Research was developed to find a forage adapted to these climates. Cactus cladodes have been used as a traditional ingredient in ruminant diets in dry areas as a solution to forage scarcity. Many traditionally used sources of forage, fresh or conserved, can be added to diets with cactus. However, the limiting factor to their inclusion would be market availability and price. This study showed that cactus cladodes associated with sugarcane bagasse (a high available crop residue) present the same nutritive value of conserved crops as silages and hay. Cactus (Opuntia and Nopalea) are essential for ruminant production systems in arid and semiarid regions due to the limitation of forage production caused by the low precipitation.
   This study evaluated the effect of different roughages fed to sheep on nutrient and water intake, ingestive behavior, nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis, fermentation parameters, and methane production using an in vitro gas production system. The treatments consisted of five diets: cactus cladodes Nopalea (NUB) and Opuntia (OUB), both with the addition of sugarcane bagasse (SB) and urea/ammonium sulfate (urea/as); Tifton hay (TH); corn silage (CS); and sorghum silage (SS), also with added urea/as. The NUB provided greater (p <= 0.03) intakes of dry matter (1024 g/d), digestible organic matter (670 g/d), and crude protein (161 g/d) than those on the SS. The NUB provided greater (p < 0.01) dietary water intake (3023 g/d) than TH. The time spent on rumination was shorter (p < 0.01), and the idle time was longer in animals fed NUB and OUB than TH and CS. Microbial protein synthesis was not affected (p = 0.27). The final pH (6.4) of the incubation fluid and the concentration of NH3-N (39.05 mg/dL) were greater for NUB and OUB. Ruminal parameters and methane production were little or not affected by tested forages. We recommend using cactus cladodes in combination with sugarcane bagasse and urea/as in sheep diets.

AB  - The quality of pig sperm is one of the crucial determinants of reproductive ability, and sperm defects can shorten the reproductive life of boars and affect the production of offspring. During transcription and translation, the DAZAP1 gene exerts regulatory control over alternative splicing, thereby exerting influence on vital cellular processes including cell growth, development, and spermatogenesis. In this study, we employed second-and third-generation transcriptome sequencing techniques to isolate and identify the DAZAP1 gene and its transcripts using Banna mini-pig inbred line (BMI) testicular cDNA as a template. We identified three splice variants of the DAZAP1 gene, including ENSSSCT00000023438.4 (DAZAP1_X1), ENSSSCT00000051975.3 (DAZAP1_X2), and ENSSSCT00000074738.2 (DAZAP1_X3). Furthermore, the transcript DAZAP1_X2, was subjected to comprehensive analysis. The DAZAP1_X2 variant comprises 13 exons, with a coding sequence (CDS) length of 1254 bp (417 aa). Subsequently, enrichment analyses based on GO and KEGG pathways revealed that DAZAP1_X2 primarily participated in pathways associated with spermatogenesis, movement of the 9+2 cilium structure, germ cell development, gamete generation, and sexual reproduction. The ceRNA analysis identified three miRNAs interacting with DAZAP1_X2: ssc-miR-107, ssc-miR-127, and ssc-miR-1343, which were primarily linked to spermatogenesis. Both the testis and urethral bulb had significant levels of DAZAP1 expression, according to multi-tissue expression analysis. Subcellular localization indicated that the DAZAP1 was mainly distributed in the cell nucleus. DAZAP1 was critical for sperm formation and was essential for reproductive. These results shed light on the biological roles of DAZAP1 in pigs.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to evaluate, validate and select microbial water quality monitoring tools to establish their suitability and feasibility for use in rural communities. The monitoring of water quality was performed at three different levels: i) basic level focusing on sanitary inspection and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) test; ii) intermediate level via enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens); and iii) advanced level based on qPCR detecting host-associated genetic markers (BacHum, BacCow, Cytb, Pig-2-Bac, and BacCan) and pathogens (Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli). A positive correlation was recorded between sanitary risk and faecal coliforms (r = 0.613 and p < 0.002), E. coli (r = 0.589 and p < 0.003), and Enterococcus spp. (r = 0.625 and p < 0.003). The H2S test showed positive correlations with sanitary risk score (r = 0.623; p < 0.003), faecal coliforms (r = 0.809; p < 0.001), E. coli (r = 0.779; p < 0.001) and Enterococcus spp. (r = 0.799; p < 0.001). Similar correlation patterns were also found with advanced techniques used for detecting host-associated genetic markers, excepted between Clostridium perfringens, and Pig-2-Bac (pig), BacCan (dog), and V. cholerae. The H2S test and sanitary inspections are therefore suitable and cost-effective tools to capacitate rural areas at household level for the monitoring of faecal contamination and management of water sources.

AB  - To examine the utilization of maize stovers (MS) and maize cobs (MC) as replacement of wheat straw (WS) in Total Mixed Ration (TMR) for buffalo calves, 18 calves (aged 14 +/- 2 months weighing 189 +/- 15 kg) were randomly divided into six equal groups. Six TMRs [iso-nutritious with 12% CP and 68% TDN] having crop residues MS, MC and WS each supplemented with 75% and 65% concentrate (C) were formulated as: T1) MS to C ratio of 25:75%, T2) MS to C ratio of 35:65%, T3) MC to C ratio of 25:75%, T4) MC to C ratio of 35:65%, T5) WS to C ratio of 25:75% and T6) WS to C ratio of 35:65%. These TMRs were offered ad libitum along-with 5 kg green fodder to each calf for 100 days. Daily feed intake, body weight gain and nutrient digestibility during last 5-days were recorded of individual animals. The calves fed TMR with 25% MC attained significantly higher weight gain (830 g/d, P<0.05), followed by the calves fed TMR with 35% MC (760 g/d) whereas, those fed TMR with 35% MS got lowest weight gain (687 g/d). Similarly, better feed conversion ratio (6.63) was observed in calves fed 25% MC based TMR while poor (7.90) FCR was observed in TMR with 35% WS. Intake of calves for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF), among all the groups was similar, however, except ADF, digestibility of DM, CP and NDF was significantly (P<0.05) higher in calves fed TMR with 25% MC and lower in those fed 35% WS based TMR. Cost of feed per kg gain was lowest (Rs 128) in calves fed TMR with 35% MC and it was highest (Rs. 167) in both TMRs with 25% WS and 35% WS, respectively. In conclusion, TMR with 35% MC is better in terms of feed cost per kg gain in buffalo calves compared to other rations used in this study.

AB  - Beneficial soil microbes have long been recognized for their ability to improve plant growth, to antagonize pathogens and to prime plants against biotic stressors. Nevertheless, their ability to enhance plant resistance against arthropod pests remains largely unexplored, especially in crop plants such as pepper. Herein, we assessed the effects of several fungal and bacterial species/strains applied in the soil on the performance of key pests of pepper plants. Specifically, we recorded the impact of pepper inoculation with commercial strains of beneficial bacteria (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Pseudomonas spp.) as well as fungi (Trichoderma spp. and Cordyceps fumosorosea) on the population growth of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we recorded the effects of microbial inoculation on plant growth parameters, such as stem and root weight. We found that both pests can be negatively affected by microbial inoculation: spider mites laid up to 40% fewer eggs, and the number of aphids were up to 50% less on pepper-inoculated plants, depending on the microbe. We also recorded a variation among the tested microbes in their impact on herbivore performance, but no significant effects were found on plant biomass. Our results add to the growing literature that beneficial soil microbes may be capable of exerting biocontrol capabilities against aboveground herbivorous pests possibly, among other means, via the elicitation of plant defense responses.

AB  - Dietary generalist herbivorous insects are widespread and often occur in a variety of environments. Across their geographic range, herbivorous insects may encounter variable plant traits as they feed on high-quality or low-quality plants. Herbivorous insect larvae experience both bottom-up (host plant) and top-down (parasitoid) factors that affect survival. Host plant quality may affect larval growth and survival in that larvae feeding on low-quality plants often suffer reduced fitness. However, herbivores on different host plants are also subject to different levels of parasitism. High-quality plants confer stronger larval performance (higher survival, more offspring), but larvae may also face higher parasitism. In some herbivore species, diet mediates larval immune response. The generalist insect herbivore fall webworm (FW), Hyphantria cunea Drury (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a moth native to North America, and its larvae have considerable variance in their performance when reared on different host plants. We investigated whether diet affects the immune response in FW larvae when they are reared on different host plant species known to vary in food quality. We measured immune response by melanization of a nylon filament. We found significant differences in immune response across host plants, indicating that diet mediates immune response in FW larvae. Our study helps elucidate the factors that cause variation in immune response in a generalist herbivore.

AB  - Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds vast potential in agriculture. However, its applications are still limited by its low efficiency. Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) was identified as an epigenetic barrier for this. Histone demethylase KDM4D could regulate the level of H3K9me3. However, its effects on buffalo SCNT embryos are still unclear. Thus, we performed this study to explore the effects and underlying mechanism of KDM4D on buffalo SCNT embryos. The results revealed that compared with the IVF embryos, the expression level of KDM4D in SCNT embryos was significantly lower at 8- and 16-cell stage, while the level of H3K9me3 in SCNT embryos was significantly higher at 2-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst stage. Microinjection of KDM4D mRNA could promote the developmental ability of buffalo SCNT embryos. Furthermore, the expression level of ZGA-related genes such as ZSCAN5B, SNAI1, eIF-3a, and TRC at the 8-cell stage was significantly increased. Meanwhile, the pluripotency-related genes like POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG were also significantly promoted at the blastocyst stage. The results were reversed after KDM4D was inhibited. Altogether, these results revealed that KDM4D could correct the H3K9me3 level, increase the expression level of ZGA and pluripotency-related genes, and finally, promote the developmental competence of buffalo SCNT embryos.

AB  - Current measures mainly focus on how melatonin reduces physiological heat stress in animals, but its effects on reproductive damage to male dairy goats have been neglected. This study aimed to determine the protective effect of melatonin on male reproduction during heat stress in dairy goats and to further explore its mechanisms. A natural heat stress model of Saanen dairy goats was used to assess testicular tissue damage 7 days after heat stress and to examine semen quality changes during a spermatogenic cycle. RNA-seq, Western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence staining were used to explore the mechanism by which melatonin protects against heat stress-induced reproductive damage and to validate the results. The data suggested that melatonin significantly alleviated the heat stress-induced decrease in sperm quality, protected varicose tubule structure, reduced the levels of heat shock proteins and apoptotic proteins and protected the spermatocytes and round spermatozoa, which are mainly affected by heat stress. RNA-seq results suggest that melatonin inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reduces the level of p-AKT, and promotes elevated BCL-2. In addition, melatonin treatment could upregulate the gene expression of MT2 which was downregulated by heat stress and improve the change in extracellular matrix components and restore serum testosterone levels. Our results suggest that melatonin can protect against testicular and spermatogenic cell damage and improve semen quality in male dairy goats under heat stress. This study provides an important reference for subsequent studies on the molecular mechanisms of melatonin in protecting male reproductive processes under heat stress and using exogenous melatonin to prevent heat stress.

AB  - During adolescence, acute stress can modify neuronal excitability in various brain regions, leading to negative behavioral outcomes. However, the impact of chronic stress during adolescence on neuronal responses to acute stimuli remains unclear. To address this, we subjected adolescent mice to 12 days of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Anxiety and depressive behaviors were evaluated, along with changes in c-Fos expression, which is one of the most widely used markers of neuronal activation. By comparing c-Fos immunoreactivity between the CUS and control groups both before and after the tail suspension test (TST), we found that adolescent CUS induced depressive behaviors in male mice, but not in female mice. Adolescent CUS primarily affected the excitability of neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL), the dorsomedial and dorsolateral area of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the ventral hippocampus CA3. TST exerted a significant main effect on the density of cFos+ neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL), infralimbic cortex (IL), cingulate areas 1 and 2 (Cg1, Cg2), the lateral septum (LS), BNST, and lateral habenular (LHb). Furthermore, the excitability of neurons in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) was impacted by sex. These data suggest that adolescent CUS elicits region- and sexspecific modifications in TST-induced c-Fos expression, establishing a theoretical basis for understanding the pathophysiological alterations in mood disorders following adolescent stress.

AB  - Simple Summary: Coagulase-negative staphylococci are main pathogens that produce goat mastitis. Marbofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone approved to treat mastitis in animals. Since the efficacy of an antimicrobial is related with its concentration in the site of infection, and the latter depends of dose and biological processes that determine the distribution of the antimicrobial in different tissues and secretions, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a dose regimen of marbofloxacin (10 mg/kg/24 h) administered intramuscularly for five days in goats with mastitis induced by coagulase-negative staphylococci, by an evaluation of the concentrations of marbofloxacin achieved in blood and milk over time (called pharmacokinetics), and characterizing the concentration-effect relationship of marbofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci in Mueller Hinton broth and goat milk, by time kill assays, in order to determine the concentrations of marbofloxacin related with an adequate bacterial count reduction (measured by efficacy index AUC/MIC). The proposed dose regimen was adequate for the treatment of goat mastitis produced by coagulase-negative staphylococci, resulting in a microbiological and clinical cure of all animals. The animal model used in this study provided important pharmacokinetic information about the effect of the infection on the pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin. Pharmacodynamic modeling showed that marbofloxacin concentrations needed for antimicrobial efficacy were higher in goat milk compared with Mueller Hinton broth. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a serious problem, since marbofloxacin is considered a critically important antimicrobial, and its rational and prudent use could extend its utility over time.Coagulase-negative staphylococci are main pathogens that produce goat mastitis. Marbofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone approved for treat mastitis in animals. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin (10 mg/kg/24 h) in serum and milk administered intramuscularly for five days in goats with mastitis induced by coagulase-negative staphylococci; (ii) to characterize the concentration-effect relationship of marbofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci in Mueller Hinton broth and goat milk; (iii) to determine AUC/MIC cutoff values of marbofloxacin, and (iv) to perform a PK/PD analysis to evaluate the efficacy of the dose regimen for the treatment of goat mastitis produced by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Marbofloxacin presented context-sensitive pharmacokinetics, influenced by the evolution of the disease, which decreased marbofloxacin disposition in serum and milk. Marbofloxacin showed a median (95% CI) fAUC/MIC values for MIC of 0.4 and 0.8 mu g/mL of 26.66 (22.26-36.64) and 32.28 (26.57-48.35) related with -2 log(10)CFU/mL reduction; and 32.26 (24.81-81.50) and 41.39 (29.38-128.01) for -3 log(10)CFU/mL reduction in Mueller Hinton broth. For milk, -2 log(10)CFU/mL reduction was achieved with 41.48 (35.29-58.73) and 51.91 (39.09-131.63), and -3 log(10)CFU/mL reduction with 51.04 (41.6-82.1) and 65.65 (46.68-210.16). The proposed dose regimen was adequate for the treatment of goat mastitis produced by coagulase-negative staphylococci, resulting in microbiological and clinical cure of all animals.& nbsp;The animal model used in this study provided important pharmacokinetic information about the effect of the infection on the pharmacokinetics of marbofloxacin.
   Pharmacodynamic modeling showed that fAUC/MIC cutoff values were higher in goat milk compared with Mueller Hinton broth.

AB  - Animals have evolved a variety of mechanisms to detect and avoid predation. The non-vocal sounds produced by some bird species during takeoff flights have been considered to function as an alarm call, because they may convey information about predation risk. Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of the non-vocal sound (wing trills) produced by the scaled dove (Columbina squammata) on antipredation behaviours of conspecifics. We evaluated the individual response to playbacks of the wing trill stimulus and compared it to the response to other two control stimuli (vocalizations of the scaled dove and the southern house wren). We found that doves' probability to become vigilant or to display freezing behaviour was higher after a wing trills stimulus in comparison to the other playback stimuli. These results suggest that wing trill production in scaled doves communicate potential risks and are considered by the individuals in the decision-making process, but we cannot rule out the possibility that any takeoff flight sound might also promote antipredator responses.

AB  - Fear of human can impact negatively offspring's behaviour and cognition whereas early positive handling has positive impacts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the crossed effects of trans-generational transfer and familiarisation with human on piglets' behaviour. Sows were classified into two categories (Fearful, n = 11 and Docile, n = 13) based on whether they avoided human contact or not during a human approach test at 71 days of gestation. Fear of human was not related to salivary cortisol levels of the sows (F =2.72, P = 0.10). Fearful sows' piglets stood immobilized longer (Chisq= 6.24, P = 0.01), as well females (8.70, P = 0.003) during a tonic immobility test (TIT) at 7 days but not at 15 days. The behaviour of two male and two female piglets per sow (n = 96) was studied after weaning (28 days). We found no effect of sow's reaction to human on piglets' emotionality expressed during an open-field test (OFT) at 32-33 days. However, during a Human voluntary approach test (VHAT) piglets born from fearful sows were more fearful than piglets born from docile sows (Chisq=8.23, P = 0.004,). Half of the piglets (n = 48, 1 male and 1 female per sow) were then familiarised with human while the others received minimum contact. We found no main or crossed effect of sow's reaction to human and piglet's treatment on piglets' emotionality during an OFT, nor on their exploratory behaviour during VHAT at 46-47 days. Piglets' born from fearful sows were less attracted to human during VHAT2 (Chisq=8.33, P = 0.004) and familiarised piglets were more attracted (Chisq=15.05, P < 0.001). Piglets born from docile sows found the reward faster in a spatial maze test than those born from fearful sows. Both sows HAR and piglet familiarisation with human seemed to specifically affect human related behaviours without affecting their general emotionality, but also behaviour in a spatial maze test.

AB  - The provision of enrichment material has been widely recommended to mitigate stress and minimise aggressive behaviour as well as enhance the welfare of pigs after transport and regrouping. In this study, we assessed the effects of providing a polyester sling belt (SB) on behaviour, number of skin lesions, and salivary cortisol levels in growing pigs shortly after transport and regrouping. A total of 571 pigs (29.6 +/- 2.4 kg) were allocated to one of the following three treatment groups: 1) C: control group, 2) SB5: provision of 5-6 SB per pen, and 3) SB10: provision of 10-12 SB per pen. After being transported for 2 h, the pigs were housed in pens having fully slatted floors and regrouped with unfamiliar pigs. Their behaviours after regrouping were observed via 24-h video recording. Body weight and number of skin lesions were assessed on days 0 (the day of transport and regrouping) and day 6. Saliva samples were collected from nine pigs per treatment on days 1 and 2. The SB10 group exhibited significantly lower levels of injurious interaction than did the C group (P < 0.05). This injurious interaction tended to have positive correlations with the salivary cortisol levels on day 2 (r = 0.64, P = 0.06) and the changes in the proportion of pigs with skin lesion score (1+2) from day 0-6 (r = 0.66, P = 0.05). Furthermore, it was positively correlated with the proportion of pigs with skin lesion score (1+2) on day 6 (r = 0.80, P = 0.01). Additionally, manipulation behaviour towards the SB showed a negative correlation with skin lesions on day 6 (r = -0.70, P < 0.05) and also displayed a negative tendency to be correlated with salivary cortisol levels on day 2 (r = -0.64, P = 0.06). During the study period, the SB10 group exhibited the greatest reduction in the proportion of pigs with skin lesions than did the other groups (P < 0.05). Salivary cortisol levels did not differ significantly among the treatment groups on day 1; nevertheless, the lowest level was observed in the SB10 group on day 2 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, providing SB to growing pigs housed in pens with slatted flooring shortly after transportation and regrouping can improve their health and welfare by reducing injurious behaviour, skin lesions and activity in the HPA-axis suggesting stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effects of different seasons on the cryopreservation success of buffalo sperm in terms of kinematics and sperm functional parameters. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of three seasons (winter, comfort and summer) and cryopreservation on sperm kinematics and functional properties in buffalo bulls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen ejaculates (n = 90) collected during three seasons i.e. winter (n = 30), comfort (n = 30), summer (n = 30) were evaluated for sperm kinematics and functional properties. RESULTS: Sperm kinematics with respect to total (TM), progressive (PM) and rapid motility (RM) was higher (P<0.05) in fresh sperm compared to sperm that had been frozen-thawed. Similarly, all kinematic parameters [viz. frequency (BCF), lateral head displacement (ALH), linearity (LIN) and straightness (STR)] were higher (P<0.01) at the fresh stage. With respect to season, frozen-thawed semen TM (57.67 +/- 115 %), PM (50.2 +/- 1.15 %) and RM (51.6 +/- 1.19 %) were higher (P<0.01) when using sperm collected during winter. The stage of cryopreservation (i.e., equilibration and freeze-thawing) also showed significant effects (P<0.01) on mitochondrial superoxide positive status (MSPS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), acrosome status and intra-cellular calcium status. CONCLUSION: The season of sperm collection and cryopreservation have significant effects on buffalo bull sperm kinematics and functional properties.

AB  - The Alboran platform, located in the Alboran Sea, is an area of high productivity due to the mixture of the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, which produce an almost permanent upwelling in the region. It has been considered one of the main biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean Sea. Previous taxonomic studies on bryozoans carried out around the Alboran platform mentioned a total of 127 species collected at depths between 28 and 480 m. Here we report on four INDEMAREs (Inventario y designacion de la Red Natura 2000 en areas marinas del Estado espanol) samples collected in 2011 and 2012 at depths between 95 and 120 m from a biogenic gravel bottom (i.e. small rocks and shells). Sixty-eight taxa belonging to 52 genera and 34 families were identified. Two species are proposed as new (Escharella similis n. sp. and Hemicyclopora admirabilis n. sp.), eight taxa were identified only to genus level although two of them (Chorizopora sp., Hippothoa sp.) are likely to be undescribed species, and one taxon only at family level. Among the species identified, 30 are new records for the Alboran platform, 13 are new records for the Alboran Sea, and Microporella funbio is recorded for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. These results covered only a small part of the material sampled (4 out of 44 samples), which suggests that the number of bryozoan species in the Alboran platform is even higher, and also shows the importance of this area for "bryodiversity".

AB  - Background Early embryonic mortality is one of the major intriguing factors of reproductive failure that causes considerable challenge to the mammalian cell biologists. Heat stress is the major factor responsible for reduced fertility in farm animals. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of heat stress on prostaglandin production and the expression of key genes, including COX-2, PGES, PGFS, ITGAV and LGALS15, in buffalo endometrial epithelial cells. Methods and results Buffalo genitalia containing ovaries with corpus luteum (CL) were collected immediately post-slaughter. The stages of the estrous cycle were determined based on macroscopic observations of the ovaries. Uterine lumens of the mid-luteal phase (days 6-10 of the estrous cycle) were washed and treated with trypsin to isolate epithelial cells, which were then cultured at control temperature (38.5 degree celsius for 24 h) or exposed to elevated temperatures [38.5 degree celsius for 6 h, 40.5 degree celsius for 18 h; Heat Stressed (HS)]. The supernatant and endometrial epithelial cells were collected at various time points (0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) from both the control and treatment groups. Although heat stress (40.5 degree celsius) significantly (P < 0.05) increased COX-2, PGES, and PGFS transcripts in epithelial cells but it did not affect the in vitro production of PGF(2 alpha) and PGE2. The expression of ITGAV and LGALS15 mRNAs in endometrial epithelial cells remained unaltered under elevated temperature conditions. Conclusion It can be concluded that elevated temperature did not directly modulate prostaglandin production but, it promoted the expression of COX-2, PGES and PGFS mRNA in buffalo endometrial epithelial cells.

AB  - Insects frequently confront different microbial assemblages. Bacteria inhabiting an insect gut are often commensal, but some can become pathogenic when the insect is compromised from different stressors. Herbivores are often confronted by various forms of plant resistance, but how defenses generate opportunistic microbial infections from residents in the gut are not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenic tendencies of Serratia isolated from the digestive system of healthy fall armyworm larvae (Spodopterafrugiperda) and how it interfaces with plant defenses. We initially selected Serratia strains that varied in their direct expression of virulence factors. Inoculation of the different isolates into the fall armyworm body cavity indicated differing levels of pathogenicity, with some strains exhibiting no effects while others causing mortality 24 h after injection. Oral inoculations of pathogens on larvae provided artificial diets caused marginal (< 7%) mortality. However, when insects were provided different maize genotypes, mortality from Serratia increased and was higher on plants exhibiting elevated levels of herbivore resistance (< 50% mortality). Maize defenses facilitated an initial invasion of pathogenic Serratia into the larval hemocoel, which was capable of overcoming insect antimicrobial defenses. Tomato and soybean further indicated elevated mortality due to Serratia compared to artificial diets and differences between plant genotypes. Our results indicate plants can facilitate the incipient emergence of pathobionts within gut of fall armyworm. The ability of resident gut bacteria to switch from a commensal to pathogenic lifestyle has significant ramifications for the host and is likely a broader phenomenon in multitrophic interactions facilitated by plant defenses.

AB  - Strain degeneration has been defined as a decrease or loss in the yield of important commercial traits resulting from subsequent culture, which ultimately leads to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. Pleurotus ostreatus is a lignin-producing nematophagous edible mushroom. Mycelia for mushroom production are usually maintained in subsequent culture in solid media and frequently show symptoms of strain degeneration. The dikaryotic strain P. ostreatus (DkN001) has been used in our lab as a model organism for different purposes. Hence, different tools have been developed to uncover genetic and molecular aspects of this fungus. In this work, strain degeneration was studied in a full-sib monokaryotic progeny of the DkN001 strain with fast (F) and slow (S) growth rates by using different experimental approaches (light microscopy, malondialdehyde levels, whole-genome transcriptome analysis, and chitosan effect on monokaryotic mycelia). The results obtained showed that: (i) strain degeneration in P. ostreatus is linked to oxidative stress, (ii) the oxidative stress response in monokaryons is genotype dependent, (iii) stress and detoxifying genes are highly expressed in S monokaryons with symptoms of strain degeneration, (iv) chitosan addition to F and S monokaryons uncovered the constitutive expression of both oxidative stress and cellular detoxifying genes in S monokaryon strains which suggest their adaptation to oxidative stress, and (v) the overexpression of the cell wall genes, Uap1 and Cda1, in S monokaryons with strain degeneration phenotype indicates cell wall reshaping and the activation of High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) and Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathways. These results could constitute a hallmark for mushroom producers to distinguish strain degeneration in commercial mushrooms.

AB  - With 52 species, bats make up almost a quarter of all the mammal species in Nepal, and yet remains the least understudied group of mammals. Owing to its diverse geography and climate, more species of bats potentially occur in the country, and acoustic surveys could improve the knowledge of their ecology. So, a study was conducted in Sailung and Melung Rural Municipalities of Dolakha district of Nepal, with the objectives of assessing bat species richness and preparing digital records of their echolocation calls. Using mist-netting and roost survey during three periods in 2018 (late March, late May to early June and mid-November), 10 species of bats were recorded: Cynopterus sphinx, Lyroderma lyra, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus luctus, Rhinolophus pearsonii, Rhinolophus sinicus, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis formosus, Myotis sp. and Nyctalus noctula. Ten roosts (mostly caves) were located. Echolocation calls of six of these species were documented, including signals of three species described for the first time in Nepal. This study also reports the fifth record of Myotis formosus in Nepal and new locality record of the species after two decades. The echolocation calls documented hereafter may serve as a reference for species identification for non-invasive studies of bats.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) serve as powerful defense mechanisms that help plants mitigate pest-induced stress. Geraniol is a HIPV released by tea leaves in response to damage inflicted by tea green leafhoppers. In order to investigate whether the release of geraniol is a defensive mechanism of tea plants against infestation by tea green leafhoppers, our study explored the effects of geraniol on tea green leafhoppers, including the selectivity of tea green leafhoppers' response to geraniol, survival and reproductive parameters, as well as alterations in endophytes and the transcriptome. The findings indicated that while geraniol did not exhibit strong repellent or lethal effects on tea green leafhoppers, it significantly reduced the egg-laying and hatching rates. Through 16S rRNA microbial sequencing, we found that geraniol treatment significantly altered the composition of endophytic microbial communities in tea green leafhoppers, potentially affecting their metabolic functions. Transcriptome analysis further showed that genes associated with energy metabolism, such as glutamate dehydrogenase, were significantly upregulated in response to geraniol, suggesting that tea green leafhoppers may enhance energy metabolism to counteract geraniol-induced stress. Additionally, the downregulation of antimicrobial peptide-related signaling pathways suggests that geraniol may weaken the immune capacity of tea green leafhoppers, potentially reducing their resistance to pathogens. These findings indicate that the strategic application of geraniol could be a promising approach to controlling tea green leafhopper populations. This study enhances our understanding of the insect-resistant mechanisms of HIPVs and provides new insights into environmentally sustainable pest management strategies for tea plantations.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of linseed oil (LO) supplementation on conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) biosynthesis in lactating Saanen goats. Goats (DIM = 96 +/- 14 days) were divided into control (n = 6) and LO treatment (n = 6) groups. LO supplementation was implemented in both short- and long-term experimental settings. Short-term LO supplementation significantly increased trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA in milk fat without affecting lactation performance. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we identified six upregulated proteins in milk somatic cells, including translocon-associated protein (SSRD), succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCB2), ATP synthase subunit (ATPD), stress-70 protein (GRP75), NADH dehydrogenase (NDUFS2), and cytochrome complex QCR1. Long-term LO supplementation enhanced milk fat content and cis-9,trans-11 CLA levels, while significantly elevating the mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and all previously identified proteins-including proteasome 20s subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5). These findings extend beyond the known SCD pathway, revealing novel protein markers and potential mechanisms associated with CLA biosynthesis in mammary tissue and milk somatic cells.

AB  - The role of dietary forage neutral detergent fiber in maintaining rumenfunction is critical for ruminants, yet it remains unclear what an optimal proportion offorage neutral detergent fiber that is suitable for sheep is in the pelleted total mixed rationfeeding model. This investigation aimed to explore the influence of dietary forage neutraldetergent fiber on ruminal pH, fermentation characteristics, chewing activity, nutrientdigestibility, and the ruminal bacterial community of Hu sheep fed a pelleted total mixedration. The results showed that increasing dietary forage neutral detergent fiber contentshifted the rumen fermentation pattern towards acetate production, reduced lactate con-centration in the rumen, and stimulated both chewing and ruminating, thereby mitigatingthe severity of subacute rumen acidosis in sheep. Additionally, increasing dietary forageneutral detergent fiber content increased the proliferation of cellulolytic bacteria in therumen, and it promoted fiber utilization. A ratio of forage neutral detergent fiber (12.48%)to rumen-degradable starch (15.57%) with 0.8 was found to be optimal for maintainingstable ruminal function As the key components of dietary carbohydrates, ensuring a balance between forage-neutral detergent fiber (FNDF) and rumen-degradable starch (RDS) is essential for ruminant health. Eight male Hu sheep equipped with rumen cannulas were randomly divided into four groups based on dietary FNDF content: low FNDF (L-FNDF, 6.08%), middle low FNDF (ML-FNDF, 9.47%), middle high FNDF (MH-FNDF, 12.48%), and high FNDF (H-FNDF, 15.68%), while the RDS levels (15.65% of DM on average) were similar among the four groups. A replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design was employed in this study. The results indicated that mean and minimum ruminal pH increased linearly with increasing dietary FNDF content, while the duration and area of pH under 5.8 and 5.6, along with the acidosis index, reduced linearly (p <= 0.002). There were no differences between the MH-FNDF group and the H-FNDF group in these indicators (p > 0.05). The molar proportions of acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate, as well as the acetate-to-propionate ratio, increased linearly, while propionate and valerate molar proportions and lactate concentration displayed a linear decrease with increasing FNDF content in the diet (p < 0.001). Increasing dietary FNDF content extended ruminating and chewing time while enhancing ruminal microbial diversity, promoting the proliferation of Fibrobacterota and Butyrivibrio in the rumen, and improving fiber degradability (p < 0.05). When the dietary FNDF content exceeded 12.48%, no effects of FNDF on acetate to propionate ratio and fiber utilization were observed (p > 0.05). The results suggest that augmenting FNDF content in the PTMR can reshape ruminal fermentation towards acetate production and promote rumination to enhance ruminal pH, thereby alleviating the risk of ruminal acidosis. When the RDS content in the PTMR was 15.57%, an FNDF content of 12.48% was optimal for maintaining stable ruminal function in sheep, and the recommended ratio of FNDF to RDS was 0.8.

AB  - The Arabian ostrich (Struthio camelus syriacus) was an integral element in the wildlife of the Middle East until its extinction in the mid-20th century. Here we discuss the historic and archaeological record that provides baseline information on the past distribution of ostriches in the Negev Desert (Israel). Specifically, we focus on survey data of ancient petroglyph depictions of ostriches and examine their spatial distribution. Through the application of models of optimal habitat reconstruction using data on the houbara bustard as a proxy species for the ostrich, correlated with the spatial distribution of the ostrich petroglyphs and ecological data on the region, we identified the optimal areas that the Syrian ostrich could have inhabited in the past. Finally, we applied our model to examine reintroduction programs of a closely related ostrich subspecies, S. c. camelus, that have been carried out in the Negev to date.

AB  - Background Kangaroo rats are small mammals that are among the most abundant vertebrates in many terrestrial ecosystems in Western North America and are considered both keystone species and ecosystem engineers, providing numerous linkages between other species as both consumers and resources. However, there are challenges to studying the behavior and activity of these species due to the difficulty of observing large numbers of individuals that are small, secretive, and nocturnal. Our goal was to develop an integrated approach of miniaturized animal-borne accelerometry and radiotelemetry to classify the cryptic behavior and activity cycles of kangaroo rats and test hypotheses of how their behavior is influenced by light cycles, moonlight, and weather.Methods We provide a proof-of-concept approach to effectively quantify behavioral patterns of small bodied (< 50 g), nocturnal, and terrestrial free-ranging mammals using large acceleration datasets by combining low-mass, miniaturized animal-borne accelerometers with radiotelemetry and advanced machine learning techniques. We developed a method of attachment and retrieval for deploying accelerometers, a non-disruptive method of gathering observational validation datasets for acceleration data on free-ranging nocturnal small mammals, and used these techniques on Merriam's kangaroo rats to analyze how behavioral patterns relate to abiotic factors.Results We found that Merriam's kangaroo rats are only active during the nighttime phases of the diel cycle and are particularly active during later light phases of the night (i.e., late night, morning twilight, and dawn). We found no reduction in activity or foraging associated with moonlight, indicating that kangaroo rats are actually more lunarphilic than lunarphobic. We also found that kangaroo rats increased foraging effort on more humid nights, most likely as a mechanism to avoid cutaneous water loss.Conclusions Small mammals are often integral to ecosystem functionality, as many of these species are highly abundant ecosystem engineers driving linkages in energy flow and nutrient transfer across trophic levels. Our work represents the first continuous detailed quantitative description of fine-scale behavioral activity budgets in kangaroo rats, and lays out a general framework for how to use miniaturized biologging devices on small and nocturnal mammals to examine behavioral responses to environmental factors.

AB  - In the pursuit of solving the energy storage issues of leadless pacemakers, this study presents a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) for self-powering. The mismatch in natural frequencies between the cardiac cycles and the piezoelectric structure affects energy generation. In this research, a groundbreaking hexa-fold PEH (HF-PEH) with contact impacts was proposed to generate high energy density from cardiac cycles. The HF-PEH was manufactured and tested in vivo inside a living pig's heart. Subsequently, we subjected this HF-PEH prototype to laboratory cardiac acceleration for over 35 million cardiac cycles to investigate its long-term performance. Post-test material analysis using SEM and x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the material structure. The HF-PEH generated maximum voltage, current, and power of 1.4 V, 458.5 mu A, and 367.2 mu W at in-vivo animal trial with 71 beats per minute, which are the same or higher than the values a leadless pacemaker paces into the body. Post-test material analyses showed that the piezoelectric ceramic remained intact while the electrode condition changed. A verified finite element model was used to study the long-term electrode layer erosion condition with respect to the electric displacement field. Since the electrode erosion is limited to the contact-based impact region, limited power degradation in long-term performance was observed. This study also highlights the roles of electrode materials and presents potential protective methods and materials to mitigate electrode performance degradation. Our findings pave the way for practical energy harvesting applications for leadless pacemakers and underscore the need for advanced piezoelectric coatings in contact-based energy harvesting systems.

AB  - Cartilage tissue engineering is a promising strategy to repair damaged tissue and reconstruct organ function, but the scaffold-free cartilage regeneration technology is currently limited in its ability to construct three-dimensional (3D) shapes, maintain the chondrogenic phenotype, and express cartilage-specific extracellular matrix (ECM). Recently, cartilaginous organoids (COs), multicellular aggregates with spheroid architecture, have shown great potential in miniaturized cartilage developmental models in vitro. However, high-efficiency and transferable in vivo organoid-based 3D cartilage regeneration technology for preclinical research needs further exploration. In this study, we develop novel cartilaginous organoids bioassembly (COBA) strategy to achieve scaffold-free 3D cartilage regeneration, which displays batch-to-batch efficiency, structural integration, and functional reconstruction. For underlying molecule mechanism, cellular adhesion proteins significantly regulate cell aggregation and cytoskeleton reorganization to form cartilaginous spheroids, and the hypoxic microenvironment created by high-density cell aggregates synergistically activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha-mediated glycolytic metabolism reprogramming to maintain the chondrogenic phenotype and promote cartilage-specific ECM deposition. Furthermore, separated COs can integrate into a complete and continuous cartilage tissue through the COBA approach, and thus facilitate raising the nasal dorsa in goats after minimally invasive injection. This study thus demonstrates the promise of COBA technology to achieve scaffold-free 3D cartilage regeneration for organoid-based translational applications.

AB  - The Gaoligong Mountains, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and provides a refugium for many endangered endemic animals. In this study, we reported a population genetic study on black snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus strykeri), a critically endangered primate endemic to the Gaoligong Mountains, yet their large-scale population genetic study remains underexplored. Here, we performed population genetic analyses from two geographical populations (Pianma and Luoma) based on targeted genomic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (37.7 K) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (842 bp). Both nuclear SNP data and mtDNA revealed relatively low levels of genetic variation in both populations compared to other reported primates, which is most likely to be explained by loss of historical genetic diversity due to inbreeding and long-term small effective population size, thus potentially aggravating the effects of inbreeding and genetic depression. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses for mtDNA revealed two deep lineages (approximately 0.69 million years ago), but limited genetic differentiation in nuclear data, which might have been caused by the Late Cenozoic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and glacial refuge, and subsequent secondary contact as a result of historically high and bidirectional gene flow between populations. Ecological niche modeling and landscape connectivity analyses also showed historical and recent connectivity between two geographical populations. The demographic history inferred from both mtDNA and nuclear data revealed at least two continuous declines in the effective population size occurring around 43 Kya and 8-10 Kya, respectively, probably due to Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent human activities. Our results provide the first detailed and comprehensive genetic insights into the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of a critically endangered species, and provide essential baseline information to guide conservation efforts.

AB  - Containment cages are one of the main causes of chronic stress and reduced welfare during swine pro-duction as well as in hot environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate behavioral changes and physiological parameters in the presence or absence of cages in farrowing facilities and to determine the benefits of cage removal on the welfare of pigs during summer in a tropical climate. Twenty-six sows and 290 piglets were divided into two groups: individual open stalls and cage stalls, from birth to weaning at 21 days of age. To obtain behavioral data, the animals were evaluated every 10 minutes, for 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon, three non-consecutive times a week, for 21 days for each sow and litter. Rectal, dorsal, and ventral surface temperatures, as well as the respiration rate, were obtained three non-consecutive times per week from all sows and a sample of piglets in the morning and afternoon. Saliva samples for cortisol determination were collected only from the sows and performed at 7-day intervals in the morning and afternoon. Sows kept in cages showed greater agonistic, stereotypical, and feeding be-haviors, and less exploratory behavior. In piglets, exploratory and playful behaviors were highly expressed in open stalls. Suckling behavior was observed more frequently in cage stalls and in the afternoon. Positive behaviors were higher in open stalls for both sows and piglets. The average rectal, dorsal, and ventral surface temperatures of the sows were higher in open stalls and lower in piglets, and air temperatures were lower. Higher concentrations of cortisol were found in cage stalls and in the afternoon. In conclusion, open stalls are better than cage stalls in improving animal welfare, contributing to the presence of positive be-havior even during summer.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Brain development is a prolonged process and it is sensitive to the environment during critical periods. Stress in early life is believed to increase vulnerability to depression, while enriched environment (EE) has beneficial effects on neural plasticity and depression. In this study, we compared the therapeutic effect of EE during different periods on early life stress-induced depression, and investigated the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and protein kinase B (AKT) on the effect of EE. Plasma corticosterone level was also detected to evaluate the reactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 4-h maternal separation (MS) procedure during postnatal days 2-21. After this separation, the mice were assigned to standard environment groups (SE), EE in the early period groups (3-8 weeks, EEE) and EE in the adult groups (8-13 weeks, EEA). Depression and anxiety behavior were evaluated at 14-weeks of age. The plasma corticosterone was quantified utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hippocampus BDNF and AKT/p-AKT were detected using Western blotting. Results: The results showed that MS increased depression and anxiety level, while EE in both intervention periods alleviated the symptoms of depression and anxiety. The EEE group showed better effects in terms of anhedonia and anxiety than the EEA group. The difference in despair behavior between the EEE and EEA groups was not significant. MS increased plasma corticosterone level, while EE decreased corticosterone level in both intervention periods. EE increased BDNF and p-AKT expression in the hippocampus, with stronger effects in the EEE group. Conclusion: EE during the early development period was more effective in alleviating depression and anxiety induced by early life stress. BDNF and AKT may play a significant role in the effect of EE, and further research is needed to explore the detailed neurobiological mechanisms.

AB  - Simple Summary: Flowering plants are used to enhance pest control by predators and parasitoids, but insect herbivores can also use floral resources. We documented the species of adult rootworm beetles on key plants, and found that northern corn rootworm (NCR) adults were commonly associated with sunflower inflorescences while western corn rootworm adults were most abundant in corn and on squash blossoms. Consumption of sunflower and corn pollen by NCR adults did not impact predation of their eggs by an omnivorous mite, but a predatory soil-dwelling mite ate pest eggs less frequently and took longer to feed on eggs when NCR adults had fed on sunflower pollen. While increasing plant diversity can benefit natural enemies and pest control within agroecosystems, it is important to consider how floral resources alter dietary preferences of biocontrol agents.Landscape diversification with flowering plants can benefit pollinators and natural enemies, although insect pests can also use floral resources for nutrition and chemoprotection. Corn rootworms (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Diabrotica spp.) are major pests of corn (Zea mays L.), and while subterranean larvae primarily feed on corn roots, adult rootworms commonly consume floral resources from other plant species. We quantified the species, density, and sex of adult corn Diabroticite rootworm beetles on wild and cultivated sunflower, corn, and squash, quantified pollen within the bodies of adult northern corn rootworms [NCR, D. barberi (Smith & Lawrence)], and investigated how consumption of sunflower and corn pollen by NCR adults impacted predation of their eggs by two soil-dwelling mites with different feeding specialization. NCR were the most common Diabroticite species on sunflower inflorescences and western corn rootworm (WCR, D. v. virgifera LeConte) were more abundant in corn and squash blossoms. Pollen feeding by NCR adults did not impact egg predation by omnivorous Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Acari: Sarcoptiformes, Acaridae), but predatory Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley) (Acari: Mesostigmata, Laelapidae) ate eggs less frequently and took longer to feed on eggs from NCR females that had fed on sunflower pollen. This research suggests pollen feeding by adult NCR can impact predation of their eggs. While increasing plant diversity can benefit natural enemies and pest control within agroecosystems, it is important to consider how floral resources alter dietary preferences of biocontrol agents.

AB  - It has been established that through binding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), bone morphogenetic protein receptor I B (BMPR1B) can mediate transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signal transduction, and is involved in the regulation of several biological processes, such as bone and muscle formation and homeostasis, as well as folliculogenesis. Also known as FecB, BMPR1B has been reported as the major gene for sheep prolificacy. A number of previous studies have analyzed the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene and its related performance. In recent years, with the illustration of the effect of retrotransposon insertion on the expression of the proximal genes or phenotypic variation, retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) have been used as a novel type of molecular marker in the evaluation of evolution, population structure and breeding of plant and domestic animals. In this study, the RIPs in porcine BMPR1B gene were excavated, and thereafter verified using a comparative genome and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The potential effects of phenotype, gene expression and functions related to RIPs were also explored. The results showed that 13 distinct RIPs were identified in introns of porcine BMPR1B. Among these, only BMPR1B-SINE-RIP9 and BMPR1B-LINE-RIP13 displayed a close relationship with the growth traits of Large White pigs. Moreover, the total number of BMPR1B-SINE+/+-RIP9 individuals born was found to be significantly higher than that of SINE-/- (p < 0.05). These two RIPs showed an obvious distribution pattern among Chinese indigenous breeds and Western commercial breeds. The expression of BMPR1B in ovaries of adult BMPR1B-SINE+/+-RIP9 Sushan pigs was found to be significantly higher in comparison to those of BMPR1B-SINE-/--RIP9 (p < 0.05). SINE insertion of BMPR1B-SINE-RIP9 and LINE insertion of BMPR1B-LINE-RIP13 were observed to significantly increase the activity of Octamer binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) minipromoter in CHO and C2C12 cells (p < 0.01). Therefore, these two RIPs could serve as useful molecular markers for modulating the growth or reproductive traits in assisted selection of pig breeding, while the mechanisms of the insertion function should be studied further.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates using hair analysis to monitor potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in cattle and roe deer sharing pastures in Northern Italy. PTEs include essential and non-essential elements that, if unbalanced in organisms, can lead to health issues. Hair analysis is a non-invasive method that allows retrospective evaluation of PTE exposure. Aluminum, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu, Mg, Fe, and Zn were measured. Findings indicate significantly higher As levels in roe deer due to selective feeding, while Cd and Pb levels align with other studies. Cattle have lower Cu, Fe, and Zn levels, likely due to dietary differences. Elevated Cr and Ni in cattle suggest contamination or physiological differences. Hair analysis proves valuable for monitoring environmental PTE exposure, emphasizing interspecies differences and the potential of both animals as bioindicators.Abstract Intensive cattle breeding's environmental challenges are prompting shifts to extensive, pasture-based systems, influencing nutrient and pollutant uptake. PTEs are essential and non-essential elements, regularly found in the environment and organisms, and in which unbalances lead to health issues. Hair analysis, a non-invasive method, provides retrospective PTE exposure evaluation. This study aims to understand exposure and species-specific accumulation patterns of PTEs in cattle and roe deer sharing pastures in Northern Italy using the hair analysis. Aluminum, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu, Mg, Fe, and Zn were quantified through the use of ICP-OES. Findings show As levels significantly higher in roe deer due to their selective feeding, while Cd and Pb levels align with other studies. Essential elements like Cu, Fe, and Zn are lower in cattle, possibly due to diet differences. Higher Cr and Ni levels in cattle suggest contamination or physiological differences in accumulation patterns. In conclusion, hair analysis is valuable for monitoring environmental PTE exposure, highlighting significant interspecies differences and the potential of both animals as bioindicators in shared grazing areas.

AB  - Aquaculture and agriculture integration is essential for maximizing water and land productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. Thus, the increase in global water scarcity and the dual use of water for crop and fish production has the potential to optimize water use, dispose of aquaculture wastes, provide additional nutrients to crops, and reduce inorganic fertilizer usage, thus maximizing farm productivity. This greenhouse study was conducted to determine the effects of fish effluents on the growth, yield parameters, and yield of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with six replications. The 13 treatments consisted of three irrigation water types (river water-control, Nile tilapia-Oreochromis niloticus, African sharptooth catfish-Clarias gariepinus), four fertilizers (chicken manure, cow manure, sheep manure; recommended rate of NPK-280 kg ha(-1) of 10-10-20), and six mixed treatments with fish effluent and 50% of the applied rate of manure alone. Results showed that irrigation with C. gariepinus effluent increased the stem diameter by 21%, the number of flowers by 88%, the fruit number by 50%, the fruit diameter by 24%, the mean fruit weight by 34%, and total fruit weight of tomato by 96% compared to NPK treatments. These effects were more evident when C. gariepinus was mixed with poultry, cow, and sheep manures, which resulted in significantly greater values than recommended rates of NPK. The higher productivity observed from the combined use of C. gariepinus and manure treatments (133% increase, on average) compared to NPK treatments was related to the continuous supply of nutrients and the increase of yield parameters. Therefore, the combined use of C. gariepinus effluent and manure can be a viable alternative for smallholder farmers, for whom inorganic fertilizers are often neither affordable nor available.

AB  - Livestock farming, and in particular slurry management, is a major contributor to ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) emissions in Europe. Furthermore, reduced NH3 and CH4 emissions are also relevant in licensing procedures and the management of livestock buildings. Therefore, the aim is to keep emissions from the barn as low as possible. Acidification of slurry in the barn can reduce these environmental and climate-relevant emissions by a pH value of 5.5. In this study, an acidification technology was retrofitted in an existing fattening pig barn equipped with a partially slatted floor. The slurry in a compartment with 32 animals was acidified. An identical compartment was used for reference investigations (case-control approach). Several times a week slurry was pumped for acidification in a process tank outside the barn compartment in a central corridor, where sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was added. Then the slurry was pumped back into the barn. In contrast to other systems, where acidified slurry was stored mainly in external storage tanks, in this study the slurry was completely stored in the slurry channels under the slatted floor, during the entire fattening period. The emission mass flow of NH3 and CH4 was measured continuously over three fattening periods, with one period in spring and two periods in summer. On average 17.1 kg H2SO4 (96%) (m3 slurry)-1 were used for acidification during the three fattening periods. NH3 and CH4 emissions were reduced by 39 and 67%, respectively. The hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentration in the barn air of the acidification compartment was harmlessly low (0.02 ppm). Thus, despite the storage of the acidified slurry in the barn, the system leads to a lower concentration of detrimental gases, which is beneficial for the animals' as well as for the workers' health. The study shows that it is possible to retrofit acidification technology into existing pig barns. Further investigations shall identify possible measures to reduce the amount of H2SO4 used and thus minimise the sulphur input into the slurry.

AB  - Purpose Porcine cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of significant veterinary and medical importance owing to its economic impact and public health significance. The present study aimed at genetic characterization of Taenia solium metacestodes in slaughtered pigs of Haryana (North India). Methods A total of 213 (160 and 53 from Chandigarh and Hisar, respectively) slaughtered pigs intended for human consumption were screened for the presence of T. solium metacestodes. The retrieved metacestodes were confirmed molecularly based on the partial amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene. Evolutionary divergence, haplotype and nucleotide diversities and neutrality indices of the retrieved isolates were also assessed. Results Out of the 213 pigs, 2 (0.94%) revealed the presence of metacestodes involving 1 pig each from Chandigarh (0.62%) and Hisar (1.9%). The sequences obtained after custom sequencing were submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers LC661682-83. The present study haplotype clustered with haplotypes of Asian origin and showed variation from other haplotypes by 1-23 mutational steps. However, the present study isolates also showed nucleotide polymorphisms (A198T, A199G, A201T, G204A, T206A, C210T, T212G, T213A, T216G/A, T217C, T221C, C524T, G994A) at different positions, which indicated the presence of sub-lineages. Low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.020) and negative value of Tajima's D (- 1.304) observed for the haplotypes under consideration was indicative of purifying selection and recent population expansion. Conclusions Our study confirms the circulation of T. solium Asian genotype (with distinct sub-lineages) in study area and recommends strict control measures to contain the zoonotic disease.

AB  - To investigate the effects of nano-ammonium octamolybdate (nano-Mo) and Macleaya cordata extracts (MCE) on antioxidant capacity of grazing Nanjiang brown goats on natural prairies under Cu and Cd stress, a 2 x 2 factorial design was adopted in this test, and two factors were nano-Mo (0, 10 mg/kg) and MCE (0, 3000 mg/kg). 24 hm(2) polluted grassland was used in this 30-day trial and was equally divided into twelve fenced units. A total of 36 Nanjiang brown goats (1 year old) with an average body weight (BW) of 40.9 +/- 2.1 kg were used in this test. The dietary treatments were (1) CON group, basic diet; (2) Nano-Mo group, basic diet + 10 mg/kg added Mo (nano-Mo); (3) MCE group, basic diet + 3000 mg/kg added MCE; and (4) combined group, basic diet + 10 mg/kg added nano-Mo and 3000 mg/kg added MCE. Nano-Mo or combination of nano-Mo and MCE diets significantly decreased the Cu content in serum and the liver of grazing goats (P < 0.05) and increased the Fe and Mo contents in serum and the liver (P < 0.05). The supplementation of nano-Mo, MCE, and combined diets extremely increased the levels of blood Hb, RBC, and PCV (P < 0.05), as well as the activities of serum SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and Cp (P < 0.05), and greatly decreased the blood WBC content (P < 0.05) and the serum MDA content (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the application of nano-Mo and/or MCE diets on contaminated grasslands changed the contents of mineral elements in serum and the liver of grazing goats, reduced oxidative stress, and improved antioxidant capacity. The combination of nano-Mo and MCE can alleviate the toxic damage of combined heavy metal contaminations.

AB  - A pilot-scale column reactor, with both anaerobic and aerobic zones, was used to examine the impact of localized anaerobic spots that naturally develop due to non-uniform aeration during the aerobic co-composting of SRM and manure. Specified Risk Materials (SRM)-a category of high-risk animal byproducts, including the brain, spinal cord, and nervous tissue of cattle-with cattle manure. The temporal and spatial distributions of CO2, CH4, and NH3 emissions were measured in both zones. The gas generated in the aerobic and anaerobic zones and the unused supplied air were collected through an outlet and measured as cumulative gas emissions. The study examined the influence of SRM content (10, 20, and 30%), manure type, manure content, and phosphogypsum (PG, 16%) on gas emissions and carbon loss. All manures originated from cattle but differed in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content. Variations in pH, nitrogen-15 isotope (delta 15N), nitrate ions (NO3-), and ammonium ions (NH4+) during the co-composting process were determined and discussed. Results indicated that anaerobic activity was minimized at 10% SRM but increased with higher SRM contents, while aerobic bacteria showed consistent responses across SRM levels of 10-30%. However, SRM consumption rates were influenced by manure type. Co-composting with 10% SRM produces 17.4 and 71.6% less CH4 compared to 0 and 30% SRM, respectively, indicating that SRM content should be maintained at 10% to minimize CH4 production. Adding 16% PG to pure manure and manure with 30% SRM can reduce NH3 emissions by 75.8 and 98.1%, respectively, demonstrating that PG is considerably more effective when SRM is included.

AB  - Freshwater samples (n = 199) were obtained from 41 sites with contrasting land-uses (avian, low impact, dairy, urban, sheep and beef, and mixed sheep, beef and dairy) and the E. coli phylotype of 3980 isolates (20 per water sample enrichment) was determined. Eight phylotypes were identified with B1 (48.04%), B2 (14.87%) and A (14.79%) the most abundant. Escherichia marmotae (n = 22), and Escherichia ruysiae (n = 1), were rare (0.68%) suggesting that these environmental strains are unlikely to confound water quality assessments. Phylotypes A and B1 were overrepresented in dairy and urban sites (p < 0.0001), whilst B2 were overrepresented in low impact sites (p < 0.0001). Pathogens ((Salmonella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium or Giardia) and the presence of diarrhoeagenic E. coli-associated genes (stx and eae) were detected in 89.9% (179/199) samples, including 80.5% (33/41) of samples with putative non-recent faecal inputs. Quantitative PCR to detect microbial source tracking targets from human, ruminant and avian contamination were concordant with land-use type and E. coli phylotype abundance. This study demonstrated that a potential recreational health risk remains where pathogens occurred in water samples with low E. coli concentration, potential non-recent faecal sources, low impact sites and where human, ruminant and avian faecal sources were absent.

AB  - Goats raised for meat production are often transported long distances. Twelve-month-old male Spanish goats were used to determine the effects of habituation to trailers on plasma metabolomic profiles when transported for extended periods. In a split-plot design, 168 goats were separated into two treatment (TRT; whole plot) groups and maintained on two different paddocks. Concentrate supplement was fed to one group inside two livestock trailers (habituated group, H), while the other group received the same quantity of concentrate, but not inside the trailers (non-habituated, NH). Goats were subjected to a 10-h transportation stress in 4 replicates (n = 21 goats/replicate/TRT) after 4 weeks of habituation period. Blood samples were collected prior to loading, 20 min after loading (0 h), and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h of transportation (Time; subplot). A targeted quantitative metabolomics approach was employed to analyze the samples. The data were analyzed using R software and MIXED procedures in SAS. Several amino acids (alanine, serine, glycine, histidine, glutamate, trans-hydroxyproline, asparagine, threonine, methylhistidine, ornithine, proline, leucine, tryptophan) were higher (p < 0.05) in the H group compared to the NH group. Six long-chain acylcarnitines were higher (p < 0.05), while free (C0) and short-chain (C3, C5) carnitines were lower (p < 0.05) in the NH goats compared to the H goats. In general, amino acid concentrations decreased and long-chain acylcarnitine (> C10) levels increased with transportation time (p < 0.05). Butyric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and alpha-aminoadipic acid concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) and beta-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were higher in the NH goats compared to the H goats. Plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and urea nitrogen concentrations were significantly influenced by Time (p < 0.01). Plasma NEFA concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the H group than the NH group. Habituation to trailers can be beneficial in enhancing stress coping abilities in goats due to higher concentrations of metabolites such as butyrate and certain amino acids that support antioxidant activities and immune function. Plasma long-chain acylcarnitines may be good indicators of stress during long-distance transportation in goats.

AB  - Air pollution caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in human settlements will have a great impact on human health, but also a great risk of transmission. The transmission power of the virus can be represented by quanta number in the Wells-Riley model. In order to solve the problem of different dynamic transmission scenarios, only a single influencing factor is considered when predicting the infection rate, which leads to large differences in quanta calculated in the same space. In this paper, an analog model is established to define the indoor air cleaning index RL and the space ratio parameter. Based on infection data analysis and rule summary in animal experiments, factors affecting quanta in interpersonal communication were explored. Finally, by analogy, the factors affecting person-to-person transmission mainly include viral load of infected person, distance between individuals, etc., the more severe the symptoms, the closer the number of days of illness to the peak, and the closer the distance to the quanta. In summary, there are many factors that affect the infection rate of susceptible people in the human settlement environment. This study provides reference indicators for environmental governance under the COVID-19 epidemic, provides reference opinions for healthy interpersonal communication and human behavior, and provides some reference for accurately judging the trend of epidemic spread and responding to the epidemic.

AB  - Simple Summary For over thirty years, contagious agalactia has been recognized as a mycoplasma disease affecting small ruminants caused by four different pathogens: Mycoplasma agalactiae, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum and Mycoplasma putrefaciens which were previously thought to produce clinically similar diseases. Today, with major advances in diagnosis enabling the rapid identification by molecular methods of causative mycoplasmas from infected flocks, it is time to revisit this issue. In this paper, we discuss and argue the reasons to support Mycoplasma agalactiae infection as the sole cause of contagious agalactia. Contagious agalactia (CA) is suspected when small ruminants show all or several of the following clinical signs: mastitis, arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis and occasionally abortion. It is confirmed following mycoplasma isolation or detection. The historical and major cause is Mycoplasma agalactiae which was first isolated from sheep in 1923. Over the last thirty years, three other mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum and Mycoplasma putrefaciens) have been added to the etiology of CA because they can occasionally cause clinically similar outcomes though nearly always in goats. However, only M. agalactiae is subject to animal disease regulations nationally and internationally. Consequently, it makes little sense to list mycoplasmas other than M. agalactiae as causes of the OIE-listed CA when they are not officially reported by the veterinary authorities and unlikely to be so in the future. Indeed, encouraging countries just to report M. agalactiae may bring about a better understanding of the importance of CA. In conclusion, we recommend that CA should only be diagnosed and confirmed when M. agalactiae is detected either by isolation or molecular methods, and that the other three mycoplasmas be removed from the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines in Terrestrial Animals and associated sources.

AB  - Simple Summary It has been well documented that the energy intake and associated energy retention of pigs will decline as the result of heat stress when the ambient temperature increases beyond thermoneutrality. The development of nutritional interventions to alleviate the negative effects of heat stress could be beneficial to pork producers. Studies have shown that reduced protein diets decrease the energy loss related to the excretion of excess N in urine and the energy loss associated with heat production. In conclusion, we provided a new nutritional strategy of decreasing dietary crude protein percentage from 12% to 10% in finishing pigs in summer, which had no negative effects on growth performance and carcass quality. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of reduced dietary protein at natural high temperature in summer on the growth performance and carcass quality of finishing pigs. A total of 72 crossbreed pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) at an average body weight (BW) of 77 +/- 5.7 kg were randomly assigned to two treatments, based on BW and sex, in six replicates per treatment, with six pigs per pen, using a randomized complete block design. The dietary crude protein (CP) level of the normal protein diet (NP) and the reduced protein diet (LP) were 12% and 10%, respectively. The growth performance and serum biochemical parameters of the pigs were analyzed for a 28-day experimental period. At the end of the experiment, 12 pigs were harvested to measure carcass characteristics and pork quality. The average highest ambient temperature during the experiment period was about 32.4 degrees C. There was a trend for the average daily feed intake (ADFI) to be lower in the pigs on the reduced protein diet compared to the control (p < 0.10) in the 0-28 day period. The serum urea nitrogen was lower (p < 0.05) for pigs fed the reduced protein diets only on day 14. The carcass characteristics and pork quality were not affected by dietary treatments. In conclusion, decreasing dietary crude protein percentage from 12% to 10% in finishing pigs in summer may have no negative effects on growth performance and carcass quality.

AB  - Blood Nitrogen Mixed-Activated Carbon (BN-AC) containing multiple nitrogen functional group was successfully prepared with pig blood meal as raw material and phosphoric acid as activator. These nitrogen-containing func-tional groups will provide more adsorption sites, thus, the adsorption efficiency of carbon materials is significantly improved. Research shows that BN-AC was used to remove phenol from wastewater, Under the optimum techno-logical conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity and removal rate of phenol by BN-AC were 56.35 mg/g and 94.18%, respectively. This study not only realized the resource utilization of waste pig blood and expanded the selection range of activated carbon raw materials, but more importantly contributed to the current environmental protection field.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Saliva is gaining importance as a diagnostic sample in pigs. The aim of this research was to evaluate a panel of salivary analytes in three porcine diseases and establish predictive models to detect them. Methods: Saliva samples were obtained from healthy pigs (n = 97) and pigs affected by meningitis due to Streptococcus suis (n = 118), diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC, n = 77), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS, n = 52). The following biomarkers were analyzed: adenosine deaminase (ADA), haptoglobin (Hp), calprotectin (Calp), aldolase, alpha-amylase (sAA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein (TP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs). Predictive models based on binary logistic regression and decision trees combining those analytes for detecting specific diseases were constructed. Results: The results showed a different biomarker profile between the groups. S. suis and ETEC pigs showed higher values of ADA, Hp, Calp, aldolase, sAA, LDH, and TP than healthy pigs. Pigs with PRRS showed higher values of Hp, Calp, sAA, and LDH than healthy animals. The constructed predictive models showed overall accuracies of over 78% and 87% for differentiating ETEC and PRRS, respectively, whereas the models did not accurately predict S. suis infection. Conclusions: Salivary analytes show different changes in pigs depending on the disease, and the combination of these analytes can contribute to the prediction of different diseases. Further studies should be conducted in larger populations to confirm these findings and evaluate their possible practical applications.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious and fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting species of the cervidae family. CWD has an expanding geographic range and complex, poorly understood transmission mechanics. CWD is disproportionately prevalent in wild male mule deer and male white-tailed deer. Sex and species influences on CWD prevalence have been hypothesized to be related to animal behaviours that involve deer facial and body exocrine glands. Understanding CWD transmission potential requires a foundational knowledge of the cellular prion protein (PrP (c)) in glands associated with cervid behaviours. In this study, we characterized the presence and distribution of PrP (c) in six integumentary and two non-integumentary tissues of hunter-harvested mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). We report that white-tailed deer expressed significantly more PrP (c) than their mule deer in the parotid, metatarsal, and interdigital glands. Females expressed more PrP (c) than males in the forehead and preorbital glands. The distribution of PrP (c) within the integumentary exocrine glands of the face and legs were localized to glandular cells, hair follicles, epidermis, and immune cell infiltrates. All tissues examined expressed sufficient quantities of PrP (c) to serve as possible sites of prion initial infection, propagation, and shedding.

AB  - Tea has been gaining increasing popularity all over the world in recent years, and its yield and quality depend on the growth and development of tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze] in various environments. Nowadays, biotic stress and extreme weather, such as high temperature, drought, waterlogging, pests, and diseases, bring about much pressure on the production of tea with high quality. Wherein anthracnose, which is the most common and serious disease of tea plants, has earned more and more attention, as its control mainly relies on chemical pesticides. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), forming symbiosis with most terrestrial plants, participate in plant resistance against the anthracnose disease, which was found by previous studies in a few herbaceous plants. However, there are a few studies about arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal regulation of the resistance to the anthracnose pathogen in woody plants so far. In this paper, we investigated the effect of AMF on the development of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum camelliae and tried to decipher the pertinent mechanism through transcriptome analysis. Results showed that inoculating AMF significantly reduced the damage of anthracnose on tea seedlings by reducing the lesion area by 35.29% compared to that of the control. The content of superoxide anion and activities of catalase and peroxidase significantly increased (P < 0.05) in mycorrhizal treatment in response to the pathogen with 1.23, 2.00, and 1.39 times higher, respectively, than those in the control. Pathways of plant hormone signal transduction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis might play roles in this regulation according to the transcriptomic results. Further redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis found that plant hormones, such as auxin and ethylene, and the antioxidant system (especially peroxidase) were of great importance in the AM fungal alleviation of anthracnose. Our results preliminarily indicated the mechanisms of enhanced resistance in mycorrhizal tea seedlings to the anthracnose pathogen and provided a theoretical foundation for the application of AMF as one of the biological control methods in tea plantations.

AB  - Lentils are a good dietary source of essential minerals for the proper functioning of the human body. We evaluated 34 cultivars and elite lentil lines representing the breadth of the Canadian breeding program. Trials were established in 10 site- years across Saskatchewan. Concentrations of 27 minerals were quantified with an inductive coupled argon plasma emission spectrometer in whole and dehulled lentil seeds. Lithium (Li), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), arsenic (As), silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), tin (Sn), lanthanum (La), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) had concentrations below the quantification limit and were excluded from further analysis. The effects of site year, tissue type (whole and dehulled), and lentil genotypes were analyzed using a mixed model. Mineral concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), boron (B), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), aluminum (Al), and barium (Ba) was different among genotypes and across environments. Most minerals except Cu had significantly different concentrations between whole and dehulled seeds. Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, B, Al, and Ba were more concentrated in whole seeds, while K, S, and Ni were higher in dehulled seeds. Among the 34 genotypes, CDC Impala had the highest Fe, Zn, K, P, S, and Cu concentrations. Lentil genotypes with a higher composition of several minerals could be a starting point for enhancing mineral composition in lentils.

AB  - Soil heavy metals and their associated ecological risks are significant environmental issues, yet comprehensive studies are limited in ecologically sensitive regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study focuses on Yushu County and utilizes principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and network environmental analysis (NEA) models to identify pollution sources and ecological risk transmission pathways. The results indicated that the heavy-metal content in the soil of the study area predominantly reflects natural background levels, with minimal anthropogenic influence. The PCA-MLR model identified five main factors influencing soil composition: acidic rocks, basic rocks, agricultural/pastoral activities, hydrothermal processes, and crustal backgrounds. The NEA model revealed that cadmium and arsenic posed the highest ecological risks, primarily accumulating in soil microorganisms (67.1 %), while vegetation, herbivores, and carnivores accounted for 25.2 %, 4.6 %, and 3.1 % of the potential risk, respectively. Acidic and basic rock sources were major contributors, with acidic rocks posing the highest risk of arsenic input to soil microorganisms. The environmental capacity of soil to absorb Cd and As is approaching its limit, highlighting the urgent need to address their pollution risks. This study provides critical insights into geogenic heavy-metal risks, offering a framework for sustainable management in fragile ecosystems.

AB  - Dew plays an important role as a nonrainfall water input in semi-arid ecosystems. To analyse dew's variations and its influencing factors, Tribulus, Hippophae and Ulmus were selected as typical plant species because of these common plants having different leaf traits in loess hill and gully region of China. A dew monitoring method correlating manual measurements of plant leaf dew with automated sensor data was developed. During May-October 2022, the cumulative amount of dew on the foliage of the three plant species was in the following order: Tribulus (17.46 mm) > Hippophae (11.14 mm) > Ulmus (5.88 mm). Dew mainly occurred from 20:00 to 9:00 the next day and was mainly concentrated in July-October. Compared with rainfall, dew frequency is higher though the dew amount is less. Dew formation was more favourable when relative humidity at 0.2-m height was greater than 80.0%, the air temperature and dewpoint difference at 0.2-m height was less than 2 degrees C, and the wind speed at 1.0-m height was less than 1.0 m/s. In addition, there was more dew on the first day after rainfall because of sufficient moisture. Under the same meteorological conditions, Tribulus is more prone to dew because of its dense, fine and vertical tomentum. Overall, meteorological factors significantly influenced the amount of dew condensation of the three plants. However, interspecific differences due to plant foliar characteristics were more prominent. Therefore, foliar characteristics of different plants cannot be ignored in dew studies.

AB  - The livestock industry is expanding rapidly, generating large amounts of manure rich in nutrients and energy. This study develops a novel integrated biorefinery approach that combines multiple technologies to enable the simultaneous recovery of nutrients, proteins and energy from pig manure, maximizing resource valorization and economic returns. The technologies included gas-permeable membrane (GPM) to separate the ammonia, solid-liquid separation to separate organic particles, acid-base solubilization to separate phosphorus and proteins (SPP) from the particles, anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas and combinations thereof. Using the GPM method, nitrogen (N) concentrations were reduced by up to 90 %, with total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) recovery rates ranging from 25 to 27 g N m-2 d-1. Solid-liquid separation did not significantly increase pH or N recovery. The SPP method provided a phosphorus extraction efficiency of 114 % and a protein extraction efficiency of 86 % from the solid fraction of pig manure. The methane yield was 1.9 times higher when nitrogen was recovered before AD, while phosphorus and protein removal resulted in methane yields comparable to swine manure (215.5 mL CH4 g-1 VS). A techno-economical study was carried out for the AD treatments proposed in the biorefinery approach. High internal rates of return (IRR) were obtained, 21-37 %, and a return on the investment in 3-5 years was obtained for all the treatments. This integrated strategy demonstrated a comprehensive and economically viable solution for sustainable pig manure management and resource recovery.

Impatiens glandulifera and I. parviflora are two invasive species, whose leaves in the secondary range have been severely damaged by leaf miners in recent years. The leaf miner attack rates for these species and a native congener, I. noli-tangere, were examined. Molecular analysis shows that all three impatiens species are affected by the same leaf miner Phytoliriomyza melampyga (Agromyzidae) without signs of divergence between populations living on different plant species. The native I. noli-tangere is more often damaged by the leaf miner, whilst I. parviflora is attacked more often than I. glandulifera. The largest mined area was found in I. glandulifera leaves and the smallest in I. noli-tangere. The nitrogen content, indicative of food quality, was similar in all three species, and there were no differences in 15N enrichment between miners from three impatiens species. We suppose that observed differences in attack rates and mined area in P. melampyga on three Impatiens species can be explained mainly by different levels of antiherbivore defence and recent host shift from native species to invasive ones.

AB  - Plant-plant signalling via volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been studied intensively, but its contingency on abiotic conditions (e.g., soil nutrients, drought, warming) is poorly understood. To address this gap, we carried out a greenhouse experiment testing whether soil nutrients influenced signalling between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants in response to insect leaf herbivory by the generalist caterpillar Spodoptera exigua. We placed pairs of plants in plastic cages, where one plant acted as a VOC emitter and the other as a receiver. We factorially manipulated soil nutrients for both emitter and receiver plants, namely: unfertilized (baseline soil nutrients) vs. fertilized (augmented nutrients). Then, to test for signalling effects, half of the emitters within each fertilization level were damaged by S. exigua larvae and the other half remained undamaged. Three days after placing larvae, we collected VOCs from emitter plants to test for herbivory and fertilization effects on VOC emissions and placed S. exigua larvae on receivers to test for signalling effects on leaf consumption and larval mass gain as proxies of induced resistance. We found that herbivory increased total VOC emissions and altered VOC composition by emitter plants, but these effects were not contingent on fertilization. In addition, bioassay results showed that receivers exposed to VOCs from herbivore-damaged emitters had lower levels of herbivory compared to receivers exposed to undamaged emitters. However, and consistent with VOC results, fertilization did not influence herbivore-induced signalling effects on receiver resistance to herbivory. In sum, we found evidence of S. exigua-induced signalling effects on resistance to herbivory in potato plants but such effects were not affected by increased soil nutrients. These results call for further work testing signalling effects under broader range of nutrient concentration levels (including nutrient limitation), teasing apart the effects of specific nutrients, and incorporating other abiotic factors likely to interact or covary with soil nutrients.

AB  - Furanocoumarins are phytoalexins often cited as an example to illustrate the arms race between plants and herbivorous insects. They are distributed in a limited number of phylogenetically distant plant lineages, but synthesized through a similar pathway, which raised the question of a unique or multiple emergence in higher plants. The furanocoumarin pathway was investigated in the fig tree (Ficus carica, Moraceae). Transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches led to the identification of CYP76F112, a cytochrome P450 catalyzing an original reaction. CYP76F112 emergence was inquired using phylogenetics combined with in silico modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. CYP76F112 was found to convert demethylsuberosin into marmesin with a very high affinity. This atypical cyclization reaction represents a key step within the polyphenol biosynthesis pathway. CYP76F112 evolutionary patterns suggests that the marmesin synthase activity appeared recently in the Moraceae family, through a lineage-specific expansion and diversification. The characterization of CYP76F112 as the first known marmesin synthase opens new prospects for the use of the furanocoumarin pathway. It also supports the multiple acquisition of furanocoumarin in angiosperms by convergent evolution, and opens new perspectives regarding the ability of cytochromes P450 to evolve new functions related to plant adaptation to their environment.

AB  - Jameed is a traditional dried dairy product in Jordan that is known under different names in the Middle East, Turkey, Central Asia, China, and Mongolia. It has been produced in the region for centuries and makes a significant contribution (up to 20%) to the income of small-scale traditional dairy processors who are based in sheep-producing districts. This study aims to assess the nutritional value of Jameed as a model for traditional dried fermented dairy products and to highlight the safety of the product quality and some of the health risks that may arise. For this purpose, 80 samples of Jameed were collected from the market covering all regions of the Kingdom of Jordan. The samples were analyzed for nutritional value and health risks by standard and approved methods. Results show that the total solids were 84.57%, with a large variation from 73 to 92%. Producers use a lot of salt to control elevated acidity during the drying of Jameed. The salt concentrations in collected samples were 15.68%. The average acidity was 6.79%. Moreover, farmers heavily use antibiotics to control mastitis without observing milk withdrawal. The residues of antibiotics were detected in 50.65% of the analyzed samples. The samples show large variations in measured values, reflecting differences in processing methods, homogeneity, and standardization.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite traditional reports on the ability of female dromedaries to modulate pregnancy length in response to environmental conditions, no empirical study has been developed. According to the present results, female dromedaries would adjust the onset of parturition to give birth around darker and, therefore, safer nights since social communication and interaction between congeners are increased under dim light conditions, mostly mediated by hormonal signals. Furthermore, the time of delivery, a highly energy-demanding process, may also be modulated by mean wind speed and its transient increases since these weather variables affect the thermal comfort and, thus, the heat transfer between an animal and its environment and the individual energy budget. Gravid females may be more energetically compromised when the offspring is a male; hence, the onset of parturition for the newborns of the male sex will be more probable to occur on slightly brighter nights and when mean wind speed is lower when compared to their female counterparts. Such specific phenology would favor a proper multisensory interaction between the mother and the more immature male young at neonatal stages so that thermoregulatory demands are minimized for these reproductive tasks, and then the fitness of parents and the survival of offspring are improved. Given energy costs for gestating and caring for male offspring are higher than those of female newborns, external environmental conditions might be regarded as likely to affect the timing of delivery processes differentially depending on the sex of the newborn calf to be delivered. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the association between environmental stressors such as the moon phase and weather-related factors and the onset of labor in female dromedaries. A binary logistic regression model was developed to find the most parsimonious set of variables that are most effective in predicting the probability for a gravid female dromedary to give birth to a male or a female calf, assuming that higher gestational costs and longer labor times are ascribed to the production of a male offspring. Although the differences in the quantitative distribution of spontaneous onset of labor across lunar phases and the mean climate per onset event along the whole study period were deemed nonsignificant (p > 0.05), a non-negligible prediction effect of a new moon, mean wind speed and maximum wind gust was present. At slightly brighter nights and lower mean wind speeds, a calf is more likely to be male. This microevolutionary response to the external environment may have been driven by physiological and behavioral adaptation of metabolic economy and social ecology to give birth to cooperative groups with the best possible reduction of thermoregulatory demands. Model performance indexes then highlighted the heterothermic character of camels to greatly minimize the impact of the external environment. The overall results will also enrich the general knowledge of the interplay between homeostasis and arid and semi-arid environments.

AB  - Simple Summary Cashmere goats are one of the most important animal breeds in northern China. Cashmere is characterised by good quality and high yield and represents an excellent textile material. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development of cashmere hair follicles is poorly understood, which limits the further development of the cashmere industry. Here, we used whole-transcriptome sequencing to analyse goat embryonic skin samples and carried out experimental verification. We found that fibroblast growth factor 10 and the interacting non-coding RNA miR-184 play important roles in dermal papilla cells of cashmere goat secondary hair follicles. This discovery not only further improves the theoretical understanding of the development of cashmere wool follicles but also has significant implications for functional research on fibroblast growth factor 10 and miR-184. Cashmere, a keratinised product of secondary hair follicles (SHFs) in cashmere goats, holds an important place in international high-end textiles. However, research on the complex molecular and signal regulation during the development and growth of hair follicles (HFs), which is essential for the development of the cashmere industry, is limited. Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in HF development. Herein, we systematically investigated a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network mediated by circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in skin samples of cashmere goat embryos, using whole-transcriptome sequencing technology. We obtained 6468, 394, and 239 significantly differentially expressed mRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs, respectively. These identified RNAs were further used to construct a ceRNA regulatory network, mediated by circRNAs, for cashmere goats at a late stage of HF development. Among the molecular species identified, miR-184 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 10 exhibited competitive targeted interactions. In secondary HF dermal papilla cells (SHF-DPCs), miR-184 promotes proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and alters the cell cycle via the competitive release of FGF10. This study reports that FGF10 and its interaction with ncRNAs significantly affect SHF-DPCs, providing a reference for research on the biology of HFs in cashmere goats and other mammals.

AB  - Mayotte is a small tropical island in the Comoros archipelago. It became recently a French department and much of its food, especially meat, is imported from abroad. The development of livestock farming is therefore a necessity. To understand the problems faced by Mahoran farmers, we organised semi-directive interviews with 15 farmers who reared cattle, sheep, goats or poultry. The first difficulty of farmers was limited access to land, especially for ruminants. This led to feed shortages. Another difficulty was the limited access to water and the poor quality of the roads to reach the farms. Poultry farmers were too dependent on importations of feed and laying hen or broiler genotypes from metropolitan France. The lack of organization for independent food productions (absence of abattoirs, cooperatives or organised markets) is also an obstacle to the development of the sector. Animal health, although not considered a major problem, has been a nuisance in the past (anthrax in cattle or salmonella in poultry). Mahoran farmers trust veterinarians or their assistants to manage health, although they complain about the high cost. Surprisingly, farmers use traditional medicine for many of their ailments, mostly based on local plants, but rarely for animals. Overall, our study reveals that larger land areas, better availability of money for investment and access to water and fodder are urgently required to improve livestock production and economic viability of farmers in Mayotte.

AB  - The avian hippocampus, akin to its mammalian counterpart, plays a critical role in cognitive and physiological processes despite notable structural differences. Initially thought to be less developed, recent studies over the past two decades have revealed it as a complex brain region essential for diverse functions in both laboratory and free-living birds. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the avian hippocampus' organization, functionality, and neurophysiological significance. We first examine its anatomical structure and neuronal connectivity, comparing it with the mammalian hippocampus. We then highlight how its volume, neuronal density, and neurogenesis support spatial memory and navigation, influencing behaviors such as migration, food storing, brood parasitism, and homing. Beyond spatial functions, the avian hippocampus mediates emotion and stress physiology through interactions with the endocrine system, particularly via glucocorticoid receptors. It also influences spatial memory through sex hormones, especially estradiol, with local estrogen production through aromatase activity enhancing memory and plasticity. Therefore, the avian hippocampus serves as a central neural hub, integrating sensory information with internal states to facilitate essential behaviors and responses to external environmental stimuli. This review underscores the progress made in understanding this brain structure's roles, highlighting conserved neurophysiological functions across vertebrate taxa.

AB  - Bacteriophages (phages) can significantly influence the composition and functions of their host communities, and enhance host pathogenicity via the transport of phage-encoded virulence genes. Phages are the main component of animal gut viruses, however, there are few reports on the piglet gut phageome and its contribution to virulence genes. Here, a total of 185 virulence genes from 59,955 predicted genes of gut phages in weaned piglets were identified, with 0.688 % of the phage contigs coding for at least one virulence gene. The virulence gene pblA was the most abundant, with various virulence genes significantly correlated with gut phages and their encoded mobile gene element (MGE) genes. Importantly, multiple virulence genes and MGE genes coexist in some phage sequences, and up to 12 virulence genes were detected in a single phage sequence, greatly increasing the risk of phage-mediated transmission of virulence genes into the bacterial genome. In addition, diarrhoea has driven changes in the composition and structure of phage and bacterial communities in the intestinal tract of weaned piglets, significantly increasing the abundance of phage contigs encoding both virulence genes and MGE genes in faecal samples, which potentially increases the risk of phage-mediated virulence genes being transfected into the gut bacterial genome. In summary, this study expands our understanding of the gut microbiome of piglets, advances our understanding of the potential role of phages in driving host pathogenesis in the gut system, and provides new insights into the sources of virulence genes and genetic evolution of bacteria in pig farm environments.

AB  - Lay Summary The study determines deer velvet antler (DVA) compounds and their effect on Candida species biofilm formation. A total of 45 compounds were detected in the DVA extract. Most Candida spp. exhibited a higher percentage of biofilm reduction and decreased total cell count when treated with DVA extract.
   Oral biofilms comprise extracellular polysaccharides and polymicrobial microorganisms. The objectives of the study were to characterize the deer velvet antler (DVA) compounds and their effect on Candida species biofilm formation with the hypothesis that DVA inhibits the biofilm of Candida spp. Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) was conducted to characterize the DVA compounds. To study the effect of DVA on biofilm, Candida albicans ATCC MYA-4901 (ALT5), AIDS isolate (ALC2), oral cancer isolate (ALC3), C. dubliniensis ATCC MYA-2975, C. glabrata ATCC 90030, C. krusei 14 243, C. lusitaniae ATCC 34449, C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, and C. tropicalis ATCC 13803 were inoculated with DVA in separate wells of a 96-well plate containing RPMI-1640 followed by 72 h incubation. A total of 45 compounds were detected in the DVA extract. C. lusitaniae exhibited a higher percentage of biofilm biomass reduction when treated with DVA extract (66.10% +/- 5.33), followed by ALC3 (44.12% +/- 6.24). However, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis showed no reduction in biofilm biomass after being treated with DVA extract. Most Candida strains also exhibited decreased total cell count when treated with DVA extract, except for ALC3 and C. krusei. ALT5 had the lowest total cell count (0.17 x 10(5) cells/ml) when cultured with DVA extract. In conclusion, DVA extract inhibits Candida spp. biofilm formation except for C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis.

AB  - Plant-pollinator interactions have persisted and evolved over millions of years. These interactions are shaped by environmental factors. However, global environmental changes are disturbing these interactions in the Anthropocene. One way both plants and pollinators can respond (and potentially adapt) to these changing environments is through phenotypic plasticity mediated by epigenetic modifications and non-genetic inheritance. Yet, research on how, and to what extent, epigenetic modifications and non-genetic inheritance shape plant-pollinator dynamics is rare. In this forward-looking perspective, we discuss different ways in which the environment mediates epigenetic marks and non-genetic inheritance into the subsequent generation. By taking a broader perspective, we discuss four mechanisms of epigenetic modification and non-genetic inheritance in both plants and pollinator systems: epigenetic modifications, inter-generational non-genetic inheritance, transgenerational non-genetic inheritance, and cultural transmission. We discuss the roles of various epigenetic marks and the transfer of molecules that cause epigenetic changes and non-genetic inheritance in plants and pollinators, which either directly or indirectly affect the outcome of plant-pollinator interactions. We provide a framework for the ecological and evolutionary implications for inheritance of acquired traits driving plant-pollinator interactions and discuss its importance in a rapidly changing environment. Lastly, we suggest ways to experimentally test the role of epigenetic marks and non-genetic inheritance, and how to integrate such mechanisms into long-term studies on plant-pollinator interactions during the Anthropocene.

AB  - In a development of the ecosemiotic vivo-scape concept, a 'safety eco-field' is proposed as a model of a species response to the safety of its environment. The safety eco-field is based on the ecosemiotic approach which considers environmental safety as a resource sought and chosen by individuals to counter predatory pressure. To test the relative safety of different locations within a landscape, 66 bird feeders (BF) were deployed in a regular 15 x 15 m grid in a rural area, surrounded by shrubs, small trees, hedgerows, and buildings. On each of 48 days in November 2021 and February and March 2022, dried mealworms were placed on each BF and counts of larvae at each BF were made at noon and dusk. The European robin (Erithacus rubecula) and the great tit (Parus major) were the most regular visitors to the BFs. Land cover at each BF was recorded. Bird behaviour at the BFs was noted from direct video recordings of the birds at nine selected BFs, totalling 32 daily sessions in March. The different behaviours of the European robin and the great tit were observable. The safety eco-field changed according to the month and the time of day. The distance of the BF from the woodland edges seemed to be important only in the morning. In the afternoon, BFs that were more distant from the woodland edges received the highest number of visits. Weather conditions were found to influence the number of mealworms removed, but this requires further investigation. A significant relationship between land cover and the number of mealworm larvae removed from the BFs was observed. Within the grid of BF, three regions were distinguishable which were related to land cover in the safety eco-field process. The experimental framework confirms the adequacy, at least for birds that have cryptic predators, to map the landscape as a proxy of safety resource. From the video recordings it was noted that the European robin visits were distributed throughout the day without apparent temporal preferences, while the great tit visits were concentrated in the central part of the day. This result has the limitation of the short period of observation (March) and should be extended to the entire period of the experiment to eventually capture seasonal variation. The experimental evidence obtained confirms that the ecosemiotic-based models of safety eco-field are an efficient approach to explain bird feeding preferences and behaviours.

AB  - Dietary nutrient digestion and utilization patterns influence pig performance and intestinal health. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of protein digestion and fiber fermentation speed among different feed ingredients on growth performance and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in weaned pigs. A total of 192 weaned pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire [6.87 +/- 0.14 kg]) were selected and randomly divided into four dietary groups: fast-digesting protein with fast-fermenting fiber, fast-digesting protein with slow-fermenting fiber, slow-digesting protein with fast-fermenting fiber, and slow-digesting protein with slow-fermenting fiber. The results showed that cottonseed and wheat protein powders exhibited faster protein digestion than potato protein powder (p < 0.05). In vitro microbial fermentation of hawthorn powder and orange pomace resulted in greater and faster gas production and SCFA concentrations than sugarcane bagasse (p < 0.05). Orange pomace increased the abundance of Klebsiella and Escherichia-Shigella, whereas sugarcane bagasse increased the abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and norank_f__Muribaculaceae. In addition, the fast-fermentation fiber tended to increase the daily weight gain and feed intake of piglets (p < 0.10), and the slow-fermentation fiber significantly reduced diarrhea incidence in pigs (p < 0.05). Fast fermentation increased acetate and valerate concentrations, and slow-digestion protein increased branched-chain SCFA and valerate contents (p < 0.05). In conclusion, there were large variations in protein digestion and fiber fermentation speed among the different common feed ingredients. Dietary protein digestion and fiber fermentation speed would affect growth performance and diarrhea incidence in weaned pigs.

AB  - <ol><li>Herbivory by insects leads to changes in both primary and secondary plant metabolism, ultimately impacting subsequent interactions. Some phloem-feeding insects have developed mechanisms to suppress herbivore-induced plant defences and manipulate the quality of host phloem sap, thereby facilitating their establishment on the host plant. Based on evidence that the specialized phloem-feeding insects, Dalbulus maidis and Rhopalosiphum maidis, can suppress herbivore-induced defences in maize, we hypothesized that infestation by either of these pests in maize would facilitate the colonization and establishment of subsequent conspecific and heterospecific individuals. We conducted a series of behavioural assays with these insects in both laboratory and greenhouse settings.</li><li>The corn leafhopper D. maidis preferred previously infested plants as hosts, but it did not discriminate between conspecific- or heterospecific-infested plants for colonization. However, when selecting a host for oviposition, it preferred depositing eggs on conspecific-infested plants, which were the hosts that the offspring performed better compared to both non-infested and heterospecific-infested plants.</li><li>The corn aphid R. maidis also preferred previously infested plants over non-infested plants as hosts. However, the aphid preferred heterospecific-infested over conspecific-infested plants, even though heterospecific-infested plants were hosts of lower quality to aphids. Aphids performed better on conspecific-infested plants, followed by heterospecific-infested plants, when compared to non-infested plants.</li><li>Our results confirm that previous colonization by the specialized phloem-feeding insects facilitates subsequent infestations by conspecifics and heterospecifics. However, the facilitation for heterospecifics was asymmetric, as colonization by D. maidis facilitated infestations by R. maidis more than the reverse sequence of infestation.</li> </ol>

AB  - The aims of this study were to analyse the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 11 (PPP1R11) expression and cellular localization in yak follicles and investigate its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and oestrogen secretion in granulosa cells (GCs). Ten healthy and non-pregnant female yaks (4-year-old) were used as experimental animals. The mRNA relative expression level of PPP1R11 in GCs from small (<3.0 mm), medium (3.0-5.9 mm) and large (6.0-9.0 mm) follicles was detected by RT-qPCR, and the cellular localization of PPP1R11 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). After isolation, culture and identification of yak GCs in vitro, si-PPP1R11 and si-NC (negative control) were transfected into GCs. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the interference efficiency, and ELISA was performed to detect oestrogen concentration. Then, EdU staining and TUNEL staining were conducted to analyse cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, the oestrogen synthesis, proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes were detected by RT-qPCR after knockdown PPP1R11. The results showed that PPP1R11 is mainly located in ovarian GCs, and the expression levels of PPP1R11 in GCs from large follicles were significantly higher than that from medium and small follicles. Transfection of si-PPP1R11 into GCs could significantly inhibit the expression of PPP1R11. Interestingly, the oestrogen secretion ability and the expression level of oestrogen pathway-related genes (STAR, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and HSD17B1) were also significantly downregulated. Moreover, the proportion of positive cells was decreased, and cellular proliferation-related genes (PCNA, CCNB1 and CDC25A) were significantly downregulated after knockdown PPP1R11. However, the proportion of apoptotic cells was increased, and apoptosis-related genes (BAX, CASP3 and P53) were significantly upregulated. Taken together, this study was the first revealed the expression and cellular localization of PPP1R11 in yak follicles. Interference PPP1R11 could reduce oestrogen secretion, inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in GCs, which provided a basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanism of PPP1R11 in follicle development.

AB  - Simple Summary The high-quality lambskin of the Chinese Zhongwei goat has a high economic value. The quality of lamb skin is mainly affected by the curvature of the wool, which is regulated by the growth and development of hair follicles. In this study, the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of 45-day-old and 108-day-old Zhongwei goats were constructed by the Ribo Zero RNA sequencing. A total of 60 differential lncRNAs and 352 differential mRNAs were identified. The functional annotation of differential lncRNAs target genes showed that they were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt and Arachidonic acid metabolic signaling pathways. In combination with qRT-PCR and WGCNA results, we speculate that LOC102172600 and LOC102191729 might affect hair follicle development and wool curvature by regulating the target genes. These results provide new insights into the potential role of lncRNA in regulating wool bending. Chinese Zhongwei goat is a rare and precious fur breed as its lamb fur is a well-known fur product. Wool bending of lamb fur of the Zhongwei goat is its most striking feature. However, the curvature of the wool decreases gradually with growth, which significantly affects its quality and economic value. The mechanism regulating the phenotypic changes of hair bending is still unclear. In the present study, the skin tissues of Zhongwei goats at 45 days (curving wool) and 108 days (slight-curving wool) after birth were taken as the research objects, and the expression profiling of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs were analyzed based on the Ribo Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) method. In total, 46,013 mRNAs and 13,549 lncRNAs were identified, of which 352 were differentially expressed mRNAs and 60 were. lncRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of the target genes of lncRNAs were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt, Arachidonic acid metabolic, cAMP, Wnt, and other signaling pathways. The qRT-PCR results of eight selected lncRNAs and target genes were consistent with the sequencing result, which indicated our data were reliable. Through the analysis of the weighted gene co-expression network, 13 co-expression modules were identified. The turquoise module contained a large number of differential expressed lncRNAs, which were mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway. The predicted LOC102172600 and LOC102191729 might affect the development of hair follicles and the curvature of wool by regulating the target genes. Our study provides novel insights into the potential roles of lncRNAs in the regulation of wool bending. In addition, the study offers a theoretical basis for further study of goat wool growth, so as to be a guidance and reference for breeding and improvement in the future.

AB  - Although perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is structurally similar to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and also widely detected in humans and the environment, comparatively fewer toxicity data exists on this 6-chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid. In this study, repeated oral doses of PFHxS were administered to deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) to evaluate subchronic toxicity and potential effects on reproduction and development. Maternal oral exposure to PFHxS caused increased stillbirths, which is relevant for ecological risk assessment, and resulted in a benchmark dose lower limit (BMDL) of 5.72 mg/kg-d PFHxS. Decreased plaque formation, which is relevant for human health risk assessment, occurred in both sexes of adult animals (BMDL = 8.79 mg/kg-d PFHxS). These data are the first to suggest a direct link between PFHxS and decreased functional immunity in an animal model. Additionally, female animals exhibited increased liver:body weight and animals of both sexes exhibited decreased serum thyroxine (T4) levels. Notably, since reproductive effects were used to support 2016 draft health advisories and immune effects were used in 2022 drinking water health advisories released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), these novel data can potentially support advisories for PFHxS because relevant points of departure emerge at similar thresholds in a wild mammal and corroborate the general understanding of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

AB  - Meeting the water requirements of fattening pigs is crucial for animal welfare in successful animal husbandry. At the same time, barn climate has a significant influence on the water requirements of fattening pigs. Equations for the estimation of water consumption are useful in this context. However, it is questionable whether existing equations match modern pig genetics and housing conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the water consumption of modern fattening pigs and compare the measured values with the predicted values using equations from the literature. It was found that the measured water consumption was, in most cases, higher than the calculated one. As a result, six new equations for the prediction of water consumption were derived and discussed. More data are needed to further specify these new equations.The water consumption of fattening pigs was recorded under practical conditions and compared with calculated water consumption. The experiment was carried out in the summer of 2020 with 79 fattening pigs. Data loggers were used to record the climate data, such as temperature and relative humidity. These data were used to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI). It was found that there were sometimes considerable discrepancies between the measured and the calculated water consumption. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be the age of the existing water requirement equations, as in recent decades there has been a clear breeding development and thus a strong increase in pig performance. Based on these deviations, six new water consumption equations were established, which considered the variables body weight (BW), temperature, THI and feed consumption. It was found that the THI and BW should be included in one equation as predictor variables and the evaluation also showed good results. Its use, in practice, should also be considered. Overall, it became apparent that there is still a need for further research to make water consumption equations more precise. This would require a larger database.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) constraint can be alleviated by increasing C inputs, which can help to improve crop production and P fertilizer use efficiency. However, the effects of different manures on soil microbial biomass P (MBP) and P fractions as well as C fractions in calcareous soils remain poorly understood. Soil MBP pool involves the P mineralization and immobilization processes, potentially changing P fractions and P availability. Therefore, the effects of different manures on soil microbial biomass (MBP, MBC) pool, P, and C fractions and crop P utilization were evaluated in greenhouse experiments with maize plantation. Treatments included no manure (control), poultry manure (PM), cow manure (CM), goat manure (GM), mixed manure (MM), and three inorganic P (Pi) rates; P0: 0 mg kg-1, P50: 50 mg kg-1, and P100: P100 mg kg-1 (P2O5). For plant growth comparison, crop physiological growth indices, shoot P contents and total P uptake were increased by PM and P100 as compared to other treatments. The PM with P100 significantly increased the plant growth by inducing P uptake of & SIM;18% compared with control. The results exhibited that Pi (P100) combined with manure (PM) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil physicochemical properties, that is, 683.76 mg kg-1 total P, 21.5 mg kg-1 Olsen P, 4.26 g kg-1 SOC, 2.41 g kg-1 POC, as well as microbial biomass C and P increased by 152.84 mg kg-1 and 36.83 mg kg-1, respectively. Consequently, we concluded that PM with Pi (P100) application builds up soil microbial biomass, which is more beneficial for promoting P utilization for maize.

AB  - The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a major migratory polyphagous insect pest of various crops. The essential nutrient and mineral profile of the host plants determines the feeding fitness of herbivorous insects. As a result, the growth and development of insects is affected. To determine the effect of the nutrient and mineral profile of different host plants (maize, castor bean, cotton, cabbage, okra, and sugarcane) on the growth and development of S. frugiperda, biological parameters like larval weight, pupal weight (male/female), and feeding and growth indices were calculated. The proximate compositions such as crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre, and ash and mineral contents of the tested host plants showed significant differences (p < 0.05). The feeding indices on these host plants also differed significantly (p < 0.05). The maximum relative growth rate (RGR), relative consumption rate (RCR), and consumption index (CI) were recorded in S. frugiperda larvae that fed on maize and castor bean leaves. The crude protein, dry matter, and ash contents in maize and castor bean were significantly higher and positively correlated with the RGR and RCR of S. frugiperda larvae. The larval, male and female pupal weights were the maximum in the larvae feeding on the castor bean host plant. These findings provide novel information based on nutritional ecology to develop sustainable integrated pest management strategies using selective crop rotation.

AB  - Demographic data on threatened species is crucial to understand their conservation status and make management decisions when necessary, which is especially relevant for narrow endemic species with isolated populations. This is the case of Femeniasia balearica (J.J. Rodr.) Susanna, a narrow endemic cushionlike shrub that grows in coastal areas of northern Menorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean Basin) and catalogued as Vulnerable according to the IUCN categories. Recently, a new population has been located in the center of the Serra de Tramuntana of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). In this study, the demographic status of the population from Mallorca has been studied, geolocating all of the individuals with a differential GPS to obtain a detailed map. Data on stage of development (seedling, vegetative or reproductive), morphometry and the overall status of all the individuals have been compiled. A total of 116 individuals and 96 seedlings have been counted. The fact that most of the individuals are reproductive (86.70%) and the confirmation of the presence of seedlings suggest that the population may be maintained in the future. This study provides valuable data on the demographic status of the new population of the species, but long-term monitoring is necessary for analyzing demographic trends.

AB  - Watersheds impacted by wildfires undergo alterations in water, sediment, and biogeochemical fluxes owing to, e. g., soil destabilization and loss in evapotranspiration potential. Enhanced sediment availability and surface runoff are known to make burnt slopes susceptible to localised slope failure, whereas larger watershed-scale (>1,000 km2) changes in sediment flux are largely unconstrained. This shortcoming results from the scarcity of direct measurements from most large, remote watersheds, which makes modelling efforts particularly relevant. Here, we develop a two-fold model to estimate sediment flux from hillslopes to a river based on characteristic rates of catchment erosion and relationships with riverbank migration. We apply this model to the watershed of the Bonaparte River (British Columbia, Canada), which was heavily impacted by the Elephant Hill megafire in the summer of 2017. Photogrammetric data collected from three meandering reaches reveal sharp post-fire channel widening and accelerated migration (up to 130% and 230%, respectively) in the fire's aftermath. Field observations link these trends to enhanced post-fire suspended- and wash-load fluxes to floodplain reaches, whereas input of bedload sediments was likely restricted to bedrock reaches. Our model predicts a power-law relationship between fire-induced sediment-supply enhancement from hillslopes and riverbank mobility, consistent with the hypothesis that sediment flux affects meander migration. Future integrations of these results with sub-catchment-scale mapping of burn severity and direct data on sediment capacity may help better inform alterations in sediment and biogeochemical fluxes in the aftermath of wildfires elsewhere.

AB  - Korean wooden architectural heritage buildings are often damaged by termites, and climate change is expected to exacerbate the problem. To prevent termite damage, it is necessary to identify the habitat range and activity period of termites. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the ecological characteristics of Reticulitermes speratus, the dominant termite species in South Korea, past termite damage records of wooden architectural heritage buildings, and climate data (2000-2019). We determined that termite infestations could potentially occur in 98.5% of the total studied area, except for a few mountainous regions in South Korea. In addition, termites were active for an average of 209 days per year. The habitat range of termites appears to be gradually expanding, possibly as a result of a combination of anthropogenic interventions, rising temperatures caused by climate change, and the ecological characteristics of termites. In the future, it is imperative to implement enhanced preventive and active termite control measures to preserve the original wooden architectural heritage buildings of South Korea.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to contrast the expression values of heat shock protein (HSP70) and interleukins 2, 6 and 12 (IL 2, IL 6 and IL 12) genes in summer and winter in two different locations in Egypt (Alexandria zone and Matrouh zone) to deduce changes in thermo-physiological traits and biochemical blood metabolites of Barki sheep. A total of 50 ewes (20 in Alexandria and 30 in Matrouh) were individually blood sampled to determine plasma total protein (TP), Albumin, Globulin and Glucose constituents and T3, T4 and cortisol hormones. The thermo-physiological parameters of rectal temperature (RT, degrees C), skin temperature (ST, degrees C), Wool temperature (WT, degrees C), respiration rate (RR, breaths/min) and pulse rate (PR, beats/min) were measured for each ewe. Expressions of IL 2, IL 6, IL 12 and HSP 70 in summer and winter were analyzed along with thermo-physiological parameters and blood biochemical metabolites. In both locations, THI had significant effects on ST, WT, PR and RR, but not significant on RT. However, it had no significant effects on blood plasma metabolites and hormonal concentrations in the two locations in summer and winter. In Alexandria location, THI had negative significant effect on the expressions of IL-2 and IL-6 but positively affected on HSP70 genes in winter, while the expression of IL-12 gene was not affected by seasons, whereas in Matrouh zone, the effects of THI on the expressions of all tolerance genes were not significant. The results of the current study suggest that IL-2, IL-6 and HSP70 genes could be used as molecular markers for heat/cold stress.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exogenous hormones on postpartum ultrasonographic changes of uterine horn in Hu sheep. 90 nulliparous Hu sheep were divided into three groups according to the number of lambs. Each group was further randomly subdivided into three groups (n = 10), a control group (sodium chloride), a PG group (cloprostol), and a PG+OT group (cloprostol + oxytocin). The effects of different treatments on ultrasonographic changes of uterine horn and reproductive performance of ewes were determined after the treatment. Then, 90 nulliparous ewes were divided into a control group, PG group, and PG+OT group according to hormone injections received. Each group (n = 30) consisted of 10 single, 10 twin, and 10 triple ewes. Changes in the levels of hormones P4, LH, FSH, and E2 in the serum of postpartum ewes, the time of the first estrus, and the conception rate were detected. Results showed that the higher the lambing rate, the slower the rate of ultrasonographic changes of uterine horn. The rate of ultrasonographic changes of uterine horn in the PG+OT group was faster than that in respective PG and the control groups. Caruncle diameter was not affected by the number of lambs or hormone treatment. After delivery, the concentrations of P4 and LH increased rapidly and remained at a relatively high level, while the concentration of E2 increased in all ewes. The PG+OT group had lower P4 concentrations compared to the control group, but higher LH, FSH, and E2 levels. The time to first postpartum estrus was significantly shorter in the PG+OT group, but differences in pregnancy rate were not significant. Thus, PG+OT treatment can significantly accelerate postpartum ultrasonographic changes of uterine horn, which can prepare postpartum ewes for the next reproductive cycle.

AB  - Robinia pseudoacacia L. is one of the most common and environmentally adaptable introduced tree species which has become an important element of artificial afforestation and landscaping in Ukraine over the past 150 years. Throughout the history of its introduction on the territory of Ukraine, this species was considered resistant because of the absence of dangerous phytophages. At the beginning of the XXI century, the phytosanitary situation changed as the result of the penetration and rapid spread of a number of North American invasive phytophages. The appearance and distribution of the miner Parectopa robiniella (Clemens, 1863) (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) feeding on R. pseudoacacia was recognized as the largest invasion in Ukraine. This paper considers the issues of studying the effect of P. robiniella caterpillars feeding on R. pseudoacacia in various forest-growing conditions in the steppe zone of Ukraine. The process of photosynthesis, as the most important physiological parameter, was chosen as indicator of condition. The study was conducted using biosensor technology which made it possible to measure the effect of caterpillar feeding on critical parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (the Kautsky curve). The research has shown that the initial value of fluorescence induction was within the range of 196-284 RFU, and the maximum value of the background fluorescence parameter was recorded in undamaged leaves and under shading conditions. Both the effect of phytophages and the shading factor caused a significant decrease in the values of fluorescence induction of the "plateau" both in the conditions of an artificially washed sandbar, on the watershed area of a watershed-gully landscape, as well as on natural sandy-loam soil. The maximum values of photosynthetic fluorescence induction under the simultaneous influence of the studied factors had rather high variability. In contrast to the fluorescence induction parameter, the "plateau" of the highest maximum fluorescence induction was reached in the absence of pest damage under conditions of total shading. As revealed by dispersion and regression analyses, the maximum fluorescence index was most dependent on the amount of solar radiation and on the degree of the leaf surface damage by phytophages. Significantly higher values of the steady-state fluorescence induction parameter were determined in the absence of insect damage in both shading and lighting conditions. A statistically significant combined influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the "plateau" fluorescence induction parameter was determined in comparison with the mono-influence of individual factors. A highly significant dependence of the maximum efficiency indicator of primary photosynthesis processes on individual factors of exogenous influence was established, while the combined effect of these factors did not affect this parameter. The obtained data allow one to apply in practice the methods of analyzing chlorophyll fluorescence induction to establish the physiological state of tree flora in forest and garden farms.

AB  - Myostatin (MSTN), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, negatively regulates muscle growth. MSTN inhibition has been known to cause a double-muscled phenotype in skeletal muscle and fibrosis reduction in the heart. However, the role of MSTN in the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) needs more studies in various species of animal models to draw more objective conclusions. The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether loss of MSTN affects the cardiac extracellular matrix in pigs. Three MSTN knockouts (MSTN-/-) and three wild type (WT) male pigs were generated by crossing MSTN +/- heterozygous gilts and boars. Cardiac ECM and underlying mechanisms were determined post-mortem. The role of MSTN on collagen expression was investigated by treating cardiac fibroblasts with active MSTN protein in vitro. MSTN protein was detected in WT hearts, while no expression was detected in MSTN-/- hearts. The heart-to-body weight ratio was significantly decreased in MSTN-/- pigs. The morphometric analyses, including picrosirius red staining, immunofluorescent staining, and ultra-structural thickness examination of the endomysium, revealed a significant reduction of connective tissue content in MSTN-/- hearts compared to WT. Hydroxyproline, type I collagen (Col1A), and p-Smad3/Smad3 levels were significantly lower in MSTN-/- hearts in vivo. On the contrary, cardiac fibroblasts treated with exogenous MSTN protein overexpressed Col1A and activated Smad and AKT signaling pathways in vitro. The present study suggests that inhibition of MSTN decreases cardiac extracellular matrix.

AB  - Guinea pigs have been integral as models used in biomedical research, making significant contributions to nutritional, auditory, immunologic, and hypersensitivity studies, and necessitating the routine need for sedation in laboratory settings. The ketamine-xylazine (KX) combination has been the standard sedation protocol for decades. However, due to the adverse effects and abuse potential of xylazine, this study explores the possibility of substituting xylazine with midazolam and examines the combined use of midazolam with ketamine and alfaxalone in female laboratory guinea pigs. Our findings indicate that KX facilitates the fastest induction and longest duration of sedation compared with other sedatives, including ketamine-midazolam (KM), which, despite its rapid induction, results in significantly shorter sedation durations. KX also ensures a deeper anesthetic depth and greater odds of loss of withdrawal and inguinal reflexes, in contrast to KM and alfaxalone-midazolam (AM), under which only 15% of the animals lost these reflexes. In terms of cardiopulmonary function, KM led to an increased heart rate attributed to elevated sympathetic activity. All 4 sedative protocols lead to respiratory depression, except KM, which causes minimal reduction. Adverse events varied, with 75% of animals experiencing injection site reactions after KX administration and 67% exhibiting regurgitation post-KM administration. No adverse events were reported for the AM combination, suggesting its safer profile. In conclusion, while KX remains the superior protocol for sedation due to its efficiency, reliability, and minimal impact on physiologic parameters, midazolam is not a preferable alternative to replace xylazine. Its increased sympathetic tone, hyperesthesia, and shorter action duration, coupled with a higher potential for adverse events, limit its suitability to combine with ketamine in guinea pig sedation. However, when midazolam is used in conjunction with safer alternatives like alfaxalone, it presents a viable sedation strategy, emphasizing the need for further research into optimizing sedative combinations for laboratory guinea pigs.

AB  - Most parasitoid wasps parasitize herbivorous insects, so nectar from flowers is readily available. However, parasitoid wasps are also an important component of the rich invertebrate communities at livestock facilities in large accumulations of manure, where flowers are largely absent. Little is known about adult parasitoid diet and nutrition in these communities. The present study examined this in Spalangia cameroni Perkins, a pupal parasitoid of filth flies. Like many parasitoid wasps, S. cameroni feed on host fluids, and in the laboratory readily feed on honey or a sucrose solution, which increases their longevity. Here adult longevity in the presence of six potential food sources, bovine manure, sorghum silage, bovine milk, buckwheat inflorescence (Polygonaceae), sweet alyssum inflorescence (Brassicaceae), or dandelion inflorescence (Asteraceae), was compared to that with water or honey. Only parasitoids given buckwheat lived as long as parasitoids given honey, and parasitoids given honey or buckwheat lived longer than parasitoids given water. Parasitoids readily ate buckwheat nectar, avoiding pollen grains. Diet affected the amount of free sugars, glycogen, and lipids in complex ways. Compared to parasitoids that were given just water, parasitoids with access to honey or sucrose had higher sugar and glycogen levels, but not detectably higher lipid levels. Access to buckwheat had no detectable effect on a parasitoid's free sugar, glycogen, or lipid levels; however, then after 4 d with just water, sugar levels were lower and glycogen levels were higher compared to parasitoids that had been given access to only water the entire time.

AB  - The livestock industry has long been a hotspot environment for antibiotic resistance genes, with smallholder farming still holding a significant position in pig farming. However, the microbial antibiotic resistance and pathogen risks in pigs under the smallholder farming model remain unclear. We systematically analyzed the antibiotic resistance and microbial composition of pig feces from smallholder and large-scale farming models in Sichuan. The results indicated a lower abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and similar microbial composition in smallholder farming compared to large-scale farming. Beneficial bacteria were more abundant in small-scale farming, whereas large-scale farming exhibited more ARGs, virulence genes, and human pathogenic bacteria (HPBs), including ESBL Escherichia coli strains closely related to human strains, indicating higher zoonotic risk. The findings suggest that smallholder farming presents a relatively better microbial composition and resistance profile, highlighting its advantages over large-scale farming in terms of pig and human health. It is noteworthy that a considerable proportion of HPBs carrying ARGs still exist in the feces from smallholder farming, and given the openness of fecal handling, there remains a high risk of transmitting ARGs and pathogens to humans.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Tragocephala nobilis (Fabricius) (Coleoptera:Cerambycidae), an insect pest (herbivorous insect), was recently found on a multipurpose tropical tree species, Tetrapleura tetraptera (Schum and Thonn.) Taub, in Ghana. Although the pest has been previously reported on other tree crops such as cocoa and Coffea arabica, this is the first report on T. tetraptera. T. tetraptera is a deciduous tree crop with numerous nutritional and medicinal benefits. The pest, a long-horned beetle is found to attack T. tetraptera tree and damage is first observed as die-back of twigs and branches leading to the formation of a witches broom in the crown. This is followed by a series of tunnels created by the larvae on the main stem resulting in branch death and/or tree mortality. In view of the threat posed by the pest to T. tetraptera, a broader study is needed urgently to develop an integrated pest management strategy for T. nobilis pest in T. tetraptera plantations as the interest in its domestication as a tree crop is burgeoning in response to increasing herbal medicine and food supplements demand.

AB  - Forensic entomology has been developing in Brazil in recent years. In cases where traditional forensic methods cannot accurately determine the postmortem interval (PMI), entomological evidence can be crucial. In this novel study, we present the first results of the Forensic Entomology Division at Santa Catarina Scientific Police, southern Brazil, formally established in January 2022. From Jan 2022 to July 2023, minimum PMI was calculated based on entomological evidence in 34 cases. A total of 21 species of insects (16 species of Diptera belonging to 6 families and 5 species of Coleoptera belonging to 4 families) were collected from human bodies at different decomposition stages and in different types of environments. The most abundant and relevant species to estimate PMI were: Chrysomya albiceps (in 38% of the cases), followed by Hermetia illucens (18%), Oxelytrum discicolle (14%), Chrysomya megacephala (12%) and Peckia (Pantonella) intermutans(12%). Some species were reported for the first time colonizing human corpses in Santa Catarina and used for the first time to estimate minimum PMI in Brazil. Understanding the entomofauna present on a human corpse becomes an important tool in death investigations and is essential for forensic entomology applications. Our findings provide better understanding of entomological evidence from Santa Catarina State and have important implications for the advancement of forensic entomology in Brazil.

AB  - Currently, the methods to identify leather materials have limitations, and identifying natural leather types is also relatively complex. In this research, the microstructures of four types of mammalian leathers (cattle leather, pig leather, sheep leather, and deer leather), three kinds of reptilian leathers (crocodile leather, lizard leather, and snake leather) and regenerated leather were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The spectral curves (from 900 to 1700 nm) of these leather samples were extracted using a hyperspectral imaging system, and their spectral characteristics were analyzed. A method of leather identification by the hyperspectral imaging system combined with chemometrics was established. The results showed that the spectral curves of natural and regenerated leather differed in the number, position, and depth of the characteristic peaks, enabling the classification of regenerated leather by comparative analysis with the naked eye. The first-order derivative processing-principal component analysis-discriminant analysis model achieved a 98% correct classification rate, confirming the hyperspectral imaging system's feasibility in the leather material identification field. We believe that his research is beneficial for the leather industry to understand the classifications scientifically, in order to protect consumer rights and further develop the leather testing industry.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the antibacterial features of functional macromolecules released during the fermentation of goat milk and whey from goat milk by selected lactic acid bacteria strains that are components of kefir grain microflora. Two milk sources were used: goat milk and whey from goat milk. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and indicator microorganisms used were Lactobacillus plantarum PCM 1386, Lactobacillus fermentum PCM 491, Lactobacillus rhamnosus PCM 2677, Lactobacillus acidophilus PCM 2499, Escherichia coli PCM 2793, Salmonella enteritidis PCM 2548, Micrococcus luteus PCM 525, and Proteus mirabilis PCM 1361. The metabolic activity of LAB was described by the Gompertz model, and the parameters proposed for this experiment were the maximum rate of change of electrical impedance and potential biodegradability. Antibacterial activity was examined using the culture method in a liquid medium, determination of the reduction in indicator microorganisms, and optical density changes. Results show that the selective LAB produced certain active biomolecules with antibacterial activity from whey, a by-product that is sometimes troublesome for goat milk processors to manage. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a microorganism that is characterized by the highest metabolic activity in goat milk and whey from goat milk. It has the possibility to produce macromolecules with antibacterial activity.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that inadequate maternal nutrition during gestation can have immediate and lifelong effects on offspring. However, little is known about the effects of maternal nutrition during gestation on male offspring reproduction. Here, using a sheep model of maternal restricted - and over - nutrition (60 or 140% of the National Research Council requirements) during gestation, we found that maternal restricted - and over - nutrition do not affect semen characteristics (i.e. volume, sperm concentration, pH, sperm motility, sperm morphology) or scrotal circumference in male F1 offspring. However, using small RNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrated that both restricted - and over - nutrition during gestation induced marked changes in composition and expression of sperm small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) subpopulations including in male F1 offspring. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis further identified specific genomic loci where poor maternal nutrition resulted in alterations in DNA methylation. These findings indicate that maternal restricted - and over - nutrition during gestation induce epigenetic modifications in sperm of F1 offspring sperm in sheep, which may contribute to environmentally influenced phenotypes in ruminants.

AB  - Like other plants, wild and domesticated rice species (Oryza nivara, O. rufipogon, and O. sativa) evolve in environments with various biotic and abiotic stresses that fluctuate in intensity through space and time. Microbial pathogens and invertebrate herbivores such as plant-parasitic nematodes and caterpillars show geographical and temporal variation in activity patterns and may respond differently to certain plant-defensive mechanisms. As such, plant interactions with multiple community members may result in conflicting selection pressures on genetic polymorphisms. Here, through assays with different aboveground and belowground herbivores, the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and the southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), and comparison with rice responses to microbial pathogens, we identify potential genetic trade-offs at the KSL8 and MG1 loci on chromosome 11. KSL8 encodes the first committed step toward the biosynthesis of either stemarane-type or stemodane-type diterpenoids through the japonica (KSL8-jap) or indica (KSL8-ind) allele. Knocking out KSL8-jap and CPS4, encoding an enzyme that acts upstream in diterpenoid synthesis, in japonica rice cultivars increased resistance to S. frugiperda and decreased resistance to M. incognita. Furthermore, MG1 resides in a haplotype that provided resistance to M. incognita, while alternative haplotypes are involved in mediating resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and other pests and pathogens. Finally, KSL8 and MG1 alleles are located within trans-species polymorphic haplotypes and may be evolving under long-term balancing selection. Our data are consistent with a hypothesis that polymorphisms at KSL8 and MG1 may be maintained through complex and diffuse community interactions.

AB  - An experiment was conducted during the fall season of 2020 in one of the protected facilities (plastic house) in the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Kufa/Iraq. This research aimed to study the effect of applying three types of decomposing organic residue solution to soil (cow, sheep, and chicken), and foliar spraying of proline with three concentrations (0, 40 and 80) mg center dot L-1 on some indicators of the vegetative growth of a local variety of faba bean. A factorial experiment was conducted according to R.C.B.D with three replications. The results revealed significant effects of organic residue solution of chicken for plant height 46.03 cm, leaf number 26.10 (leaf center dot plant-1), branch number 4.32 (branch center dot plant-1), and chlorophyll content 44.04 (SPAD unit) in comparison with cow residue solution. Moreover, spraying with proline at 80 mg center dot L-1 realized a significant increase in leaf number 25.96 (leaf center dot plant-1), branch number 3.73 (branch center dot plant-1), and relative chlorophyll content 34.68 (SPAD unit) compared to the control treatment. Consequently, the combination of the two factors was the most efficient treatment for faba bean plant growth indicators studied aforementioned.

AB  - In natural systems, animal-mediated nutrient transport can be a major driver of primary productivity, but the role of marine megafauna such as cetaceans in mediating the transfer and recycling of nutrients has been overlooked. Here, we developed a spatially resolved, stochastic, nutrient-transport model for cetaceans in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using species-specific foraging depths, distributions, and diets. An estimated 6.4 x 108 mmol N d-1, or 0.06 mt N yr-1 ind-1, is transported to the surface from depths below 100 m by the 19 cetacean species that occur in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico; 75% of this transport occurs seaward of the continental slope, but the per area transported nitrogen is greater on the continental slope (200-1000 m) than in the ocean basin. Benthos to surface transport comprised 6.0 x 107 mmol N d-1 and was much more common on the continental slope than the open basin. Compared to an existing physical-biogeochemical model, the transported nutrients add 8% N d-1 to the estimated ammonium concentration above the nutricline and could add 16% N d-1 to the surface ammonium concentration if expelled nutrients remain at the surface. Through feeding on diel vertical migrants, cetaceans retain an additional 2.7 x 107 mmol N d-1 in the surface waters that would otherwise return to depth via downward diel vertical migration. Cetaceans contribute to nutrient movements and recycling in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico, and may provide one of the few allochthonous sources of nutrients for primary producers in oligotrophic ecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary This work studied the situation regarding biosecurity practices in goat farms in Greece and their potential associations with the socio-demographic characteristics of farmers. The findings indicated that, in goat farms, the socio-demographic characteristics of farmers are associated with the biosecurity level therein. This study identified that the presence of working staff on the farm and the length of farming experience were characteristics associated with the application of most biosecurity-related individual practices and procedures. Female farmers and the presence of working staff were associated with the overall level of biosecurity on the farms. This knowledge can be useful when developing biosecurity programs on goat farms.Abstract Given the significance of goat farming in Greece, our study aimed to explore biosecurity conditions on goat farms and refers to an investigation performed on 119 farms countrywide in Greece. The objective of the present work was to evaluate and report on potential associations between the socio-demographic characteristics of goat farmers and practices that play a role in biosecurity on farms. Data were obtained during a large cross-sectional study performed across Greece in 119 goat herds. The socio-demographic characteristics of farmers, as well as 16 variables related to biosecurity, were recorded; these were practices or events that could potentially enhance or compromise biosecurity on farms. A score based on all the biosecurity-related variables was devised by assigning a '1' or '-1' mark for each variable recorded on a farm that could enhance or compromise, respectively, biosecurity. Among variables potentially enhancing biosecurity on farms, the application of disinfections on the farm and the maintenance of isolation for sick animals were practiced more frequently; among variables potentially compromising biosecurity on farms, the presence of hunters in the area around the farm and grazing practices for animals were recorded more frequently. The median overall score for biosecurity-related practices for all farms in the study was 1 (interquartile range: 2.5; minimum: -4; maximum: 5). Among socio-demographic characteristics, the presence of working staff on a farm was associated with five individual biosecurity-related practices and the length of farming experience with three individual biosecurity-related practices. In the multivariable analysis, female farmers (p = 0.007) and the presence of working staff on the farm (p = 0.025) emerged as the two significant socio-demographic characteristics with an association with the overall biosecurity level on farms. This knowledge can be useful when developing biosecurity programs on goat farms. Recognition of locally applied farm-level practices enhancing biosecurity could form a basis for farmers to apply more rigorous and effective relevant plans.

AB  - Ovine toxoplasmosis has a significant negative impact on sheep farming, and abortion is the main clinical manifestation. The objective of the present study was to survey ovine toxoplasmosis and assess its potential harm T. gondii in sheep. Sheep serum or heart fluid was collected from 1035 sheep, along with the tissue or blood samples collected from 164 of them. We investigated ovine toxoplasmosis by a modified agglutination test (MAT) (n = 1035 sheep) and by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (n = 164 sheep) in China. The results showed that 75 sheep were seropositive (titer >= 1:100), with a prevalence of 7.2%, as assessed by MAT. The molecular prevalence of T. gondii in sheep was 16.4% (27/164), as assessed by PCR. From these 164 tissue or blood samples, 22 tissues and 2 blood samples were selected in order to isolate T. gondii by mouse bioassay. A viable T. gondii strain (TgSheepCHn15, ToxoDB #10) was isolated from sheep tissues in the veterinary clinic. This strain was avirulent for Swiss mice, and the survival time of mice was 97 +/- 31 days. This is the first instance of the isolation of a Type I strain from sheep with avirulence in mice. The prevalence of T. gondii has been decreasing in sheep from China. However, T. gondii remains present in sheep herds and should not be ignored.

AB  - The aim of the studies was to investigate the effect of camel grass, lavender, patchouli, peppermint and tea tree essential oils, and their mixtures on the in vitro growth of pathogenic fungi Cladobotryum dendroides and Mycogone perniciosa, occurring in the cultivation of button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). The mycelial growth of the tested pathogens was evaluated on PDA medium. Essential oils were added in three doses: 0.25; 0.5 and 1 mg.cm(-3) of PDA medium. Camel grass and peppermint essential oils applied at the highest dose inhibited completely the in vitro growth of C. dendroides mycelium. Lavender oil used at the amount of 1 mg.cm(-3) reduced the growth of the pathogen by 90 %. In the case of M. perniciosa the complete inhibition of the pathogen's growth was observed after the addition of camel grass oil to PDA medium, irrespective of a dose, and lavender oil at the doses of 0.5 and 1 mg.cm(-3). The efficacy of the tested mixtures against M. perniciosa was high. Generally, all mixtures of essential oils, irrespective of a dose, completely controlled the growth of the pathogen. The complete inhibition of the growth of C. dendroides was observed only on the medium with the addition of the mixture of camel grass and peppermint oils at the highest dose. The conducted research showed that natural essential oils due to their antifungal properties could be useful in the Integrated Disease Management for the protection of button mushroom against diseases. They could be an effective alternative to synthetic chemical fungicides.

AB  - Simple Summary Stunning is an important and statutory pre-slaughter process that aims to induce a state of unconsciousness and insensibility to pain just before sticking and bleeding out. In Europe, two main stunning methods that are applied at pig slaughter are electrical (ES) and gas stunning with high-concentration carbon dioxide (CO2). Stunning is not only crucial in terms of the welfare of pigs at slaughter, but it may also have effects on meat quality. Various studies have compared these two methods with respect to meat-quality traits. In several studies, stunning with CO2 has been shown to improve meat quality in comparison with ES; however, other research indicated that ES enhanced the meat quality as opposed to CO2 or had no significant effect. The current study analysed the combined results of independent research and experiments to achieve quantitative evidence of the effects of two stunning methods, electrical and gas with a high concentration of carbon dioxide, on selected quality attributes of fresh pork. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that relative to CO2 stunning, overall, ES pigs had a lower pH(1), higher drip loss (DL) and lightness (L*). However, the greater alterations in these traits were achieved with the application of the head-to-back (HB) electrical-stunning method and conventional chilling (Conv.) of the carcasses. The results of the meta-analysis provide evidence that differences between these two stunning methods in DL and L* may be diminished by the application of the head-only (HO) or head-to-body (HBO) method, followed by the fast chilling of the carcasses. Stunning is a statutory pre-slaughter process that may affect the quality of pork. The objective of this study was quantification of the effects of stunning (ES vs. CO2 stunning) on selected quality attributes of pork, using a meta-analytical approach. Data from 18 publications with 46 individual experiments were combined using a random-effect model to estimate the effect size of stunning on the initial and ultimate pH (pH(1), pH(u)); drip loss (DL); colour (lightness-L*, redness-a*, yellowness-b*); and tenderness (expressed as Warner-Bratzler shear force, WBSF) of pork. In overall, loins from ES showed significantly lower pH(1) (by 0.08 units); greater DL (by 0.68 p.p.); higher L* (by 1.29 units); and a* (by 0.80 units) as they compared to those from CO2 stunning. In subgroups, a greater-than-overall negative change in pH(1), pH(u), DL, L* and a* was detected with the application of the head-to-back (HB) stunning method. Additionally, alterations in DL and L* may be magnified with the application of conventional chilling (Conv.) to ES pigs. There was no effect of stunning on WBSF but, due to a low number of research in the database, the reliability of these results may be misleading. These results provide evidence that the differences between these two stunning methods in DL and L* may be diminished by the application of the head-only (HO) or head-to-body (HBO) method, followed by the fast chilling of carcasses.

AB  - Albendazole (ABZ), a broad-spectrum anthelmintic drug frequently used in livestock against parasitic worms (helminths), enters the environment mainly via faeces of treated animals left in the pastures or used as dung for field fertilization. To obtain information about the subsequent fate of ABZ, the distribution of ABZ and its me-tabolites in the soil around faeces along with uptake and effects in plants were monitored under real agricultural conditions. Sheep were treated with a recommended dose of ABZ; faeces were collected and used to fertilize fields with fodder plants. Soil samples (in two depths) and samples of two plants, clover (Trifolium pratense) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), were collected at distances 0-75 cm from the faeces for 3 months after fertilization. The environmental samples were extracted using QuEChERS and LLE sample preparation procedures. The targeted analysis of ABZ and its metabolites was conducted by using the validated UHPLC-MS method. Two main ABZ metabolites, ABZ-sulfoxide (anthelmintically active) and ABZ-sulfone (inactive), persisted in soil (up to 25 cm from faeces) and in plants for three months when the experiment ended. In plants, ABZ metabolites were detected even 60 cm from the faeces and abiotic stress was observed in the central plants. The considerable distribution and persistence of ABZ metabolites in soil and plants amplify the negative environmental impact of ABZ documented in other studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Semen cryopreservation is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species, which leads to lipid peroxidation of sperm membranes, resulting in a reduction in sperm motility and decreased fertilizing ability. We investigated the effects of bioactive peptides from palm kernel meal protein hydrolysates (PKMPHs) on sperm viability, motility, acrosome and mitochondrial function in frozen-thawed boar semen. PKMPH improved the total motility, progressive motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial function of sperm and diminished lipid peroxidation. Therefore, we suggest that PKMPH plays a crucial role as an antioxidant during the freezing of boar sperm.Abstract Boar sperm is sensitive to particular conditions during cryopreservation, resulting in an extreme reduction in fertilizing ability due to damage to the sperm membranes. PKMPH contains bioactive peptides that have antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. There is no information on the use of palm-kernel-meal-derived bioactive peptides for boar semen cryopreservation. This study aimed to examine the effects of bioactive peptides from PKMPH on post-thawed boar sperm quality. Boar semen ejaculates (n = 17) were collected and divided into six equal aliquots based on PKMPH concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mu g/mL) in a freezing extender. Semen samples were processed and cryopreserved using the liquid nitrogen vapor method. Thereafter, the frozen semen samples were thawed at 50 degrees C for 12 s and evaluated for sperm motility using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer and for sperm viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial function, and lipid peroxidation by measuring the level of malondialdehyde (MDA). The results demonstrate that the supplementation of PKMPH with 2.5 mu g/mL afforded superior post-thawed sperm qualities, such as increased total motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial function by 10.7%, 12.3%, 18.3%, and 12.7%, respectively, when compared to the control group. PKMPH at a concentration of 2.5 mu g/mL showed the lowest level of MDA (40.6 +/- 2.0 mu Mol/L) compared to the other groups. In conclusion, adding PKMPH peptides at 2.5 mu g/mL to the freezing extender reduced the oxidative damage associated with cryopreservation and resulted in higher post-thawed sperm quality.

AB  - Simple Summary Although somatic cell count is not a sensitive biomarker to identify mastitis in goats, the current study revealed a relationship between this indicator and goat milk composition. While data on goat milk fatty acids and especially on amino acid variations according to somatic cell count influence are very minimal, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the relation of different somatic cell count levels in goat milk with goat milk yield, milk composition, fatty acid, and amino acid profiles of Alpine and Saanen goat breeds. The research revealed some statistically significant relationships between somatic cell count and amino acids and fatty acids, suggesting that improving milk quality by reducing somatic cell count may benefit farmers by improving goat milk's fatty acid and amino acid composition and may serve as a biomarker for dairy goats. However, future studies with more goats are needed to confirm these results. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the relation of different SCC levels in goat milk with goat milk yield, milk composition, FA, and AA profiles. Whereas the investigated herd was composed of Alpine and Saanen goats, the influence of breed on milk parameters and milk yield was also assessed. The research was carried out in 2022 at a Lithuanian dairy goat farm with 135 goats (Saanen = 66 and Alpine = 69) without evidence of clinical mastitis. The current research revealed a relationship between SCC with goat milk yield and composition. Goats with a high SCC had significantly lower milk yield (p < 0.001), lower content of lactose (p < 0.01), fat (p < 0.001) and higher protein content (p < 0.05) in their milk. The increase in most AA was significantly associated with increased SCC. The higher quantity of Asp, Glu, Ala, Met, His, Lys, Arg, EAA, NEAA, and TAA (compared with the low SCC group) (p < 0.05-0.01), Leu, Tyr, and BCAA (compared with the low and medium SCC group) were found in the milk of the high SCC group (p < 0.05-0.01). The distribution of the main FA groups was also related to SCC and showed a significant decrease in SCFA (p < 0.01-0.001) and an increase in LCFA, PUFA, and BCFA in the high SCC group (p < 0.05). All individual AA and their groups (EAA, NEAA, TAA, BCAA) were significantly lower in the milk of the Saanen goat breed (p < 0.001). The most individual FA ranged between goat breeds, while the total amount of SFA, UFA, and MUFA wasn't affected by breed (p > 0.05). The research revealed a statistically significant relationship between SCC, AA, and FA, suggesting that these traits may be used as a biomarker in the goat selection process.

AB  - Symbiotic microbes facilitate rapid adaptation of invasive insects on novel plants via multifaceted function provisions, but little was known on the importance of cross linkages in symbiotic microbiota to insect invasiveness. Novel host pine Pinus tabuliformis is inherently unsuitable for invasive red turpentine beetle (RTB) in China; however, Novosphingobium and Erwinia/Serratia in gallery microbiota (at the interface between RTB larvae and pine phloem) have been discovered to help beetles via biodegrading pine detrimental compounds naringenin and pinitol, respectively. Here, we further revealed significant positive linkage of the two functions, with higher activity level conferring more growth benefit to RTB larvae. Abundance of Erwinia/Serratia was remarkably increased in response to pinitol, while naringenin-biodegrading Novosphingobium was unable to utilize this main phloem carbohydrate directly. High-activity bacterial microbiota produced nutritive metabolites (sucrose and hexadecanoic acid) from pinitol consumption that facilitated growth of both Novosphingobium and beetle larvae. Functional proteins of several bacterial taxa were enriched in high-activity microbiota that appeared to form a metabolic network collectively to regulate the nutrient production. Our results indicate that positive interaction between Erwinia/Serratia and Novosphingobium is critical for RTB invasion success, while Bacilli bacteria might restrict this linkage, providing new insights into symbiotic microbial interactions for insect herbivores.

AB  - Tea is a high-value cash crop, and it is a popular beverage globally owing to its unique flavor and health benefits. Selenium can increase tea yield, and the increasing demand for selenium-enriched tea has made it a research hotspot. However, the effect of selenium on the quality and cold resistance of tea has rarely been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exogenous selenium application on the physiological and biochemical properties, antioxidant enzyme activity, and quality of tea under low-temperature stress (4celcius). The results showed that selenium treatment increased the net photosynthetic rate of leaves under low-temperature stress. Furthermore, it reduced the contents of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide to stabilize plant photosynthesis and the membrane system and to improve the cold tolerance of tea.Moreover, selenium treatment regulates the content of proline and increases the activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase and catalase to prevent oxidative damage caused by cold stress. In addition, treatment with selenium regulated changes in the secondary metabolites of tea under low-temperature stress, including reducing the oxidation products of polyphenols, increasing the polyphenol content, increasing sugar accumulation, and promoting the synthesis of various tea amino acids to improve tea quality.

AB  - Efficient transcriptional regulation of the stress response is critical for microorganism survival. In yeast, stress-related gene expression, particularly for antioxidant enzymes like catalases, mitigates reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), preventing cell damage. The halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii shows oxidative stress tolerance, largely due to high catalase activity from DhCTA and DhCTT genes. This study evaluates D. hansenii's response to oxidative stress caused by H2O2 under saline conditions, focusing on cell viability, gene expression, and catalase activity. Chromatin organization in the promoter of DhCTA and DhCTT was analyzed, revealing low nucleosome occupancy in promoter regions, correlating with active gene expression. Stress-related motifs for transcription factors like Msn2/4 and Sko1 were found, suggesting regulation by the DhHog1 MAP kinase. Analysis of a Dhhog1 Delta mutant showed DhHog1's role in DhCTA expression under H2O2 or NaCl conditions. These findings highlight DhHog1's critical role in regulating the stress response in D. hansenii, offering insights for enhancing stress tolerance in halotolerant yeasts, particularly for industrial applications in saline wastewater management.

AB  - Improving thermoelectric generators (TEGs) performance remains challenging in the context of energy crisis and thermal-pollution. Here, we present a strategy for thermal management and performance enhancement of TEGs by sustainable evaporative cooling utilizing highly hygroscopic and adhesive ionogels (PIGs). Rational swelling and poly-[2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (PDMAPS) chains with group interactions prevent lithium chloride (LiCl) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) leakage, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and MIL-101(Cr) optimize the evaporative cooling of PIGs. PIGs possess high sorption (252.72% at 25 degrees C, 90% RH for 12 h) and steady sorption-desorption kinetics. Meanwhile, PIGs exhibit high adhesion (130.89 N m(-1)) on TEGs. The evaporative cooling of PIGs enhances the temperature difference of TEGs. The potential of PIG-TEG is increased by three times at heat source temperatures of 50-80 degrees C, and the output power density stabilizes at similar to 706.25 mW m(-2) after heating at 50 degrees C for 1 h. Moreover, the PIG-TEG maintains stable output enhancement for prolonged time (over 24 h). Additionally, we integrate PIG-TEGs for the durable power supply of devices and design a movable model car, which utilizes waste heat for self-powering. PIGs realize effective thermoelectric output enhancement of TEGs, and provide ideas in clean energy conversion, wearable devices, and mobile power.

AB  - Brain tumor detection is a very important and challenging task. An efficient detection algorithm is of great importance to the practice of brain tumor medicine. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel optimization algorithm based on a shared-memory environment to solve the SVM classifier for brain tumor detection. Firstly, the HOG algorithm is used to extract brain tumor MR image features and compare them with the wavelet transform method. Secondly, SVM with symbolscript loss function is utilized as a classifier. Due to its sparsity, the detection speed is significantly faster. Finally, SMP-SGD, SMP-Momentum, SMP-Adagrad, and SMP-Adam algorithms are proposed and applied to the classifier solution. The experimental results show that the HOG algorithm extracts brain tumor MRI features more effectively than the discrete wavelet transform method. The proposed SMP-SGD algorithm and its variants achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency for brain tumor detection.

AB  - Pasture access is key to horse welfare, but during summer biting insects can cause discomfort and lead to health issues related to transmission of diseases and allergies. To measure the level of discomfort and whether access to shelters or other indoor areas may help prevent biting insect nuisance, we studied 39 horses: n = 21 with free indoor access (five groups) and n = 18 without indoor access (four groups) and recorded horse position (e.g., inside or outside), insect-repelling behaviour (e.g., tail swishing and head tossing), faeces cortisol metabolites, weather conditions, and insect prevalence through trap catches (e.g., tabanids which are known to attack horses). Data were collected one day per week per group for eight weeks during midsummer. Tail swishing (mean occurrence: 29.4 +/- 1.1 per min) and skin shivering (mean occurrence: 13.8 +/- 0.6 per min) were the most frequently recorded behaviours. The total frequency of insect-repelling behaviour was affected by treatment (indoor access vs. no access) and tabanid trap catches in interaction (F1281 = 8.08, P = 0.005), as more repelling behaviour was shown by horses without indoor access with increasing tabanid prevalence. Horses with indoor access were inside on 69% of recordings on days with a high tabanid prevalence vs. 14% on days with low tabanid prevalence. Concentrations of faeces cortisol metabolites did not differ between days with low vs. high tabanid prevalence. The following year, we conducted a small follow-up study on 13 horses (6 with free indoor access and 7 without) and recorded behaviour and saliva cortisol on four selected summer days with either low or high insect prevalence (2 "low' and 2 "high' days). On "high' insect days, saliva cortisol increased significantly in horses without indoor access, suggesting that biting insect nuisance is reflected in saliva cortisol concentrations. We conclude that free access to shelters or other indoor areas during summer reduce nuisance by biting insects and thereby can improve horse welfare.

AB  - Pigs can be an important model for preclinical biological research, including neurological diseases such as Alcohol Use Disorder. Such research often involves longitudinal assessment of changes in motor coordination as the disease or disorder progresses. Current motor coordination tests in pigs are derived from behavioral assessments in rodents and lack critical aspects of face and construct validity. While such tests may permit for the comparison of experimental results to rodents, a lack of validation studies of such tests in the pig itself may preclude the drawing of meaningful conclusions. To address this knowledge gap, an apparatus modeled after a horizontally placed ladder and where the height of the rungs could be adjusted was developed. The protocol that was employed within the apparatus mimicked the walk and turn test of the human standardized field sobriety test. Here, five Sinclair miniature pigs were trained to cross the horizontally placed ladder, starting at a rung height of six inches and decreasing to three inches in one-inch increments. It was demonstrated that pigs can reliably learn to cross the ladder, with few errors, under baseline/unimpaired conditions. These animals were then involved in a voluntary consumption of ethanol study where animals were longitudinally evaluated for motor coordination changes at baseline, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10% ethanol concentrations subsequently to consuming ethanol. Consistent with our predictions, relative to baseline performance, motor incoordination increased as voluntary consumption of escalating concentrations of ethanol increased. Together these data highlight that the horizontal ladder test (HLT) test protocol is a novel, optimized and reliable test for evaluating motor coordination as well as changes in motor coordination in pigs.

AB  - BackgroundSheep is one of the commodities of livestock which has been known widely in Indonesia for supporting the national food security. Improvement in genetic quality by selection based on genetic markers for growth is necessary to increase meat production. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in sheep suggests that Calpain 3 gene (CAPN3) gene might be one of the candidate loci affecting growth traits. CAPN3 is located on chromosome 7 sheep expressed in the skeletal muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate polymorphism CAPN3 intron 11 in Merino x Garut (MEGA) backcross using the PCR-RLFP method and to determine their association with growth traits.ResultsSNP intron 11 CAPN3 | BseSI of Merino x Garut (MEGA) backcross sheep was polymorphic and resulted in two alleles of C and T with a frequency of 0.76 and 0.24, respectively, and CC, CT, and TT genotypes with a frequency of 0.54, 0.43, and 0.02, respectively. These loci were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The SNP CAPN3 | BseSI significantly affected (P < 0.05) the birth weight in Merino x Garut (MEGA) backcross sheep.ConclusionThis result suggests that the CAPN3 | BseSI can be used as a genetic marker for birth weight trait in sheep.

AB  - Veterinary medicines are routinely used in animal husbandry and the environment may consequently be exposed to them via manure applications. This presents potential environmental and societal risks such as toxicological effects to aquatic/terrestrial organisms and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Regulatory studies that assess the degradability of veterinary antibiotics during manure storage currently permit the use of just one manure per animal type although we speculate that heterogenic properties such as pH could be driving significant variability within degradation rates. To bridge this knowledge gap and assess degradation variability with pH, laboratory degradation studies were performed on a broad range of antibiotics (ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and tylosin) at three different environmentally relevant pH levels (5.5, 7, and 8.5). The effect of pig slurry pH on degradation rates was found to be significant and compound specific. Usually, acidic slurries were found to inhibit degradation when compared to neutral pH, for florfenicol, tylosin, and ceftiofur; the associated changes in DT50 (half-life) values were 2-209 h, 35.28-234 h, and 0.98-2.13 h, respectively. In some circumstances alkaline slurries were observed to enhance the degradation rate when compared to those for neutral pH, for tylosin, the respective changes in DT50 values were from 3.52 to 35.28 h. Comparatively, the degradation of sulfamethoxazole was enhanced by acidic conditions compared to neutral (DT50 20.6-31.6 h).Tentative identification of unknown transformation products (TPs) was achieved for sulfamethoxazole and florfenicol for the first time in pig slurries. These results reveal the importance of considering slurry pH when assessing the degradation of antibiotic compounds, which has implications for the acidification of manures and the environmental risk assessment for veterinary medicines.
   Environmental relevance and significance: Given the significant effect of pig slurry pH on degradation rates, manure degradation studies need to be harmonised and standardized, taking into account the influence of pH.

AB  - In the field of species conservation, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is increasing in popularity as wildlife observation and monitoring tools. With large datasets created by UAV-based species surveying, the need arose to automate the detection process of the species. Although the use of computer learning algorithms for wildlife detection from UAV-derived imagery is an increasing trend, it depends on a large amount of imagery of the species to train the object detector effectively. However, there are alternatives like object-based image analysis (OBIA) software available if a large amount of imagery of the species is not available to develop a computer-learned object detector. The study tested the semi-automated detection of reintroduced Arabian Oryx (O. leucoryx), using the specie's coat sRGB-colour profiles as input for OBIA to identify adult O. leucoryx, applied to UAV acquired imagery. Our method uses lab-measured spectral reflection of hair sample values, collected from captive O. leucoryx as an input for OBIA ruleset to identify adult O. leucoryx from UAV survey imagery using semi-automated supervised classification. The converted mean CIE Lab reflective spectrometry colour values of n = 50 hair samples of adult O. leucoryx to 8-bit sRGB-colour profiles of the species resulted in the red-band value of 157.450, the green-band value of 151.390 and blue-band value of 140.832. The sRGB values and a minimum size permitter were added as the input of the OBIA ruleset identified adult O. leucoryx with a high degree of efficiency when applied to three UAV census datasets. Using species sRGB-colour profiles to identify re-introduced O. leucoryx and extract location data using a non-invasive UAV-based tool is a novel method with enormous application possibilities. Coat refection sRGB-colour profiles can be developed for a range of species and customised to autodetect and classify the species from remote sensing data.

AB  - The improper use of deltamethrin (DM) can result in its accumulation in soil, water, food, and even the human body, which is associated with an elevated risk of neurotoxicity and behavioral abnormalities; however, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently investigated. Emerging evidence underscores the significance of the gut-brain axis in central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions. Accordingly, this study investigates the role of the gut-brain axis in DM-induced behavioral anomalies in mice. The results showed that DM exposure induced depressive-like behavior, and the hippocampus, the region that is responsible for the modulation of emotional behavior, showed structural integrity disrupted (neuronal nuclear shrinkage and decreased tight junction protein expression). In addition, DM exposure led to compromised gut barrier integrity (disruptions on crypt surfaces and decreased tight junction protein expression), which might contribute to the gut bacterial-derived lipopolysac-charide (LPS) leakage into the bloodstream and reaching the brain, triggering LPS/toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated increases in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequently, we observed a disturbance in neuro-transmitter metabolic pathways following DM exposure, which inhibited the production of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Additionally, DM exposure resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis. Characteristic bacteria, such as Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Gram-negative bacterium cTPY-13, and Odoribacter exhibited significant correlations with behavior, tight junction proteins, inflammatory response, and neurotransmitters. Further fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments suggested that DM-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis might contribute to depressive-like behavior. These results provide a new perspective on the toxicity mechanism of DM, indicating that its neurotoxicity may be partially regulated by the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

AB  - Livestock expresses complex traits influenced by several factors. The response of animals to variations in climatic factors, such as increases in temperature, may induce heat stress conditions. In this study, animals living at different temperatures were compared using the genome-wide Wright fixation index (FST). A total of 825 genotypes of Sarda breed ewes were divided into two groups based on the flocks' average temperature over a 20-year period to compute the FST: 395 and 430 sheep were represented in colder and hotter groups, respectively. After LOWESS regression and CONTROL CHART application, 623 significant markers and 97 selection signatures were found. A total of 280 positional candidate genes were retrieved from a public database. Among these genomic regions, we found 51 annotated genes previously associated with heat stress/tolerance in ruminants (FCGR1A, MDH1, UGP2, MYO1G, and HSPB3), as well as immune response and cellular mechanisms related to how animals cope with thermal stress (RIPK1, SERPINB1, SERPINB9, and PELI1). Moreover, other genes were associated with milk fat (SCD, HERC3, SCFD2, and CHUK), body weight, body fat, and intramuscular fat composition (AGPAT2, ABCD2, MFAP32, YTHDC1, SIRT3, SCD, and RNF121), which might suggest the influence of environmental conditions on the genome of Sarda sheep.

AB  - Capitate glandular trichomes (CGTs) of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) are epidermal structures that facilitate interactions between the plant and various floral visitors. This study aimed to investigate the essential oil composition of an anther's CGTs during different reproductive stages of the sunflower capitulum. We examined the late development of CGTs using differential interference contrast and confocal microscopy to identify the secretory and post-secretory stages of glands during anthesis and post-anthesis of the disc flowers in a sunflower genotype with a high number of CGTs per anther (a fertility restorer, Rf975). Additionally, we analyzed, for the first time, the chemical composition of essential oils secreted by CGTs during anthesis and post-anthesis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on plants grown under field conditions. The GC-MS analysis from CGTs identified 13 organic compounds and their varying proportions at disc flower's anthesis and post-anthesis. Proportions of Phytol and Hexadecanal were significantly higher during anthesis than post-anthesis. Moreover, we observed an increase in monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids at post-anthesis. Among these, alpha-Pinene and beta-Gurjunene were the most abundant compounds in their respective groups. Our investigation reveals phenophase-dependent changes in the essential oil composition of sunflower anther CGTs. These findings suggest a dynamic "chemical code" generated by these glands, which may enhance communication with beneficial insects during anthesis (e.g., pollinators) and subsequently transition to a defensive function against post-pollination threats (e.g., herbivores).

AB  - Chemical variation is a critical aspect affecting performance among co-occurring plants. High chemical variation in metabolites with direct effects on insect herbivores supports chemical niche partitioning, and it can reduce the number of herbivores shared by co-occurring plant species. In contrast, low intraspecific variation in metabolites with indirect effects, such as induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), may improve the attraction of specialist predators or parasitoids as they show high specificity to insect herbivores. We explored whether induced chemical variation following herbivory by various insect herbivores differs between VOCs vs. secondary non-volatile metabolites (non-VOCs) and salicinoids with direct effects on herbivores in six closely related willow species. Willow species identity explained most variation in VOCs (18.4%), secondary non-VOCs (41.1%) and salicinoids (60.7%). The variation explained by the independent effect of the herbivore treatment was higher in VOCs (2.8%) compared to secondary non-VOCs (0.5%) and salicinoids (0.5%). At the level of individual VOCs, willow species formed groups, as some responded similarly to the same herbivores. Most non-VOCs and salicinoids were upregulated by sap-suckers compared to other herbivore treatments and control across the willow species. In contrast, induced responses in non-VOCs and salicinoids to other herbivores largely differed between the willows. Our results suggest that induced responses broadly differ between various types of chemical defences, with VOCs and non-VOCs showing different levels of specificity and similarity across plant species. This may further contribute to flexible plant responses to herbivory and affect how closely related plants share or partition their chemical niches.

AB  - Long-term use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) in supratherapeutic doses is associated with severe adverse effects, including physical, mental, and behavioral alterations. When used for recreational purposes several AAS are often combined, and in scientific studies of the physiological impact of AAS either a single compound or a cocktail of several steroids is often used. Because of this, steroid-specific effects have been difficult to define and are not fully elucidated. The present study used male Wistar rats to evaluate potential somatic and behavioral effects of three different AAS; the decanoate esters of nandrolone, testosterone, and trenbolone. The rats were exposed to 15 mg/kg of nandrolone decanoate, testosterone decanoate, or trenbolone decanoate every third day for 24 days. Body weight gain and organ weights (thymus, liver, kidney, testis, and heart) were measured together with the corticosterone plasma levels. Behavioral effects were studied in the novel object recognitiontest (NOR-test) and the multivariate concentric square field-test (MCSF-test). The results conclude that nandrolone decanoate, but neither testosterone decanoate nor trenbolone decanoate, caused impaired recognition memory in the NOR-test, indicating an altered cognitive function. The behavioral profile and stress hormone level of the rats were not affected by the AAS treatments. Furthermore, the study revealed diverse AAS-induced somatic effects i.e., reduced body weight development and changes in organ weights. Of the three AAS included in the study, nandrolone decanoate was identified to cause the most prominent impact on the male rat, as it affected body weight development, the weights of multiple organs, and caused an impaired memory function.

AB  - The medicinal use of rhino horn in Asia is a major driver of poaching and illegal trade. Research into the different actors involved in this trade is needed to inform policymaking and improve conservation outcomes. While researchers have investigated rhino horn consumers in Vietnam, studies have yet to focus on China. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey to investigate medicinal rhino horn consumption in China's Guangdong province. One in seven respondents reported having used rhino horn in the past year. These individuals tended to be older, male, wealthier and better educated; several healthcare usage variables were also associated with rhino horn consumption. These findings can help guide the development of tailored demand reduction interventions. Our results question the effectiveness of the global community's current approach to rhino conservation. We conclude by highlighting the need for conservationists to work more closely with key stakeholders to find lasting and sustainable solutions.

AB  - Understanding the defensive strategies of hyperaccumulators in plant-herbivore interactions is essential for their safe applications in phytoremediation. Sedum alfredii plants are widely applied in metal-contaminated soil where they were found to be easily damaged by herbivores. Thus, we investigated a comparative analysis of the defensive strategies from the perspective of constitutive leafy volatiles between the hyperaccumulator S. alfredii plant and its non-hyperaccumulator counterpart, along with feeding preference tests. Generalist snails prefer hyperaccumulators with lower content of metals while detested non-hyperaccumulators with relatively high food qualities in saccharides. Further leafy volatile profiles of the two ecotypes showed a total of 34 differentially enriched metabolites with 16 down-regulated organic compounds in the hyperaccumulators. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed two down-regulated metabolic pathways in phenylalanine metabolism and metabolic pathways due to the lower production of naphthalene and benzeneacetaldehyde, which are known herbivore deterrents and predator attractants. Hence, the high reliance on metals with the reduced performance of organic defense implied a trade-off between the two defensive strategies in the hyperaccumulator S. alfredii plants. Overall, this increased susceptibility to herbivores due to the lack of metals advocates the concerns and solutions for the safe application of this species in the phytoremediation practice.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the preference for, interest in, and behavior of growing pigs provided with three different suspended enrichment toys in a four-compartment environmental preference chamber (EPC). Sixty pigs at 70 +/- 2 days of age were divided into two contemporary groups. There were two distinct areas in each compartment of the EPC: one isolated area where two control pigs were housed with access to one type of toy, and one area with free access to the other compartments where five test pigs were housed for 5 days (D-1, D0, D1, D2, D3). Each week, a new group of pigs was introduced into the EPC; this procedure was repeated four times with a different contemporary group. Three different suspended toys (PET bottle; sisal rope; chain) were offered from D1 to D3 and were removed and washed at the end of the day. The toys and a control were randomly arranged in each EPC compartment (control; test). Focal animal sampling with recording interval of 10 min was used to determine the occurrence of behaviors (agonistic, idle, eating, drinking, vocalizing, stereotypic, positive, use of toy, others) from 8:00 to 11:00 h and from 13:00 to 16:00 h. Only for test pigs, for the 'use of toy', we also recorded which toy was being used as well as the duration it was used for. Samples for the determination of salivary cortisol and respiratory rate were taken on alternate days (D0; D2) at 7:0 0 and 13:0 0 h. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with fixed effects of group (test, control), day (D1, D2, D3), and period (7:0 0, 13:0 0 h -cortisol), as well as their interaction. Means were compared by the Tukey-Kramer or t-test ( P < 0.05). The sisal rope was the preferred toy in the test group ( P < 0.05), with a total duration of 70.8 +/- 3.9 min and 36.5 +/- 3.7 bouts, followed by the PET bottle (14.7 +/- 2.2 min; 12.0 +/- 1.6 bouts) and the chain (15.8 +/- 1.4 min; 12.4 +/- 0.9 bouts) ( P > 0.05). Test pigs also exhibited fewer idle bouts compared to control pigs ( P < 0.05). Control pigs preferred the sisal rope ( P < 0.05). Cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between treatment groups or sampling days, although they numerically decreased by 34.6% (7:00 h) and 17.8% (13:00 h) from D0 to D2. In conclusion, the preferred toy was the sisal rope, with a slight reduction in the number of bouts and duration over three days; however, this toy was still attractive to the pigs and reduced idle behavior when they have the possibility of choosing toys.

AB  - Livestock production is the basis of global food production and it is a serious threat to the environment. Significant environmental pollutants are odors and ammonia (NH3) emitted from livestock buildings. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration and emission factors of ammonia and odors, in the summer season, from a deep-litter fattening house. The research was carried out during summer in a mechanically ventilated fattening piggery located in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. Ammonia concentrations were measured using photoacoustic spectrometer Multi Gas Monitor Innova 1312, and odor concentrations were determined by dynamic olfactometry according to EN 13725:2003 using a TO 8 olfactometer. The NI-13 emission factors from the studied piggery, in summer, ranged from 8.53 to 21.71 g.day(-1)pig(-1), (mean value 12.54 +/- 4.89 g.day(-1)pig(-1)). Factors related to kg of body mass were from 0.11 to 0.23 g.day(-1).kg b.m.(-1) (mean value 0.17 +/- 0.06 g.day(-1).kg b.m.(-1)). Odor concentrations in the studied piggery were from 755 to 11775 ouE.m(-3) and they were diversified (coefficient of variation 43.8%). The mean value of the momentary odor emission factors was 179.5 +/- 78.7 ouE. s(-1).pig(-1). Factor related to kg of body mass was 2.27 +/- 1.71 ou(E).s.(-1).kg b.m.(-1). In Poland and many other countries, the litter systems of pigs housing are still very popular. Therefore, there is a need to monitor the pollutant emissions from such buildings to identify the factors influencing the amount of this emission. Another important issue is to verify whether the reduction techniques, giving a measurable effect in laboratory research, bring the same reduction effect in production buildings.

AB  - Optimising kid rearing is essential for sustainable dairy goat farming, yet validated parameters and practical benchmark data are lacking. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring kid-rearing practices through a participatory approach. Researchers, veterinarians and five dairy goat farms participated developed a prototype set of KPIs covering birth, colostrum management, average daily gain (ADG), and mortality, which were stratified across four rearing phases: perinatal (first 48 h), postnatal (birth to weaning), postweaning (weaning to 12 weeks), and final rearing (12 weeks to mating). The set of KPIs was subsequently tested for its added value but also for its feasibility in practice on the five participating farms as proof of principle. On these farms, data were gathered over a six-month period (June 2020-January 2021), combining routine census data with on-farm records. Only three out of five farms returned complete datasets encompassing data from 715 kids. Results revealed significant variation in rearing outcomes across farms, particularly in birth weights and postweaning growth. Birth weight emerged as a key predictor for ADG, while differences in weaning strategies had the greatest impact on postweaning performance. Although the farmers acknowledged the added value of the developed KPIs, collection of these data during the kidding season was challenging and required further automation to simplify data collection on the farm. This study demonstrates the feasibility and value of individual-level data collection in dairy goat systems and underscores the need for practical tools to support routine monitoring and data-driven management.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that host-plant traits affect herbivore population growth rates, which in turn modulates predator-prey interactions. However, while vector-borne plant pathogens often alter traits of both host plants and vectors, a few studies have assessed how pathogens may act as interaction modifiers within tri-trophic food webs. By applying a food web motif framework, we assessed how a vector-borne plant pathogen (Pea-enation mosaic virus, PEMV) modified both bottom-up (plant-herbivore) and top-down (predator-prey) interactions. Specifically, we assessed trophic interactions with PEMV-infectious Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid) vectors compared to non-infectious aphids in a factorial experiment that manipulated predator and plant communities. We show that PEMV altered bi-trophic relationships, whereby on certain plant species, PEMV reduced vector performance but also increased their susceptibility to predators. However, on other plant species, PEMV weakened top-down control or increased vector performance. Our results suggest that vector-borne plant pathogens are important interaction modifiers for plant-herbivore-predator dynamics: host-plant response to viruses can decrease herbivore abundance by reducing herbivore performance, but also increase herbivore abundance by weakening top-down control. Broadly speaking, trophic interactions that regulate herbivore outbreaks appear to be modified for herbivores actively transmitting viruses to host plants. Consequently, management and monitoring of outbreaking herbivores should consider the infection status of focal populations.

AB  - To achieve precise control over the particle size distribution (PSD) of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in optical nanocomposites, this study introduces a GBDT-RR (Gradient Boosted Decision Tree-Rosin-Rammler) framework to guide their synthesis. We first constructed a TiO2 synthesis-PSD data set based on hydrodynamic diameter by combining Syn-ext Llama with manual collaboration. Based on this data set, we integrated a GBDT model for high-precision prediction with an RR model for concise PSD representation. Moreover, this framework was embedded into a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm (GBDT-RR with BO) to develop an efficient synthesis reverse design platform. Experimental validation confirmed the platform's efficiency, with the computational process to guide the synthesis of 15 nm TiO2 NPs taking only 5 min. Feature importance analysis offered mechanistic insights into the nucleation process. Additionally, its versatility was proven by successful extension to ZrO2 and CeO2 NPs. In summary, the GBDT-RR framework and its associated synthesis reverse design platform represent a powerful, data-driven tool for the precise and efficient optimization of TiO2 NP PSDs, facilitating their applications in optical nanocomposites.

AB  - The deaf and hearing-impaired community expresses their emotions, communicates with society, and enhances the interaction between humans and computers using sign language gestures. This work presents a strategy for efficient feature extraction that uses a combination of two different methods that are the convolutional block attention module (CBAM)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) and standard handcrafted histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor. The proposed framework aims to enhance accuracy by extracting meaningful features and resolving issues like rotation, similar hand orientation, etc. The HOG feature extraction technique provides a compact feature representation that signifies meaningful information about sign gestures. The CBAM attention module is incorporated into the structure of CNN to enhance feature learning using spatial and channel attention mechanisms. Then, the final feature vector is formed by concatenating these features. This feature vector is provided to the classification layers to predict static sign gestures. The proposed approach is validated on two publicly available static Massey American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL) databases. The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Our proposed methodology achieved 99.22% and 99.79% accuracy for the ASL and ISL datasets. The acquired results signify the efficiency of the feature fusion and attention mechanism. Our network performed better in accuracy compared to the earlier studies.

AB  - Spermatogenesis involves a complex process of cellular differentiation maintained by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Being critical to male reproduction, it is generally assumed that spermatogenesis starts and ends in equivalent transcriptional states in related species. Based on single-cell gene expression profiling, it has been proposed that undifferentiated human spermatogonia can be subclassified into four heterogenous subtypes, termed states 0, 0A, 0B, and 1. To increase the resolution of the undifferentiated compartment and trace the origin of the spermatogenic trajectory, we re-analysed the single-cell (sc) RNA-sequencing libraries of 34 post-pubescent human testes to generate an integrated atlas of germ cell differentiation. We then used this atlas to perform comparative analyses of the putative SSC transcriptome both across human development (using 28 foetal and pre-pubertal scRNA-seq libraries) and across species (including data from sheep, pig, buffalo, rhesus and cynomolgus macaque, rat, and mouse). Alongside its detailed characterisation, we show that the transcriptional heterogeneity of the undifferentiated spermatogonial cell compartment varies not only between species but across development. Our findings associate 'state 0B' with a suppressive transcriptomic programme that, in adult humans, acts to functionally oppose proliferation and maintain cells in a ready-to-react state. Consistent with this conclusion, we show that human foetal germ cells-which are mitotically arrested-can be characterised solely as state 0B. While germ cells with a state 0B signature are also present in foetal mice (and are likely conserved at this stage throughout mammals), they are not maintained into adulthood. We conjecture that in rodents, the foetal-like state 0B differentiates at birth into the renewing SSC population, whereas in humans it is maintained as a reserve population, supporting testicular homeostasis over a longer reproductive lifespan while reducing mutagenic load. Together, these results suggest that SSCs adopt differing evolutionary strategies across species to ensure fertility and genome integrity over vastly differing life histories and reproductive timeframes.

AB  - A total of 297 wolf skulls from the collection of the Central Forest State Biosphere Reserve were studied for the presence of trauma. Of these, 129 (43.4 +/- 2.9%) skulls had trauma of various origins or a deformed sagittal crest. Aside from the sagittal crest, the level of trauma was 32.3 +/- 2.7%. Based on the causes of origin, the types of trauma were divided into three groups: those received when preying on moose, those sustained during aggressive intraspecific contacts, and accidental. Complicated fractures of dental crowns predominate among accidental trauma. Moose preying trauma and intraspecific aggression are more common in subadult wolves than in adults, which can be attributed to the elimination of injured animals. The frequency of occurrence of accidental trauma, on the contrary, increases with age. The level of trauma serves as a population characteristic, indicating tension in the predator-prey system and the degree of intraspecific aggression.

AB  - In the tea ecosystem, tea plants are exposed to attack by the smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai Yasuda (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Ascogaster reticulata Watanabe (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a solitary egg-larval parasitoid wasp that uses chemical cues from tea leaves to search for its host habitat. However, wasp responses to volatiles from egg-laden tea leaves, and plant signaling in response to oviposition by A. honmai, which also recruits parasitoids, are still unknown. Therefore, in this study, we examined wasp responses to volatiles from tea leaves treated with A. honmai egg or reproductive system (RS) homogenate. Although wasps did not show preference for volatiles of host egg-masses or RS homogenates themselves, they preferred egg-laden and RS-treated leaf volatiles to intact leaf volatiles. These results indicate that host plant responses involved in volatile emission attract wasps. Thus, we also investigated plant innate responses induced by A. honmai oviposition. Multiple defense related genes, including JA- and ET-signaling genes, were induced on RS-treated tea leaf. We also investigated gene expression profiles of the SA, JA and ET pathways in a nonhost plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In A. thaliana, expression of SA and ET-signaling genes was induced by egg treatment, but that of JA-signaling genes was down-regulated. These results suggest that volatile compounds induced by JA pathway may attract A. reticulata to host plant tea leaves.

AB  - Objective This study explored the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama 3 to summarize qualitative data from an online brain tumor support forum, assessing the differences between these methods and traditional thematic analysis.Methods Eight posts and responses were collected in September 2024 from the American Brain Tumor Association Brain Tumor Support Group, using the passive/unobtrusive method. The data were analyzed using two methods: (1) traditional thematic coding with Dedoose software and (2) summarization and interpretation using LLMs. Prompts guided the LLMs in generating summaries and identifying key challenges, with results evaluated using the metrics BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and BERTScore (f1). Flesch-Kincaid grade levels and readability ease scores were also calculated and compared.Results GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance across ROUGE and METEOR metrics, outperforming GPT-3.5 and Llama 3. Semantic similarity scores were comparable across models. GPT-4's capacity to process entire transcripts increased efficiency, while GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 required data segmenting. Summaries produced by LLMs aligned closely with human-generated thematic analysis, with significant reductions in time and labor.Conclusion LLMs, particularly GPT-4, show strong potential for summarizing complex, qualitative health data, offering time-efficient and consistent outputs. These tools may enhance research efficiency and support in patient-centered environments. However, challenges such as training data biases and capacity limitations in some models warrant further investigation.

AB  - Site fidelity-returning repeatedly to the same site-can help many migratory species reduce uncertainty in their environment, especially when migratory stopover periods leave little time to explore and evaluate new habitat. Avian taxa, though, have shown wide variation in their levels of site fidelity during migration, and few studies have been able to examine individual-level fidelity at fine spatiotemporal scales. We used a high-resolution GPS tracking dataset of Numenius phaeopus (Whimbrel), a long-distance migratory shorebird, to assess levels of fidelity to specific foraging and roosting sites during migration, both within and between stopover seasons. We found that individuals are almost exclusively faithful to one shared roost site at night, but disperse to individual foraging territories during the day that overlap with each other by <20%. Individuals remain faithful to these distinct territories over time, on average shifting the center of their daily home ranges by <1.5 km within a single season, and overlapping with their previous season's home range by 70% when they return during subsequent stopovers. Our findings reveal for the first time that a shorebird species exhibits fine-scale, individual foraging site fidelity during and between migratory stopovers-an important insight to inform effective conservation and management action.

AB  - BackgroundPreterm birth is associated with brain injury and long-term behavioral abnormalities, for which there are limited prevention options. When born preterm, infants prematurely lose placental neurosteroid (allopregnanolone) support. This increases the risk of excitotoxic damage to the brain, which increases the risk of injury, causing long-term deficits in behavior, myelination, and alterations to neurotransmitter pathways. We propose that postnatal restoration of neurosteroid action through zuranolone therapy will reduce neurological impairments following preterm birth.Methods:Guinea pig dams underwent survival cesarean section surgery to deliver pups prematurely (GA64) or at term (GA69). Between birth and term equivalence age, preterm pups received vehicle (15% beta-cyclodextrin) or the allopregnanolone analogue zuranolone (1 mg/kg/day). Behavioral analysis was performed at postnatal day (PND) 7 and 40, before tissue collection at PND 42. Immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP), as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction to characterize oligodendrocyte lineage and neurotransmitter pathways, was performed in frontal cortex tissues.Results:Zuranolone treatment prevented the hyperactive phenotype in preterm-born offspring, most markedly in males. Additionally, preterm-related reductions in MBP were ameliorated. Several preterm-related alterations in mRNA expression of dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic pathways were also restored back to that of a term control level.Conclusion:This is the first study to assess zuranolone treatment as a neuroprotective therapy following preterm birth. Zuranolone treatment improved behavioral outcomes and structural changes in the preterm offspring, which continued long term until at least a late childhood timepoint. Clinical studies are warranted for further exploring the neuroprotective possibilities of this treatment following preterm birth.
   Preterm-born guinea pigs displayed hyperactive behavior, reduced myelin, and disrupted neurotransmitter pathway expression at late childhood equivalence. Treatment with zuranolone in the immediate postnatal period following preterm birth was able to prevent these deficits from occurring and restore behavioral abnormalities to a term-born phenotype. image

AB  - Termites have become a global concern, and their effective management has remained a challenge since time immemorial. Certain microbial and botanical agents have been used for their management, but their efficacy has been compromised, particularly in field conditions. Hence, the current study was designed to check the efficacy of low doses of different pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, fipronil, bifenthrin, and chlorantraniliprole, against mortality and behavioral responses of Odontotermes obesus at two different temperatures (16 +/- 1 and 26 +/- 1 degrees C). The discrete behavioral symptoms included intoxication, ataxia, moribundity, and death. Laboratory-maintained termite workers were exposed to different concentrations of pesticides through a filter paper bioassay. All tested pesticides and their concentrations differed significantly regarding their lethal time (LT50) values compared to the mortality of termite workers. Moreover, the LT50 values of pesticides gradually decreased with increased pesticidal concentrations. Temperature also had a significant effect on the efficacy of tested pesticides as all pesticides showed better results at higher temperatures. At both tested temperatures, chlorantraniliprole (5 ppm) proved to be the most effective pesticide against termite workers. Similarly, the behavioral symptoms also varied depending on pesticides and their administered concentrations and existed for a relatively longer time span at lower temperatures. In most cases, the order of responses was moribundity, followed by intoxication and ataxia. Moribundity and intoxication were the most frequently observed symptoms for chlorpyriphos and bifenthrin-treated termite workers. In the case of fipronil, intoxication was the most pronounced symptom. Similarly, the maximum value of ataxia was recorded in the case of chlorantraniliprole. However, moribund symptoms lasted longer in all tested concentrations of chlorantraniliprole, followed by ataxia and intoxication. The overall order of toxicity was chlorantraniliprole > bifenthrin > fipronil > chlorpyrifos. These pesticides, at their low doses, did not exhibit any repellent action and were not detected by the foraging termite workers. Moreover, their slow action mechanism makes them a suitable candidate for infecting whole colonies away from treated surfaces. Therefore, these pesticides can be successfully incorporated into different integrated termite management programs to keep the plantation free from threatening underground pests.

AB  - This study reports on rhinocerotoid fossils from the Oligocene-Pleistocene strata of the Linxia Basin of Gansu Province, northwestern China. Rhinoceroses have been important components of mammalian faunas of these beds, and include the Late Oligocene giant rhinos (paraceratheres) and the Late Miocene hornless rhinos (aceratheres). As a result of their high diversity, wide geographical distribution and rapid evolution, rhinoceroses are good markers for stratigraphic division and may be used for intercontinental correlations. The Late Oligocene fauna of the Linxia Basin occurs in the lower part of the Jiaozigou Formation. Among 12 species of large mammal fossils, nine are of the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea, and giant rhinos are dominant. Rhinoceroses of the Middle Miocene fauna reflect a forest environment. Comparison with contemporaneous European rhinoceroses suggests a dispersal route for populations along the north side of the Tibetan Plateau. Rhinoceroses were most abundant in the Linxia Basin in the Late Miocene times. The most primitive species of the genus Chilotherium and the huge elasmotheres are key indicators for the base of the Upper Miocene (Tortonian). From the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene, the assemblages of the three-toed horse Hipparion comprise five horizons, each of which has different rhinocerotid fossils as markers of division and correlation. Because of the strong competition by ruminants, rhinoceroses declined greatly in the Early Pleistocene fauna. At that time, only a species of the woolly rhino persisted, but as an intermediate form, Coelodonta nihowanensis of the Linxia Basin can still connect the Pliocene Zanda Basin of the Tibetan Plateau and the Early Pleistocene Nihewan Basin of the North China Plain.

AB  - Long-term spaceflights and simulated microgravity negatively affect the number of cognitive functions, including memory, learning, spatial orientation, and decision making. At the same time, it was shown that cognitive processes are regulated by hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we analyzed the effect of 3-day antiorthostatic (hindlimb) unloading on the activity of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult male CD1 mice. Our results showed that 3-day hindlimb unloading did not affect cell proliferation and population size of immature doublecortin-positive neurons but induced a decrease in the number of early nestin-positive neural progenitors. Analysis of signaling cascades involved in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis revealed no changes in the activity of ERK1/2 protein kinases but a significant increase in the expression and activity of the CREB transcription factor. In addition, mice exposed to 3-day hindlimb unloading demonstrated significantly elevated serum corticosterone concentrations and increased expression of glucocorticoid receptors in granule cells and hippocampal CA3 subfield, suggesting the development of stress response. Thus, stress caused by the adaptation to hindlimb unloading can be a crucial factor that mediates impairments of hippocampal neurogenesis under conditions of short-term simulated microgravity.

AB  - The unique male pregnancy in pipefishes and seahorses ranges from basic attachment (pouch-less species: Nerophinae) of maternal eggs to specialized internal gestation in pouched species (e.g. Syngnathus and Hippocampus) with many transitions in between. Due to this diversity, male pregnancy offers a unique platform for assessing physiological and molecular adaptations in pregnancy evolution. These insights will contribute to answering long-standing questions of why and how pregnancy evolved convergently in so many vertebrate systems. To understand the molecular congruencies and disparities in male pregnancy evolution, we compared transcriptome-wide differentially expressed genes in four syngnathid species, at four pregnancy stages (nonpregnant, early, late and parturition). Across all species and pregnancy forms, metabolic processes and immune dynamics defined pregnancy stages, especially pouched species shared expression features akin to female pregnancy. The observed downregulation of adaptive immune genes in early-stage pregnancy and its reversed upregulation during late/parturition in pouched species, most notably in Hippocampus, combined with directionless expression in the pouch-less species, suggests immune modulation to be restricted to pouched species that evolved placenta-like systems. We propose that increased foeto-paternal intimacy in pouched syngnathids commands immune suppression processes in early gestation, and that the elevated immune response during parturition coincides with pouch opening and reduced progeny reliance. Immune response regulation in pouched species supports the recently described functional MHC II pathway loss as critical in male pregnancy evolution. The independent co-option of similar genes and pathways both in male and female pregnancy highlights immune modulation as crucial for the evolutionary establishment of pregnancy.

AB  - A high-quality reference genome is quite valuable in assessing the conservation status of a rare species when adequate data from other sources are unavailable. Bats comprise almost a fifth of all mammals and contribute greatly to the ecosystem. However, due to the nocturnal and elusive habits, it is difficult to obtain the accurate census population size of a rare bat species and assess its conservation status. Here, we generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the king horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus rex) and assess its conservation status by comparing the genome-wide summary statistics with other related species. The genome assembly size was 2.1 Gb (contig N50: 75.26 Mb) and 99.9% of the total sequences were anchored onto 30 autosomes, X and Y chromosomes. Despite lower genome-wide heterozygosity and recent inbreeding, R. rex did not exhibit a higher genetic load compared with the other two Rhinolophus species. Historical demography analysis revealed that R. rex maintained a long-term (similar to 2 million years) stable population size (similar to 150,000). In the future, whole-genome sequencing data from more individuals will be needed to comprehensively assess the conservation status at recent timescales. We also reconstructed the ancestral karyotype of Rhinolophus as 2n = 54 and found that Robertsonian fissions and fusions were the main mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in this genus. Overall, our study shows important implications of reference-quality genomes in both conservation genomics and comparative genomics.

AB  - Circadian rhythms influence virtually all aspects of physiology and behavior. This is problematic when circadian rhythms no longer reliably predict time. Circadian rhythm disruption can impair memory, yet we don't know how this fully works at the systems and molecular level. When trying to determine the root of a memory impairment, assessing neuronal activation with c-FOS is useful. This has yet to be assessed in the hippocampi of circadian rhythm disrupted rats in a hippocampal gold standard task. Rats were trained on the Morris water task (MWT), then received 6 days of a 21-h day (T21), 13 days of a normal light dark cycle, probe trial, and tissue extraction an hour later. Despite having impaired memory in the probe trial, compared to controls there were no differences in c-FOS expression in hippocampal sub regions: CA1; CA3; Dentate gyrus. These data confirm others in hamsters demonstrating that arrhythmicity which produces an impairment in spontaneous alternation does not affect c-FOS in the dentate gyrus. The current study indicates that the memory impairment induced by a lighting manipulation is likely not due to attenuated neuronal activation. Determining how the master clock in the brain communicates with the hippocampus is needed to untangle the relationship between circadian rhythms and memory.

AB  - Abundant conodont faunas from the subsurface of British Columbia, Canada, allow the correlation of Lower and Middle Triassic strata with outcrop sections in British Columbia, the Canadian Arctic and the western USA, as well as recording the previously recognized radiation of neogondolellin conodonts in the early Spathian. Twentyeight samples collected from the Progress Hz Caribou D-040-H/094-G-07 and Progress Hz Laprise A-082-I/094G-01 wells yielded more than 1100 conodont specimens, representing twenty-nine pectiniform species belonging to fourteen genera. These faunas enable the recognition of the Dienerian-Smithian, Smithian-Spathian, and Spathian-Anisian boundaries in these wells. Five of the conodont species recognized in the Smithian and Spathian samples are new: Neogondolella n. sp. A, Borinella n. sp. A, Magnigondolella. n. sp. A, Columbitella n. sp. A, and Co. talpa sp. nov. Together with these new segminiplanate species, several other neogondolellin conodonts occur. These faunas are the manifestation in British Columbia of the previously recognized increase in abundance of neogondolellin conodonts in the early Spathian, and they are consistent with hypotheses in which the earliest species of Magnigondolella evolved from Borinella by a progressive fusion of the denticles of the carina. These conodonts help to characterize the events around the globally significant Smithian-Spathian boundary, and to correlate this boundary in North America.

AB  - This research developed an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating pollutant loads from pig farming. The behavior of farmer agents was captured using concepts from the theory of planned behavior. The ABM has three basic components: the household or farmer agent, the land patches, and global parameters that capture the environmental context. The model was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis and then validated using data from a household survey, which showed that the predictive ability of the model was good. The ABM was then used in three scenarios: a baseline scenario, a positive scenario in which the number of pigs was assumed to remain stable but supporting policies for environmental management were increased, and a negative scenario, which assumed the number of pigs increases but management measures did not improve relative to the baseline. The positive scenario showed reductions in the discharged loads for many sub-basins of the study area while the negative scenario indicated that increased loads will be discharged to the environment. The scenario results suggest that to maintain the development of pig production while ensuring environmental protection for the district, financial, and technical support must be provided to the pig producers. The experience and education level of the farmers were significant factors influencing behaviors related to manure reuse and treatment, so awareness raising through environmental communication is needed in addition to technical measures.

AB  - Plants are attacked by multiple insect pest species and insect herbivory can alter plant defense mechanisms. The plant defense responses to a specific herbivore may also contribute to the herbivore growth/survival on plants. Feeding by one insect species can modulate the plant defenses, which can either facilitate or hamper the colonization of subsequent incoming insects. However, little is known about the effect of sequential herbivory on sorghum plants. In this study, we demonstrate that a specialist aphid, sugarcane aphid (SCA; Melanaphis sacchari) grows faster on sorghum than a generalist aphid species, greenbug (GB; Schizaphis graminum). We also determined how the pre-infestation of SCA on sorghum affected the invasion of GB and vice-versa. Our sequential herbivory experiments revealed that SCA reproduction was lower on GB-primed sorghum plants, however, the reverse was not true. To assess the differences in plant defenses induced by specialist vs. generalist aphids, we monitored the expression of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) marker genes, and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes after 48 h of aphid infestation. The results indicated that GB infestation induced higher expression of SA and JA-related genes, and flavonoid pathway genes (DFR, FNR, and FNSII) compared to SCA infestation. Overall, our results suggested that GB-infested plants activate the plant defenses via phytohormones and flavonoids at early time points and hampers the colonization of incoming SCA, as well as explain the reproductive success of SCA compared to GB.

AB  - The ability to use environmental geometry when orienting in space reflects an animal's ability to use a global, allocentric framework. Therefore, understanding when and how animal's use geometry relative to other types of cues in the environment has interested comparative cognition researchers for decades. Yet, only two amphibians have been tested to date. We trained the poison frog Dendrobates auratus to find goal shelters in a rectangular arena, in the presence and absence of a feature cue, and assessed the relative influence of the two types of cues using probe trials. We chose D. auratus because the species has complex interactions with their physical and social environments, including parental care that requires navigating to and from distant locations. We found that, like many vertebrates, D. auratus are capable of using geometric information to relocate goals. In addition, the frogs preferentially used the more reliable feature cue when the location of the feature conflicted with the geometry of the arena. The frogs were equally successful at using the feature cue when it was proximal or distal to the goal shelter, consistent with prior studies that found that D. auratus can use distal cues in a flexible manner. Our results provide further evidence that amphibians can use environmental geometry during orientation. Future studies that examine when and how amphibians use geometry relative to other types of cues will contribute to a more complete picture of spatial cognition in this important, yet understudied, group.

AB  - BackgroundFocal and diffuse pathology resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) often disrupts brain circuitry that is critical for episodic memory, including medial temporal lobe and prefrontal regions. Prior studies have focused on unitary accounts of temporal lobe function, associating verbally learned material and brain morphology. Medial temporal lobe structures, however, are domain-sensitive, preferentially supporting different visual stimuli. There has been little consideration of whether TBI preferentially disrupts the type of visually learned material and its association with cortical morphology following injury. Here, we investigated whether (1) episodic memory deficits differ according to the stimulus type, and (2) the pattern in memory performance can be linked to changes in cortical thickness. MethodsForty-three individuals with moderate-severe TBI and 38 demographically similar healthy controls completed a recognition task in which memory was assessed for three categories of stimuli: faces, scenes, and animals. The association between episodic memory accuracy on this task and cortical thickness was subsequently examined within and between groups. ResultsOur behavioral results support the notion of category-specific impairments: the TBI group had significantly impaired accuracy for memory for faces and scenes, but not animals. Moreover, the association between cortical thickness and behavioral performance was only significant for faces between groups. ConclusionTaken together, these behavioral and structural findings provide support for an emergent memory account, and highlight that cortical thickness differentially affects episodic memory for specific categories of stimuli.

AB  - Simple Summary Sperm suffers damage from reactive oxygen species stress (ROS) during cryopreservation. Supplementation of antioxidants is suggested to reduce sperm cryodamage induced by ROS. Proline has been regarded as a powerful antioxidant. However, there is no information on the role proline plays during goat sperm cryopreservation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of proline during goat sperm cryopreservation procedures. In the present study, supplementation of 2 mM proline significantly enhanced post-thaw goat sperm quality by regulating sperm redox homeostasis. Proline supplementation protects goat sperm against ROS stress through PRODH-mediated metabolism. Sperm cryopreservation contributes to the extensive utilization of artificial insemination (AI) in the daily livestock industry. However, due to the presence of few sperm with good biological function in post-thaw goat sperm, its use has been limited for AI purposes. Hence, its improvement has been the focus of many research studies. This study aimed to investigate the effects of proline supplementation of the freezing medium on goat sperm. The goat semen was cryopreserved with freezing medium supplementation of different concentrations of proline (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mM). The post-thaw sperm motility patterns, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) activity, superoxide dis-mutase (SOD) activity, glutathione (GSH) levels and GSH/GSSG were evaluated. Likewise, the expression and immunofluorescent localization of PRODH in post-thaw goat sperm was also detected. It was observed that addition of 2 mM proline to the freezing medium significantly enhanced post-thaw goat sperm total motility, progressive motility, straight-linear velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), straightness (STR), linearity (LIN), membrane integrity and acrosome integrity. Interestingly, PRODH was expressed in post-thaw goat sperm, especially in the post-acrosome and sperm tail. Addition of 2 mM proline also significantly increased the post-thaw sperm PRODH activity compared to the control. Moreover, post-thaw goat sperm LPO levels and MDA levels were reduced by supplementation of 2 mM proline. Furthermore, compared to the control, the values of post-thaw goat sperm T-AOC, SOD activity, GSH level and GSH/GSSG were also significantly increased in 2 mM proline treatment. Reduction of post-thaw goat sperm apoptosis in 2 mM proline treatment was also observed as the levels of Caspase3 and Caspase9 were decreased by the supplementation with 2 mM proline. These observations suggest that the addition of 2 mM proline to the freezing medium increased post-thaw goat sperm quality by reducing oxidative stress during cryopreservation. These findings also provide novel insights into the use of proline as an efficient additive to enhance post-thaw goat sperm quality during cryopreservation.

AB  - Food shortages in goats have made it necessary to search for nutritional alternatives for them, such as hydroponic green forage, as well as the evaluation of their positive response to these alternative diets. It was thus decided to evaluate the concentration of metabolites in dairy goats fed with green hydroponic wheat and corn forages, during pregnancy and lactation, in addition to the relationship between productive parameters and the offered diet. For this experiment 280 blood samples were obtained from 40 French Alpine primiparous goats. The determination of metabolites was carried out by colorimetry. Statistical data were analyzed using a mixed model of divided plots, with repeated measurements in time and Pearson's test for productive parameters. Metabolite concentrations were in normal ranges, increasing to meet the nutritional needs of the young during lactation. A positive correlation was also found between glucose concentration and diet, as well as between growth and weaning of the kids, but this was not the case of urea, nor non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), the latter having a greater relationship with the birth of the kids.

AB  - The culing of injured and non-viable pigs (Sus scrofa) (neonate to breeding stock) is a routine and necessary procedure on most farms. Usualy, pigs are culled using one of the following methods: blunt-force trauma (manual and mechanical), captive-bolt stunners, electrical stunning and electrocution or carbon dioxide. Manual blunt-force trauma is one of the most widely used methods due to its low or absent operational and investment costs. However, as a method, it has serious limitations, which include the risk of incomplete concussion, pain, and distress. Manual blunt-force trauma is also aesthetically unpleasant to operators and wider society. To address these issues there has been significant recent research into the development of alternatives to manual blunt-force trauma, these include: captive-bolt stunners, on-farm, gas-based controlled atmosphere systems, low atmospheric pressure systems and electrical stunning. Some of these are currently in commercial use while others are still in the developmental phase. This review brings together the relevant research in this field, evaluating the methods in terms of mechanism of action (mechanical and physiological), effectiveness and animal welfare.

AB  - Home range is a fundamental characteristic of an animal natural history. The study of home range provides information on the sites where organisms forage for food, find shelter, or locate mates. Home range size and shape can change throughout the lifespan of an organism, during the year, or across seasons, driven by resource availability and the basic needs for each organism. For freshwater and semi-aquatic turtles, home range is greatly affected by water availability, humidity, and temperature throughout the year, nevertheless demographic factors such age and sex are also important determinants of home range size. In this study we estimated home range and dispersal movements for Kinosternon creaseri, Terrapene yucatana, and Rhinoclemmys areolata in a semi-tropical dry forest in central Yucat & aacute;n. For a two-year period, turtles were surveyed using hoop traps and visual encounters. Twenty-one individuals (5-8 per species) were equipped with radio transmitters to track them across the landscape. Distances between relocations and home range were compared across species seasons, sex, and interactions of these variables. Monthly average movements were positively correlated with rain in the three species studied. Home range of R. areolata was larger than those of K. creaseri and T. yucatana. Home range of the three studied species were larger during the wet season. Home range overlap index within same species individuals was higher during the rainy than dry season, but overall overlap is low between and within species.

AB  - Simple Summary Growth qualities are critical economic traits that substantially impact pork yield. Here, we evaluated the effect of somatostatin (SS) DNA vaccines on growth promotion in fattening pigs. Our results demonstrate that immunisation with SS DNA vaccine induces cellular and humoral immunity in fattening pigs, producing anti-SS antibodies that neutralise endogenous SS, thereby promoting daily gain and slaughter weight. In addition, the vaccine does not pose a safety challenge. Consequently, it is possible to accelerate the growth of fattening pigs through the immune SS DNA vaccine, which will bring more economic benefits to the company and the farmer. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SS DNA vaccine on growing pigs. Randomly, 147 pigs were divided into four groups, treatment 1 (T1, 3 x 10(9) CFU/mL, n = 39), T2 (3 x 10(8) CFU/mL, n = 35), T3 (3 x 10(7) CFU/mL, n = 35) and control group (phosphate-buffered saline, n = 38). All animals received two vaccinations separated by 45 days and the same diet and management. The results showed that all treatment groups (T1, T2 and T3) had significantly higher slaughter weight (d 185) than the Ctrl group (p < 0.05), and daily gain between 50 and 110 days of age was significantly higher in all treatment groups than in the Ctrl group (p < 0.05). Antibody-positive pigs have significantly higher daily weight gain than that in antibody-negative pigs (p < 0.05). The results of the meat quality analysis showed no significant changes between the P (antibody-positive pigs) and N (antibody-negative pigs) groups. Furthermore, the results showed that antibody titres at 110 and 185 days had a significant positive correlation with the daily weight gain (p < 0.05) and a significant negative correlation with the backfat thickness (p < 0.05). Evaluating the safety of vaccines by PCR amplification of target genes (GS/2SS), faecal, soil and water samples had no target genes detected by PCR amplification in these samples after 5 days, and no GS/2SS were detected in the blood and tissues for the experimental period. Moreover, no abnormalities were found in pathological sections of the P group compared with the N group. In conclusion, SS DNA vaccines can promote the growth of fattening pigs to a certain extent without altering the meat quality, and it has no effects on the safety of the surrounding environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Constructing a contactless pig mass estimation method through computer vision technology can help us to adjust our pig breeding program to improve production efficiency. Due to the complexity of the actual production environment, there are few reports on pig mass estimation in an unconstrained environment. In this study, we constructed a pig mass estimate model based on deep learning without constraint. The experimental results proved that the pig body mass estimation model constructed in this paper can quickly and accurately obtain the body mass of pigs. The model can evaluate the body quality of sows in real-time in an unconstrained environment, thereby providing data support for grading and adjusting breeding plans, and has broad application prospects. The body mass of pigs is an essential indicator of their growth and health. Lately, contactless pig body mass estimation methods based on computer vision technology have gained attention thanks to their potential to improve animal welfare and ensure breeders' safety. Nonetheless, current methods require pigs to be restrained in a confinement pen, and no study has been conducted in an unconstrained environment. In this study, we develop a pig mass estimation model based on deep learning, capable of estimating body mass without constraints. Our model comprises a Mask R-CNN-based pig instance segmentation algorithm, a Keypoint R-CNN-based pig keypoint detection algorithm and an improved ResNet-based pig mass estimation algorithm that includes multi-branch convolution, depthwise convolution, and an inverted bottleneck to improve accuracy. We constructed a dataset for this study using images and body mass data from 117 pigs. Our model achieved an RMSE of 3.52 kg on the test set, which is lower than that of the pig body mass estimation algorithm with ResNet and ConvNeXt as the backbone network, and the average estimation speed was 0.339 s center dot frame(-1) Our model can evaluate the body quality of pigs in real-time to provide data support for grading and adjusting breeding plans, and has broad application prospects.

AB  - IFITM3 is interferon-induced transmembrane 3, which plays an extremely key role in anti-proliferation, antivirus and anti-tumor diseases. In this study, the yak (Bos grunniens) IFITM3 (BgIFITM3) gene contained a 5 '-untranslated region (UTR) (25 bp), a coding region (441 bp), and a 3 '-UTR (115 bp). The expression of BgIFITM3 gene in liver was significantly higher than that in heart, spleen, lung and kidney (P < 0.01). BgIFITM3 protein was localized on the yak hepatocyte plasma membrane, and its expression was significantly different between 1 day and 15 months of age (P < 0.05). Moreover, the prokaryotic expression vector of BgIFITM3 protein was constructed and expressed successfully, with a molecular weight of 19.5 kDa. The activities of yak hepatocyte were significantly inhibited after treating with BgIFITM3 protein (10 and 20 mu g/mL) (P < 0.01). The expression levels of ERBB-2, IRS-1, PI3KR-1, AKT-1 and MAPK-3 were significantly lower after treating with 20 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein (P < 0.05). Besides, the activities of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treating with BgIFITM3 protein (1, 10 and 20 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). While, the cloning ability and migration ability of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treating with 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein (P < 0.05). Finally, the mitochondria of HepG2 cells was concentrated, cristae widened, and the double film density of mitochondria was increased after treating with 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein. After 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein treating, the expression levels of VDAC-2, VDAC-3 and p53 genes were significantly increased, but the expression level of GPX-4 gene was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Taken together, the BgIFITM3 protein could inhibit the proliferations of yak hepatocyte and HepG2 cells by regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway or ferroptosis-related genes, respectively. These results benefit for further study of the function of BgIFITM3 protein.

AB  - We hypothesized that human chorionic gonadotropic (hCG) could replace LH in the maturation media for buffalo oocytes, and hCG administration before ovum pick-up (OPU) enhances in-vitro development of buffalo oocytes. Objectives were 1) to investigate the effect of hCG supplementation on nuclear maturation, oocyte development, and granulosa cell mRNA abundance of genes related to growth and antioxidant pathways and 2) to determine the effect of hCG administration before OPU on in-vitro oocyte development. In Experiment 1, buffalo oocytes retrieved from slaughterhouse ovaries were maturated in the media supplemented with 0.5 mu g of LH or 2 IU of hCG. After fertilization, cleavage and embryo were assessed on 48 h and 7 d of the culture, respectively. The nuclear maturation of the oocytes and granulosa cells mRNA abundance of genes (AREG, EREG, NRG1, CYP19A1, GDF9, CASP9, SOD1) were assessed after maturation. In Experiment 2, buffaloes were synchronized and superstimulated with FSH and 6 h before OPU, randomly assigned to either receive saline (CON, n = 4) or 1500 IU of hCG (hCG, n = 6). Four OPU sessions per buffalo were conducted at weekly intervals and retrieved oocytes were maturated and fertilized in-vitro. In Experiment 1, nuclear maturation, cleavage, embryo production, and mRNA abundance of the genes related to growth and steroidogenesis did not differ between treatments but SOD1 gene expression tended (P = 0.10) to lower in hCG treatment as compared with LH. In Experiment 2, oocytes retrieved from hCG-treated buffaloes resulted in a higher proportion of cleavage (84.0 vs. 42.5 +/- 8.9 %, P = 0.02) and embryo (84.0 vs 24.0 +/- 7.3, P < 0.01) than CON. In conclusion, hCG supplementation in the maturation media yielded comparable outcomes to that of LH, and hCG administration 6 h before OPU enhanced the in-vitro developmental competency of the buffalo oocytes.

AB  - Little is known regarding the interplay between microbiota and pancreas functions in humans as investigations are usually limited to distal sites, namely the analyses of fecal samples. The aim of this study was to investigate both ileal and fecal microbiota in response to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in a porcine model of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). PERT was stopped for ten days in ileo-cecal fistulated minipigs with experimentally induced EPI (n = 8) and ileal digesta as well as fecal samples were obtained before withdrawal, during withdrawal and after the reintroduction of PERT. Profound community changes occurred three days after enzyme omission and were maintained throughout the withdrawal phase. A reduction in alpha-diversity together with relative abundance changes in several taxa, in particular increases in Bifidobacteria (at both sites) and Lactobacilli (only feces) were observed. Overall, dysbiosis events from the ileum had accumulating effects in distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract with additional alterations occurring only in the colon. Changes were reversible after continuing PERT, and one week later, bacterial communities resembled those at baseline. Our study demonstrates the rapid and profound impacts of enzyme withdrawal in bacterial communities, contributing to our understanding of the interplay between pancreas function and microbiota.

AB  - Semiochemicals are chemical substances utilized by insects use to modify their physiology and behaviour and are classified as pheromones (intraspecific effects) and allelochemicals (interspecific effects). It plays a crucial role in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as a marker of insect presence and a behavioural modifier that prevents pest dissemination and multiplication. Insect populations can be managed using various attractant-based strategies such as monitoring, mass trapping and attracting insect pests. These management methods require understanding insect chemical ecology and identifying the cues involved. Semiochemicals for managing key insect pests of coconut have been extensively studied. However, practical utility and awareness among farmers are limited. Major coconut pests are managed with effective and efficient attractants, pheromones and host volatiles. Semiochemical applications are gaining importance as a primary management strategy and provide significant scope for sustainable and eco-friendly pest management. Despite the noteworthy strides in developing semiochemical-based pest management approaches for coconut, a critical gap exists for further innovations to evolve solutions applicable to a broader array of significant pests and establish sustainable and highly effective pest management strategies. In light of this, the use of semiochemical techniques for sustainable pest management in coconut plantations is extensively discussed in this review.

AB  - Chromosomal inversions can play an important role in divergence and reproductive isolation by building and maintaining distinct allelic combinations between evolutionary lineages. Alternatively, they can take the form of balanced polymorphisms that segregate within populations until one arrangement becomes fixed. Many questions remain about how inversion polymorphisms arise, how they are maintained over the long term, and ultimately, whether and how they contribute to speciation. The long-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) is genetically subdivided into geographic lineages and marine-lagoon ecotypes, with shared structural variation underlying lineage and ecotype divergence. Here, we aim to characterize structural variants and to reconstruct their history and suspected role in ecotype formation. We generated a near chromosome-level genome assembly and described genome-wide patterns of diversity and divergence through the analysis of 112 whole-genome sequences from Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Sea populations. By also analysing linked-read sequencing data, we found evidence for two chromosomal inversions that were several megabases in length and showed contrasting allele frequency patterns between lineages and ecotypes across the species range. We reveal that these inversions represent ancient intraspecific polymorphisms, one likely being maintained by divergent selection and the other by pseudo-overdominance. A possible selective coupling between the two inversions was further supported by the absence of specific haplotype combinations and a putative functional interaction between the two inversions in reproduction. Lastly, we detected gene flux eroding divergence between inverted alleles at varying levels for the two inversions, with a likely impact on their dynamics and contribution to divergence and speciation.

AB  - Understanding the signaling pathway regulatory mechanisms in type II alveolar epithelial (ATII) cells, the progenitor cells responsible for proliferating and regenerating type I alveolar epithelial (ATI) and ATII cells, in Tibetan pigs is beneficial for exploring methods of preventing and repairing cellular damage during hypoxia. We simulated a hypoxic environment (2% O-2) for culture ATII cells of Tibetan pigs and Landrace pigs, with cells cultured under normoxic conditions (21% O-2) as a control group, and performed integrated analysis of circular RNA (circRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory axes by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the source genes of the differential expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were primarily involved in cell proliferation, cellular processes, and cell killing. A series of DEcircRNAs were derived from inhibitors of apoptosis proteins and led to a key autonomous effect as modulators of cell repair in Tibetan pigs under hypoxia. The significant higher expression of COL5A1 in TL groups may inhibited apoptosis of ATII cells in Tibetan pigs under lower oxygen concentration, and may lead their better survive in the hypoxia environment. In addition, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of functional interactions was constructed that included novel_circ_000898-ssc-miR-199a-5p-CAV1 and novel_circ_000898-ssc-miR-378-BMP2, based on the node genes ssc-miR-199a-5p and ssc-miR-378, which may regulate multiple miRNAs and mRNAs that mediate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation and attenuate hypoxia-induced injury in ATII cells under hypoxic conditions. These results broaden our knowledge of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs associated with hypoxia and provide new insights into the hypoxic response of ATII cells in Tibetan pigs.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the efficacy of vitamin E, yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and a combined supplement of both in alleviating the impacts of arsenic exposure on young goats. Alongside, we investigated feed consumption, carcass traits, arsenic levels in blood and organs, mineral distribution in different tissues, and potential human health risks from consuming meat from arsenic-exposed goats. Thirty healthy male Black Bengal goat weaned kids, averaging 6.15 +/- 0.32 kg and 142.87 +/- 9.28 days old, were involved in the trial. They were divided into five equal treatment groups. The diet consisted of chopped sorghum sudan grass as roughage and a concentrate mixture for growth and maintenance of young goats. Arsenic was administered through the concentrate as sodium arsenite, with T-0 as the control (no arsenic). To prevent stress-related issues, kids under T-1-T-4 groups received gradually increasing arsenic doses over a three-week adaptation period, followed by a consistent 50 ppm dose for 17 weeks. Vitamin E and yeast culture were introduced concurrently with arsenic exposure, with DL-alpha-Tocopherol added to the concentrate at 250 IU/kg of feed dry matter for T-2 and T-4, and T-3 and T-4 received 4 x 10(9) colony forming units of yeast culture (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) daily. High arsenic levels led to reduced feed dry matter intake (g/kg body weight) (p = 0.01) and crude protein consumption (g/kg body weight) (p < 0.001) in arsenic-challenged goats. However, supplementation with vitamin E, yeast culture, or both mitigated these effects and decreased blood arsenic levels (p < 0.001). Interestingly, neither arsenic exposure nor the mitigation strategies significantly impacted the levels of Ca, P, Mg, Cu, Mn, Zn and Fe in various organs and carcass components except for liver copper levels, which showed a negative correlation (p < 0.008) with arsenic concentration. Organs such as the liver, kidneys and testes accumulated higher (p < 0.001) arsenic levels compared to other body parts. Vitamin E, alone or with yeast culture, significantly reduced (p < 0.001) arsenic deposition in carcass components, while yeast culture alone showed no additional benefit. Despite supplementation, arsenic levels in meat and carcass parts from exposed goats (T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4) remained higher (p < 0.001) than in the control group, posing a cancer risk exceeding acceptable thresholds value (1 x 10(-6)). Vitamin E supplementation, alone or combined with S. cerevisiae, partially mitigated arsenic deposition in various organs and body parts, offering a promising solution to the issue.

AB  - Orius sauteri (Poppius) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) is often used for biological control of small arthropod pests in greenhouse vegetable production systems in Asia. In addition to feeding on arthropod prey, O. sauteri consumes small quantities of plant material. Previous studies demonstrated that tomato plant chemistry confers antixenosis resistance to phloem-feeding whiteflies, but the potential nontarget effects of phytochemicals on the beneficial predator O. sauteri are unknown. Comparison of O. sauteri confined to near-isogenic lines (NILs) of tomatoes producing high levels of flavonoids (NIL-purple hypocotyl; resistant to whiteflies) and low levels of flavonoids (NIL-green hypocotyl; susceptible to whiteflies) revealed that O. sauteri had reduced oviposition, nymphal survival, and development on resistant plants, even if they were also provided with prey that did not feed on the host plant. Moreover, O. sauteri showed a significant ovipositional preference in choice assays, laying significantly more eggs on susceptible than on resistant plants. Molecular gut content analysis using the specific chloroplast trnL gene from tomato confirmed that adult and immature O. sauteri feed on both resistant and susceptible genotypes, and feeding behavior assays revealed that resistance did not affect plant feeding or prey acceptance by O. sauteri adults. These results demonstrate a direct negative effect of phytochemicals on a nontarget beneficial species and indicate that resistance mediated by phytochemicals can affect organisms that do not solely feed on phloem sap. The results also indicate that the mode of action and the potential ecological effects of phytochemical-mediated resistance are broader than previously recognized.

AB  - Simple Summary Helminth parasite infections have a significant impact on the efficiency of swine production as a consequence of the reduced feed conversion and weight gain and the condemnation of affected organs after slaughter. Parasite control is primarily based on the use of chemical agents, such as albendazole, a broad-spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic compound. After oral administration, the dissolution and absorption of albendazole may be significantly modified by the type of diet, which may induce substantial variation in the amounts of the active drug/metabolites that actually reach the parasite to exert the anthelmintic action. This diet-related variability may have relevant implications on the drug efficacy, affecting the overall success of parasite control programs. Herein, we describe the relationship between the feeding management and the pharmacokinetic behavior of albendazole in pigs. Although the type of diet did not result in a significant difference in the systemic exposure to albendazole/metabolites, the higher fat content in the diet (by the addition of soya oil) was correlated with higher albendazole sulfoxide concentrations 12 h post-treatment. Albendazole (ABZ) is a methylcarbamate benzimidazole anthelmintic used to control gastrointestinal parasites in several animal species and humans. The type of diet has been identified as a major determinant for ABZ pharmacokinetics in different animal species and humans. The work described here assesses the pattern of the absorption and the systemic availability of ABZ and its metabolites after its oral administration to pigs under different feed management plans. Eighteen pigs (5 months old, local ecotype breeds) were distributed into three experimental groups. In the fasting group, the animals fasted for 8 h prior to treatment. In the pellet + oil and pellet groups, the animals were fed ad libitum with a commercial pelleted-based diet with or without the addition of soya oil. An ABZ suspension was orally administered at 10 mg/kg. Blood samples were taken over the 48 h post-treatment. The plasma samples were analyzed by HPLC. Under the described experimental conditions, the ingestion of the pellet-based diet with or without the soya oil before ABZ treatment did not significantly (p < 0.05) modify the plasma disposition kinetics of the ABZ sulfoxide (ABZSO, the main ABZ metabolite) compared to that observed in the fasting pigs. Both ABZ metabolites (ABZSO and ABZ sulphone) reached similar peak concentrations and systemic exposures in all the experimental groups regardless of the feeding management. However, the addition of oil to the pelleted food enhanced the pattern of ABZ absorption, which was reflected in the higher (p < 0.05) concentration profiles of the active ABZSO metabolite measured between 12 and 48 h post-treatment compared to the pigs fed with the pelleted food alone. Although this effect may not be therapeutically relevant after ABZ administration as a single oral dose, the overall impact of the type and feeding conditions when ABZ is supplemented with food for several days should be cautiously evaluated.

AB  - The market value of tea is largely dependent on the tea species and cultivar. Therefore, it is important to develop efficient molecular markers covering the entire tea genome that can be used for the identification of tea varieties, marker-assisted breeding, and mapping important quantitative trait loci for beneficial traits. In this study, genome-wide molecular markers based on intron length polymorphism (ILP) were developed for tea trees. A total of 479, 1393, and 1342 tea ILP markers were identified using the PCR method in silico from the 'Shuchazao' scaffold genome, the chromosome-level genome of 'Longjing 43', and the ancient tea DASZ chromosome-level genome, respectively. A total of 230 tea ILP markers were used to amplify six tea tree species. Among these, 213 pairs of primers successfully characterize products in all six species, with 112 primer pairs exhibiting polymorphism. The polymorphism rate of primer pairs increased with the improvement in reference genome assembly quality level. The cross-species transferability analysis of 35 primer pairs of tea ILP markers showed an average amplification rate of 85.17% through 11 species in 6 families, with high transferability in Camellia reticulata and tobacco. We also used 40 pairs of tea ILP primers to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of C. tetracocca with 176 plants from Puan County, Guizhou Province, China. These genome-wide markers will be a valuable resource for genetic diversity analysis, marker-assisted breeding, and variety identification in tea, providing important information for the tea industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is instrumental in the initiation of early postmortem glycolysis and the advent of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) meat when cellular energy is altered. However, conflicting studies show that AMPK activation without corresponding energy level changes in PSE meat challenges this long-held notion. Here, we examined the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress on AMPK activation in the context of glycolysis, protein solubility, and water-holding capacity (WHC) in the postmortem yak longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. Further, we explored the mechanisms underlying these effects.
   RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly augmented the degree of oxidative stress, increasing the production of ROS and malondialdehyde excessive production and reducing the activity of the anti-oxidants superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In turn, oxidative stress dramatically promoted AMPK activation and glycolysis by increasing glycogen depletion and promoting hexokinase and phosphofructokinase activity. Subsequently, lactic acid accumulation increased, leading to a rapid decline in pH, which aggravated protein solubility degree and centrifugal loss in the early postmortem yak LD muscle. Importantly, these changes caused by oxidative stress were eliminated by the AMPK inhibitor. Mechanistically, oxidative stress elevated calcium ion (Ca2+) levels, which mobilized calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase beta (CaMKK beta) and AMPK. Rescue experiments confirmed that the increases were attenuated using Ca2+ and CaMKK beta chelators, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: These results indicated that oxidative stress caused by ROS hastened early-stage postmortem glycolysis and reduced the WHC of yak meat. These effects were likely mediated by the alternative and energy-independent CaMKK beta/AMPK signaling pathway. (C) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis, caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii , poses a significant zoonotic risk. With its adaptability to diverse environments and a wide range of warm-blooded hosts, T. gondii remains a persistent concern for public health worldwide. In this study, we investigated 250 fecal samples from cats across various pet clinics in Hyderabad. Microscopic examination revealed T. gondii infection in 38 out of 250 samples, indicating a 15.2% prevalence rate among cats. We delved deeper to identify factors contributing to disease development and found intriguing patterns. Breed-wise analysis showed higher infection rates in Persian cats (19.79%), followed by Bengal (16.67%) and crossbreeds (9.09%). Notably, younger cats exhibited significantly higher infection rates (39.06%) compared to adults (6.99%) (P = 0.0001). Surprisingly, male cats showed no infections, while female cats harbored a 26.03% infection rate. Further analysis revealed a correlation between infection and symptoms, with dry hair-coated cats showing a 31.91% infection rate compared to those with healthy coats (5.13%). Additionally, fecal consistency appeared to influence infection rates, with semi-solid samples exhibiting a prevalence of 100%. Morphological characterization of positive samples revealed bi-layered oocyst walls with oval and spherical shapes, while molecular analysis via PCR confirmed the presence of a 469 bp fragment of the B1 gene of T. gondii . Sequencing confirmed a 99-100% similarity with T. gondii from various hosts and locations. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relatedness to isolates from rats and sheep in Nigeria and Mexico, respectively. These findings underscore the common prevalence of T. gondii among pet cats, posing a significant risk to pet owners. The alarming baseline data generated in this study calls for strategic management of toxoplasmosis in public health initiatives.

AB  - The effects of different NaCl concentrations (0-150 mM) for different periods of time (10 days and 25 days) on Paulownia tomentosa x fortunei and Paulownia elongata x elongata were analyzed. The decrease of the pig-ment composition, an inhibition of the photochemistry of both photosystems as well as an increase of the antioxidant activity (FRAP assay), the antiradical activity (DPPH assay), the total flavonoids and the proline levels were affected only at short salt treatment (10 days) with high NaCl concentration (150 mM). These changes correspond with some decrease of the maximum quantum yields of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), the effective quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion (Phi(PSII)) and the photochemical quenching (q(P)) as a result of a restriction of electron flow from Q(A) to Q(B) as well as an influence on the oxidation reduction prop-erties of P-700. The role of the carotenoids and levels of flavonoids and proline during the first days of salt stress for the prevence of the functions of the photosynthetic apparatus and adaptation of plants to different high salt contents are dicussed.

AB  - Citrus target spot, caused by Pseudofabraea citricarpa, was formerly considered a cold-tolerant fungal disease. However, it has now spread from high-latitude regions to warmer low-latitude regions. Here, we conducted physiological observations on two different strains of the fungus collected from distinct regions, and evaluated their pathogenicity. Interestingly, the CQWZ collected from a low-latitude orchard, exhibited higher temperature tolerance and pathogenicity when compared to the SXCG collected from a high-latitude orchard. To further understand the evolution of temperature tolerance and virulence in these pathogens during the spread process, as well as the mechanisms underlying these differences, we performed genomic comparative analysis. The genome size of CQWZ was determined to be 44,004,669 bp, while the genome size of SXCG was determined to be 45,377,339 bp. Through genomic collinearity analysis, we identified two breakpoints and rearrangements during the evolutionary process of these two strains. Moreover, gene annotation results revealed that the CQWZ possessed 376 annotated genes in the "Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism" pathway, which is 79 genes more than the SXCG. The main factor contributing to this difference was the presence of salicylate hydroxylase. We also observed variations in the oxidative stress pathways and core pathogenic genes. The CQWZ exhibited the presence of a heat shock protein (HSP SSB), a catalase (CAT2), and 13 core pathogenic genes, including a LysM effector, in comparison to the SXCG. Furthermore, there were significant disparities in the gene clusters responsible for the production of seven metabolites, such as Fumonisin and Brefeldin. Finally, we identified the regulatory relationship, with the HOG pathway at its core, that potentially contributes to the differences in thermotolerance and virulence. As the global climate continues to warm, crop pathogens are increasingly expanding to new territories. Our findings will enhance understanding of the evolution mechanisms of pathogens under climate change.

AB  - Plants have evolved various defense mechanisms to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses. Cooperation with microorganisms, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), strengthens the defense capabilities of host plants. To explore the effect of AMF on the growth of Elymus and the defenses against locust feeding, we designed a two-compartment device to connect or cut the mycelia and roots. We used this to investigate communication cues and pathways between donor and receiver plants. We found that AMF significantly increased the nitrogen content and decreased the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio of donor plants and receiver plants and the carbon content of both. After the establishment of the common mycorrhizal network (CMN) with AMF between the two chambers, inoculations of donor plants challenged by locusts caused enhancement in four defense-related enzymes, namely, lipoxygenase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and beta-1,3-glucanase, in the receiver plants. The main components of volatile organic compounds emitted by receiver plants were terpenoids. The findings indicated that AMF could not only improve plant growth but also activate the defense response of plants to insect feeding. Four defense enzymes, volatile organic compounds, and carbon and nitrogen content were involved in the defense response, and the mycelial network could act as a conduit to deliver communication signals.

AB  - Transportation stress is complex and can affect the welfare and health of animals. The study was aimed at investigating the impact of road transportation on puppies and the beneficial effects of melatonin supplementation. Fourteen (14) apparently healthy Nigerian indigenous breed of dogs (puppies) divided into two groups, group I (control) and group II (pretreated with Melatonin at 10 mg/kg) were transported by road during the hotdry season. Vital parameters; respiratory rate (RR), pulse rate (PR) and rectal temperature (RT) were taken before, during and immediately after commencement of the journey. Blood sample was also collected from each puppy before and immediately after the journey, part of which was used to analyzed for some hematological parameters and oxidative biomarkers such as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The result revealed that road transportation caused moderate to severe stress on the puppies as observed with the discomfort index (DI) (27.75-34.64 oC). The dry-bulb temperature during the study period was 33.23 +/- 0.13 oC, while the relative humidity was 73.85 +/- 0.60%. The RT, PR and RR also increased significantly (p < 0.05) during and immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement of the transportation. The result further revealed that total leucocyte counts and Neutrophil:Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were elevated immediately after the transportation. The MDA concentration was also significantly (P < 0.05) elevated immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement in the control group. The activities of SOD and CAT and the concentration of GSH was lowered immediately after the transportation compared to before commencement. Supplementation with melatonin before the transportation ameliorated the stress posed by road transportation on the puppies as can be observed in the lowering of the elevated RT, PR and RR, total leucocyte count, NLR and MDA concentration. Pretreated with melatonin also increased the depleted activities of SOD and CAT, and the concentration of GSH immediately after the transportation. The results showed that road transportation is stressful for puppies and supplementation with melatonin mitigated the stress posed on the puppies, probably through the ability of melatonin to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated during the transportation. The results further showed that melatonin may be used to enhance the welfare of puppies subjected to road transportation under adverse thermal conditions.

AB  - Nutrition underpins survival and reproduction in animal populations; reliable nutritional biomarkers are therefore requisites to understanding environmental drivers of population dynamics. Biomarkers vary in scope of inference and sensitivity, making it important to know what and when to measure to properly quantify biological responses. We evaluated the repeatability of three nutritional biomarkers in a large, iteroparous mammal to evaluate the level of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to those traits. During a long-term, individual-based study in a highly variable environment, we measured body fat, body mass, and lean mass of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) each autumn and spring. Lean mass was the most repeatable biomarker (0.72 autumn; 0.61 spring), followed by body mass (0.64 autumn; 0.53 spring), and then body fat (0.22 autumn; 0.01 spring). High repeatability in body and lean mass likely reflects primary structural composition, which is conserved across seasons. Low repeatability of body fat supports that it is the primary labile source of energy that is largely a product of environmental contributions of the previous season. Based on the disparate levels in repeatability among nutritional biomarkers, we contend that body and lean mass are better indicators of nutritional legacies (e.g., maternal effects), whereas body fat is a direct and sensitive reflection of recent nutritional gains and losses.

AB  - This study examined the impact of various storage temperatures (5, 12 and 22 degrees C, and ambient conditions of around 19 degrees C), seed moisture content (8, 12 and 16%, and an initial content of 5.1%) and storage duration (1, 3 and 5 months) on the quality of camelina (Camelina sativa) seeds. Germination percentages, normal seedling percentage, mean germination time (MGT) and electrical conductivity (EC) were recorded both before and after storage. Camelina seeds had the highest germination percentage and quality before storage. As storage progressed, germination and vigour of the seeds declined, influenced by seed moisture and storage temperature. The seeds stored with moisture of 5.1% at 5 degrees C for one month showed the highest germination percentage (100%), normal seedling percentage (99%), shortest MGT (2.25 days) and lowest EC (65.65 mu S cm-1 g-1). Seeds stored with 16% moisture at 22 degrees C for five months had the lowest germination (73%), normal seedling percentage (60%), longest MGT (3.98 days) and highest EC (194.83 mu S cm-1 g-1). Additionally, a negative correlation (r =-0.61**) was found between EC and early counts of radicle emergence (RE) after 48 hours of imbibition, suggesting potential methods to assess seed vigour. Overall, camelina seeds harvested in June can be stored effectively at 5 degrees C with 5.1% moisture for five months prior to sowing.

AB  - Wild pig (Sus scrofa) populations in the United States are expanding and increasing in distribution and abundance and are known to reservoir a variety of pathogens that can have economic and agricultural impacts. We examined wild pigs for exposure to Brucella spp. and Francisella tularensis from Oklahoma and Texas to determine their potential role as a regional reservoir for these pathogens since wild pigs co-occur with livestock, especially on rangelands in this region. Antibodies to Brucella spp. and F. tularensis were found in every location sampled and during multiple years. Overall, wild pigs had a 12.5% prevalence of Brucella spp. and a 14.8% prevalence of F. tularensis in this study. Wild pig prevalence of Brucella spp. was 43 times higher in southcentral Oklahoma compared to previously published results. Understanding and monitoring regional disease prevalence rates in wild pigs are necessary, especially on rangelands managing for livestock that may be susceptible to these diseases.

AB  - PurposeSocial Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is a tool used to evaluate the social sustainability of products and systems. The performance reference scale is the commonly used S-LCA approach for agricultural systems but has limitations including reliance on social performance assessments, lack of sector-specific value-added activity variables, and dependence on linear reference scoring. These limitations can lead to inaccurate assessments of social issues. We aimed to develop a methodology for the pork value chain and agricultural systems to overcome these shortcomings.MethodsPerformance reference points were sourced from national and regional pig industry benchmarks, while generic data was used for inventory indicators. Social performance was expressed using ordinal scores which were converted to cardinal scores based on expert judgments. Social performance was converted to social risks using reversed min-max normalization. The "people" activity variable was enhanced by incorporating population and pig densities with pig per capita used to distinguish the local community from society. Social risks were aggregated with social issue weights and activity variables to calculate social risk time, which culminated in the estimation of social hotspot indices. These enhancements were compared using linear and nonlinear scoring methods.Results and discussionAverage social risks were highest for pigs (0.57 vs. 0.64) and lowest for society (0.47 vs. 0.44) for linear and nonlinear methods, respectively. The distribution and ranking of social risk time for social issues varied between the scoring methods across all stakeholder groups. Both linear and nonlinear methods identified pig farm as a social risk hotspot (0.57 vs. 0.65) and the consumption value chain stage as a social opportunity hotspot (0.39 vs. 0.31). The linear scoring method showed a lack of granularity and systematic bias in estimating the social risks, while the nonlinear method was more nuanced due to incorporating contextualization into the reference scores.ConclusionThe proposed methodology highlighted the importance of including social risks and hotspots, alongside social performance, for an agricultural system S-LCA. It demonstrated the advantages of nonlinear scoring over the linear method, overcoming limitations like lack of granularity and systemic bias in the assessment of social issues. However, a limitation of the nonlinear method lies in potential bias when selecting experts for social issue contextualization. This can be mitigated by carefully selecting stakeholder representatives and conducting a sensitivity analysis.

AB  - Background Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a multifunctional cytokine which plays multiple roles in different biological processes such as implantation, bone remodeling, and hematopoiesis. The buESCs are difficult to culture due to lack of proper understanding of the culture conditions. LIF is one of the important factors which maintain the pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and commercial LIF from murine and human origin is used in the establishment of buffalo embryonic stem cells (buESCs). The LIF from a foreign origin is not able to maintain pluripotency and proliferation in buESCs for a long term which is contributed by difference in the binding sites on LIF; therefore, culture medium supplemented with buffalo-specific LIF may enhance the efficiency of buESCs by improving the environment of culture conditions. The high cost of LIF is another major drawback which restricts buESCs research, thus limits the scope of buffalo stem cell use. Various methods have been developed to produce human and murine LIF in prokaryotic system. However, Buffalo leukemia inhibitory factor (BuLIF) has not been yet produced in prokaryotic system. Here, we describe a simple strategy for the expression and purification of biologically active BuLIF in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Results The BuLIF cDNA from buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) was cloned into pET22b(+) and expressed in E. coli Lemo-21(DE3). The expression of BuLIF was directed into periplasmic space of E. coli which resulted in the formation of soluble recombinant protein. One step immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC chromatography) was performed for purification of BuLIF with >= 95% of homogeneity. The recombinant protein was confirmed by western blot and identified by mass spectroscopy. The biological activity of recombinant BuLIF was determined on murine myeloid leukemic cells (M1 cells) by MTT proliferation assay. The addition of BuLIF increased the reduction of MTT by stimulated M1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The BuLIF induced the formation of macrophage like structures from M1 cells where they engulfed fluorescent latex beads. The recombinant BuLIF successfully maintained pluripotency in buffalo embryonic stem cells (buESCs) and were positive for stem cells markers such as Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Conclusions The present study demonstrated a simple method for the production of bioactive BuLIF in E. coli through single step purification. BuLIF effectively maintained buffalo embryonic stem cells pluripotency. Thus, this purified BuLIF can be used in stem cell study, biomedical, and agricultural research.

AB  - Feed efficiency (FE) is a crucial trait in pig production that influences both economic viability and environmental sustainability. The jejunum, an essential organ for nutrient absorption, plays a significant role in determining FE by affecting how pigs process and utilize feed. To explore the genetic and regulatory mechanisms behind FE, we conducted an integrative multi-omics study using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ATAC sequencing (ATAC-seq) on pigs with high and low FE. By comparing gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles in the jejunum, we identified key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) associated with lipid metabolism and immune function, both of which are critical pathways for efficient growth. Notably, we identified transcription factors such as GATA4 and EHF and genes like SCARB1 and GRXCR1 that may play regulatory roles in FE. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing FE in pigs, offering potential targets for genetic selection and nutritional interventions to enhance feed efficiency and sustainability in pig production.

AB  - The current study aims to describe the functional changes in Murrah buffalo PBMCs during chronic in-vitro thermal stress. Thus, PBMCs were stimulated at 34 degrees C or 37 degrees C or 40 degrees C for 0 hr, 24 hrs and 48 hrs. At the end of each treatment, mRNA abundance of genes related to heat shock (HSP10, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSF1), inflammation (IL1 beta, IL6, IL 12 and INF gamma), cell viability (Bax and Bcl2) and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (SLC11A1) were quantified by qPCR. The results revealed upregulation (p < 0.05) in mRNA expression of HSP10, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSF1, IL1 beta, IL6, IL12, INF gamma, BAX, BCL2 and SLC11A1 gene in chronically (24 and 48 hrs) thermal stressed (40 degrees C) PBMCs than cells maintained at 34 degrees C or 37 degrees C. In conclusion, chronic thermal stress directly affects the functionality of Murrah buffalo PBMCs and is likely responsible for immune alterations during thermal stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND : Weather variability is associated with enteric infections in people through a complex interaction of human, animal, and environmental factors. Although Campylobacter infections have been previously associated with precipitation and temperature, the association between precipitation and drought on campylobacteriosis has not been studied. OBJECTIVE : Using data from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and counties in Utah, this ecological study aimed to assess the association between precipitation and the incidence of campylobacteriosis by county from 2009 to 2021 and to determine how this association is modified by prior drought level and animal operations. METHODS : We merged 38,782 cases of campylobacteriosis reported in 127 counties with total precipitation (in inches), temperature (in average degrees Fahrenheit), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI, category), and animal census data (presence, density per square mile) by week from 2009 to 2021. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations adjusted for temperature with a 3-wk lag were used to explore the association between precipitation on campylobacteriosis with resulting incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Stratified analyses explored the association with precipitation following antecedent drought, presence of farm operations, and animal density. RESULTS : A 1-in (25.4 mm) increase in precipitation was associated with a 3% increase in campylobacteriosis reported 3 wks later (IRR =1.03; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.04) after adjusting for average temperature and PDSI. Compared with normal conditions, there were significantly more cases when precipitation followed antecedent extremely wet (IRR =1.15; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.26), very wet (IRR =1.09; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18), moderately wet (IRR =1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12), moderate drought (IRR =1.11; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.16), and severe drought (IRR =1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.11) conditions, whereas there were significantly fewer cases (IRR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.94) for antecedent extreme drought. Compared to counties with no animal operations, counties with animal operations had significantly more cases following precipitation for every PDSI category except extreme drought. Counties with a higher density of beef cattle, goats for meat, chicken broilers, and chicken layers had significantly higher rates of campylobacteriosis following precipitation than those with no such operations, whereas those with dairy cattle and goats for milk, did not. DISCUSSION : In this majority arid and semiarid environment, precipitation following prior wet conditions and moderate and severe drought were significantly associated with increased rates of campylobacteriosis, and only in prior extreme drought did rates decrease. Where the precipitation fell made a difference; after precipitation, counties with farm operations had significantly more cases compared to counties without farm operations. Further work should assess individual-level risk factors within environmental exposure pathways for Campylobacter. .

AB  - India's forest landscapes are reeling under severe demographic and developmental pressures. These tensions are particularly pronounced in peri-urban regions that are marked by rapid land use change, weak and overlapping institutions and competing claims on land. This paper examines how rapid urbanization influences place-making and the practice of forest management in Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), India. BNP is an elephant corridor traversing through a human-dominated landscape bordering the megacity of Bangalore. Straying of elephants and leopards into village settlements has led to significant destruction of crops and life. Unregulated real-estate development driven by a boom in the information technology (IT) industry, combined with granite quarries that operate illegally around BNP have altered the characteristics of the surrounding villages. These processes have revealed or created newer forms of inequity that challenge forest institutions to respond ingeniously. Applying concepts from critical institutionalism and ethnography, our research aims to inform policy efforts to incorporate pluralism in sustainable forest management and rural development. Through data collected over 16 months via observation, interviews, and oral histories we examine the workings of forest management institutions in everyday social life. We map specific modes through which four marginalized agents navigate institutional plurality and intersect with each other in the peri-urban forest landscape. The results illustrate the potency of `institutional bricolage', wherein agents renegotiate their space in the landscape by actively drawing from available resources to ensure workable institutional arrangements, challenging government efforts to conserve and manage ecosystems.

AB  - Dysregulated homeostasis of neural activity has been hypothesized to drive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. AD begins with a decades-long presymptomatic phase, but whether homeostatic mechanisms already begin failing during this silent phase is unknown. We show that before the onset of memory decline and sleep disturbances, familial AD (fAD) model mice display no deficits in CA1 mean firing rate (MFR) during active wakefulness. However, homeostatic down-regulation of CA1 MFR is disrupted during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and general anesthesia in fAD mouse models. The resultant hyperexcitability is attenuated by the mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme inhibitor, which tunes MFR toward lower set-point values. Ex vivo fAD mutations impair downward MFR homeostasis, resulting in pathological MFR set points in response to anesthetic drug and inhibition blockade. Thus, firing rate dyshomeostasis of hippocampal circuits is masked during active wakefulness but surfaces during low-arousal brain states, representing an early failure of the silent disease stage.

AB  - This research is to study the effects of nano-Cu2O on blood parameters, growth performance, and wool yield in the Cu-stripped ranches, and provide reference for further study on prevention and treatment in Cu-deficient Chinese Merino sheep. We selected twenty Chinese Merino sheep from Cu-deficient and normal ranch, respectively. The results have shown that the Cu content in the soils, forages, blood, and wool from Cu-deficient ranches was significantly lower than those from normal ranches (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the contents of other elements. Treatment experiments of nano-Cu2O were carried out for 50 days. We found that the Cu content in the blood was increased continuously in the sheep after adding nano-Cu2O, and reached the highest level at 40 days. The levels of Hb, RBC, PCV, MCV, and MCH in the nano-Cu2O-fed animals were remarkably higher than those in the control animals (P < 0.01). The daily gain and wool yield in the nano-Cu2O-fed animals were also significantly higher than those in the control sheep (P < 0.01). Therefore, adding nano-Cu2O not only remarkably increases the Cu content in the blood, but also greatly improves the daily gain and wool yield in Cu-deficient animals.

AB  - BACKGROUND Iron deficiency and iron overload can affect the normal functioning of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Fermented milk products may enhance immune functions, but little is known about the effect of fermented milks on modulation of the immune response during iron deficiency anemia and recovery with normal or high dietary iron intake. Eighty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a control group fed a standard diet or to an anemic group fed a diet deficit in iron. Control and anemic groups were fed for 30 days with diets based on a fermented goat's or cow's milk product, with normal iron content or iron overload. RESULTS In general, during anemia recovery lectin and alternative complement pathway activity and lactoferrin decreased, because it improves iron homeostasis, which is critically important in immune system functions. Fermented goat's milk diet enhanced immune function during iron deficiency recovery, suppressed oxidant-induced eotaxin and fractalkine expression due to the concurrent reduction of free radical production and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and monocyte migration and adhesion. The increase in interferon-gamma can confer immunological colonization of gut microbiota and downregulate inflammation. CONCLUSION Fermented goat's milk consumption enhances immune function, modifying complement pathway activity and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as lactoferrin concentration, due to the improvement of iron homeostasis, which is critically important in the normal function of the immune system.

AB  - It has been argued that, throughout the Mesozoic, the immature growth forms of megaherbivorous dinosaurs competitively excluded small herbivorous dinosaur species, leading to the left-skewed species richness-body mass distributions of their fossil assemblages. By corollary, where large and small herbivores coexisted over a geologically significant period of time, they must have exhibited niche partitioning. We use multivariate ecomorphological analysis of the Late Cretaceous ornithischian dinosaur assemblage of North America to examine this prediction. Our results indicate good ecomorphological separation of most, but not all, species at small body size, although more work is required to demonstrate that these patterns were adaptive. Calculation of browse profiles using corrected abundance data and bracketed estimates of energy requirements suggests that immature megaherbivores - most particularly hadrosaurids - outstripped coexisting small ornithischian species in their control of the resource base.

AB  - Pigs are susceptible to cold stress due to the absence of brown fat caused by the partial deletion of uncoupling protein 1 during their evolution. Some local pig breeds in China exhibit potential cold adaptability, but research has primarily focused on fat and intestinal tissues. Skeletal muscle plays a key role in adaptive thermogenesis in mammals, yet the molecular mechanism of cold adaptation in porcine skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. This study investigated the cold adaptability of two pig breeds, Mashen pigs (MS) and Large White pigs (LW), in a four-day cold (4 degrees C) or normal temperature (25 degrees C) environment. We recorded phenotypic changes and collected blood and longissimus dorsi muscle for transcriptome sequencing. Finally, the PRSS8 gene was randomly selected for functional exploration in porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells. A decrease in body temperature and body weight in both LW and MS pigs under cold stress, accompanied by increased shivering frequency and respiratory frequency, were observed. However, the MS pigs demonstrated stable physiological homeostasis, indicating a certain level of cold adaptability. The LW pigs primarily responded to cold stress by regulating their heat production and glycolipid energy metabolism. The MS pigs exhibited a distinct response to cold stress, involving the regulation of heat production, energy metabolism pathways, and robust mitochondrial activity, as well as a stronger immune response. Furthermore, the functional exploration of PRSS8 in porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells revealed that it affected cellular energy metabolism and thermogenesis by regulating ERK phosphorylation. These findings shed light on the diverse transcriptional responses of skeletal muscle in LW and MS pigs under cold stress, offering valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in pigs.

AB  - Tidal flat areas are important resources for land development and are becoming antibiotic resistance receivers that trigger major health concerns. The spatial distributions of forty-nine antibiotics, nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), one mobile gene element (MGE) gene, and nine available metals in the soils and sediments along the coastlines of the Yellow Sea in China were quantified. Hierarchical linear model analysis was used to explore relationships between the antibiotics and ARGs across multiple effects resulting from human activities and environmental factors. Fish farm sediments and farmland soils showed high levels of quinolones (QNs) (maximum 637 ng center dot g-1), sulfonamides (SAs) (maximum 221 ng center dot g-1), and corresponding ARGs. Significant positive correlations (P from 5.47 x 10-14 to 0.0487) were observed between the antibiotics (QNs, SAs, and chlortetracycline) and their corresponding ARGs (qnrA, qnrD, aac(6')-Ib-cr, dfrA, sul2, and tetA), indicating the selective pressure from antibiotics in soils and sediments. Nine available metals had positive correlations with at least one ARG, indicating heavy metal pollution could enhance the ARGs. Sheep and poultry husbandry and marine aquaculture contribute the most to the antibiotic resistance in the coastlines. In conclusion, antibiotic pollutions have promoting effects at sub-inhibitory concentrations and more attention should be given to inhibit the enrichment of ARGs during tidal flat reclamation processes. The study also suggests the induction effects from metal pollutions, MGE spread, and the antibiotic pollutions from the usage in livestock and aquaculture.

AB  - In Scotland, efforts to reintroduce extirpated species have been marred by guerrilla rewilding and social conflicts. We ask whether these conflicts could at least in part be the product of shifting baseline syndrome. The multi-generational absence of many large charismatic species has resulted in an 'extinction of experience' about how to coexist with them embedded within the structures, institutions, and cultural products of Scottish landscapes. We draw on academic literature, popular media, and policy documents to consider debates over the potential reintroduction of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus) to Scotland from a shifting baseline perspective. The paucity of (scientific and historical) knowledge about the social and ecological impacts of locally extinct species and the loss of coexistence experience has created more fertile ground for myths and wishful thinking to proliferate uninhibited, resulting in the romantic and cynical cultural transformation of the lynx and wolf in Scottish society. We argue that empathetic, patient, and transparent dialogue can help to co-produce shared visions of rural landscapes, with or without large carnivores, which retain ecological ambition and support multiple land-use systems, while ensuring that any transitions are socially just and economically feasible.

AB  - Gene augmentation therapy is a promising treatment for incurable, blinding inherited retinal diseases, and intravitreal delivery is being studied as a safe alternative to subretinal injections. Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAV) are commonly-used vectors for ocular gene augmentation therapy. Naturally occurring pre-operative exposure and infection with AAV could result in presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAB's) in patients' serum, and may affect the safety and efficacy of treatment. Our aim was to characterize the humoral response against AAV pre- and post-intravitreal delivery of AAV2.7m8 vectors in a naturally-occurring sheep model of CNGA3 achromatopsia. Serial serum neutralization assays were performed to screen sheep for pre-exiting anti-AAV2 NAB's, and to assess the effect of intravitreal AAV2.7m8 injection on post-operative NAB titers and intraocular inflammation in sheep. The effect of viral dose and transgene type were also assessed. Serological screening revealed pre-operative seropositivity in 21.4% of animals, with age being a risk factor for the presence of anti-AAV2 NAB's. NAB titers increased following intravitreal AAV administration in the majority of sheep. There was no significant difference in the degree of post-operative serum neutralization between pre-operatively seronegative sheep and those with pre-existing antibodies. However, only sheep with pre-existing antibodies presented with signs of post-operative inflammation. We conclude that pre-existing anti-AAV2 NAB's do not affect the level of post-operative NAB titers; however, they increase the risk of post-operative ocular inflammation. Our results could have implications for the management of AAV-mediated ocular gene therapies, a technology being increasingly studied and used in patients.

AB  - The Kereh River in Penang, Malaysia, has faced severe pollution for over 40 years due to untreated wastewater from swine farms in Kampung Selamat, discharged via stormwater drains. Despite official claims that all 77 swine farms treat their wastewater to meet regulatory standards, local non-governmental organizations and villagers have challenged this, though their concerns lack scientific backing. This study evaluates the river's water quality by analyzing samples from upstream (US), midstream (MS), and downstream (DS), and from Parit Cina-Parit Besar, a conduit for untreated swine wastewater. Fourteen parameters were measured against Malaysia's National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). Significant differences were found in six parameters: ammonium nitrogen (AN), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease (OG). While Dunn's post hoc pairwise comparison showed no significant differences among river segments, mean values indicated increased pollution downstream, particularly after the convergence with untreated swine wastewater. River classification worsened, with water quality index dropping from 69.88 +/- 11.37 score (Class III) US to 38.49 +/- 12.74 and 50.44 +/- 3.14 scores (Class IV) MS and downstream, respectively. A significant positive correlation between E. coli and AN (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) suggests a common point source pollutant, particularly the untreated swine wastewater. The river exhibits low oxygen levels and high organic matter and nutrient concentrations, especially MS and downstream, highlighting substantial ecological and public health risks. Effective enforcement of waste treatment regulations and enhanced monitoring are crucial for mitigating pollution and restoring the river's ecosystem. Collaboration between authorities and pig farmers is essential to improve water quality and maintain the river's ecological balance.

AB  - Chemical speciation can fundamentally affect the potential toxicity and bioavailability of heavy metals. The transformation of heavy metal speciation and change of bioavailability were investigated in an anaerobic digestion (AD) system using four different substrates (pig manure (PM), cattle manure (CAM), chicken manure (CHM) and rice straw (RS)). The results obtained indicated that the total contents of heavy metals in PM, CHM and CAM were higher than in RS and decreased in the order Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > As > Cd in all substrates. Moreover, the speciation with the largest proportion for each heavy metal was the same both in the different substrates and the biogas residues. Among them, Zn, Ni, Cd and As were mainly in the reducible fraction (F2), while Cu was mainly in the oxidizable fraction (F3) and Pb occurred predominantly in the residual fraction (F4). Our results further indicated that the AD process had a greater effect on the speciation of heavy metals in CHM and PM, but less on CAM and RS. The rates of change in bioavailability followed the order PM > CHM > CAM > RS. Changes in organic matter, humic acid or local metal ion environment as a result of AD were inferred as likely mechanisms leading to the transformation of heavy metal speciation. These results enhanced our understanding of the behavior of heavy metals in AD and provided a new perspective for the treatment and disposal of the substrates.

AB  - Piglets are susceptible to cold, and piglet death caused by cold stress leads to economic losses in the pig industry in cold areas. Skeletal muscle plays a key role in adaptive thermogenesis in mammals, but the related mechanism in pigs is unclear. In this study, cold-tolerant Tibetan pigs and cold-sensitive Bama pigs were subjected to either a cold environment (4 degrees C) or a room temperature environment (25 degrees C) for 3 days. The biceps femoris (BF) and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) were collected for phenotypic analysis, and the BF was used for genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Our results showed that Tibetan pigs had a higher body temperature than Bama pigs upon cold stimulation. RNA-seq data indicated a stronger transcriptional response in the skeletal muscle of Tibetan pigs upon cold stimulation, as more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the same criteria (p < 0.05 and fold change > 2). In addition, distinct pathway signaling patterns in skeletal muscle upon cold exposure were found between the breeds of pigs. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation-related genes and pathways were significantly upregulated in Tibetan pigs, indicating that Tibetan pigs may use fatty acids as the primary fuel source to protect against cold. However, the significant upregulation of inflammatory response- and glycolysis-related genes and pathways in the skeletal muscle of Bama pigs suggested that these pigs may use glucose as the primary fuel source in cold environments. Together, our study revealed the distinct transcriptional responses of skeletal muscle to cold stimulation in Tibetan pigs and Bama pigs and provided novel insights for future investigation of the cold adaptation mechanism in pigs.

AB  - We explored the effect of supplementation of two tropical red seaweeds, Kappaphycus alvarezii (KA) and Gracilaria salicornia (GS) at three different levels (0, 1.5 and 3%) on nutrient utilization, gut health, antioxidant, and immune status in adult dogs. The experiment was based on a 5 x 5 Latin square design (LSD) comprising five adult Labrador dogs, five dietary treatments (CON: basal diet; KA(L): KA at 1.5 % of diet dry matter (DM); KA(H): KA at 3 % DM; GS(L): GS at 1.5 % DM; GS(H): GS at 3 % DM) and five periods, each of 21 days, followed by a 7-day washout period in between. The palatability, food intake, and body weight changes were comparable among the groups (P>0.05). The supplementation of two seaweeds at either level did not have any effect on nutrient digestibility (P>0.05). The fecal lactate concentration was higher (P<0.05) in GS(L) and GS(H) groups whereas fecal ammonia was lower (P<0.05) in the GS(H) group in comparison to the other groups. The volatile fatty acids (VFA) profile improved (P<0.05) in the KA(H), GS(L,) and GS(H) groups. The mean fecal Lactobacillus count tended to increase (P<0.10) in the KA(H) and GS(H) groups while the coliform count remained unaffected by seaweed supplementation. The mean fecal Bifidobacterium population was higher (P<0.05) and the mean clostridial population was lower (P<0.05) in the GS(H) group as compared to -other groups. The concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) was higher (P<0.05) and lipid peroxides were lower in the KA(H) and GS(H) groups. A tendency (P<0.10) of improved cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was observed in the GS(H) group as compared to other groups. Overall, the supplementation of either of the seaweeds at 1.5 % failed to exert significant influence on any of the parameters studied except fecal VFA and lactate levels, whereas both the seaweeds at 3% level showed some promising benefits in terms of improved gut health, antioxidant, and immune status and the best response was obtained in GS(H) group. Hence, it can be concluded that supplementation of GS at the 3 % level outperformed KA supplementation at the 3 % level by improving gut health, antioxidant status and immunity.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has pointed out the high vulnerability of developing countries to climate change, which is expected to impact food and income security. Sheep farming is one of the main animal productions among the families located in the most vulnerable regions of the semiarid region of Pernambuco state, a Brazilian territory known for its high temperatures, low relative humidity, and high net solar radiation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify different regions of Pernambuco that may be more suitable for different breeds of sheep, based on non-parametric statistics and kriging maps of the temperature and humidity index (THI). THI values were determined based on mean annual temperature and wind speed extracted from the TerraClimate remote sensing database. Pernambuco state presented THI values ranging from 66 to 79, with the hair breeds having a high potential for exploitation in almost all territories, including the main meat-producing breeds. The East Friesian breed, a high milk producer, would be well suited to the Agreste mesoregion, a territory that, like the Pajeu and Moxoto microregions, also proved favorable for the introduction of three wool breeds (Suffolk, Poll Dorset, and Texel) known as major meat producers. The kriging maps of the THI values successfully allowed the identification of strategic development regions of Pernambuco state with high potential for sheep breeding.

AB  - Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SorL1) deficiency is a genetic predisposition to familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its pathology is poorly understood. In SorL1-null rats, a disorder of the global endosome-lysosome network (ELN) is found in hippocampal neurons. Deletion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in SorL1-null rats could not completely rescue the neuronal abnormalities in the ELN of the hippocampus and the impairment of spatial memory in SorL1-null young rats. These in vivo observations indicated that APP is one of the cargoes of SorL1 in the regulation of the ELN, which affects hippocampal-dependent memory. When SorL1 is depleted, the endolysosome takes up more of the lysosome flux and damages lysosomal digestion, leading to pathological lysosomal storage and disturbance of cholesterol and iron homeostasis in the hippocampus. These disturbances disrupt the original homeostasis of the material-energy-subcellular structure and reprogram energy metabolism based on fatty acids in the SorL1-null hippocampus, instead of glucose. Although fatty acid oxidation increases ATP supply, it cannot reduce the levels of the harmful byproduct ROS during oxidative phosphorylation, as it does in glucose catabolism. Therefore, the SorL1-null rats exhibit hippocampal degeneration, and their spatial memory is impaired. Our research sheds light on the pathology of SorL1 deficiency in AD.

AB  - Termites' digestive systems, particularly in lower termites with the presence of protozoa, are unique ecological niches that shelter a diverse microbiota with a variety of functions for the host and the environment. In 2012, the metagenomic DNA (5.4 Gb) of the prokaryotes that freely live in the gut of the lower termite Coptotermes gestroi were sequenced. A total of 125,431 genes were predicted and analyzed in order to mine lignocellulolytic genes. however, the overall picture of the structure, diversity, and function of the prokaryotic gut microbiota was not investigated. In the present study, these 125,431 genes were taxonomically classified by MEGAN and functionally annotated by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and by the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) and HMMER databases. As a result, 95,751 bacterial genes were classified into 35 phyla. The structure of the bacteria, typified by a high ratio of Firmicutes to Bacterioidetes, was distinct from the structure of the entirety of the bacteria in the lower or higher termites' guts. The archaea (533 genes) were distributed into 4 phyla, 10 classes, 15 orders, 21 families, 47 genera, and 61 species. Although freely living in the guts, the prokaryotic community was formed, developed, and adapted to exhibit unique interactions in order to perform mutual roles of benefit to their hosts. Methanobacteriales, accounting for 61% of the archaea symbionts, seem to play an important role in methanogenesis. Concomitantly, bacterial methanotrophs in the gut utilize methane and combine with other bacterial groups, including potential lignocellulolytic degraders, acetogens, sulfur bacteria, and nitrogen-recycling bacteria, to efficiently convert wood with little nitrogen into acetates via certain pathway modules specified by prokaryotes that freely live in the gut. This forms an important energy source for the termites. Furthermore, bacteria carry 2223 genes involved in the biosynthesis of 17 antibiotic groups. The gut bacteria also possess genes for the degradation of 18 toxic aromatic compounds, of which four are commercial pesticides against termites commonly used for the preservation of wooden constructions. Eight of the eighteen pathways were the first to be reported from the termite gut. Overall, this study sheds light on the roles of the freely living bacteria and archaea in the C. gestroi gut, providing evidence that the gut microbiome acts as the second host genome, contributing both nutrients and immunity to support the host's existence, growth, and development.

AB  - Sexual segregation has been intensely studied across diverse ecosystems and taxa, but studies are often limited to periods when animals occupy distinct seasonal ranges. Some avian and marine studies have revealed that habitat segregation, when sexes differ spatially or temporally in use of the physical landscape, is common during the migratory period and characterized by sex-specific differences in migratory behaviors. Recent research highlights the importance of understanding movement patterns in the context of the full annual life cycle and highlights the need to extend relevant theories of sexual segregation to the migratory period. We tested predictions from two leading hypotheses of sexual segregation, the forage-selection hypothesis (FSH) and the reproductive strategy hypothesis (RSH) as applied to the migratory period. We collected global positioning system (GPS) location data for male and female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in south-central Wyoming and northwest Colorado and tested the main predictions of the FSH and RSH. Both sexes showed high fidelity to their migratory routes, but route fidelity was more variable in males. Males also started spring migrations earlier, ended spring and autumn migrations later, and spent 22% more time on stopover sites during spring migrations. Consequently, males took twice as long in spring and 44% longer in autumn to complete migration. Our results revealed clear sex-specific migratory behaviors and supported predictions of the RSH that male foraging behaviors optimize body condition for the autumn rut, and females prioritize foraging while balancing reproductive constraints. Specifically, males timed their movements with spring green-up as optimally as females, and the timing of male migrations and use of stopovers suggested that males prioritized time in areas of high-quality forage. This refutes predictions of the FSH during the migratory period that males should consistently choose habitats with abundant, low-quality forage. Our findings provide an important contribution to sexual segregation theory by extending relevant theories to understand male and female movements during the migratory period.

AB  - Adding tropical legumes into grass-based forage systems may increase the nutritive fodder value, but competition may decrease legume quality. We evaluated the nutritional values and agronomic responses of tall and dwarf elephant grass genotypes (Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone.) and butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea L.) grown as binary intercrops. Two tall (Elephant B and IRI-381) and two dwarf elephant grass genotypes (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37) were the grass components of intercrops in a two-year trial. Higher acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin contents were found in tall than dwarf elephant grass genotypes (p < 0.0001), while lower coefficients of in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) were recorded in tall than dwarf elephant grass genotypes (p < 0.0001). There was no intercrop effect on the herbage accumulation (p = 0.1278), dry matter (DM) contents (p = 0.2338), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (p = 0.2022), lignin (p = 0.7179) and condensed tannins (p = 0.1699) of the butterfly pea. The butterfly pea grown with tall genotypes had higher crude protein (CP) concentrations (p = 0.0001) and coefficients of IVDDM (p = 0.0086) than when intercropped with dwarf genotypes. The study showed that tall elephant grass genotypes improved the butterfly pea's nutritional value in grass-legume intercrops through increases in leaf/pod ratio. Intercropping with butterfly pea may compensate for the lower nutritive fodder value of tall elephant grasses compared to dwarf genotypes.

AB  - Fasciolosis, a globally re-emerging zoonotic disease, is mostly caused by the parasitic infection with Fasciola hepatica, often known as the liver fluke. This disease has a considerable impact on livestock productivity. This study aimed to evaluate the fluke burdens and faecal egg counts in goats that were administered phage clones of cathepsin L mimotopes and then infected with F. hepatica metacercariae. Additionally, the impact of vaccination on the histology of the reproductive system, specifically related to egg generation in adult parasites, was examined. A total of twenty-four goats, which were raised in sheds, were divided into four groups consisting of six animals each. These groups were randomly assigned. The goats were then subjected to two rounds of vaccination. Each vaccination involved the administration of 1 x 10(13) phage particles containing specific mimotopes for cathepsin L2 (group 1: PPIRNGK), cathepsin L1 (group 2: DPWWLKQ), and cathepsin L1 (group 3: SGTFLFS). The immunisations were carried out on weeks 0 and 4, and the Quil A adjuvant was used in combination with the mimotopes. The control group was administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (group 4). At week 6, all groups were orally infected with 200 metacercariae of F. hepatica. At week 22 following the initial immunisation, the subjects were euthanised, and adult F. hepatica specimens were retrieved from the bile ducts and liver tissue, and subsequently quantified. The specimens underwent whole-mount histology for the examination of the reproductive system, including the testis, ovary, vitellaria, Mehlis' gland, and uterus. The mean fluke burdens following the challenge were seen to decrease by 50.4%, 62.2%, and 75.3% (p < 0.05) in goats that received vaccinations containing cathepsin L2 PPIRNGK, cathepsin L1 DPWWLKQ, and cathepsin L1 SGTFLFS, respectively. Animals that received vaccination exhibited a significant reduction in the production of parasite eggs. The levels of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes in vaccinated goats were significantly higher than in the control group, indicating that protection is associated with the induction of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. The administration of cathepsin L to goats exhibits a modest level of efficacy in inducing histological impairment in the reproductive organs of liver flukes, resulting in a reduction in egg output.

AB  - Green waste (GW) contains lignocellulosic substances that are resistant to degradation and prolong the composting process. Different strategies have been used to improve GW composting, including adding co-substrates and additives like food waste (FW) and biochar (Bc). FW offers advantages such as its constant availability in MSW streams, its high content of readily degradable organic matter, and its contribution of essential nutrients like nitrogen and potassium. On the other hand, Bc is incorporated at the beginning of the process. However, the effect of its addition in the phase of greatest biological activity has not been studied. This article compares the effect on the process, product quality, and the compost microbial community of adding 2% Bc in two different phases of the co-composting GW with food waste (FW). Two treatments were evaluated using the same mixture of substrates (wet/ weight) (i.e., 48%GW + 35%FW + 13%Sawdust + 2% Phosphate Rock + 2%Bc), but Bc was added in the mesophilic phase for T1 and the thermophilic phase for T2. With the addition of Bc at the mesophilic phase, higher temperatures were reached in the thermophilic phase, with a maximum temperature of 52.5 degrees C for T1 and 47.7 degrees C for T2. T1 final product had higher nutrient content (i.e., 28.30% TOC, 1.91% TN, and 4.69% TP in T1 compared to 15.80% TOC, 1.14% TN, and 4.29% TP in T2) and achieved a higher fertility index. Streptomyces and Nonomuraea were more abundant in T1 than T2, while Rhizobium, Roseiflexus, and Chloroflexus were significantly more abundant in T2 than in T1. These results suggest that T1 presents a microbial community that is more robust in degrading complex organic materials. This article demonstrated increased biological activity, lignocellulosic degradation, and nutrient content in the product when biochar is added from the beginning of the process.

AB  - Context. Incomplete epigenetic reprogramming of histone deacetylation (HDAC) is one of the main reasons for the low efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Scriptaid is a synthetic HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) that may improve the efficiency of porcine SCNT. Aims. This study aimed to determine whether scriptaid increases the number of blastocyst cells or the cleavage rate. Methods. We conducted a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature published over the past decade. Key results. A total of 73 relevant papers were retrieved using a diverse English keyword search, and I I articles were used for the meta-analysis. Scriptaid was positively correlated with blastocyst rate but had no effect on cleavage rate or blastocyst cell number. A subgroup analysis of blastocyst cell number showed that the staining method was the source of the heterogeneity. Conclusions. In SCNT embryos, scriptaid treatment after activation can promote embryonic development, but there may be adverse effects on early development. Implications. HDACi research should focus on SCNT birth efficiency.

AB  - Most animals live in home ranges, and memory is thought to be an important process in their formation. However, a general memory-based model for characterising and predicting home range emergence has been lacking. Here, we use a mechanistic movement model to: (1) quantify the role of memory in the movements of a large mammal reintroduced into a novel environment, and (2) predict observed patterns of home range emergence in this experimental setting. We show that an interplay between memory and resource preferences is the primary process influencing the movements of reintroduced roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Our memory-based model fitted with empirical data successfully predicts the formation of home ranges, as well as emergent properties of movement and spatial revisitation observed in the reintroduced animals. These results provide a mechanistic framework for combining memory-based movements, resource preferences, and the formation of home ranges in nature.

Dalweed (weeds from the world-famous urban Dal Lake) and cow manure (CM) are cheaply and abundantly available bio resources in Kashmir valley. Dalweed (DW), disposed of in the heart of the city, ascribes unpleasant effects on tourism and the natural ecosystem. Initial substrate mixtures of DW and CM with different ratios (CM100, DW100, CM80:DW20, CM60:DW40, CM40:DW60 and CM20:DW80) and castings harvested were analyzed for the following parameters: pH, TOC, TN, NO3- P, K, Fe, Zn, C:N, C:P, and C:S ratio. The results of a 56day study revealed in consistency and disparity towards the bio-optimization of coprolites depending upon the type of waste residue and mixture ratio used. Treatments with medium to low dalweed residues (CM60:DW40 followed by CM80:DW20) were found to be optimum and significantly primed chemical properties of castings using A. caligenosa. C:N, C:P, and C:S ratios showed a non-linear response with maximum decrease in C:N ratio by 35%, C:P ratio by 38% in CM100, and C:S ratio by 67% in DW100. Humification ratio, humification index, and percent humic acids were changed across all the treatments with the highest respective values of 21.33 +/- 1.05, 11.33 +/- 0.76, and 47.83 +/- 0.76 for CM60:DW40. Results also showed that the earthworm population and biomass significantly increased with the highest respective increments of 57.53% and 74.88% in CM60:DW40 over initial values. Moreover, the highest number of cocoons (95.67 +/- 1.17) were recorded within CM60:DW40 and the lowest in the control (43.33 +/- 1.53). Dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activities were inconsistent with the highest in CM40:DW60 (64.64%) and CM20:DW80 (63.54%) respectively over the initial substrates, while highest urease activity (74.40%) was observed from CM100. The results highlight the role of A. caliginosa in sustainable transformation of CM and DW with insightful, beneficial, and priming impacts on castings for its agronomic value.

AB  - Pesticide resistance, cross-resistance, and limitation of potential biopesticide on Helopeltis theivora Waterhouse [Commonly known as tea mosquito bug (TMB)] have strongly triggered notable economic losses in tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] industries across African and some selected Asian countries like India and Bangladesh. Repellent agents like essential oils (EOs) could be quite promising to reduce the adverse and numerous side effects of synthetic pesticides; however, scientific study on chemoreception through olfaction, as a sensory modality on this pest, is yet to be done. In this study, therefore, spatial olfactory response of few selected essential oils (N=7) has been highlighted in a modified vertical Y-tube olfactometer (VYTO), which is based on the negative geotaxis crawling movement (NGCM) of the pest within the confined environment of the olfactometer. The NGCM distance covered by the TMBs was 80 cm in 16.02 +/- 1.47 (Mean +/- SD) min with a speed of 8x10(-3) m/s. This study is also first to report the spatial repellency, as spatial activity index (SAI), of transfluthrin as a positive control (0.88%) against TMBs [SAI of 0.849 +/- 0.042 (Mean +/- SD)]. Based on EOs yield, natural abundance, and growth, wild Agerartum conyzoides (L.) was found to be a potential spatial repellent agent [SAI of 0.925 +/- 0.036 (Mean +/- SD)] against adult female TMBs. GC-MS analysis of A. conyzoides detected precocene I and precocene II, as the most probable metabolites within the highest peak area (%). This study will definitely help in the behavioral study on TMBs in the future; especially, in the elucidation of spatial bio-insecticidal properties of the abundant volatile aromatic compounds in the natural environment.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, consumers have been paying more and more attention to the flavor and texture of pork, and, therefore, the Chinese indigenous pig breeds, like Tibetan pigs, are valued for good meat quality. Herein, we investigated whether dietary mulberry leaf powder could further improve the meat quality of Tibetan pigs. Our results indicated improved meat quality in Tibetan pigs who consumed mulberry leaf powder, which might be the consequence of enhanced antioxidant activity and altered muscle fiber type and morphology. This research was conducted to study the effects of dietary inclusion of mulberry leaf powder (MLP) on growth performance, meat quality, antioxidant activity, and carcass traits of Tibetan pigs. Eighteen Tibetan pigs (33.8 +/- 1.1 kg) were assigned to two treatment groups randomly and received either the control diet (CON) or a basal diet containing 8% MLP (MLP) for two months. After the two-month feeding trial, the MLP group showed lower backfat thickness while a higher lean percentage. Compared with CON pigs, MLP pigs had higher serum CAT activity. In addition, dietary MLP supplementation significantly decreased the muscle shear force. Muscle fiber morphology analysis showed that MLP pigs had larger muscle fiber density while smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Up-regulated gene expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC)IIa was also observed in MLP pigs. These results indicate that the enhanced antioxidant activity and altered muscle fiber type and morphology appeared to contribute to the improvement of meat quality in Tibetan pigs fed diets containing MLP.

AB  - Migratory animals often use environmental cues to time their seasonal migrations. Local conditions may, however, differ from distant ones, and current conditions may poorly predict future conditions. This may be particularly true for early wet season conditions in tropical systems, as storms and associated rainfall events are generally not predictable at the scale of weeks or days and are heterogeneously distributed even at the scale of a few kilometres. How migratory animals cope with such challenges, and the consequences they may have, remain poorly known. We used time-to-event models based on GPS data from 19 African elephant herds from Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) to study the effect of local and distant rainfall events on the elephants' decision to initiate their wet season migration. Elephants relied more on distant rainfall events occurring along the future migration route than on local events when initiating their migration. Such ability to use distant cues does not, however, ensure an immediate migration success. In over 30% of the cases, the elephants came back to their dry season range, sometimes after having travelled > 80% of the expected migration distance. This happened particularly when there was little additional rain falling during the migration. All elephants successfully migrated later in the season. Our study improves the understanding of the migratory ecology of elephants. More broadly, it raises questions about the reliability of rainfall as a migratory cue in tropical systems, and shed light on one of its potential consequences, the poorly quantified phenomenon of migration false starts.

AB  - PurposeHeavy metals (HMs), antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their compound pollutions in manures present a serious threat to ecology and human health. A better solution is urgently sought. In this study, the dynamics change of chitosan addition in chicken manure composting on the profiles of antibiotics and their environmental risk, bio-available heavy metals, ARGs and bacterial communities were investigated.Materials and methodsThe high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry combined with solid-phase extraction, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and Wafergen SmartChip Real-time PCR system were used in the scale of 100 kg chicken manure and mushroom bran (1.81:1, fresh weight) composting with chitosan addition.Results and discussionAfter composting, chitosan addition could completely remove chlortetracycline (CTC) and reduce ofloxacin (OFX) environmental risk to low level (HQ = 0.04) while improving the removal rate of bio-available Cu significantly. Furthermore, it reduced the abundance of pathogens, the amount (18) and absolute abundance (56.7%) of ARGs and the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) compared with traditional compost. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that the ranking of environmental factors influencing bacterial community changes is temperature, bio-available Cd, pH, bio-available Cu, OFX and CTC. For the ARGs, bio-available Cu had higher influence than bio-available Cd, and CTC was higher than OFX.ConclusionsOur study provides a new strategy on the ARGs, bio-available HMs and antibiotics compound pollution removal with chitosan addition in composting and may guide producing harmless compost production and reutilization of agricultural fishery wastes in the days ahead.

AB  - The outermost exine capsules of many pollen and spore grains are composed of a chemically inert yet mechanically robust sporopollenin biopolymer. These dynamically expansible and foldable capsules have great potential as renewable functional biomaterials with industrial applications. However, the mechani-cal and morphological variations in the shape, size, robustness, and apertural strength of the exine cap-sules across taxa of angiosperms and cryptogamic plants remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study, we unraveled the abortive microgel transformation of spores inspired by their germination mechanism, being compared with eudicot-based pollen microgels. After chemical treatments, significant mechanical degradation of exine was clearly observed for the Camellia pollen, whereas crosslinking density and mod-ulus of spore exine remained almost constant. The significant volume expansion of Camellia pollen was observed akin to sunflower pollen; in contrast, the spores ballooned showed limited volume changes un-der equal levels of turgor pressure. Furthermore, spore underwent marked changes in volume when their aperture sutures were softened and ruptured, which are prerequisites for spore germination. Therefore, this study disentangled mechanical and morphological origins of biochemical pathways of pollen and spore germination, and germination-like hydration and desiccation, which will give clues about selection of pollen and spore species for potential biomaterial applications.

AB  - Stressor exposure causes dendritic remodeling on excitatory neurons in multiple regions of the brain, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Additionally, stressor and exogenous stress hormone exposure impair cognitive functions that are dependent on the OFC. For this Special Issue on the OFC, we summarize current literature regarding how stress-prenatal, postnatal, and even inter-generational-affects OFC neuron structure in rodents. We discuss dendrite structure, dendritic spines, and gene expression. We aim to provide a focused resource for those interested in how stressors impact this heterogeneous brain region.

AB  - The reduction of antibiotics in livestock farming is of great significance for ensuring the safety of meat-derived food and reducing farming pollution. Agricultural technology extension can precisely, efficiently, and costeffectively provide frontline concepts and technologies for antibiotic reduction to farmers. However, there is still a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of Internet usage on antibiotic reduction among farmers. Based on survey data from 1005 duck farmers in 9 provinces across China, this study empirically analyzes the impact of Internet usage on the reduction of antibiotics among duck farmers and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that Internet usage significantly affects antibiotic reduction among farmers, a conclusion that holds true after endogeneity testing and robustness testing. Cognition of ecological benefits and cognition of health benefits are crucial pathways for promoting antibiotic reduction in farming, and Internet usage significantly enhances farmers ' cognition of ecological and health benefits. Regarding information effectiveness, technical training exhibits complementary effects on Internet usage. The marginal effects of Internet usage on antibiotic reduction among farmers are significantly enhanced when the quantity and quality of family labor are at a medium level or higher. Internet usage has a substantial impact on antibiotic reduction among farmers when the quantity of family labor is at a medium level or higher, and information effectiveness can effectively promote antibiotic reduction in farming. There is no apparent heterogeneity in the impact of information effectiveness on antibiotic reduction among farmers of different quality groups.

T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by impaired renal function and is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Sheep milk contains several bioactive molecules with protective effects against inflammation and oxidative stress. In the current study, we investigated the potential renoprotective effects of sheep milk and the associated mechanisms of action in an adenine-induced CKD murine model. Sheep milk delayed renal chronic inflammation (e.g., significant reduction in levels of inflammatory factors Vcam1, Icam1, Il6, and Tnfa), fibrosis (significant reduction in levels of fibrosis factors Col1a1, Fn1, and Tgfb), oxidative stress (significant increase in levels of antioxidants and decrease in oxidative markers), mineral disorders, and renal injury in adenine-treated mice (e.g. reduced levels of kidney injury markers NGAL and KIM-1). The combined proteomics and metabolomics analyses showed that sheep milk may affect the metabolic processes of several compounds, including proteins, lipids, minerals, and hormones in mice with adenine-induced chronic kidney disease. In addition, it may regulate the expression of fibrosis-related factors and inflammatory factors through the JAK1/STAT3/HIF-1 alpha signaling pathway, thus exerting its renoprotective effects. Therefore, sheep milk may be beneficial for patients with CKD and should be evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB  - Odorous and greenhouse gases emissions from animal manure composting cause air pollution and nutrient loss. This research examined the effects of thermophilic fungal agent (F) and bacterial agent (B) on the emissions of odorous and greenhouse gases during chicken manure composting and explored the underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that the cumulative emission of ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in F treatment decreased by 20.1 %, 34.2 %, 8.3 % and 26.1 %, respectively, in comparison to 25.3 % reduction in H2S and 9.3 % reduction in N2O in B treatment. F treatment increased the relative abundance of amoA, pmoA and nosZ, while lowering that of ureC, dsrB, mcrA and nirK. Furthermore, inoculation of thermophilic microbial agent significantly altered the evolution of bacterial communities during composting. Pearson correlation and co-occurrence network analysis revealed that Bacillus, Ammoniibacillus, Acinetobacter, Escherichia-Shigella and Oceanobacillus were closely related to gaseous emissions during composting. This study demonstrated that thermophilic fungal inoculation was efficient for mitigating odorous and greenhouse gases emissions during animal manure composting.

AB  - This study examined the effects of three Bacillus strains and one Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain on nitrogen transformation and microbial communities in pig and chicken manure compost. The findings revealed that the use of compound microbial inoculants increased the compost temperature, accelerated moisture reduction, enhanced cellulase activity, and stimulated the accumulation of NH4+-N, NO3--N, and total nitrogen (TN), resulting in a 9% increase in TN content. The abundance of Firmicutes decreased by 3.95% at the maturation phase, while Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased by 1.64% and 1.85%, respectively. Inoculation led to an increase in amoA, nxrA and nifH gene copy numbers, while simultaneously reducing the abundance of nirK, nosZ and nirS genes. It also resulted in an increase in functional enzyme levels, specifically nif and amo, with a corresponding decrease in nor. Clostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, Eubacterium and Faecalibacterium from the class Clostridium, which have a significant correlation with nifH and nxrA genes, suggest their likely crucial role in nitrogen retention and fixation. Inoculation aided in the removal of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) like fluoroquinolones, nucleosides and nitroimidazole. This study provides effective theoretical support for the mechanism of nitrogen retention and fixation, and for improving the quality of compost.
   This study investigates the application of specific microbial inoculants in the composting process of pig and chicken manure, resulting in a 9% increase in total nitrogen content. The introduction of these inoculants instigated a beneficial shift in the microbial community, augmenting nitrogen retention and fixation, while concurrently diminishing the prevalence of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. This research highlights the potential of microbial interventions to enhance the quality of agricultural compost and mitigate environmental risks. image

AB  - Drugs targeting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have been approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the presence of undesirable psychotomimetic and cognitive side effects may limit their utility. In this study, we show that the phosphorylation levels of the GluN2B subunit at tyrosine (Y) 1070 increase in mice after both acute and chronic restraint stress (CRS) exposure. Preventing GluN2B-Y1070 phosphorylation via Y1070F mutation knockin produces effects similar to those of antidepressants but does not affect cognitive or anxiety-related behaviors in subject mice. Mechanistically, the Y1070F mutation selectively reduces non-synaptic NMDAR currents and increases the number of excitatory synapses in the layer 5 pyramidal neurons of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not in the hippocampus. Altogether, our study identifies phosphorylation levels of GluN2B-Y1070 in the mPFC as a dynamic, master switch guarding depressive behaviors, suggesting that disrupting the Y1070 phosphorylation of GluN2B subunit has the potential for developing new antidepressants.

AB  - Mitigation of methane (CH4) emissions from slurry pits within pig barns can be achieved through treatment of residual slurry left after frequent flushing of the slurry pits. In this study, dosages of additives such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were optimized to achieve reduction in CH4 emissions from residual pig slurry during storage. In addition, the effects on emissions when both the treatments were combined and the effects of SDS treatment on slurry acidified with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were studied in order to reduce CH4 and ammonia (NH3) emissions from residual pig slurry storage. A maximum of 98% and 70% reduction in CH4 emissions were achieved with SDS and H2O2 treatments, respectively. The combination of SDS and H2O2 did not increase efficiency in reducing CH4 emissions compared to SDS treatment alone. Whereas the application of SDS to slurry acidified with H2SO4 (pH 6.2) increased the CH4 mitigation efficiency by 15-30% compared to treating slurry with only SDS. The combined treatment (SDS + H2SO4) reduced NH3 emissions by 20% compared to treating slurry with H2SO4 (pH 6.2) alone. Hereby, combined treatment (SDS + H2SO4) can reduce both CH4 and NH3 emissions, with a reduced amount of chemicals required for the treatment. Hence, application of SDS at concentrations <2 g kg(-1) to acidified slurry is recommended to treat residual pig manure in pig barns.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rosa damascena is an ancient plant with significance in both medicine and perfumery that have a variety of therapeutic properties, including antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and anti-stress effects. Rose damascena essential oil (REO) has been used to treat depression, anxiety and other neurological related disorders in Iranian traditional medicine. However, its precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact and mechanism underlying the influence of REO on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats. Materials and methods: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique coupling was used to analyze of the components of REO. A CUMS rat model was replicated to assess the antidepressant effects of varying doses of REO. This assessment encompassed behavioral evaluations, biochemical index measurements, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. For a comprehensive analysis of hippocampal tissues, we employed transcriptomics and incorporated weighting coefficients by means of network pharmacology. These measures allowed us to explore differentially expressed genes and biofunctional pathways affected by REO in the context of depression treatment. Furthermore, GC-MS metabolomics was employed to assess metabolic profiles, while a joint analysis in Metscape facilitated the construction of a network elucidating the links between differentially expressed genes and metabolites, thereby elucidating potential relationships and clarifying key pathways regulated by REO. Finally, the expression of relevant proteins in the key pathways was determined through immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Molecular docking was utilized to investigate the interactions between active components and key targets, thereby validating the experimental results. Results: REO alleviated depressive-like behavior, significantly elevated levels of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and reduced hippocampal neuronal damage in CUMS rats. This therapeutic effect may be associated with the modulation of the serotonergic synapse signaling pathway. Furthermore, REO rectified metabolic disturbances, primarily through the regulation of amino acid metabolic pathways. Joint analysis revealed five differentially expressed genes (EEF1A1, LOC729197, ATP8A2, NDST4, and GAD2), suggesting their potential in alleviating depressive symptoms by modulating the serotonergic synapse signaling pathway and tryptophan metabolism. REO also modulated the 5-HT2A-mediated extracellular regulated protein kinasescAMP-response element binding protein-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (ERK-CREB-BDNF) pathway. In addition, molecular docking results indicated that citronellol, geraniol and (E,E)-farnesol in REO may serve as key active ingredients responsible for its antidepressant effects. Conclusions: This study is the first to report that REO can effectively alleviate CUMS-induced depression-like effects in rats. Additionally, the study offers a comprehensive understanding of its intricate antidepressant mechanism from a multi-omics and multi-level perspective. Our findings hold promise for the clinical application and further development of this essential oil.

AB  - Bibionidae is a family of flies known as March flies or lovebugs. An updated list of March flies analyzed until now from Uruguay is presented. The data provided here are based on specimens deposited in the two larger Uruguayan entomological collections, new samples and literature records of Bibionidae in Uruguay. Eight species from three genera are recorded in the country, namely: Bibio Geoffroy, with the species Bibio dacunhai Hardy, Dilophus Meigen with four species, Dilophus collaris Guerin-Meneville, Dilophus pectoralis Wiedemann, Dilophus aff. tetracanthus and Dilophus Fitzgerald. Unidentified morphospecies were observed in iNaturalist records indicating that more species must be present in the country. Besides, a different morph of P. gibbosa, named here as Plecia aff. gibbosa may represent another species. Bibio dacunhai, P. collaris, P. gibbosa and P. ramosa as well as the genera Bibio and Plecia, are recorded for the first time in Uruguay. Additionally, species previously recorded from Uruguay are discussed and the first record of wild boar feeding on Bibionidae larvae in the Neotropical region is reported.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a transition metal that is toxic to living organisms in the environment and endangers living organisms. To explore whether Cd induces apoptosis in pig thymus and its possible mechanism, the role Cd induction of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway in apoptosis of thymus cells was studied in pigs. We found that Cd exposure (the feed is treated with Cd) significantly increased Cd accumulation in the thymus of pigs. The TUNEL assay confirmed the typical apoptotic characteristics of thymus in Cd group. Moreover, in the Cd group, the activities of antioxidant indices decreased significantly, while the levels of oxidative stress indexes increased significantly, and the mRNA levels of GSH, CAT, Gpx1, GST, SOD1, and SOD2 decreased obviously. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of PTEN/PI3K/AKT and apoptosis-related genes were detected by qPCR and western blotting. The results show that the expressions of PI3K and AKT decreased, while the expression of PTEN increased, indicating that pathway activated. With the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway regulating, Bcl-2 expression decreased. Conversely, the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related genes were up-regulated. In conclusion, accumulation of Cd in the pigs caused oxidative damage to immune tissues. In addition, Cd-induced oxidative stress activates the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, inducing apoptosis in the thymus of pigs.

AB  - Hormone monitoring of at-risk species can be valuable for evaluation of individual physiological status. Traditional non-invasive endocrine monitoring from urine and faeces typically captures only a short window in time, poorly reflecting long-term hormone fluctuations. We examined toenail trimmings collected from African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants during routine foot care, to determine if long-term hormone patterns are preserved in these slow-growing keratinized tissues. We first measured the growth rate of elephant toenails biweekly for one year, to establish the temporal delay between deposition of hormones into nail tissue (at the proximal nail bed) and collection of toenail trimmings months later (at the distal tip of the nail). In African elephants, toenails grew similar to 0.18 +/- 0.015 mm/day (mean +/- SEM) and in Asian elephants, toenails grew similar to 0.24 +/- 0.034 mm/day. This slow growth rate, combined with the large toenail size of elephants, may mean that toenails could contain a 'hormone timeline' of over a year between the nail bed and nail tip. Progesterone, testosterone and cortisol were readily detectable using commercial enzyme immunoassays, and all assays passed validations, indicating that these hormones can be accurately quantified in elephant toenail extract. In most cases, variations in hormone concentrations reflected expected physiological patterns for adult females and males (e.g. ovarian cycling and musth) and matched individual health records from participating zoos. Progesterone patterns aligned with our calculations of temporal delay, aligning with female ovarian cycling from over six months prior. Unexpectedly, male testosterone patterns aligned with current musth status at the time of sample collection (i.e. rather than prior musth status). Though this sample type will require further study, these results indicate that preserved hormone patterns in elephant toenails could give conservationists a new tool to aid management of elephant populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus of Spodoptera frugiperda (SfMNPV) plays an important role in regulating its natural host and has high potential for use as a bioinsecticide. However, information about how agricultural practices such as fertilization and plant biotic interactions affect the biocontrol efficacy of SfMNPV is limited. In this study, we examined how multitrophic maize-mycorrhiza-insect herbivore interactions affect the biocontrol efficacy of SfMNPV against S. frugiperda under full and reduced mineral nitrogen fertilization. Two fully factorial greenhouse pot experiments with three factors were performed: (i) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (with and without AMF), (ii) nitrogen fertilization (50% and 100% N), and (iii) insect (with and without of S. frugiperda). The biocontrol efficacy of SfMNPV against S. frugiperda was examined using detached leaves under controlled environmental conditions.
   RESULTS: Associating maize with AMF resulted in multitrophic cascade effects. Plants with AMF showed suppression of plant growth and increased leaf N and P content, which coincided with increased foliar herbivory and larval biomass that finally reduced the susceptibility of S. frugiperda to SfMNPV. Reduced levels of N fertilization mitigated these observed cascade effects on the biocontrol efficacy of SfMNPV with maize mycorrhizas.
   CONCLUSION: Our results show that AMF can modulate S. frugiperda-SfMNPV interactions via plant-mediated phenotypic responses to the mycorrhizal association and are most likely linked with increased leaf food quality for S. frugiperda. These results call for further studies to address the mode of interaction and possible implications for pest management in maize agroecosystems.

AB  - The current radioecological situation of the territory in Bryansk oblast that was polluted as a result of the Chernobyl accident is analyzed based on calculating the radiation dose rate for reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The initial data for the assessment were observation data (May-December in 1986-2020) on the density of soil contamination in the areas of Bryansk oblast located within different zones of radioactive contamination. Elk (Alces alces), the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and the earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) were selected as reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The total radiation dose rate for the biota objects was determined in accordance with the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and Roshydromet R 52.18.820-2015. Cs-137 was considered as the main dose-forming radionuclide. The contribution of Sr-90 to the radiation dose rate was insignificant (0.1-4.9%). Analysis of the radiation safety of biota objects consisted in checking the condition that the integral indicator of soil pollution (IISP) in the areas of Bryansk oblast did not exceed the environmentally safe level. According to the current monitoring data on the state of the territory of the Chernobyl radioactive trace, the IISP is significantly lower than the environmentally safe level for all areas of this region except for the exclusion zones. The maximum radiation doses were recorded for elk living in the vicinity of the village of Zaborye, Krasnogorsk raion, in 2020. According to a conservative estimate, a high dose load on biota exceeding the safe radiation level (SRL) for elk and the bank vole was observed in 1986 in Novozybkovsk raion. The dose rate for vertebrate animals in the contaminated areas of the region is one order of magnitude lower than the safe radiation level. In the future, it is recommended to continue radioecological studies of the territories and monitoring of the radiation situation in the most polluted areas of Bryansk oblast. It is also necessary to organize a radioecological reserve in the exclusion zones to carry out regular observations and improve the system of radiation protection of the environment.

AB  - Flying lemurs are able to glide using a thin membrane of skin (patagium) connected to their limbs, body, and part of tails. The Malayan flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) is endemic to Southeast Asia. Previous information on food habits of this species has been anecdotal, and few studies on their dietary composition have been conducted. From the information of sibling species, we predicted that the Malayan flying lemurs to be folivorous. We firstly tried a quantitative analysis of the dietary compositions of the Malayan flying lemurs together with food availability in West Java, Indonesia, throughout the year. The Malayan flying lemurs seasonally changed foods: leaves from December to July largely overlapping with the rainy season (October-June) and fruits from August to November largely overlapping with the dry season (July-September). When fruits were abundant, the proportions of fruits in the feces increased while proportions of leaves in the feces decreased, or the flying lemur shifted their foods from leaves to fruits. In this period, tree leaves were abundant, which did not explain the decrease in the feces. This implies that the flying lemurs fed on tree leaves in the majority of the year but they shifted to fruits when they were abundant though leaves were also abundant. The abrupt changes in the dietary composition of the flying lemurs were different from those of the sympatric folivorous primate, Javan lutung (Trachypithecus auratus), for which dietary composition showed a gradual change from leaves to fruits. Such inter-specific differences would be caused by differences in body sizes and/or digestive physiology.

AB  - The effects of incorporating yeast culture (YC) into pelleted feeds on sheep production and the potential impact on rumen microbial populations, microbial metabolism, and fermentation have not been extensively studied. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of YC on growth performance, rumen tissue development, rumen fermentation, and rumen microflora in sheep and to explore the potential microbial mechanisms involved. Fifty healthy 3-month-old male lambs of small-tailed Han sheep, with an average weight of 28.44 +/- 0.63 kg, were randomly divided into five groups: control (0% YC), 3% YC, 6% YC, 9% YC, and 12% YC. The pre-feeding period lasted for 15 days, followed by an official feeding period of 60 days. On the last day of the formal feeding period, six lambs that exhibited the best growth performance were randomly selected from the control group and the 9% YC group. These sheep were slaughtered, then the rumen epithelial tissue and rumen contents were collected for the measurement of rumen fermentation, microbial populations, and metabolites. Compared to the control group, the YC-treated groups showed higher daily and final body weight gains, as well as increased levels of propionic acid, butyric acid, and total volatile fatty acids (p < 0.05). YC supplementation also enhanced rumen papilla length and width (p < 0.05). Additionally, YC increased the relative abundance of certain microbial species (p < 0.05). These results suggest that supplementing 9% YC in pelleted diets for small-tailed Han sheep may enhance growth performance and improve the rumen environment.

AB  - Plants face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors simultaneously. Many species can tolerate and resist stress, but countermeasures differ between roots and leaves. Since herbivores and environmental conditions modulate costs and benefits of plant defence traits, stress responses are context-dependent. We examined whole-plant tolerance and resistance responses to individual and combined effects of above and belowground herbivory under variable water conditions.
   We manipulated water availability and access by two common herbivores (Spodoptera exigua caterpillars and Meloidogyne incognita nematodes) to Solanum lycocarpum. Plants were either watered based on historical regional averages or the 30% reduction predicted by IPCC studies. Herbivory treatments included isolated above (AG) and belowground (BG) attacks, simultaneous (AGBG) attacks and no-herbivory controls. We then parameterized generalized linear mixed-effects models with data on plant survival, leaf and root biomass accumulation, root complexity and terpenoid concentration.
   Foliar herbivory increased terpenoid concentrations in roots relative to no-herbivory plants under control water but decreased concentrations in both roots and leaves under drought. Similarly, root feeders increased concentrations of terpenoids in leaves under control water but decreased concentrations only in roots under drought. Plants challenged with AGBG herbivory had greater whole-plant biomass (i.e. tolerance) and lower total concentrations of defensive compounds (i.e. resistance) than plants exposed to no-herbivore controls, regardless of water conditions. Importantly, the capacity of plants to grow or produce terpenoids changes when herbivory level is considered. In plants exposed to AGBG herbivory, greater nematode infection was related to decreases in whole-plant biomass and marginal increases in total terpenoid concentration. Ultimately, accounting only for individual AG and BG responses would have led to different conclusions and underestimated the magnitude of S. lycocarpum's compensatory responses. A 'whole-plant' approach revealed that belowground herbivory is the primary driver of tolerance in plants surviving moderate water stress.
   Synthesis. Whole-plant responses to stress in variable environments are complex, and their comprehensive understanding requires accounting for belowground herbivores and root responses.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to estimate the values of some blood parameters - red blood cells (RBC) count, hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) of two herds of Bulgarian local sheep breeds (closely related genetically), reared at different altitudes in one region, depending on their body condition score (BSC), too. The research was carried out in a farm in Mirkovo village (715 m above sea level) with Sofia (Elin Pelin) local sheep breed and in a farm in Gubesh village (1040 m above sea level) with Central Stara Planina (Balkan) sheep breed.
   From these two herds of local sheep (1.5-7.5 years old) were selected age-matched groups consisted by 50 animals each, from which blood samples were taken. The body condition score was performed during sampling by one individual using an adapted system. For the purposes of the research, like in our previous researches and because of narrow individual variation, formed subgroups of 10 animals each with the highest and lowest HCT in the analysis of the samples, were also compared.
   The BCS of sheep from the herd of Central Balkan sheep breed (Gubesh village) was better than that those from Elin Pelin breed (Mirkovo village), as the difference was significant between the herds in the three groups - overall for the herds (P < 0.001) and in the groups with high (P < 0.001) and low (P < 0.01) HCT. The higher altitude in the village of Gubesh together with the better BCS in this herd significantly influenced the levels of HCT in the three groups again (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01) and MCV - P < 0.05, P < 0.001, and P < 0.05, respectively.
   The levels of HGB were significantly higher overall for the herds (P < 0.05) and in the group with high HCT (P < 0.05) but the differences in RBC and MCH between all groups were not significant.
   About the MCHC - there was a high significant difference (P < 0.001) between the breeds in all three groups - overall for the herds and in the groups with high and low HCT which indicates about a specific adaptive response of the sheep's organism from Elin Pelin sheep breed to maintain a higher concentration of HGB with a smaller volume of erythrocytes for almost the same number of cells.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) is a major environmental factor negatively impacting the reproductive performance of livestock. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms of heat stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis in Hu sheep. A heat-stressed animal model was established, and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to analyze gene expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovarian tissues of both control and heat-stressed groups. The results revealed significant changes in estrus behavior, hormone secretion, and reproductive health in heat-stressed sheep, with a shortened estrus duration, prolonged estrous cycles, and decreased levels of FSH, LH, E2, and P4. A total of 520, 649, and 482 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary, respectively. The DEGs were enriched in pathways related to hormone secretion, neurotransmission, cell proliferation, and immune response, with significant involvement of the p53 and cAMP signaling pathways. Tissue-specific responses to heat stress were observed, with distinct regulatory roles in each organ, including GPCR activity and cytokine signaling in the hypothalamus, calcium-regulated exocytosis in the pituitary, and cilium assembly and ATP binding in the ovary. Key genes such as SYN3, RPH3A, and IGFBP2 were identified as central to the coordinated regulation of the HPO axis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of heat stress-induced impairments in reproductive function-manifested by altered estrous behavior, reduced hormone secretion (FSH, LH, E2, and P4), and disrupted gene expression in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis-and offer potential targets for improving heat tolerance and reproductive regulation in sheep.

AB  - There is a critical need to develop effective, high-quality, fungal-based biopesticides for use against ticks. Dermacentor albipictus, the winter tick, is a one-host species that can cause mortality in large ungulates, particularly moose (Alces alces). The larval stage of this species aggregates on the ground in a prolonged, quiescent state during the summer and then quests for hosts in autumn. This behaviour offers an opportunity to treat a vulnerable life stage with entomopathogenic fungi in an environment where both are acclimated. We produced granular formulations of Metarhizium brunneum (Petch) and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin, and tested their efficacy against winter tick larvae under semi-natural conditions within the laboratory. When granules were applied at rates of 5.0 x 10(5) and 1.5 x 10(7) conidia/cm(2), mortality ranged from 53-91% and 58-98% after nine weeks, respectively. Overall, the granular formulations had a similar ability to cause mortality to winter tick larvae regardless of application rate. Fungal granules persisted for nine weeks post application at concentrations of 9 x 10(4)-6 x 10(5) CFU/g. These results demonstrate the potential of granular formulations of Metarhizium to persist and kill a one-host tick whose larvae have a prolonged off-host stage.

AB  - Both the nature of the human-animal relationship (HAR) and housing conditions significantly impact the welfare of farmed animals. To evaluate the influence of HAR on the behaviour, emotions and stress of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in two distinct outdoor living environments, we allocated 144 young rabbits to four groups (CPX-H, CPX-N, SPL-H, SPL-N) differing in the living environments (CPX for complex, and SPL for simple). The treatment by human (H) involved daily provision of additional food resources and stroking (thoughtful farmer). It commenced at 49 days of age and lasted for 16 days. N groups did not receive the treatment (distant farmer). The rabbits were observed between 48 and 73 days of age. Their behavioural responses to human presence were evaluated at 48 and 68 days using Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) and scan sampling. A set of tests was conducted at 68 days of age to assess their reactions to a novel object and human presence. Stress levels were measured by analysing corticosterone concentrations in their hair. Rabbits in the SPL environment spent significantly more time near the novel object than those in the CPX environment (24.7 vs 17.2%). Additionally, rabbits in the H treatment group spent more time near the human than those in the N treatment group (28.2 vs 17.1%) and accepted more strokes (90.2 vs 45.9%). Following the HAR treatment, rabbits in the H group were significantly more likely to be described as ' Affectionate/ Interested' than those in the N treatment. Rabbits in the N treatment were described as ' Indifferent ' significantly more in the SPL environment. However, there were no significant differences in hair corticosterone concentrations between the groups. These findings indicate that rabbits' responses are influenced by both their living environment and the quality of their relationship with humans. Encouraging positive interactions with animals may enhance their welfare and facilitate daily care from farmers.

AB  - Re-excavation of Ha Makotoko and Ntloana Tsoana rock-shelters in western Lesotho, produced abundant faunal remains (both macro and micro) from people using the Robberg technocomplex during the late Pleistocene (Ha Makotoko and Ntloana Tsoana (15.4-13.4 kcal. BP) and early Holocene (Ntloana Tsoana 11.1-10.2 kcal. BP). This faunal material allows us to identify the subsistence strategies they employed, using the unbiased Simpson's evenness index (1-D'), and Shannon's evenness index to track diet breadth. Detailed analyses of the sites' microfauna indicates that eagle owls and/or small carnivores - not humans - were responsible for introducing them into the deposits. A chi-squared test comparing diet breadth across the sites identifies hunting strategy, focused on size 2 and 3 migratory ungulates (equids, suids, and bovids), supplemented with size 1 and 4 bovids. Comparing the evenness values from Ha Makotoko and Ntloana Tsoana to published data from other Robbergassociated sites in the wider Maloti-Drakensberg region (Sehonghong, Rose Cottage Cave and Tloutle) allows variability in subsistence strategies to be addressed. A chi-squared test comparing ungulate size classes, small mammals and fish with the evenness index reveals two important statistical differences: the warm period occupation (16.5-14.3 kcal. BP) at Rose Cottage Cave presents a narrow diet heavily focused on size 3 ungulates (with a lack of fish). At the other end of the climate spectrum, cold conditions at Sehonghong immediately before the Last Glacial Maximum were associated with a narrow diet focused on intensive fishing, with lower-thanexpected numbers of size 3 ungulates. The deposits at Ntloana Tsoana, Ha Makotoko, and Tloutle, along with the Younger Dryas-associated assemblage from Sehonghong, on the other hand, present broad diets. Fish and small mammals make more of a contribution to the expanding diet in the highlands. Our approach demonstrates the flexibility that makers of Robberg tools displayed in adapting to the changing climatic and ecological conditions of this high-elevation region in the interior of southern Africa during Marine Isotope Stage 2 and across the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.

AB  - Simple Summary To satisfy consumer demand, it is necessary to ensure the quality of the meat and small intestine of animals. For consideration of animal welfare and to obtain an adequate quality of the meat and small intestine, animals need to be stunned to minimize anxiety, pain, distress, or suffering. Electric stunning and exposure to a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) are common stunning methods in the meat industry. However, both methods have some limitations. Pale color and a higher tendency of ecchymosis is the common feature in electric-stunned pigs' meat. Exposure to higher concentration of carbon dioxide induces high aversion, irritation of nasal mucosal membranes, and severe respiratory distress causing hyperventilation and breathlessness in pigs. Hypercapnia, hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and an increased hematocrit also occur in pigs. To reducing the negative impacts of CO2, inert gases (i.e., Argon and N-2) are sometimes mixed with CO2. But, the amount of Argon in the atmosphere is very negligible (0.93%) and Argon has a high cost in the market. To maintain hypercapnic-hypoxia and improve stability, a higher concentration of N-2 has sometimes been mixed with CO2 and used in pig stunning. But, no trial has used only high concentration of nitrogen in the stunning of animals, while maintaining a hypoxic condition (less than 2% O-2 in atmosphere). Our study involved conducting a trial on electricity, CO2 (80%), and high concentrations of nitrogen (98%) in the stunning of pigs and comparing the meat and small intestine quality traits. Findings show that the meat and small intestine quality of N-2 (98%)-stunned pigs was favorable compared to the other treatment groups. The objective of present study was to investigate the feasibility of utilizing only high concentration of nitrogen gas in the stunning of pigs and its effects on the quality traits of the meat and small intestine.To conduct this experiment, three treatment groups were compared: (i) electric stunning (T1), (ii) CO2 (80%) gas stunning (T2), and (iii) N-2 (98%) gas stunning (T3). A total of 21 standard pigs (Landrace x Yorkshire x Duroc; LYD) were collected from a commercial pig farm, randomly selecting seven pigs for each group (body weight of 104.5 to 120.6 kg). For stunning, each individual pig was separately kept in a gas chamber, after which each specific gas was used to fulfill the desired level in the pit. To obtain the desired level of concentration for each gas (N-2 at 98% and CO2 at 80%), approximately 80 min and 35 min were required, respectively. It was observed that after reaching the desired level of concentration, pigs were stunned within a very short time (for CO2, 90 s and for N-2, 120 s). For electric stunning, standard quality electric devices were used. After slaughtering, the meat and small intestine of each animal was collected separately and kept in a cool room where temperature was -2 degrees C. In the meat and small intestine, L* (Lightness) and b* (Yellowness) were high (p < 0.05) in the T1 and T3 groups. The T2 group showed high a* (Redness) (p < 0.05) values in both the meat and small intestine. A proximate composition of meat showed no significant differences except moisture. The water holding capacity (WHC), cooking loss (CL), and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of meat were lowest in the T2 group, but not at a notable difference compared to T3.
   In the small intestine, L* (Lightness), a* (Redness), b* (Yellowness), and thickness significantly differed (p < 0.05) in each group, but WBSF showed no significance between the T2 and T3 groups. It is concluded that a high concentration of N-2 gas (98%) may be considered in the stunning of pigs, and its effect on meat and small intestine is favorable.

AB  - The LSD mainly affects the cattle population and other animals, especially buffalo and cows. Due to the significant loss of dairy products and cattle population, it is necessary to highlight this issue by means of a mathematical modeling approach. We formulate a mathematical model for understanding LSD by taking all the possible routes that cause the disease to spread in the community. We study the basic results for the model and then obtain their possible equilibria. The model's local and global asymptotical stability analysis is shown for the basic reproduction number less than unity. We further find a list of suitable parameter values for the model parameters and present the graphical results of the model.

AB  - Progesterone and oestrogen are the main gonadal steroid hormones that regulate the ovarian activity and induce the fertile oestrus period in females. The monitoring of this receptive phase is particularly decisive for captive breeding and is commonly based on the observation of female behavioural patterns that coincide with their hormonal oestrus. However, in the white rhinoceros (WR), a species that is well known for its impaired reproductive rate in captivity, the female behavioural and vocal indicators of receptivity have not been systematically investigated or linked to their hormonal states so far. In order to close this gap, we combined behavioural and acoustic recordings, conducted over an average period of 32 days, with the analysis of faecal progesterone and oestrogen metabolite concentrations (fPM and fEM) in 27 adult Southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum; SWR) females from 10 European zoos. For eight of the study females, we were able to detect a receptive period indicated by their acceptance of sexual behaviour from the bulls. The comparison of behaviour and vocalization between receptive and non-receptive periods in these females demonstrated that particularly presenting and marking behaviour distinctly peaked during the receptive period, indicating the significance of olfactory signalling for female reproductive behaviour. Based on the analysis of fPM profiles, we were able to identify different reproductive states (cycling, non-cycling, pregnant) in 21 of 27 study females. In contrast, fEM profiles proved to be unsuitable for the detection of ovarian activity. For the majority (five of six females for which behavioural receptivity and endocrine cyclicity were determined), a coincidence of their receptive period and the hormonal oestrus, indicated by a nadir in fPM levels, could be detected. Conclusively, this study revealed a comprehensive behavioural repertoire that reflects the hormonal oestrus in SWR females and can therefore be reliably used for non-invasive ex situ reproduction monitoring.

AB  - Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the misfolding of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP (c)) into its infectious isoform (PrPSc). Although prion diseases in humans, sheep, goats, and cattle have been extensively studied, feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) remains poorly understood. Genetic factors, particularly polymorphisms in the prion protein gene (PRNP) and prion-like protein gene (PRND), have been linked to prion disease susceptibility in various species. However, no studies have yet investigated the PRND gene in cats with respect to prion diseases. Therefore, we investigated polymorphisms in the feline PRND gene and analyzed their genetic characteristics. We sequenced the coding region of the PRND gene using samples from 210 domestic cats and determined the genotype and allele frequencies of PRND polymorphisms. We identified thirteen novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including six non-synonymous variants and one insertion/deletion (InDel) in the feline PRND gene. Four of the non-synonymous SNPs were predicted to have deleterious effects on the Doppel protein's structure and function. Notably, the SNP c.97A>G (I33V) showed potential structural clashes, and the others formed additional hydrogen bonds. The LD analysis revealed strong genetic associations between the PRND SNPs and the PRNP InDel, suggesting linkage between these loci in cats. This study identifies novel PRND polymorphisms in domestic cats and provides new insights into the genetic factors underlying feline susceptibility to prion diseases. The strong genetic linkage between PRND and PRNP polymorphisms, coupled with predictions of detrimental effects on Doppel protein structure, suggests that PRND gene variants could influence prion disease progression in cats. These findings provide a foundational framework for future studies on the functional implications of PRND polymorphisms in FSE. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report on the genetic characteristics of PRND polymorphisms in cats.

AB  - During the last decade, an increase in the European wild boar (Sus scrofa) population occurred; thus, over the years, wild boars have become an important potential carrier of pathogenic bacteria for both livestock animals and pets, but also for humans. Since antibiotic resistance has become one of the greatest challenges of global public health, the aim of the present study was to define the prevalence and the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria grown on the selective medium mannitol salt agar (MSA), isolated from nasal swabs of wild boars hunted in Campania Region (southern Italy). The most prevalent isolated bacteria were represented by the Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. strains, which showed worrying antibiotic-resistant profiles. Consequently, constant surveillance of wild boars is strongly recommended, in order to assess their role as reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria and as sentinels of a possible environmental contamination.
   The importance of wild boar lies in its role as a bioindicator for the control of numerous zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases, including antibiotic resistance. Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) is a selective medium used for isolation, enumeration, and differentiation of pathogenic staphylococci. Other genera such as Enterococcus spp. are also salt tolerant and able to grow on MSA. The present study focused on the identification, by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), of bacteria grown on MSA isolated from the nasal cavities of 50 healthy wild boars hunted in Campania Region (southern Italy) in the year 2019. In addition, the antimicrobial resistance phenotype of the isolated strains was determined by disk diffusion method. Among genus Staphylococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) were the most common isolated species, with Staphylococcus xylosus as the most prevalent species (33.3%). Furthermore, Enterococcus spp. strains were isolated, and Enterococcus faecalis was the species showing the highest frequency of isolation (93.8%). For staphylococci, high levels of resistance to oxacillin (93.3%) were recorded. Differently, they exhibited low frequencies of resistance to tested non-beta-lactams antibiotics. Among enterococci, the highest resistances were observed for penicillin (93.7%), followed by ampicillin (75%), and ciprofloxacin (68.7%). Interestingly, 43.7% of the isolated strains were vancomycin-resistant. In conclusion, this study reports the phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. strains isolated from nasal cavities of wild boars hunted in Campania Region, highlighting that these wild animals are carriers of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

AB  - The myostatin (MSTN) gene exhibits significant nucleotide sequence variations in sheep, impacting growth characteristics and muscular traits of the body. However, its influence on specific growth traits in some sheep remains to be further elucidated. This study utilized single nucleotide polymorphism sequence analysis to investigate the role of the MSTN gene in meat production performance across four sheep breeds: Charolais sheep, Australian White sheep, crossbreeds of Australian White and Small-tailed Han, and crossbreeds of Charolais and Small-tailed Han. At a SNP locus of the MSTN gene, the C2361T site was identified, with three genotypes detected: CC, CT, and TT, among which CC predominated. Gene substitution effect analysis revealed that replacing C with T could elevate the phenotypic value. Comparative analysis of data from different genotypes within the same breed highlighted the superiority of CC and TT genotypes in phenotypic values, underscoring the significance of specific genotypes in influencing key traits. Contrasting the performance of different genotypes across breeds, Charolais sheep and Charolais Han hybrids demonstrated superiority across multiple indicators, offering valuable insights for breeding new sheep varieties. Analysis of gender effects on growth characteristics indicated that ewes exhibited significantly wider chest, waist, and hip widths compared to rams, while rams displayed better skeletal growth and muscle development. Additionally, the MSTN gene also exerted certain effects on lamb growth characteristics, with the CC genotype closely associated with weight. These findings not only contribute crucial insights for sheep breeding but also pave the way for future research exploring the interaction of this gene with others.

AB  - Parasitoids find their hosts by using cues released by herbivores and their host plants. In crop fields, these semiochemicals could be used for insect pest control by attracting and retaining natural enemies. The hymenopteran aphelinidae endoparasitoid, Encarsia guadeloupae (E. guadeloupae), selectively parasitizes rugose spiralling whitefly (RSW), Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin, an invasive pest of coconut in India, thus offering an effective way to improve RSW control under natural field conditions. However, the chemical interactions that occur in between the RSW infected host plants and E. guadeloupae were unknown. Hence, using olfactometer assays and chemical analyses, we investigated the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediating attraction of the parasitoid to RSW infested host plants. To investigate the attraction of the E. guadeloupae towards the healthy and RSW infected leaves of coconut (Cocos nucifera L), banana (Musa paradisiaca L) and custard apple (Annona squmosa L), we employed a six-arm olfactometer. The E. guadeloupae preferred the volatile compounds from RSW-infested host plants rather than healthy plants. A higher percent response rate of E. guadeloupae was observed in RSW-infected banana (35.83 %), followed by healthy banana (24.33 %), RSW-infested custard apple (16.33 %), and RSW-infested coconut (9.00 %) leaf volatiles, respectively. The volatile compounds emitted from RSW-infested and healthy plants have been studied using GC-MS with thermal desorption (TD). The results revealed more than 20 volatile compounds belonging to seven chemical classes were identified and characterized from infested plants by RSW. Of these, alpha-Ocimene, alpha-Pinene, 3-Carene, trans-alpha-Ocimene, and (E)-hex-3-ene-2, 5-diol were emitted at higher levels than other compounds its proven through PCA and Heat map analysis. These five compounds elicited the greatest attraction of E. guadeloupae towards RSW damaged plants. The synthetic blend of the above volatiles could be used as attractants to enhance the population of E. guadeloupae to manage RSW under field conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND Helicoverpa armigera and Aphis gossypii are two important insect species that feed on cotton plants. These insects have distinct abilities to induce plant resistance and tolerate plant toxins, which results in interspecific competition imbalance that may be fatal to the low-tolerance A. gossypii and force these insects to develop avoidance behaviors and subsequently separate from their niche. We implemented ecological experiments to test the effects of H. armigera-induced plant resistance and behavioral avoidance in A. gossypii, and employed transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses to reveal changes in resistance genes and metabolites in plants. RESULTS Our results demonstrate that cotton plants induced by H. armigera cause significant inhibitory and avoidance effects on A. gossypii insect populations. Electrical penetration graph (EPG) analysis showed changes in plant resistance induced by H. armigera leading to a decreased feeding efficiency of A. gossypii. In addition, genes associated with jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways were significantly up-regulated in cotton plants after H. armigera induction, which led to a significant up-regulation of metabolites inducing plant resistance. These observations were corroborated by bioactivity analysis on metabolites, which showed that jasmonic acid, gossypol and tannins have significant inhibitory effects on A. gossypii populations. In contrast, methylparaben is associated with avoidance behaviors on A. gossypii populations. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the differences in the ability to induce plant resistance and tolerance between two non-predatory insects were lethal to low-tolerance A. gossypii insects, which might be a major factor determining their niche differentiation. This was further demonstrated by screening anti-insect and bio-hormonal metabolites. Our study provides a reference for investigating the evolutionary relationship between non-predatory insects and insights to implement effective insect biocontrol.

AB  - During the postnatal stages, skeletal muscle development undergoes a series of meticulously regulated alterations in gene expression. However, limited studies have employed chromatin accessibility to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms governing muscle development in yak species. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of both gene expression levels and chromatin accessibility to comprehensively characterize the dynamic genome-wide chromatin accessibility during muscle growth and development in the Tianzhu white yak, thereby elucidating the features of accessible chromatin regions throughout this process. Initially, we compared the differences in chromatin accessibility between two groups and observed that calves exhibited higher levels of chromatin accessibility compared to adult cattle, particularly within +/- 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). In order to investigate the correlation between alterations in chromatin accessible regions and variations in gene expression levels, we employed a combination of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq techniques, leading to the identification of 18 central transcriptional factors (TFs) and 110 key genes with significant effects. Through further analysis, we successfully identified several TFs, including Sp1, YY1, MyoG, MEF2A and MEF2C, as well as a number of candidate genes (ANKRD2, ANKRD1, BTG2 and LMOD3) which may be closely associated with muscle growth and development. Moreover, we constructed an interactive network program encompassing hub TFs and key genes related to muscle growth and development. This innovative approach provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanism underlying skeletal muscle development in the postnatal stages of Tianzhu white yaks while also establishing a solid theoretical foundation for future research on yak muscle development.

AB  - This study's aim was to investigate iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentration in the soil, forage crops, and sheep blood with respect to the seasonal availability of these metals. Soil, forage, and sheep blood samples were sampled from five different locations in Chakwal (Pidh, Tobar, Ratoccha, Choa Saiden Shah-Kalar Kahar road, and Choa Saiden Shan-Chakwal Road) during two seasons, i.e., winter and summer. All the samples were processed through wet acid digestion for evaluation of metal contents. Because of proximity of site-1 and site-2 to coal mines, higher Fe concentration was observed than Zn. Overall, varied Fe concentrations obtained in soil were 12.95-24.31 mg/kg, 1.29-9.61 mg/kg in forage and 1.17-24 mg/l in blood, whereas Zn values were 1.04-31.9 mg/kg, 1.96-7.02 mg/kg, and 0.16-6.52 mg/l for soil, forages, and blood respectively. The pollution load index value for both Fe (0.01-0.14 mg/kg) and Zn (0.02-0.72 mg/kg) was lesser than 1. Bio-concentration (0.09-2.64mg/kg) and enrichment factor (0.08-7.51 mg/kg) were showing efficient transfer of metals through the food chain. Daily intake and health risk index values of iron were ranged from 0.01 to 1.1 mg/kg/day and 0.02 to 1.05 mg/kg/day. There was a probable chance of upsurge in metal values in coming years due to continued mining activities. Anthropogenic input, mainly mining activities in the study area, have increased the Fe and Zn content in the environment which can ultimately find their way up the food chain, thereby risking the health of grazing livestock.

AB  - We quantified the soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes of five soil fertility management practices (inorganic fertilizer (Mf), maize residue + inorganic fertilizer (RMf), maize residue + inorganic fertilizer + goat manure (RMfM), maize residue + tithonia diversifolia + goat manure (RTiM), and a control (CtC)) in Kenya's central highlands using a static chamber method from March 2019 to March 2020. The cumulative annual soil CH4 uptake ranged from -1.07 to -0.64 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1), CO2 emissions from 4.59 to 9.01 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1), and N2O fluxes from 104 to 279 g N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1). The RTiM produced the highest CO2 emissions (9.01 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)), carbon sequestration (3.99 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1)), yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE) (0.043 g N2O-N kg(-1) grain yield), the lowest net global warming potential (net GWP) (-14.7 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1)) and greenhouse gas intensities (GHGI) (-2.81 Kg CO2-eq kg(-1) grain yield). We observed average maize grain yields of 7.98 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under RMfM treatment. Integrating inorganic fertilizer and maize residue retention resulted in low emissions, increased soil organic carbon sequestration, and high maize yields.

AB  - Livestock production is a major source of pharmaceutical emissions to the environment. The current scientific discourse focuses on measuring and modeling emissions as well as assessing their risks. Although several studies corroborate the severity of pharmaceutical pollution resulting from livestock farming, differences in pollution between livestock types and production systems are largely unknown. In fact, there is no comprehensive analysis of factors influencing pharmaceutical use-the emission's source-in the diverse production systems. To address these knowledge gaps, we developed a framework to investigate pharmaceutical pollution from different livestock production systems and applied it in a first pilot assessment to compare pollution from organic and conventional cattle, pig, and chicken production systems on selected indicator substances, covering antibiotics, antiparasitics, hormones, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Given the lack of statistics, for this article we retrieved novel qualitative information about influential factors for pharmaceutical use and pollution from expert interviews and combined this with quantitative data on, among other factors, the environmental behavior of specific substances from the literature. Our analysis reveals that factors across a pharmaceutical's entire life cycle influence pollution. However, not all factors are livestock type or production-system dependent. The pilot assessment furthermore reveals that differences in pollution potential between conventional and organic production exist, but for antibiotics, NSAIDs, and partially for antiparasitics, some factors lead to greater pollution potential in conventional systems, and others in organic systems. For hormones, we identified a comparatively greater pollution potential from conventional systems. Among the indicator substances, the assessment over the entire pharmaceutical life cycle illustrates that flubendazole in broiler production has the greatest per unit impact. The framework and its application in the pilot assessment generated insights useful to identifying which substances, livestock types, production systems, or the combination thereof have great or little pollution potential, informing more sustainable agricultural management practices.

AB  - Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Collectotrichum fructicola (C. fructicola), is a major disease affecting the quality and yield of Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera); it reduces C. oleifera yield by 40%-80%. Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) YL13 is an antagonistic endophytic bacteria strain isolated from healthy C. oleifera leaves. This study was aimed at investigating the potential of YL13 for the biocontrol of C. oleifera anthracnose and the possible mechanisms involved. In in vitro assays, YL13 demonstrated remarkable antagonistic activity of C. fructicola. Its cell-free filtrates displayed antagonistic activity, which suggested that the metabolites of YL13 might play important roles. In vivo tests showed that the disease index of YL13-treated plants was obviously reduced under greenhouse conditions. YL13 secretes a variety of bioactive metabolites, including protease, cellulase, and siderophore, which might participate in the resistance to C. fructicola. In addition, C. oleifera treated with the fermentation broth of YL13 demonstrated different defense responses, e.g., accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and activation of the defense-related enzyme peroxidase (POD), which might contribute directly or indirectly to overcome external stresses. The significant biocontrol effect and host defense-induction activity of YL13 suggested that this B. subtilis strain as well as its metabolites have the potential to be exploited as microbial control agents for the efficient management of C. oleifera anthracnose.

AB  - Soil amendments with composted organic materials are recommended to increase soil organic matter (SOM) and promote soil fertility. Growing areas of hedged olive groves in the southern Iberia peninsula generate huge amounts of olive leaves, and their potential as an organic soil amendment is not fully studied. An experimental field trial in a hedged olive grove ("Cobrancosa") was set up near Portalegre, Portugal, to test a compost of olive leaves plus sheep manure (with a ratio of 2:1) when applied in a row at the soil's surface. Nominal rates of zero, 2.5, and 5.0 kg m(-2) (T0, T1, and T2, respectively) were applied in a complete randomized block setup (three treatments, three replicas, and nine plots), and soil properties of layers between 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm were annually monitored. More expressive results occurred in the soil layer 0-5 cm, and with the dosage T2. After one year, there were significant increases in the total N, carbon of the particulate organic matter, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POX-C), extractable phosphorus, and zinc. After two years, there was 16% more soil organic carbon (SOC), an absolute increase of 0.5 in pHKCl, 1.9 times more extractable phosphorus, and ten times more zinc. The soil's C-stock in the 0-30 cm layer, after two years of T1 and T2 dosages, was 0.11 and 0.35 kg m(-2) (similar to 3 and similar to 9%, respectively), which was higher than with T0. POX-C was the most sensitive SOM-related indicator, showing increases of up to 30 cm deep after one year. This compost improved soil fertility but should be monitored over longer periods of time.

AB  - Gaseous ammonia (NH3), as a main air pollutant in pig farms and surrounding areas, directly affects animal and human health. The lung, as an important organ for gas exchange in the respiratory system, is damaged after NH3 exposure, but the underlying mechanism needs to be further explored. In this study, seven weeks old piglets were exposed to 50 ppm NH3 for 30 days, and displayed pulmonary fibrosis. Then, the toxicological mechanism of NH3-induced pulmonary fibrosis was explored from the aspects of whole genome wide protein expression and post -translational modification. Totally, 404 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 136 differentially lysine acetylated proteins (DAPs) were identified. The expression or lysine acetylation levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism including fatty acid oxidation (CPT1A, ACADVL, ACADS, HADHA, and HADHB), TCA cycle (IDH2 and MDH2), and oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFB7, NDUFV1, ATP5PB, ATP5F1A, COX5A, and COX5B) were significantly changed after NH3 exposure, which suggested that NH3 disrupted mitochondrial energy metabolism in the lung of piglets. Next, we found that type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) damaged after NH3 exposure in vivo and in vitro. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was enriched in focal adhesion pathway, and showed significantly up -regulated acetylation levels at K191 (FC = 2.99) and K209 sites (FC = 1.52) after NH3 exposure. We illustrated that ILK -K191 hyper-acetylation inhibited AEC2 proliferation andinduced AEC2 apoptosis by down -regulating pAKT-S473 in vitro. In conclusion, for the first time, our study revealed that protein acetylation played an important role in the process of NH3-induced pulmonary fibrosis in piglets. Our findings provided valuable insights into toxicological harm of NH3 to human health.

AB  - Structures previously suggested to be footprints or tracks, but which have been little described, were observed within Quaternary inland dunes of the European Sand Belt. Excavation of these in several localities of the eastern part of the belt in Poland reveal that they are hoofprints of various ungulate mammals, both wild and domestic, as well as footprints of humans, ranging from potentially as early as the fifth to sixth century to the 19th century or later. Trample grounds and horizons with high densities of tracks are associated with other signs of intensifying usage of dune habitats for pasture and farming, including constrained movement of livestock, relatively well-developed paleosols, and evidence of ploughing. The presence of such abundant life traces not only reflects the presence of individual animals and people in an area, but sheds light on the potential processes and feedbacks that the tracemakers were involved in, in terms of maintaining and modifying the habitats themselves, which were dynamic and changeable. Footprints and their associated sedimentological records can be integrated with archaeological and historical data to analyse anthropogenic influence through time on physical landscapes and on the wild biota.

AB  - The excessive production of bauxite residue (red mud) in the Bayer process is one of the major challenges amongst alumina producers. The Pedersen process is known as a combination of smelting reduction of bauxite and leaching treatment of the produced slag for alumina production, and the process also produces an inert bauxite residue (grey mud), which is more suitable for further processing compared to the red mud. This paper describes the life cycle assessment for two alumina production processes, the current commercialized Bayer process and the alternative Pedersen process, based on the complete mass and energy balance simulation. Process simulation and environmental software are applied to quantify the metallurgical processes and their related environmental effects. By assuming the same treatments for the bauxite residues, it is found that, with the production of pig iron, the Pedersen process shows the best performance in mineral resource scarcity but requires a higher energy demand and generates twice the amount of bauxite residue compared to the Bayer process. The final, relative performance in climate change impact depends on the carbon intensity of energy and the bauxite ore composition.

AB  - There are various types of bacteria inhabiting the intestine that help maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiota. Lactobacillus is one of the important beneficial bacteria and is widely used as a food starter and probiotic. In this study, we investigated the daily fluctuation of the colonic Lactobacillus species and their distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as well as antibiotic susceptibility in pigs. Metagenomic analysis revealed that genus Lactobacillus was one of the most dominant genera in the colon of growing pigs. Rhythmicity analysis revealed that 84 out of 285 Lactobacillus species exhibited rhythmic patterns. Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus reuteri were the two most abundant lactobacilli with circadian oscillation, which increased during the day and decreased at night. The profile of the antibiotic resistome was modified over time within 24-h period. Elfamycin resistance genes were the most enriched class found in Lactobacillus. Furthermore, the seven strains of Lactobacillus isolated from the pig intestine mainly exhibited resistance to gentamicin, erythromycin, and lincomycin. The whole genome annotation of four Lactobacillus strains indicated the presence of multiple ARGs, including elfamycin resistance genes, however, the most abundant ARG was optrA in genome of four strains. These results indicate the presence of various Lactobacillus species harboring a large number of ARGs in the swine intestine. This implies that when using animal-derived lactobacilli, it is essential to assess antibiotic resistance to prevent further transmission between animals and the environment.

AB  - Global warming is seriously threatening sheep farmings by increasing health problems and decreasing reproductive efficiency. In this study, pomegranate peels ethanolic extract (Ppee), rich in phenolic acids, was prepared in free (Fppee) and nanoemulsified (Nppee, with 18.49 nm-21.8 nm particles size) forms. The protective role of the extracts against heat stress impacts on homeothermy, metabolism and redox status, and reproductive performance of ewes was studied. A total of 36 Barki ewes were synchronized to estrus using two intramuscular injections PGF2 alpha. On the day of the first PGF2 alpha, ewes were allocated into three homogeneous experimental groups and received 300 mg/ewe/day Fppee, 300 mg/ewe/day Nppee, or not (control) until day 35 post-mating. The Fppee ewes showed the highest homeothermy in the morning, whereas the Nppee ewes showed the lowest homeothermy in the afternoon (P < 0.001). Both extracts increased plasma total protein, glucose, total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione concentrations (P < 0.001), whereas they decreased plasma urea, cholesterol, and malondialdehyde concentrations compared to control (P < 0.001). The highest and lowest values of these variables were for the Nppee ewes. The Nppee ewes had the significant lowest plasma progesterone concentrations. There were no differences in corpora lutea numbers and diameters. Lambs born to Fppee ewes had the highest birth weights and survivability. In conclusion, supplementing heat-stressed ewes with Fppee improved homeothermy, metabolism, redox status, and lamb weight and survivability without hampering reproductive performance, mainly by decreasing progesterone concentrations as observed in Nppee ewes.

AB  - Simple Summary Different types of unconventional feed resources as feed additives for animals are used worldwide on the basis of their availability and economical consideration. Natural mineral sorbents have been used in a wide range in animal farming mainly as feed additives since the mid-1960s. Still, to date, no studies have investigated the effect of the addition of natural sorbents such as biochar, bentonite-montmorillonite and zeolite-clinoptilolite to feed on the fatty acid content of pig meat (muscle tissue) and fat (adipose tissue). The presented research carried out in this area has revealed some evidence of fatty acid profile modification. In spite of the fact that effects of investigated sorbents were often opposite, they did not adversely affect indices of nutritional and pro-health quality of adipose tissue of the pig during fattening. Due to the fact that effects of sorbents supplementation are highly variable and can depend on the composition and dosage, further research seems fully reasonable. The fatty acid composition of meat and fat was studied in Choice Genetics line pigs fed a diet with three natural sorbents. Control (C1 and C2), biochar (D, 0.5%), bentonite-montmorillonite (A, 1.5%) and zeolite-clinoptilolite (B, 1.5%) diets were used in two trials. The samples of back fat, kidney fat and Longissimus lumborum (MLL) and Semimembranosus (MSM) muscle were examined. All sorbents (D, A and B) had no effect on fatty acid composition in MLL, whereas in MSM turned out to be very limited and inconsistent. Although A and B sorbents had a significant impact on the fatty acid profile of kidney fat, their effect was often opposite. Sorbent B's effects were less beneficial due to a significantly higher proportion of saturated fatty acids, higher value of thrombogenic and atherogenic indexes, n-6/n-3 ratio but lower h/H ratio. Sorbent A's effects significantly increased polyunsaturated fatty acids, and positively influenced lipid health quality indices. In summary, the feeding of natural sorbents slightly modified the fatty acid profile of muscle tissue, kidney fat and back fat; however, it did not have a negative effect on the indices of nutritional and pro-health quality of adipose tissue of pigs during fattening.

AB  - Although there have been many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and selective sweep analyses to understand pig genomic regions related to growth performance, these methods considered only the gene effect and selection signal, respectively. In this study, we suggest the cross-population phenotype associated variant (XP-PAV) analysis as a novel method to determine the genomic variants with different effects between the two populations. XP-PAV analysis could reveal the differential genetic variants between the two populations by considering the gene effect and selection signal simultaneously. In this study, we used daily weight gain (DWG) and back fat thickness (BF) as phenotypes and the Landrace and Yorkshire populations were used for XP-PAV analysis. The main aim was to reveal the differential selection by considering the gene effect between Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. In the gene ontology analysis of XP-PAV results, differential selective genes in DWG analysis were involved in the regulation of interleukin-2 production and cell cycle G2/M transition. The protein modification and glycerophospholipid biosynthetic processes were the most enriched terms in the BF analysis. Therefore, we could identify genetic differences for immune and several metabolic pathways between Landrace and Yorkshire breeds using the XP-PAV analysis. In this study, we expect that XP-PAV analysis will play a role in determining useful selective variants with gene effects and provide a new interpretation of the genetic differences between the two populations.

AB  - Identifying hosts of blood-feeding mosquito species is important to elucidate the role of vector species in disease transmission cycles. Herein, the aim was to identify the vertebrate hosts of mosquito species using the polymerase chain reaction-based reverse line blotting method. The mosquito species were Anopheles maculipennis sensu lato Meigen, 1818; Aedes caspius Pallas, 1771; Aedes vexans Meigen, 1830; Culex theileri Theobald, 1903; Anopheles hyrcanus Pallas 1771; Culex pipiens sensu lato Linnaeus, 1758; and Culiseta annulata Schrank, 1776, which were collected from the Aras Valley between July-August 2012 and June-September 2013. The analysis of mosquito blood-meal samples revealed several mammalian and avian host species. And also varying degrees of opportunistic mosquito feeding behavior in both birds and mammals were noted. These mosquito species fed on eight mammal species, i.e., humans, cows, sheep, horses, dogs, cats, goats, and porcupines, as well as avian species. Studies on the host-feeding patterns of blood-feeding vector arthropods may provide information about the vector potential of these species. However, the host-feeding patterns of the vector species are only one part of the vector capacity. To detect the exact potential of vector species, further studies are needed on vector competence for different pathogens.

AB  - Plants are attacked by a variety of herbivores and respond with localized or systemic defenses. Plant defense against one feeding guild (e.g. chewing, piercing/sucking) may also affect alternate feeding guilds. To optimize host plant resistance, interactions between feeding guilds must be understood. Aphids are plant virus vectors whose vector efficiency can be altered by plant defenses. To determine if systemic induction influences aphid feeding behaviors related to virus transmission, three soybean varieties, Davis, Lyon, and Progeny 4906RR, were induced by subjecting plants to soybean looper (SBL) herbivory, or exogenous applications of either jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA). Green peach aphid (GPA) apterae feeding behavior was recorded on induced and control plants using the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique. SBL growth bioassays were used to assess systemic induction. Previous SBL herbivory reduced SBL larval weights when fed Progeny 4906RR. JA reduced larval weights on Progeny 4906RR and Davis. SA increased SBL larval weights on Lyon. SBL herbivory decreased behaviors associated with nonpersistent virus transmission in Davis and Progeny 4906RR. JA altered behaviors associated with virus transmission in Davis and increased behaviors associated with virus acquisition in Progeny 4906RR. SA delayed probing in Davis, but increased behaviors associated with virus transmission in Progeny 4906RR and Lyon. Inducing host plant resistance with JA may reduce herbivore performance and increase nonpersistent virus transmission. Previous chewing herbivory may decrease nonpersistent virus transmission by aphids but is variety dependent.

AB  - The low resistance of boar sperm to cryopreservation dictates that addition antioxidants and energetic substances to the diluent to improve sperm quality is necessary. This study evaluated the effect of spermidine and phosphocreatine in combination on the quality, antioxidant capacity, and antiapoptotic-like changes capacity of cryopreserved boar sperm based on previous reports. The results showed that the combined application of spermidine and phosphocreatine significantly enhanced the motility, average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curvilinear velocity, beat cross frequency, acrosome integrity, plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, and DNA integrity compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, the combined application of spermidine and phosphocreatine significantly enhanced the total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, and catalase activity while significantly decreasing malondialdehyde content and hydrogen peroxide content (p < 0.05). Western Blot analysis further showed that spermidine and phosphocreatine significantly decreased the expression of CASP3 and BAX and significantly enhanced the expression of BCL2 (p < 0.05); therefore, the combination of spermidine and phosphocreatine has potentially positive implications for improving the quality of cryopreserved boar sperm.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the degree of groundwater pollution and to assess the contribution of specific ionic sources to groundwater, thereby helping to identify the changes in groundwater chemistry and also in groundwater quality from a rural part of Telangana, India, using the comprehensive understanding of geochemical ratios (GR), pollution index of groundwater (PIG), unmix model (UM), and land use/land cover. Groundwater samples collected (22) from the study area were analysed for pH, EC, TDS, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, and F-. The hydrogeochemical diagram showed the dominant groundwater type of Ca2+- Mg2+- HCO3- due to the water-soil-rock interactions. GR, chloro-alkaline indices, and saturation indices revealed the groundwater chemistry that explains the mineral weathering and dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation processes as the chief geogenic origin, and also the contamination of surface water due to the influence of household wastewater, septic tank leaks, irrigation-return-flows, chemical composts, etc. as the secondary anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system. Changes in groundwater quality from the recharge area to the discharge area and the correlation coefficient of chemical variables further supported the sources of geogenic and anthropogenic origins. According to PIG's calculations, the present study area was classified as the insignificant pollution zone (5.89%), which shows all chemical variables within their drinking water quality limits, and the low pollution zone (43.34%), medium pollution zone (27.48%), high pollution zone (17.34%), and very high pollution zone (5.95%), which exhibit the TDS, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, and F -contents above the drinking water quality standards. This indicates the gradual increase in the intensity of pollution activity. UM also classified the contribution of specific ions (> 50%) into three sources: Source I (K+) measures the poor sewage conditions and potash fertilizers; Source II (SO42-, Mg2+, NO3-, Na+, and Ca2+) specifies the poor sewage conditions, irrigation-return-flows, and chemical fertilizers (gypsum and nitrate); and Source III (F -and HCO3-) represents the dissolution of fluoride minerals as a major contributor to groundwater chemistry. Furthermore, the land use/land cover observations had also supported the assessment of groundwater pollution levels and the contribution of specific ionic sources made by PIG and UM. As a result, the present study clearly indicated that groundwater quality of a geogenic origin is primarily overcome the impact of anthropogenic sources. Therefore, the present study suggested strategic measures to control groundwater pollution and improve groundwater quality.

AB  - Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) play an important role in plant growth and rhizosphere soil. In order to evaluate the effects of PGPR strains on tea plant growth and the rhizosphere soil microenvironment, 38 PGPR strains belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria with different growth-promoting properties were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of tea plants. Among them, two PGPR strains with the best growth-promoting properties were then selected for the root irrigation. The PGPR treatment groups had a higher Chlorophyll (Chl) concentration in the eighth leaf of tea plants and significantly promoted the plant height and major soil elements. There were significant differences in microbial diversity and metabolite profiles in the rhizosphere between different experimental groups. PGPR improved the diversity of beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms and enhanced the root metabolites through the interaction between PGPR and tea plants. The results of this research are helpful for understanding the relationship between PGPR strains, tea plant growing, and rhizosphere soil microenvironment improvement. Moreover, they could be used as guidance to develop environmentally friendly biofertilizers with the selected PGPR instead of chemical fertilizers for tea plants.

AB  - This study was aimed to determine the impact of different taurine and caffeine combinations on the motility, viability, and oxidative markers of chilled stallion spermatozoa. Each stallion semen sample was diluted in a ratio of 1:2, with various taurine and caffeine concentrations (2.5-7.5 mg/mL taurine + 0.625-1.25 mg/mL caffeine) dissolved in a conventional extender. The control samples (CON) were prepared by diluting ejaculate only using the conventional extender. The motility was analyzed using a CASA system at different time intervals (0, 6, 12, 24, and 30 h) and the viability was evaluated using a mitochondrial toxicity test (MTT) performed at the end of the incubation at 5 degrees C. The liquid part of experimental samples was separated by centrifugation after 30 h of incubation and underwent the evaluation of oxidative stress via the quantification of markers ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and total oxidant status (TOS). The samples that were treated with a combination of taurine and caffeine significantly improved the motility parameters, mainly after 12, 24, and 30 h of incubation. Samples extended with combination of taurine and caffeine neither compromise viability nor alterations of redox status. The results of this study describe the combination of taurine and caffeine as an optimal supplement for improving the quality of stallion semen during chilled storage.

AB  - Female sexual behaviors in rodents (lordosis and appetitive or "proceptive" behaviors) are induced through a genomic mechanism by the sequential actions of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P), or E2 and testosterone (T) at their respective receptors. However, non-steroidal agents, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), noradrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, nitric oxide, leptin, apelin, and others, facilitate different aspects of female sexual behavior through their cellular and intracellular effects at the membrane and genomic levels in ovariectomized rats primed with E2. These neurotransmitters often act as intermediaries of E2 and P (or T). The classical model of steroid hormone action through intracellular receptor binding has been complemented by an alternative scenario wherein the steroid functions as a transcription factor after binding the receptor protein to DNA. Another possible mechanism occurs through the activation of second messenger systems (cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, calcium), which subsequently initiate phosphorylation events via diverse kinase systems (protein kinases A, G, or C). These kinases target the progesterone receptor (PR) or associated effector proteins that connect the PR to the trans-activation machinery. This may also happen to the androgen receptor (AR). In addition, other cellular mechanisms could be involved since the chemical structure of these non-steroidal agents causes a change in their lipophobicity that prevents them from penetrating the cell and exerting direct transcriptional effects; however, they can exert effects on different components of the cell membrane activating a cross-talk between the cell membrane and the regulation of the transcriptional mechanisms.

AB  - Basal materials in ice cores hold information about paleoclimate conditions, glacial processes, and the timing of past ice-free intervals, all of which aid understanding of ice sheet stability and its contribution to sea level rise in a warming climate. Only a few cores have been drilled through ice sheets into the underlying sediment and bedrock, producing limited material for analysis. The last of three Camp Century ice cores, which the U.S. Army collected in northwestern Greenland from 1963-1966 CE, recovered about 3.5 m of subglacial material, including ice and sediment. Here, we document the scientific history of the Camp Century subglacial material. We present our recent core-cutting, sub-sampling, and processing methodology and results for this unique archive. In 1972 CE, curators at the Buffalo, New York, Ice Core Laboratory cut the original core sections into 32 segments that were each about 10 cm long. Since then, two segments were lost and are unaccounted for, two were thawed, and two were cut as pilot samples in 2019 CE. Except for the two thawed segments, the rest of the extant core has remained frozen since collection. In 2021 CE, we documented, described, and then cut each of the remaining frozen archived segments (n=26). We saved an archival half and cut the working half into eight oriented sub-samples under controlled temperature and light conditions for physical, geochemical, isotopic, sedimentological, magnetic, and biological analyses. Our approach was designed to maximize sample usage for multiproxy analysis, minimize contamination, and preserve archive material for future analyses of this legacy subglacial material. Grain size, bulk density, sedimentary features, magnetic susceptibility, and ice content, as well as pore ice pH and conductivity, suggest that the basal sediment contains five stratigraphic units. We interpret these stratigraphic units as representing different depositional environments in subglacial or ice-free conditions: from bottom to top, a diamicton with subhorizontal ice lenses (Unit 1), vertically fractured ice with dispersed fine-grained sediments (<20 % in mass) (Unit 2), a normally graded bed of pebbles to very fine sand in an icy matrix (Unit 3), bedded very fine to fine sand (Unit 4), and stratified medium to coarse sand (Unit 5). Plant macrofossils are present in all samples and are most abundant in Units 3 and 4; insect remains are present in some samples (Units 1, 3, and 5). Our approach provides a working template for future studies of ice core basal materials because it includes intentional planning of core sub-sampling, processing methodologies, and archiving strategies to optimize the collection of paleoclimate, glacial process, geochemical, geochronological, and sediment properties from archives of limited size. Our work benefited from a carefully curated and preserved archive, allowing the application of analytical techniques not available in 1966 CE. Preserving uncontaminated core material for future analyses that use currently unavailable tools and techniques is an important consideration for rare archive materials such as these from Camp Century.

AB  - Constraints on phenotypic evolution can lead to patterns of convergent evolution, by limiting the "pool" of potential phenotypes in the face of endogenous (functional, developmental) or exogenous (competition, predation) selective pressures. Evaluation of convergence depends on integrating ecological and morphological data within a robust, comparative phylogenetic context. The staggering diversity of teleost fishes offers a multitude of lineages adapted for similar ecological roles and, therefore, offers numerous replicated evolutionary experiments for exploring phenotypic convergence. However, our understanding of fish feeding systems has been primarily shaped by marine species, with the monolithic exception of freshwater cichlids. Here we use piranhas and pacus (Serrasalmidae) to explore the evolution of different feeding ecologies and their morphological proxies in Neotropical freshwater environments. Specifically, we explore whether convergence is more widespread among plant-eating fishes, arising from strong constraints on phenotypic evolution in herbivores. Using osteological micro-computed tomographic imaging (mu CT), we describe the major axes of morphological variation in pacus and piranhas, regarding their diet and feeding behaviors. Next, we evaluated whether herbivorous niches are less labile than other dietary guilds and whether herbivorous species' phenotypes evolve at a slower evolutionary rate than other taxa. We then assess how convergent herbivorous taxa are, using three different suites of morphological characters (dental, jaw, and abdominal morphometrics). Ecologically, herbivory is not a dead end, exhibiting similar observed transition rates as those between carnivores and omnivores. However, we documented widespread convergence in herbivores and that herbivores have slower rates of phenotypic evolution than carnivores. Most instances of convergence are found in herbivorous taxa, specifically in frugivores and folivores. Moreover, instances of "complete" convergence, indicated by positive convergence metrics observed in more than one morphometric dataset, were only found in herbivores. Herbivores do appear to evolve under constrained circumstances, but this has not limited their ecological ability.

AB  - In the earliest stage of development, non-dipterocarp wildlings require specific environmental conditions; they are only able to acclimate to harsher environmental conditions after this stage. As such, the environment acts as a limiting factor of early-stage development in non-dipterocarp shade-tolerant species. We examined the survival rates and growth rates of Heritiera simplicifolia and Scaphium macropodum from the family Malvaceae in the different sets of abiotic conditions. Three abiotic environmental factors medium type, greenhouse technique, and light intensity were varied. The experiment was conducted for six months in an area near Hulu Terengganu Hydroelectric Dam, at the edge of the Tembat Forest Reserve. Height, diameter, leaves numbers, and leaf area was recorded. Our results indicate that the wildlings preferred higher daytime relative humidity and natural air ventilation at night, and they grew more quickly under SN50 (358.74 Photosynthetically Active Radiation; PAR) than under SN70 (101.41 PAR). Subsoil supplemented with vermicompost improved wildling growth more consistently than subsoil supplemented with compost or burned mesocarp. The wildling's height relative growth rate (H-RGR) and survival were affected by all treatments. These results indicate that restoration efforts using young indigenous tree species at degraded sites, supply better growth environments and organic nutrients to the rhizosphere.

AB  - BACKGROUND Andean lupin (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) is an important leguminous crop from South America with a high protein content. In Ecuador, lupin yields are severely affected by the infestation of Delia platura larvae on germinating seeds. The application of elicitor molecules with activity against herbivorous insects to control D. platura infestation constitutes an unexplored and promising alternative for chemical insecticides. In this study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), hexanoic acid, menadione sodium bisulfite, and DL-beta-aminobutyric acid were evaluated for their ability to induce resistance against D. platura in three commercial lupin cultivars. RESULTS Only seeds pretreated with MeJA significantly impaired insect performance during choice and no-choice assays. Additionally, fitness indicators such as seed germination and growth were not affected by MeJA treatment. To investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the MeJA-mediated resistance, RT-qPCR assays were performed. First, RT-qPCR reference genes were validated, showing that LmUBC was the most stable reference gene. Next, expression analysis over time revealed that MeJA application up-regulated the activity of the jasmonic acid biosynthetic genes LmLOX2 and LmAOS, together with other jasmonate-related defense genes, such as LmTPS1, LmTPS4, LmPI2, LmMBL, LmL/ODC, LmCSD1, and LmPOD. CONCLUSION This study indicates that MeJA can be used as an environmentally friendly elicitor molecule to protect Andean lupin from D. platura attack without fitness cost. MeJA application induces plant defense responses to insects in Andean lupin that may be modulated by the onset of terpenoid biosynthesis, proteinase inhibitors, lectins, polyamines, and antioxidative enzymes.

AB  - Rhinogobius similis is a common freshwater goby, widely distributed from temperate to tropical regions. Information about the length-weight relationship (LWR) and condition factor (K) of this species, which is important for assessing and managing fish resources, is still limited. This study aimed to examine the variation of the LWR and K among seasons, localities and habitats of this species based on 2508 specimens collected in 2020-2021 from the Red River system in the north and a lake in the central highland of Vietnam. The standard length of the collected fish ranged 2.30-8.27 cm (4.65 +/- 0.84 cm) and the weight ranged 0.1-5.8 g (1.03 +/- 0.61 g). Fish weights could be predicted based on fish length with high accuracy, as the r(2) value of LWR was high (r(2) > 0.83). The b values ranged 2.804-3.462, being higher than those in temperate and subtropical populations in China. This species generally showed positive allometric growth with a b value generally larger than 3, meaning smaller individuals having more elongated body shape than older individuals. The estimated K value for all individuals was lower than the nutritional threshold of 1, thus suggesting that R. similis lived in unfavourable environmental conditions at the time of sampling. The growth pattern and K varied with season, locality and habitat. In the riverine habitat of the Red River, this species expressed a positive allometric growth during the rainy season but isometric during the dry season. The K values were higher than 1 in some cases and were higher during the rainy season as compared to the dry season, higher in the riverine habitat of the Red River and in the lacustrine habitat of the south than in other habitats. These latitudinal variances in the growth pattern and K across various regions affirm the adaptive ability of this species in various habitats. The obtained data will be useful for controlling this fish while managing ecosystems since it is abundant in tropical regions and has potential ecological impacts on native species.

AB  - The biotic resistance hypothesis asserts that native species may hinder the invasion of exotic species, which can occur either directly or indirectly by influencing interactions between exotic and local species. Aphid-tending ants may play a key role in the indirect biotic resistance to plant invasion. Ants may protect aphids, thus increasing their negative effect on exotic plants, but may also deter chewing herbivores, thus benefiting exotic plants. We studied native aphid-tending ants (Dorymyrmex tener, Camponotus distinguendus, and Dorymyrmex richteri) on exotic nodding thistles (Carduus thoermeri), which are attacked by thistle aphids (Brachycaudus cardui) and thistle-head weevils (Rhinocyllus conicus). We evaluated the impact of ants, aphids, and weevils on thistle seed set. We compared ant species aggressiveness towards aphid predators and weevils and performed ant-exclusion experiments to determine the effects of ants on aphid predators and weevils. We analysed whether ant species affected thistle seed set through their effects on aphids and/or weevils. The ant D. tener showed the most aggressive behaviour towards aphid predators and weevils. Further, D. tener successfully removed aphid predators from thistles but did not affect weevils. Excluding D. tener from thistles increased seed set. Analyses supported a negative indirect pathway between the aggressive D. tener and thistle seed set through aphid populations, while the other ant species showed no indirect effects on thistle reproduction. Therefore, aggressive aphid-tending ants may enhance biotic resistance by increasing aphid infestation on exotic invasive plants. This study highlights the importance of indirect biotic resistance in modulating the success of invasive species.

AB  - The occurrence of male feticide and/or infanticide represents an extreme case of sexual conflict: an adaptive strategy of male reproduction at the expense of females. Females are predicted to develop numerous countertactics; however, it has remained unclear whether countertactics can effectively shift the balance which likely depends on the social and mating system. We conducted a 15-year, detailed observation of female and male behavior during male replacement in free-ranging golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) of a multilevel society. We have identified several potential countertactics against feticide and/or infanticide, including pregnant or lactating females staying with ousted males or transferring to stay with the ousted male after being attacked, which lead to 2 of 11 fetuses succumbing to feticide, and extra-unit mating, female joint defense and transferring with their infants to other social units, which lead to 6 of 34 infants succumbing to infanticide. Female joint defenses crucially delay infanticide, providing mothers the opportunity to transfer with their vulnerable infants to another social unit where they have previously mated with the male leader or where they have female relatives. Importantly, in response to mothers starting to transfer, some males cease attacking infants, a change in behavior that is likely to be beneficial to males because during their tenures they can sire future offspring of the mothers who remain. Our findings show how dynamic interactions between males and females can be and how the conditions in multilevel societies can shift the outcome of intersexual conflict from males to females.
   In many primates, males kill unrelated fetuses or offspring to increase their own reproductive success, which bring significant costs to females. This leads to an evolutionary arms-race, where females are predicted to develop countertactics. Here, we show many novel and effective countertactics against feticide or infanticide in golden snub-nosed monkeys of a multilevel society where individuals have social interactions within units as well as within larger bands.

AB  - Introduction African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana in animals, is caused by the blood-borne parasitic protozoa called trypanosomes, and is potentially fatal. It is estimated that Africa loses $4-5 billion annually due to the death of livestock to nagana in the tsetse belt. Purpose Although The Gambia lies within this belt, there is scanty data regarding the epizootiology of nagana in The Gambia. Here, records of reported cases of nagana for the period 2010-2019 at the International Trypanotolerance Centre (ITC) in The Gambia were analyzed retrospectively. Methods For insights into the current prevalence of AAT, blood samples of 384 cattle, 42 goats, and 59 sheep from the Central River Region (CRR) and Lower River Region (LRR) were analyzed microscopically for parasite identification. Furthermore, trypanosomes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a panel of primers that identify trypanosomes to the level of the species and subspecies by targeting a portion of the internally transcribed spacer-one (ITS-1) of the ribosomal RNA. Results The retrospective study indicates that Trypanosoma vivax (66%) and T. congolense (33.4%) were the predominant species. Based on the archive records of ITC, the villages Touba, Misera, and Sambel Kunda all in the CRR of the Gambia are the most burdened with AAT. Microscopic examination of blood samples from cattle showed a prevalence of 1.56%, whereas the PCR-based analysis gave a higher prevalence of 12.5%. The molecular analysis revealed the presence of T. vivax (3.65%), T. congolense kilifi (2.6%), T. b. brucei (1.3%), T. congolense savannah/forest (0.52%), T. b. gambiense (0.52%). Interestingly, 4.43% of mixed infections i.e. multiple trypanosome species in individual animals were recorded. In 18% of the mixed infection cases, T. godfreyi, T. simiae were coinfecting cattle alongside T. congolense. The molecular identification including the phylogenetic analysis implicated T. congolense as the most predominant trypanosome species infecting animals in The Gambia. Conclusion The incidence of nagana in The Gambia is documented and the prevalent trypanosomes identified to be T. vivax, different types of T. congolense, and T. brucei including the gambiense subspecie. Finally, nagana is less profound in sheep and goats compared to cattle, with seasonal and regional variations playing a significant role in the disease dynamics.

AB  - There is a need to evaluate the interference of pig slurry rate and the terrain slope in the chemical elements losses from the soil. This work aimed to quantify water and chemical element losses by surface runoff due to terrain slope and pig slurry rate (PS) in two soils with contrasting textures. Two trials were evaluated in 2018 and 2019 in Cambisol and Nitisol. Rates of 0, 22.5, 45, and 90 m3 ha-1 yr-1 of PS were applied superficially in sites with slopes ranging from 10% to 35%. Perennial forage grass Tifton 85 (Cynodon dactylon) was grown as summer crop and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) was sown in the cold seasons in a field environment. Were determined the runoff, the volume of water, and chemical elements (Al, Ca, P, Mg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Pb, and Zn) lost by the surface runoff after natural rainfall. Increasing land slope elevated water losses substantially, on average 23.4 times in Cambisol and 10.8 times in Nitisol. This increase resulted in average increases of 27.6 and 12.4 times in the losses of the chemical elements analyzed for Cambisol and Nitisol, respectively. There was a reduction in water losses by surface runoff due to increased PS rates applied in both sites. The increased PS rate affected the losses of Cr and Cu in Cambisol and P, Mg, Cd, and Cu in Nitisol. The clayey soil potentiated the water and chemical elements losses by surface runoff in relation to the soil with lower clay content. Regardless of the soil, water and chemical element losses are maximized at higher slopes.

AB  - The pulp and paper industry generates large quantities of bark and wood waste (BWW), most of which is disposed of at bark dumps. There are dozens of such dumpsites in Russia, some of which cause negative environmental impacts due to their proximity to bodies of water. Unlike fresh BWW, old BWW is characterized by significant heterogeneity. Given that BWW stored long-term in bark dumps is a water-heavy woody material subjected to varying degrees of microbiological decomposition, the most acceptable method for its disposal is composting. This text presents the results of studies focused on the process of field composting BWW in heaps with natural aeration during the cold season in the region of Perm, Russia. Composting was carried out in two ways: (1) with mineral fertilizers; (2) with both mineral fertilizers and a microbiological inoculum. Concurrent with the field composting, laboratory composting was carried out under controlled conditions. At the end of a 60-day process of field composting old BWW at ambient temperatures of 5 to -14 & DEG;C, there were decreases in the values of the compost mixture: loss on ignition (LOI) fell by 22%, chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 98%, and respiratory activity (AT(4)) by 32%. In laboratory conditions at an ambient temperature of 30-35 & DEG;C, LOI decreased by 24%, COD by 98%, and AT(4) by 39%. The introduction of a microbiological inoculum into the compost mixture did not intensify the biochemical destruction process of old BWW, neither in the laboratory nor in field conditions.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of floating covers (FCs) in mitigating ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions from lab-scale swine slurry pits. Lab experiments were conducted over 125 days, comparing a treatment setup with FCs covering approximately 51.6% of the slurry surface to a control setup without covers. The results showed a significant reduction in NH3 emissions by 54.4% with FCs (p < 0.05), which was attributed to their ability to limit NH3 volatilization and promote crust formation. Although H2S emissions were also reduced by 22.7%, this decrease was not statistically significant, likely due to the complex factors influencing H2S production. These findings highlight the role of floating covers (FCs) in improving air quality within swine barns and reducing environmental pollution. By minimizing nitrogen loss as ammonia (NH3), FCs enhance nitrogen recycling into agricultural land, supporting sustainable nutrient management. This aligns with broader sustainability goals by addressing air quality concerns, reducing odors, and improving resource efficiency in livestock systems. This study offers an effective method to mitigate air pollution, providing a foundation for practical and sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted for two years to evaluate the ameliorating effect of locally available diverse organic materials on saline sodic soil. The treatments comprised no-amendment (control), 100% GR (16.2 t ha(-1)), vermicompost, spent mushroom compost of Pleurotus ostreatus, farm yard manure, sheep dung and green manure (Prosopis julifera) each applied @ 10 t ha(-1). Compared to 100% GR, the pooled EC reduced for two treatments spent mushroom compost and sheep dung (by 45 and 19%, respectively) while it was comparable (slight increased by 1.5%) for vermicompost. In 2019, soil pH for vermicompost and sheep dung was significantly on par with 100% GR, although this trend was insignificant in 2020. It can be concluded that vermicompost and sheep dung can be used in amelioration of sodic and saline sodic soil, respectively, and mushroom compost followed by natural leaching can be used in amelioration of saline soils.

AB  - Insect decline and loss of biodiversity not only affect large-scale agricultural landscapes, but are increasingly recognized in urban environments. It is undisputed that a greater supply of flowers in urban green spaces can provide insects with more food and habitat. However, it is still controversial whether native wild plants or non-native ornamental plants and varieties are the right choice. To answer this question we investigated the number of insects interacting with different types of plants: twelve ornamental and six related wild perennials. In this context, the number of flower visitors per plant species and plot was recorded at 10-minute observation intervals, as well as the feeding damage caused by insect herbivores on the leaves and stems of the study plants. We established 18 plant species in ten independent study plots in the city of Darmstadt, Germany. The plants were six native wild plant species, six ornamental plant species related to the wild plants from the same genus or family and six exotic ornamental plant species from other genera and families than the wild plants. Native insects (wild bees, flies, beetles, wasps) that feed on pollen and nectar visited wild perennials significantly more often (67% of all visits) than related ornamental (24%) and unrelated exotic plants (9%). In contrast, honey bees (Apis mellifera) showed no preferences to any of the three target plant groups and interacted with other plant species than most of the native insects in our study according to analyses of interaction networks. The assessment of leaf damage caused by insect herbivores on the individual plants confirmed a similar and significant difference in the insects' choices. Leaves from wild plants showed the highest herbivory (mean 2.3% of the leaf area), followed by related ornamental plants (0.8%), whereas unrelated exotic plants were hardly consumed (0.1%) by herbivores. Practical implication. Our study shows that in urban green spaces, both flower-visiting and leaf-feeding insects are more likely to use native wild plants as a food source than closely related and exotic ornamental plants.
   Der R & uuml;ckgang von Insekten und der Verlust der biologischen Vielfalt betreffen nicht nur gro ss fl & auml;chige Agrarlandschaften, sondern werden zunehmend auch im st & auml;dtischen Umfeld festgestellt. Es ist unbestritten, dass ein gr & ouml;ss eres Bl & uuml;tenangebot in st & auml;dtischen Gr & uuml;nfl & auml;chen Insekten mehr Nahrung und Lebensraum bieten kann. Es ist jedoch umstritten, ob einheimische Wildpflanzen oder nicht-einheimische Zierpflanzen und -sorten die richtige Wahl sind. Um diese Frage zu beantworten, haben wir die Anzahl der Insekten untersucht, die mit verschiedenen Pflanzenarten interagieren: zw & ouml;lf Zierpflanzen und sechs verwandte Wildpflanzenarten. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde die Anzahl der Bl & uuml;tenbesucher pro Pflanzenart und Parzelle in 10-min & uuml;tigen Beobachtungsintervallen erfasst, ebenso wie die Fra ss sch & auml;den, die Insektenherbivoren an den Bl & auml;ttern und St & auml;ngeln der untersuchten Pflanzen verursachen. Wir haben 18 Pflanzenarten in zehn unabh & auml;ngigen Untersuchungsparzellen in der Stadt Darmstadt, Deutschland, angesiedelt. Bei den Pflanzen handelte es sich um sechs heimische Wildpflanzenarten, sechs mit den Wildpflanzen verwandte Zierpflanzenarten aus derselben Gattung oder Familie und sechs exotische Zierpflanzenarten aus anderen Gattungen und Familien als die Wildpflanzen. Einheimische Insekten (Wildbienen, Fliegen, K & auml;fer, Wespen), die sich von Pollen und Nektar ern & auml;hren, besuchten die Wildpflanzen signifikant h & auml;ufiger (67% aller Besuche) als verwandte Zierpflanzen (24%) und nicht verwandte exotische Pflanzen (9%). Im Gegensatz dazu zeigten Honigbienen (Apis mellifera) keine Vorliebe f & uuml;r eine der drei Zielpflanzengruppen und interagierten mit anderen Pflanzenarten als die meisten der einheimischen Insekten in unserer Studie, wie die Analyse der Interaktionsnetzwerke ergab. Die Bewertung der durch Insektenherbivoren verursachten Blattsch & auml;den an den einzelnen Pflanzen best & auml;tigte einen & auml;hnlichen und signifikanten Unterschied in der Wahl der Insekten. Bl & auml;tter von Wildpflanzen wiesen die h & ouml;chste Herbivorie auf (durchschnittlich 2,3% der Blattfl & auml;che), gefolgt von verwandten Zierpflanzen (0,8%), w & auml;hrend nicht verwandte exotische Pflanzen kaum (0,1%) von Herbivoren gefressen wurden. Unsere Studie zeigt, dass in st & auml;dtischen Gr & uuml;nanlagen sowohl bl & uuml;tenbesuchende als auch blattfressende Insekten einheimische Wildpflanzen eher als Nahrungsquelle nutzen als eng verwandte und exotische Zierpflanzen.
   Our study shows that planting urban green spaces with native plants as a food source for flower-visiting and leaf-feeding insects can be a way to promote different insect species in urban areas. Planting or seeding based only on the needs of honey bees is less suitable for the conservation and promotion of insect diversity in urban green spaces, as the flower preferences and needs of honey bees do not match those of most other insects. Quantitative network of insect-group plant-species interactions. Each group is shown as a rectangle (Plant species: green = NATIVE, yellow = RELATED, pink = EXOTIC perennials; insect groups = black). The widths of the black rectangles are proportional to the abundance of insect species; those of the green, yellow and pink rectangles are proportional to the number of interactions of each plant species with insect individuals. Interactions are shown as connecting bars; their width reflects the number of interactions. Lines indicate interactions that were observed only once. Flower visitor groups: purple = Apis mellifera, pink = Lepidoptera, green = Bombus, yellow = Wild Bees, brown = Coleoptera, turquoise = Diptera, blue = Wasps. The numbers 1-4 in the green, yellow or pink rectangles of the individual plant species illustrate the order of the percentage of feeding damage.image

AB  - Organic and free-range pig farming offers a potential solution to multiple agricultural challenges, including high pesticide and antimicrobial use, excess fertilization, biodiversity loss, and animal suffering. Organic pig production, which includes outdoor access and rearing, has been one solution promoted by the European Union. This study, based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with organic and non-organic free-range pig farmers in Norway, suggests that while promising, sustaining these production systems faces challenges related to animal welfare, land management, and market dynamics for pork. Specifically, we note how the weak symbolic value of organic labels and principles for pigs and pork results in fragile markets, whilst pigs' rooting undermines not just soil and farm boundaries, but potentially their own welfare. Farmers have responded by forming new relational arrangements, including situating pigs as a working animal contributing to the broader productivity of the farm, and decommodifying pigs and pork in favour of using them to sustain broader social relations that produce other values and opportunities. We conclude that the flexibility and adaptability of pigs opens multiple trajectories of change, with regards to market organization, farmer collaboration and breeding pigs for rearing outdoors. If Europe is to reterritorialize the pig and pork industry around alternative production methods it requires a fundamental reimagining of the socio-material relations underpinning this industry, its moral frameworks and our relationship with pigs and pork.

AB  - The perception of airborne chemical signals by plants can trigger reconfigurations of their metabolism that alter their biotic interactions. While plant-to-plant chemical communication has primarily been studied in the context of eliciting defenses to herbivores and pathogens, recent work suggests that it can also affect plants' interactions with their rhizosphere microbiomes. In this perspective, we discuss the potential for integrating the fields of plant-to-plant communication and microbial ecology to understand the chemical ecology of plant-microbiome interactions. As an introduction for microbial ecologists, we highlight mechanistic knowledge gaps in plant volatile organic compound (VOC) perception and provide recommendations for avoiding common experimental errors that have plagued the plant communication field. Lastly, we discuss potential implications of plant VOCs structuring rhizosphere microbiomes, particularly effects on plant community and evolutionary dynamics. As we continue to discover links between plant metabolism and their microbiomes-from molecular to community scales-we hope that this perspective will provide both motivation and words of caution for researchers working at the intersection of these two fields.

AB  - Conservation of wildlife depends on precise and unbiased knowledge on the abundance and distribution of species. It is challenging to choose appropriate methods to obtain a sufficiently high detectability and spatial coverage matching the species characteristics and spatiotemporal use of the landscape. In remote regions, such as in the Arctic, monitoring efforts are often resource-intensive and there is a need for cheap and precise alternative methods. Here, we compare an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV; quadcopter) pilot survey of the non-gregarious Svalbard reindeer to traditional population abundance surveys from ground and helicopter to investigate whether UAVs can be an efficient alternative technology. We found that the UAV survey underestimated reindeer abundance compared to the traditional abundance surveys when used at management relevant spatial scales. Observer variation in reindeer detection on UAV imagery was influenced by the RGB greenness index and mean blue channel. In future studies, we suggest testing long-range fixed-wing UAVs to increase the sample size of reindeer and area coverage and incorporate detection probability in animal density models from UAV imagery. In addition, we encourage focus on more efficient post-processing techniques, including automatic animal object identification with machine learning and analytical methods that account for uncertainties.

AB  - Context While platelet derived growth factors (PDGF) are expressed in the ovary of some species, relatively little is known regarding the potential role that PDGF play in regulating ovarian follicular development.Aims To determine the effects of PDGF on granulosa cell function from ovine antral follicles and characterise the expression of PDGF ligands and receptors in developing follicles.Methods The effects of the PDGF ligand PDGFBB on thymidine incorporation and progesterone production of granulosa cells were determined with established bioassays. Expression patterns of PDGF ligands, PDGFA, B, C, D, and receptors, PDGFRA and B, were determined using in situ hybridisation. The more sensitive technique of RT-PCR was used to confirm expression of PDGFRA and B in granulosa cells of antral follicles.Key results Thymidine incorporation was increased, and progesterone production decreased, from granulosa cells in response to PDGFBB. Oocytes, granulosa cells, thecal layers and corpora lutea expressed at least one PDGF family member. Granulosa cells had faint expression of PDGF receptors, with thecal and luteal tissue also expressing PDGF receptors. Expression of both ligands and receptors was observed in stroma around the follicle.Conclusions In sheep, ovarian follicles express both PDGF ligands and receptors, and PDGFBB regulated both thymidine incorporation and progesterone production.Implications In sheep, PDGF was identified as an additional locally produced growth factor that regulates follicular function, stimulating granulosa cell proliferation and inhibiting progesterone production. Future work to better understand the role of the different ligands and receptors at different stages of ovarian follicular development seems warranted.

AB  - Plant growth-promoting fungi belonging to genus Trichoderma are known to help plants when dealing with biotic stressors by enhancing plant defenses. While beneficial effects of Trichoderma spp. against plant pathogens have long been documented, fewer studies have investigated their effect on insect pests. Here, we studied the impact of Trichoderma root colonization on the plant defense responses against stink bug feeding attack. For this purpose, a model system consisting of tomato plant, Solanum lycopersicum cv Dwarf San Marzano, Trichoderma harzianum strain T22 and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula, was used. We firstly determined stink bug performance in terms of relative growth rate and survival on tomato plants inoculated by T. harzianum T22. Then, we evaluated relative expression of plant defense-related genes on inoculated plants induced by stink bug feeding. We found evidence that T. harzianum T22 affects tomato defense responses against N. viridula nymphs leading to reduction of growth rate. Our results also showed that T. harzianum T22 enhances plant direct defenses by an early increase of transcript levels of jasmonic acid marker genes. Yet this effect was time-dependent and only detected 8 h after herbivore induction. Taken together, our findings provide better understanding on the mechanisms underlying tomato induced resistance against herbivorous stink bugs.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study evaluated the efficiency of selected semen extenders to prevent bacterial overgrowth in boar ejaculates stored for 72 h. Among the identified bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevailing species. While all extenders supplemented with antibiotics ensured a satisfactory sperm vitality during the storage period, neither of them was able to achieve a complete elimination of bacteria from extended semen. Furthermore, a number of bacterial isolates exhibited resistance to several antibiotics chosen for the microbial susceptibility test (e.g., tigecyklin and ciprofloxacin).Bacteriospermia has become a serious factor affecting sperm quality in swine breeding, this is why antibiotics (ATBs) are a critical component of semen extenders. Due to ever-increasing antimicrobial resistance, the aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of selected commercially available semen extenders to prevent a possible bacterial contamination of boar ejaculates. Three Androstar Plus extenders containing different combinations of antibiotics were used to process ejaculates from 30 healthy Duroc breeding boars. Androstar Plus without antibiotics was used as a control. The extended samples were stored at 17 & DEG;C for 72 h. Sperm motility, viability, mitochondrial activity, DNA integrity and oxidative profile of each extended sample were assessed following 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Furthermore, selective media were used to quantify the bacterial load and specific bacterial species were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The results indicate that semen extenders enriched with ATBs ensured a significantly higher preservation of the sperm quality in comparison to the ATB-free control. The total bacterial count was significantly decreased in the extenders supplemented with ATBs (p < 0.001), however gentamycin alone was not effective enough against Gram-positive bacteria, while a few colonies of Enterococcus hirae, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium spp. were present in the samples extended in the presence of a triple combination of ATBs. In conclusion, we may suggest that semen extenders enriched in antibiotics were not able to fully eliminate the bacteria present in the studied samples. Furthermore, selection of suitable antibiotics for semen extension should be accompanied by adequate hygiene standards during the collection and handling of boar ejaculates.

AB  - Premise Exploring how functional traits vary and covary is important to understand plant responses to environmental change. However, we have limited understanding of the ways multiple functional traits vary and covary within invasive species. Methods We measured 12 leaf traits of an invasive plant Chromolaena odorata, associated with plant or leaf economics, herbivore defense, and drought resistance on 10 introduced populations from Asia and 12 native populations from South and Central America, selected across a broad range of climatic conditions, and grown in a common garden. Results Species' range and climatic conditions influenced leaf traits, but trait variation across climate space differed between the introduced and native ranges. Traits that confer defense against herbivores and drought resistance were associated with economic strategy, but the patterns differed by range. Plants from introduced populations that were at the fast-return end of the spectrum (high photosynthetic capacity) had high physical defense traits (high trichome density), whereas plants from native populations that were at the fast-return end of the spectrum had high drought escape traits (early leaf senescence and high percentage of withered shoots). Conclusions Our results indicate that invasive plants can rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions. Chromolaena odorata showed multiple different functional trait covariation patterns and clines in the native and introduced ranges. Our results emphasize that interaction between multiple traits or functions should be considered when investigating the adaptive evolution of invasive plants.

AB  - Fear and extinction learning are thought to generate distinct and competing memory representations in the hippocampus. How these memory representations modulate the expression of appropriate behavioral responses remains unclear. To investigate this question, we used cholera toxin B subunit to retrolabel ventral hippocampal (vHPC) neurons projecting to the infralimbic cortex (IL) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) and then quantified cFos immediate early gene activity within these populations following expression of either contextual fear recall or contextual fear extinction recall. Fear recall was associated with increased c-Fos expression in vHPC projections to the BLA, whereas extinction recall was associated with increased activity in vHPC projections to IL. A control experiment was performed to confirm that the apparent shift in projection neuron activity was associated with extinction learning rather than mere context exposure. Overall, results indicate that hippocampal contextual fear and extinction memory representations differentially activate vHPC projections to IL and BLA. These findings suggest that hippocampal memory representations orchestrate appropriate behavioral responses through selective activation of projection pathways.

AB  - Rice productivity, a cornerstone of global food security, is increasingly threatened by a spectrum of abiotic and biotic stressors, including heavy metal toxicity, salinity, drought, temperature extremes, flooding/water logging, nutrient deficiencies, and pathogens or pest infestations. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), also referred to as phytomelatonin, was first identified in plants in 1995 and has since emerged as a potent antioxidant and versatile signaling molecule. It plays a critical role in integrating hormonal networks and modulating stress responses in plants, including rice. Both endogenous and exogenously applied melatonin enhance rice tolerance to multiple stress conditions by improving photosynthetic efficiency, reinforcing antioxidant defense systems, maintaining ionic and osmotic homeostasis, and regulating growth and development processes. In the context of biotic stress, melatonin activates innate immune mechanisms, including modulation of defense genes, synthesis of phytoalexins, and fortification of structural barriers, thereby enhancing resistance to pathogens and insect herbivores. Notably, combinatorial applications of melatonin with silicon and nano-zero-valent iron have demonstrated synergistic effects, significantly augmenting stress resilience under complex environmental conditions. Despite these advancements, key knowledge gaps persist regarding mechanistic understanding of melatonin signaling, particularly its interaction with the OsPMTR1 receptor, as well as its efficacy under multistress field scenarios. Moreover, melatonin's functional outcomes are influenced by rice genotype and environmental context, underscoring the need for optimized application strategies (such as foliar spray, seed priming, and root drenching), and precise dosage calibration to maximize protective benefits while avoiding phytotoxic effects. This review synthesizes current insights into melatonin biosynthesis, signaling pathways, and its multifaceted roles in rice stress physiology, while identifying critical knowledge gaps and underscoring its potential as an integrative and sustainable strategy for advancing climate-resilient rice production.

AB  - Camellia (Theaceae) is a morphologically highly diverse genus of flowering plants and includes many famous species with high economic value, and the phylogeny of this genus is not fully resolved. We used 95 tran-scriptomes from 87 Camellia species and identified 1481 low-copy genes to conduct a detailed analysis of the phylogeny of this genus according to various data-screening criteria. The results show that, very different from the two existing classification systems of Camellia, 87 species are grouped into 8 main clades and two inde-pendent species, and that all 8 clades except Clade 8 were strongly supported by almost all the coalescent or concatenated trees using different gene subsets. However, the relationships among these clades were weakly supported and different from analyses using different gene subsets; furthermore, they do not agree with the phylogeny from chloroplast genomes of Camellia. Additional analyses support reticulate evolution (probably resulting from introgression or hybridization) among some major Camellia lineages, providing explanation for extensive gene tree conflicts. Furthermore, we inferred that together with the formation of East Asian subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests, Camellia underwent a radiative divergence of major clades at 23 similar to 19 Ma in the late Miocene then had a subsequent species burst at 10 similar to 5 Ma. Principal component and cluster analyses provides new insights into morphological changes underlying the evolution of Camellia and a reference to further clarify subgenus and sections of this genus. The comprehensive study here including a nuclear phylogeny and other analyses reveal the rapid evolutionary history of Camellia.

AB  - Understanding the historical context of an area enables an incoming conservationist to reflect on their role in communities and to better position themselves both politically and socially within them. Here, we explore how outside agencies and institutions, including a former colonial power, have affected and influenced local communities who share their landscape with Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) in Bouhachem forest, north Morocco. In the context of initiating Barbary macaque conservation activities, we interviewed representatives from local governmental and nongovernmental organizations, city dwellers, and villagers about the historical, political, and social context of the study site. We found that villages around Bouhachem were politically and socially marginalized and discriminated against by the state and urban society. The existence of these divisions and the outside agencies' simplistic view of villages as homogeneous communities negatively influenced conservation interventions, because people resisted initiatives imposed on them without prior consultation. We found that Bouhachem villagers have been, and still are, excluded from meaningful participation in the conservation of the forest and this finding encouraged us to decolonize our own practice. We engaged meaningfully with members of the surrounding communities and responded to news of erroneous stories about our activities by developing a project working in three villages that included all households. Based on our experiences, we recommend that all conservationists conduct historical and qualitative research to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the communities they work in. This understanding should encourage conservationists to recognize their own social and cultural biases and to decolonize their practice. Attending to our own position may help us to avoid underestimating and alienating people who view conservation actions through a very different but equally valid lens.

AB  - Boar sperm quality, as an important indicator of reproductive efficiency, directly affects the efficiency of livestock production. Here, this study was conducted to improve the boar sperm quality by using a non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Our results showed that DBD plasma exposure at 2.1 W for 15 s could improve boar sperm quality by increasing exon methylation level of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and thus improving the glycolytic flux, mitochondrial function, and antioxidant capacity without damaging the integrity of sperm DNA and acrosome. In addition, DBD plasma could rescue DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine-caused low sperm quality through reducing the oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Therefore, the application of non-thermal plasma provides a new strategy for reducing sperm oxidative damage and improving sperm quality, which shows a great potential in assisted reproduction to solve the problem of male infertility.

AB  - Several Barbarea spp. (Brassicaceae) have been tested as trap crops for the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). The use of trap crops can be affected by their susceptibility to other pests, especially if the purpose is to reduce insecticide use. Barbarea rupicola Moris, B. verna (Mill.) Asch., and B. vulgaris Aiton (types G and P) (Brassicaceae) were tested for their susceptibility to the cabbage whitefly Aleyrodes proletella L. (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). The percentage of plants showing infestation by cabbage whiteflies ranged from 50% in G-type B. vulgaris and 8.3% in B. verna to no infestation at all in B. rupicola and P-type B. vulgaris. On the other hand, 95.8% of P-type plants showed symptoms of powdery mildew, Erysiphe cruciferarum Opiz ex L. Junell (Erysiphales: Erysiphaceae), while the G type and the other Barbarea spp. were unaffected by this pathogen. Additionally, the G and P types were used in two-choice oviposition preference tests to compare their attractiveness to the small white butterfly Pieris rapae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). No significant differences in total oviposition per plant were found between the two types, but within-plant differences show that the small white butterfly prefers to oviposit on the adaxial leaf side in the P type. This study indicates that in locations where the cabbage whitefly is an economic pest, B. verna, which can also be used as a dead-end trap crop for the diamondback moth, could be chosen over G-type B. vulgaris.

AB  - Simple Summary We examined traffic accidents involving wildlife and domestic animals in Lithuanian urban areas from 2007 to 2022. We analyzed the proportions of wild and domestic animals in roadkill, annual trends, the dominant species involved, and monthly changes during the COVID-19 periods of mobility restrictions. During the study period, the number of roadkills increased exponentially, with roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) being the most numerous species. The proportion of domestic animals, 12.2% of the total roadkill in urban areas, significantly exceeded that on non-urban main, national, and regional roads in the country, these being 3.8%, 3.6%, and 4.3%, respectively. During the 2020 and 2021 COVID-19 restrictions, there was a significant increase in the number of accidents involving animals in cities, which again normalized after the lockdowns. Thus, mobility restrictions had only a temporary effect. The increase in animal-related accidents, even when there were fewer people on the roads, suggests that new ways of protecting animals in cities might be required, at least through improving driver awareness on the issue.Abstract We investigated roadkills in urban areas in Lithuania from 2007 to 2022, including two periods with COVID-19 restrictions on people's movement. We analyzed the proportions of wild and domestic animals in roadkill, annual trends, the predominant species involved, and monthly changes during the restrictions. Urban roads were characterized by a low species diversity of roadkilled mammals, with roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) dominating. Total numbers increased exponentially during the study period. The proportion of domestic animals, 12.2%, significantly exceeded that on non-urban roads in the country. The proportion of domestic animals decreased from over 40% in 2007-2009 to 3.7-5.4% in 2020-2022, while the proportion of wild mammals increased from 36.1-39.6% to 89.9-90.6%, respectively. During the periods of COVID-19 restrictions, the number of roadkills in urban areas was significantly higher than expected based on long-term trends. Compared to 2019, the number of roadkilled roe deer in 2020-2021 almost doubled from 700 to 1281-1325 individuals. These anthropause effects were, however, temporary. The imbalance between the roadkill number and transport intensity might require new mitigation strategies to sustain mammal populations in urban areas, at least through improving driver awareness on the issue.

AB  - Hypothyroidism is an endocrine-metabolic disorder, and as such it compromises a wide range of physiological functions. Memory deficits and, the most recently described, circadian rhythm disruption are among the impairments caused by thyroid dysfunctions. However, although highly likely, there is no evidence connecting these two effects of hypothyroidism. Here, we hypothesized the time-of-day interferes with the memory deficit caused by hypothyroidism. C57BL/6 J mice from both sexes were subjected to novel object recognition (NOR) task during the rest and active phases, corresponding to ZT 2-4 and 14-16, respectively (ZT: Zeitgeber time; ZT 0: lights on at 07:00 am). First, we showed that neither sex nor ZT altered object recognition memory (ORM) in euthyroid mice. Next, animals were divided into control (euthyroid) and hypothyroid [induced with methimazole (0.01%) and perchlorate (0.1%) treatment in the drinking water for 21 days] groups. Under euthyroid conditions, male and female mice recognized the novel object regardless of the time-of-day. However, hypothyroidism impaired ORM at rest phase (ZT 2-4) in both sexes. Surprisingly, in the active phase (ZT 14-16), the hypothyroid males performed the NOR, though a longer time to execute the task was required. In contrast, female hypothyroid mice showed a greater impairment in ORM. Our results suggest that hypothyroidism may disrupt the circadian rhythm in brain areas related to mnemonic processes since in euthyroid condition ORM is not affected by the time-of-day. Furthermore, our findings in an animal model indicate a pronounced deleterious effect of hypothyroidism in women.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to provide the first epidemiological data on nasopharyngeal myiasis in wild red deer from Portuguese territory. This parasitosis consists of the infestation of the host nasopharynx by Diptera larvae. In this study, the first scientific report in Portugal, a high level of prevalence (50.6%) and mean intensity of parasitism (11.38 larvae) were found. The following two larvae species were identified: Pharyngomyia picta and Cephenemyia auribarbis. The life cycle of this species can be summarised in the following series of stages: one adult stage, three larval stages, and one pupa stage. The larvae are the parasitic form, living and growing inside the host. With their spicules and hooks, they progress into the host's nasal cavities causing sinusitis, sneezing, purulent mucous exudates, dyspnea, and swallowing. In addition, they can also cause neurologic symptomatology derived from erratic larvae migrations. Therefore, it would be important to develop further studies to estimate the sublethal effect of this parasitosis, for example, investigate whether it interferes with the roar and the reproductive performance, or if it leads to losses in carcass quality. For now, many doubts remain. Nasopharyngeal myiasis in red deer has never been studied in Portugal. For this reason, from December 2015 to February 2016 a study was derived on hunted red deer in Idanha-a-Nova county to evaluate the Diptera larvae presence. During the initial examination on the spot, the larvae was analysed at the nasopharynx. When present, larvae were collected for further species identification. The infestation prevalence was 50.6 +/- 7.61% (CI 95%), and the mean parasitism intensity was 11.38 larvae per affected host. Two larvae species were found, Pharyngomyia picta and Cephenemyia auribarbis, both on single or concomitant infection, with the first species having a higher prevalence and mean infestation intensity than the second. The larvae's prevalence was significantly higher (X-2 = 4.35; p = 0.0370) in males (62.16 +/- 11.05%) than in females (41.30 +/- 10.06%). Within age groups, younger animals showed a higher prevalence. This study shows the presence of P. picta and C. auribarbis larvae in the wild red deer population in Portugal for the first time. The high parasitic prevalence and mean intensity highlight the importance of this parasitosis in this wild species. For this reason, more scientific research is required to accurately assess its prevalence in other geographic areas, and evaluate the risk factors as well effects of this parasitosis on the deer population.

AB  - Simple Summary Camelina sativa (L. Cranz), commonly known as false flax, is an annual dicot species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. The plant is characterised by extreme rusticity and is able to grow in different climatic and soil conditions, including those of the Southern Italy marginal areas. Camelina is studied as a sustainable crop for food and non-food exploitation. Its interest in animal nutrition is due to the fatty acid (FA) composition of its oil, high in polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with Camelina sativa fresh forage in autochthonous goats on the chemical composition and fatty acid profile of milk and Caciotta cheese, a traditional short-term ripened cheese with a soft ivory-coloured rind, compact texture, semi-soft paste, acid fermented odour, and delicate sweet taste. The milk from the Camelina group showed a greater content of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and PUFA, with benefits for human health. Under the nutritional point of view, Caciotta cheeses were similar between the two groups, but the recruited panellists appreciated the cheese obtained from the Camelina group more for its better palatability. The research studied the effects of dietary supplementation with Camelina sativa fresh forage on the chemical and fatty acid composition of milk and Caciotta cheese, and its sensory properties. Twenty Ionica goats were randomly assigned to the following two groups (n = 10): the control received a traditional forage mixture (Avena sativa, 70%; Vicia sativa, 20%; Trifolium spp., 10%), while the experimental group was given Camelina sativa fresh forage (CAM). All of the dams grazed on pasture and received a commercial feed (500 g/head/day) at housing. The milk from the CAM group showed a higher (p < 0.05) content of dry matter, fat, lactose and concentrations of C6:0, C11:0, C14:0, C18:2 n-6, CLA and PUFA, while lower (p < 0.05) amounts of C12:0, C18:0 and saturated long chain FA (SLCFA). The Caciotta cheese from the CAM group showed a greater (p < 0.05) content of n-6 FA and n-6/n-3 ratio, although close to four, thus resulting adequate under the nutritional point of view. The overall liking, odour, taste, hardness, solubility and "goaty" flavour were better (p < 0.05) in the CAM cheeses. Further investigation would be advisable in order to evaluate the effect of feeding Camelina forage obtained from different phenological stages, and the application of ensiling techniques.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with disrupted cognition and sleep abnormalities. Sleep loss negatively impacts cognitive function, and one untested possibility is that disrupted cognition in FXS is exacerbated by abnormal sleep. We tested whether ML297, a hypnotic acting on G -protein -activated inward -rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, could reverse sleep phenotypes and disrupted memory in Fmr1 - /y mice. Fmr1 - /y mice exhibit reduced non -rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and fragmented NREM architecture, altered sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations, and reduced EEG coherence between cortical areas; these are partially reversed following ML297 administration. Treatment following contextual fear or spatial learning restores disrupted memory consolidation in Fmr1 - /y mice. During memory recall, Fmr1 - /y mice show an altered balance of activity among hippocampal principal neurons vs. parvalbumin-expressing interneurons; this is partially reversed by ML297. Because sleep disruption could impact neurophysiological phenotypes in FXS, augmenting sleep may improve disrupted cognition in this disorder.

AB  - We evaluated the fine-scale spatiotemporal habitat use by the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus) in daily active (nighttime) and inactive (daytime) periods during heavy snowfall seasons in northeastern Japan. To reveal the habitat use by hares considering the relationship with predators, we conducted camera trap surveys between January and March in 2021 and 2022 in 150 ha and footprint tracking surveys between January and March in 2022 and 2023 in 400 ha. Consequently, the shooting events of hare camera traps were significantly positively related to canopy openness, slope, and those of martens, but not related to those of foxes. The diel activity of hares overlapped with those of martens and foxes, but did not overlap with that of foxes in daytime. There were no significant differences in time lags between appearance times of hares and martens, or hares and foxes. In contrast, the forms (i.e., resting sites) of hares during the inactive period (daytime) were located in areas with closed canopies and low horizontal openness. These findings suggest that habitat selection by hares may be based on foraging rather than terrestrial predator avoidance during the active period (nighttime), and on both aerial and terrestrial predator avoidance during the inactive period (daytime).

AB  - Aim It is predicted that insular plant taxa have evolved reduced defences in response to lower herbivore pressure on islands. However, the few studies testing this hypothesis have addressed variation in individual defensive traits, without paying attention to patterns of correlated trait expression (i.e. defence syndromes). Location Balearic and Canary Islands. Taxon Ninety-one woody plant species. Methods We tested whether plant species with contrasting histories of insularity (namely, endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics) differed in their defensive syndromes using a suite of morphological, physical, and chemical traits putatively associated with herbivory. For this, we measured eight leaf traits of 42 endemic, 29 native non-endemic and 20 introduced species for which specimens were sourced from botanical gardens found in two archipelagos: the Balearic and Canary Islands. Results We conducted phylogenetic-controlled analyses which showed that, contrary to predictions, insular taxa (endemics and non-endemic natives) across both archipelagos were more defended (thicker, smaller leaves with less nutrients) than exotic species. There were no differences in chemical defence (phenolic compounds) between endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics. Finally, we also found different defence syndromes between archipelagos: whereas species from the Balearic Islands were more physically defended, on average, those from the Canary Islands had higher chemical defences. Main conclusions Overall, these results point to a defence syndrome based on low-nutrient and physically defended leaves characteristic of insular plant taxa that is indistinct for endemic and non-endemic taxa, relative to introduced species, as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in defences between archipelagos owing to changes in species composition and likely also to different histories of biotic or abiotic pressure.

AB  - Genetic diversity provides valuable genetic resources and forms the basis of plant breeding. Plant leaves are closely connected to the external environment and play important roles in plant growth and development. Here, 13 cultivars of Camellia yuhsienensis were collected from Southern China to examine the magnitude of genetic diversity and differentiation, using cluster analysis based on 21 leaf traits and ten Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Morphological study indicated that all traits varied to different degrees, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity in C. yuhsienensis. Eight typical leaf characteristics were screened using principal component analysis, which showed that the selected traits were highly correlated and clustered. Average polymorphism percentage was obtained from the ISSR marker pattern using ten primers. A total of 201 loci were amplified, of which 175 were polymorphic with an average polymorphism percentage of 87.06%. Polymorphism information content (PIC), marker index (MI) and resolving power (RP) revealed that the selected primers were found to be informative in distinguishing C. yuhsienensis germplasm resources. Nei's diversity Index and the Shannon's diversity index values indicated a certain level of genetic diversity. Cluster analysis results based on leaf structure and molecular markers were generally consistent, indicating a high degree of effective loci for morphological markers of C. yuhsienensis. Our results revealed genetic differences and commonalities among the cultivars, providing valuable information to identify appropriate seedling cultivars and conserve germplasm resources for future utilization.
