AB  - Disturbances in uterine contractile activity contribute to the development of inflammation, and recent evidence indicates that tachykinins, including substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), are involved in controlling uterine function. Here, we determined the effect of Escherichia coli (E. coli)-induced inflammation on expression of protein receptor subtypes for substance P (NK1R) and neurokinin A (NK2R) in the pig myometrium as well as their role in contractility of inflamed uterus. The severe acute endometritis developed in the E. coli group and the expression of NK1R and NK2R proteins increased in the myometrium. Compared to the pre-administration period, SP (10(-6) M) reduced the amplitude and frequency in the myometrium of the E. coli group and the amplitude was higher and the frequency was lower versus other groups. NKA reduced the amplitude and increased the frequency in endometrium/myometrium of the E. coli group. In this group, the amplitude was lower and the frequency was higher than in the CON and SAL groups. Our research showed that NK2R (10(-6) M) antagonist application abolished the NKA inhibitory effect on uterine amplitude. The application of the NK1R (10(-5) M) antagonist together with SP revealed that the inhibitory effect of SP on uterine contractility is achieved independently of the NKR1. Additionally, taking into account the fact that NKA shows an inhibitory effect with the use of NK2R on uterine amplitude suggests the possibility of therapeutic use of the antagonist as a drug increasing uterine contractility in inflammation.

AB  - ObjectiveExtracting DNA is essential in wildlife genetic studies, and numerous methods are available. However, the process is costly and time-consuming for non-model organisms, including most wildlife species. Therefore, we optimized a cost-efficient protocol to extract DNA from the muscle tissue of White-tailed Deer using the DNAdvance kit (Beckman Coulter), a magnetic-bead-based approach. We devised a 3 x 3 factorial design using combinations of tissue mass (10 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) and reaction volume (25%, 33%, and 50% of the manufacturer's recommended volumes). DNA was extracted for N = 81 tissue sub-samples (9 replicates/treatment).ResultsOur target yield was 500 ng of genomic DNA per sample, sufficient for population genetic assessments. A combination of 50 mg tissue and 25% reaction volume yielded enough DNA at the lowest cost. The factorial design revealed that varying tissue mass and reagent volume significantly affected extracted DNA yield. Our study demonstrates that sufficient DNA can be extracted at 75% lower costs than the manufacturer's standard protocol. Other researchers can directly use our modified DNAdvance protocol to perform cost-effective DNA extractions.

AB  - Respiratory rate monitoring is of great significance in pig healthy breeding for the early detection and timely prevention of respiratory diseases. Humidity sensing is an important noncontact method to monitor pig respiration, which does not cause direct harm to pigs and meets the requirements of animal welfare. This paper proposes a humidity sensor based on graphene oxide wrapped-silica microspheres (GO@SiO2). First, the sensor shows fast response/recovery performances of 0.24/0.73 s. Experiments demonstrate that the wrapped microsphere structure can inhibit water aggregation. It is speculated that the wrapped microsphere structure can inhibit the stacking of GO, and its curved surface can promote the evaporation of water molecules. Second, the sensor shows a high sensitivity of 1.2%/%RH-4.2%/%RH in 11%-95% RH range. This can be attributed to different sensing mechanisms, from hopping transport to increasing ion transport, leading to a significant change in the sensor's resistance. Third, the sensor shows selectivity to water molecules due to the hydrophilic characteristic of GO and the significant increase in conductivity by ion transport. Finally, the sensor is applied to realize the respiratory rate monitoring of adult pigs and piglets.

AB  - Background This prospective study is focused on evaluating radiological properties of AFRS. We analysed specific CT features related to the presence of AFRS, as well as explored the possible usefulness of the texture image analysis (TIA) as an additional diagnostical parameter. Methods The CT images of maxillary sinuses of 37 adult patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis were analysed for homogeneity, high-attenuation areas, density of the soft tissue mass, bony wall thickness and density. TIA included assessment of uniformity, contrast, homogeneity and entropy of sinus content. Results In the F+ group, soft tissue mass was significantly more non-homogeneous, high-attenuation areas were more prevalent, while soft tissue densities were higher. The sinus wall showed a tendency towards decreased thickness and significantly higher density in the F+ group. Among TIA parameters only homogeneity was significantly lower in the F+ group. Conclusions Presence of fungi should be suspected when the sinus is filled with a non-homogenous soft tissue content of a high CT density not necessarily presented as clearly visible hyperattenuation material. Additional criteria in radiological diagnostics of AFRS should encompass assessment of sinus bony wall density. TIA may serve as a tool for quantitative assessment of subjective CT features such as homogeneity of the soft tissue mass for investigative purposes. However, other TIA parameters showed limited potential.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions have been extensively studied in tomato plants and their most common pests. Tomato plant chemical defenses, both constitutive and inducible, play a role in mediating these interactions. Damaged tomato plants alter their volatile profiles, affecting herbivore preferences between undamaged and damaged plants. However, previous studies on tomato volatiles and herbivore preferences have yielded conflicting results, both in the volatile chemistry itself as well as in the attraction/repellent herbivore response. This study revisits the volatile-mediated interactions between tomato plants and two of their main herbivores: the leafminer Tuta absoluta and the whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum. Tomato plant volatiles were analyzed before and after damage by each of these herbivores, and the preference for oviposition (T. absoluta) and settling (T. vaporariorum) on undamaged and damaged plants was assessed both after conspecific and heterospecific damage. We found that both insects consistently preferred damaged plants over undamaged plants. The emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) increased after T. absoluta damage but decreased after T. vaporariorum damage. While some of our findings are in line with previous reports, T. absoluta preferred to oviposit on plants damaged by conspecifics, which differs from earlier studies. A comparison of HIPVs emitted after damage by T. absoluta and T. vaporariorum revealed differences in up- or down-regulation, as well as significant variations in specific compounds (12 for T. absoluta and 26 for T. vaporariorum damaged-plants). Only two compounds, beta-caryophyllene and tetradecane, significantly varied because of damage by either herbivore, in line with the overall variation of the HIPV blend. Differences in HIPVs and herbivore preferences may be attributed to the distinct feeding habits of both herbivores, which activate different defensive pathways in plants. The plant's challenge in simultaneously activating both defensive pathways may explain the preference for heterospecific damaged plants found in this study, which are also in line with our own observations in greenhouses.

AB  - Wildlife clinics play a critical role in safeguarding the well-being and survival of diverse animal species, but their admissions data are also valuable for investigating threats and challenges impacting local wildlife. This study examines 10 years of admissions data from the Phillip Island Wildlife Clinic in Victoria, Australia, to identify species, primary causes, outcomes, and temporal trends of clinic admissions. Avian species constitute the majority of admissions (64.5%), with sea and water birds being the most frequently admitted group. Motor vehicle accidents, injuries of unknown cause, and orphaning are the dominant causes of admission for birds and mammals. Car strikes are the leading cause of admission for land birds, land mammals, macropods, and turtles. Orphaning exhibits a seasonal pattern, with a higher number of cases in spring. Overall, 59.1% of admissions resulted in mortality, with causes related to trauma showing significantly higher mortality risks than others. The findings emphasise the impact of tourism on wildlife populations and the urgent need for targeted conservation strategies on Phillip Island.

AB  - Predation is widely recognized as a powerful selective pressure on primate behavior and ecology, although knowledge of predator-prey relationships remains limited partly due to the rarity of directly observed attacks on primates. Here, we describe four confirmed or suspected instances of leopard (Panthera pardus) predation on free-ranging Sichuan (golden) snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), a highly endangered colobine species endemic to China. We recorded predation events and the reactions of monkey group members. We suggest that the evolution of a multilevel society may be an adaptive response by Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys to the risk from leopards as well as other potential predators, one that balances the pressures of predation and intra-species competition and conflict.

AB  - Sindh province is harbor of maximum number of goat breeds in Pakistan. However, information is limited to basic on indigenous breeds of the province. Therefore, current study was designed to investigate body weight, body measurements, productive and reproductive performances of ten goat breeds. A survey was carried out in breeding tracts of Kamori, Tapri, Bugi-Tori, Pateri, Kachan, Jattan, Lohri, Chappar, Barri, and Thari. Data for 395 animals were collected and arranged according to age class, sex and breed while analyzed using Mixed Model by REML methodology in R program to investigate the effects of breed, sex and age on body measurements and body weight whereas data on productive and reproductive performance were analyzed using basic statistic tools in R program. Overall, breeds differed for live body weight, heart girth, body length, body height and chest length (P <= 0.05) except for pubic bone length (P <= 0.05). Kamori had the highest mean body weight of 67.58 +/- 1.41 Kg. There was a significant difference among age class for all the body measurement and body weight (P <= 0.05). The highest birth weight and weaning weight were observed in Pateri (2.90 +/- 0.11 Kg) and Kachan (16.0 +/- 0.50 Kg), respectively. Moreover, the highest weaning age was in Bugi-Tori (8.0 +/- 0.14 months) while highest milk yield was in Kamori (3.50 +/- 0.90 Kg per day). Minimum age at first heat was in Pateri (7.50 +/- 0.50 months) while maximum twining percentage at first kidding was in Chappar (25.0 +/- 1.25%). Tapri had lowest service period of 2.64 +/- 0.17 months. Kamori was found favorite animal as mutton breed for launching selection program for meat production.

After the acclimatization of 2 weeks, they were randomly separated into two groups (n = 15) named C and SY groups. The C group received only a basal diet, while SY received a basal diet along with 0.3 mg/kg/diet of SY (Sel-Plex (R)) in total 0.035 mg/kg/diet of SY for 10 weeks. Se concentration (mu g /g dry weight) in 15 different parts of the goat's brain was accessed, and results showed that the highest concentration was found in the occipital cerebrum (322.0 +/- 6.146), whereas the lowest concentration was found in the midbrain (10.33 +/- 0.232). Besides, the oxidative biomarkers including GSH (12.13 +/- 0.191), GSH-Px (206.7 +/- 2.362), GST (23.80 +/- 0.279), CAT (14.80 +/- 0.279), and SOD (152.5 +/- 9.540) were increased in SY as compared to GSH (8.200 +/- 0.144), GSH-Px (112.9 +/- 1.183), GST (18.93 +/- 0.284), CAT (12.53 +/- 0.215), and SOD (109.0 +/- 1.966) of C. The level of cholesterol was also significantly decreased in the serum of the SY group (84.87 +/- 0.960) as compared to C (110.5 +/- 0.592). In addition, the cholesterol level in CSF decreased significantly in SY (0.3567 +/- 0.016) as compared to C (0.509 +/- 0.009). The current research suggests that SY supplementation has improved the brain's antioxidant status, blood biochemistry, and cholesterol levels in both serum and CSF of goats.

AB  - Jamestown Canyon virus disease (JCVD) is a potentially neuroinvasive condition caused by the arbovirus Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV). Human cases of JCVD have increased in New Hampshire (NH) over the past decade, but vector surveillance is limited by funding and person power. We conducted mosquito surveillance with a focus on human JCVD cases south central NH during 2021. Routine surveillance with CDC miniature traps baited with CO2 (lights removed) was supplemented by a paired trapping design to test the collection efficiency of octenol, and New Jersey light traps. We performed virus testing, blood meal analysis, and compared morphological identification with DNA barcoding. Over 50,000 mosquitoes were collected representing 28 species. Twelve JCV-positive pools were derived from 6 species of more than 1,600 pools tested. Of those, Aedes excrucians/stimulans (MLE 4.95, Diptera: Culicidae, Walker, 1856, 1848), and Aedes sticticus (MLE 2.02, Meigen, 1838) had the highest JCV infection rates, and Aedes canadensis (MLE 0.13, Theobold, 1901) and Coquillettidia perturbans (0.10, Diptera: Culicidae, Walker, 1856) had the lowest infection rates. One hundred and fifty-one blood meals were matched to a vertebrate host. All putative vectors fed on the amplifying host of JCV, white-tailed deer (36-100% of bloodmeals). Putative vectors that fed on human hosts included Aedes excrucians (8%), Anopheles punctipennis (25%, Diptera: Culicidae, Say, 1823), and Coquillettidia perturbans (51%). CDC traps baited with CO2 were effective for collecting putative vectors. DNA barcoding enhanced morphological identifications of damaged specimens. We present the first ecological overview of JCV vectors in NH.

AB  - Simple Summary Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants and camels. It is caused by a virus belonging to the genus Morbillivirus, family Paramixoviridae. Once newly introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 percent of an animal herd. A PPR outbreak is an emergency due to its rapid spread and high animal mortality rate. This study simulated three control strategies of PPR spread among animals in the United Arab Emirates. These strategies include implementing mass vaccination, ring vaccination and ceased vaccination strategies, combined with or without strict animal movement control simultaneously. The simulation results compared the level of the effectiveness and direct government costs for each of the three strategies. Such results aid the decision-makers in the country and globally in line with the World Animal Health Organization's goal to eradicate the disease by 2030. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an important infectious viral disease of domestic small ruminants that threatens the food security and sustainable livelihood of farmers across Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The objective of this research is to analyze the disease's spread and its impacts on direct government costs through conducting three simulations of different control strategies to reduce and quickly eradicate PPR from the United Arab Emirates in the near future. A Modified Animal Disease Spread Model was developed in this study to suit the conditions of the United Arab Emirates. The initial scenario represents when mass vaccination is ceased, and moderate movement restrictions are applied. The second scenario is based on mass vaccination and stamping out the disease, whereas the third simulation scenario assumes mass and ring vaccination when needed, very strict movement control, and stamping out. This study found that the third scenario is the most effective in controlling and eradicating PPR from the UAE. The outbreak duration in days was reduced by 57% and the number of infected animals by 77% when compared to the other scenarios. These results are valuable to the country's animal health decision-makers and the government's efforts to report to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) regarding the progress made towards declaration of the disease's eradication. They are also useful to other concerned entities in other Middle Eastern, North African, and Asian countries where the disease is spreading.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) treatment of plants may affect the survival and feeding preferences of herbivorous pests. However, comprehensive studies on the fitness across their entire life cycle, feeding behavior, and physiological changes in herbivores consuming EPF-treated plants within the tripartite interactions of EPF, plants, and pests are still limited. In this study, we utilized life tables, electrical penetration graph (EPG), and metabolomics to uncover the biological and physiological characteristics of Bemisia tabaci on tomato plants inoculated with Beauveria bassiana through root irrigation. RESULTS: Our study indicated that Beauveria bassiana Bb252 can penetrate the entire tissue from the point of inoculation, primarily colonizing the intercellular spaces and vascular tissue. However, this colonization is temporary, lasting no more than 35 days. Moreover, the population fitness and feeding behavior of Bemisia tabaci on tomato plants treated with Beauveria bassiana via root irrigation were significantly affected, showing a substantial 41.4% decrease in net reproductive rate (R0), a notable reduction in watery salivation, and shortened phloem ingestion. Lastly, we observed a significant decrease in hormones and amino acids of whiteflies that fed on Beauveria bassiana-treated tomato plants by root irrigation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the endophyte, Beauveria bassiana Bb252, reduced demographic fitness of Bemisia tabaci by altering its hormones and amino acids levels. These findings enhance our understanding of multitrophic interactions in integrated pest management. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Hydrogeochemical characteristics and ionic sources of groundwater contamination were examined to understand the potential health risk factors behind the chronic kidney illness in parts of the Uddanam CKDu area, Southern India. For this, a total of 50 groundwater samples were obtained during the pre and post-monsoon seasons of 2021 and examined for physicochemical metrics. pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) in groundwater were measured with the handheld meter HI991300P. The major ions in groundwater were analyzed using standard procedures by the American Public Health Association (APHA), followed by an ion balance assessment (IBA) to ensure analytical accuracy. Then water quality evaluation encompassing potability, pollution status, its spatial patterns, and human health risks were determined using Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), pollution index of groundwater (PIG), ArcGIS 10.4 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidelines. Moreover, the source evaluation of mineral species and ions was performed using saturation indices (SI) by pH redox equilibrium written in C computer language (PHREEQC) 3.7.3 geochemical model and statistical analysis employed factor analysis (FA) and Pearsons's correlation matrix using MINTAB22 software. Moreover, conventional graphical diagrams, including Piper, Gibbs and scatter plots, were also portrayed to elucidate the controlling factors of groundwater chemistry and ionic sources. Significant findings of this study are elevated levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, TDS, TH, NO3- and Si in groundwater; High to moderate pollution; High nitrate pollution vulnerability, primarily affecting children followed by women and men; Precipitation of carbonate and silicate minerals; Mixing Ca-Mg-SO4-Cl followed by Ca-Mg-HCO3 water facies; Geological and Anthropogenic influences. Notably, these findings may have critical implications for the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the Uddanam CKDu region. Hence, before water consumption, proper treatment is necessary. Proper waste disposal facilities can reduce the risk of leaching contaminants. Rainwater recharge through invasive structures may reduce the pollutants through the dilution process. These findings assist researchers and policymakers in developing sustainable water management strategies to prevent potential health risks posed to humans.

AB  - Despite the heterogeneity of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a clear link exists between type 2 immunity and the severity of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, recent studies have demonstrated that patients with severe type 2 CRSwNP also display abundant neutrophilic inflammation. Therefore, we investigated the factors associated with the recurrence of CRSwNP following sinus surgery using a machine-learning algorithm. We collected the demographics, clinical variables, and inflammatory profiles of 210 patients with CRSwNP who underwent sinus surgery. After one year, we evaluated whether each patient showed recurrence. Machine-learning methods, such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machine models, have been used to predict the recurrence of CRSwNP. The results indicated that neutrophil inflammation, such as tissue and serum neutrophils, is an important factor affecting the recurrence of surgical CRSwNP. Specifically, the random forest model showed the highest accuracy in detecting recurrence among the three machine-learning methods, which revealed tissue neutrophilia to be the most important variable in determining surgical outcomes. Therefore, our machine-learning approach suggests that neutrophilic inflammation is increased in patients with difficult-to-treat CRSwNP, and the increased presence of neutrophils in subepithelial regions is closely related to poor surgical outcomes in patients with CRSwNP.

AB  - Malnutrition and severe food insecurity are on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), an indigenous plant from Africa with a good nutritional composition, can be a strategic tool in the fight against hunger. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the yield response of different cowpea accessions to soil amendments. The study adopted a 5 x 4 factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors comprise five cowpea accessions (BBL, BBR, BCB, EBL and EBC) and four soil amendments (poultry manure [PoM], pig manure [PgM], NPK 15:15:15 fertilizer and control). There are significant differences among the cowpea accessions in all the studied attributes. The stability and mean performance analyses revealed that the top-ranked accessions were EBL and EBC, while BBL, BBR and BCB were below the population mean. The ranking order of the soil amendments was PoM > PgM > population mean > NPK > control. Accession EBL amended with PoM gave the highest plant weight (106.4 g), which was statistically similar to the same accessions amended with NPK (104.9 g) and PgM (100.4 g), but significantly higher than the other treatment combinations. Plant weight has a significant and positive correlation with pod length (r = 0.919**), number of leaves (0.623**), vine length (0.361**) and hundred seed weight (0.329*). The findings of this study showed that cowpea accessions responded differently to the soil amendments. This study recommends the use of additional nutrients as a supplement in the production of cowpea rather than relying solely on its self-fixed nitrogen.

AB  - Context. One of the main problems of porcine in vitro maturation (IVM) is incomplete cytoplasmatic maturation. Nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation will determine the future success of fertilisation and embryo development. Insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) has insulin-like and antioxidant effects, and metformin (M) is an insulin-sensitiser and antioxidant drug. Aims. To assess the effects of adding ITS and/or M in porcine IVM media on cytoplasmic maturation and early embryo development. Methods. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were IVM with M (10-4M), ITS (0.1% v/v), M + ITS or no adding (Control). Key results. ITS increased glucose consumption compared to Control and M (P < 0.01), and M + ITS did not differ from ITS or Control. Redox balance: M, ITS and M + ITS increased glutathione (P < 0.01) and decreased lipid peroxidation (P < 0.005). The viability of cumulus cells by flow cytometry increased with M (P < 0.005) and decreased with ITS (P < 0.001); M + ITS did not differ from Control. After IVF, M increased penetration and decreased male pronucleus (P < 0.05). Embryo development: cleavage increased with M (P < 0.05), and blastocysts increased with ITS and M + ITS (P < 0.05). The number of blastocyst cells increased with ITS (P < 0.05). Conclusions. Adding ITS and M + ITS to porcine IVM media benefits embryo development to blastocysts, but ITS alone has better effects than M + ITS. Implications.

AB  - Chronic hypoxia can cause fetal growth restriction (FGR) through placental dysfunction. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), such as IGF-2, play a major role in preservation of placental growth and function. We investigated the effects of chronic hypoxia and sex on protein expression of the IGF-2 pathway in placentas selected from asymmetric-FGR fetuses. Time-mated pregnant guinea pigs were assigned to normoxia (NMX, 21% O-2) or hypoxia (HPX, 10.5% O-2) during the last 14 days of pregnancy. Placentas were selected from male and female symmetrically grown NMX fetuses (fetal wt between 25th ile-75th ile) and HPX fetuses of asymmetric-FGR (fetal wt < 25th ile and brain:liver wt > 50th ile). Effects of HPX and sex on placenta protein expression of the IGF-2 signaling proteins (IGF-2, PI3K, AKT-P, total AKT, PCNA, a cell proliferation marker) were evaluated by immunoblotting. Effects of HPX and sex on morphometric parameters were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). HPX reduced (p < 0.005) fetal wt by similar to 35% compared to NMX in both sexes. Expression of IGF-2 was lower (p = 0.029) in NMX female placentas compared to males. Despite lower NMX levels, HPX increased (p < 0.05) expression of IGF-2, AKT-P, relative AKT-P, and PCNA in female placentas only and had no effect on protein expression in male placentas. The female guinea pig placenta exhibits a greater sensitivity than males to HPX in upregulating expression of the IGF-2 axis. In addition, the sex difference in baseline IGF-2 expression suggests a greater capacity for females to increase IGF-2 in response to HPX as a placental adaptation in FGR.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both the testes to descend in the scrotum. In pigs, the incidence of cryptorchidism varies from 4% to 12%, and the most frequent localisation of retained testes is the abdominal region. In other species, transabdominal ultrasound is the most reliable diagnostic tool to localize the retained testis. This study aimed to evaluate the value of ultrasound in correctly identifying the location of retained testes, to improve the cryptorchidectomy in pigs. The ultrasound examination reduced the duration of anaesthesia, surgery, and postoperative pain. Indeed, the technique used is safe, effective, and rapid. To locate the testis, it should recognise the echo structure of the testicle and the mediastinum is well always recognisable for its hyperechogenicity. The routine use of the ultrasound examination is considered a useful alternative before the cryptorchidectomy in the pig because it allows the exact location of the retained testicle, ensuring reduced manipulation of the viscera. This study aimed to describe a technique to locate retained testes in pigs by means of ultrasound examination and thereafter proceed with cryptorchidectomy. Fifty-two monolateral cryptorchid pigs were enrolled. After anaesthesia, 42 pigs (Group U) underwent ultrasound examination before cryptorchidectomy, and 10 pigs (Group C) were used as control group without ultrasonography. The total duration of anaesthesia, ultrasound examination, and surgery was evaluated. In 10 pigs of Group U and 10 pigs of Group C, the heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and body temperature (T) were monitored to assess intraoperative pain response. An operator used the Piglet Grimace Scale (PGS) to assess postoperative pain. In Group U, the total time required for anaesthesia and surgery was less than Group C. No intra- or postoperative complications were reported in both groups. For HR, RR, and T, no statistically significant differences were observed. During the postoperative pain assessment, the highest pain scores were recorded at T6 (6 h after surgery). Ultrasound examination was found to be a valid technique for locating the retained testis in the abdomen in cryptorchid pigs and to reduce the duration of the surgery.

AB  - Floral volatiles are among the well-known cues that mediate plant-pollinator interactions. Understanding plant-pollinator interactions is especially important in arid regions, where the low abundance of pollinators limits their visiting frequency and, thus, constraints the reproductive success of many plant species. Moreover, plants in such arid habitats are exposed to abiotic stress, particularly to water shortage. Plants in arid habitats are also prone to suffer from multiple stress factors, such as the addition of pathogen and herbivore attacks. All these stress factors induce disruptions in the plant metabolism and increase physiological costs that may lead to changes in floral volatiles, thus affecting the communication between the plant and its pollinators, consequently intensifying the constraints on the plants' reproductive success. To explore this general hypothesis, we used as a model Matthiola livida (Delile) DC. (Brassicaceae), a common native plant species in arid regions of the Middle East. We first tested whether water shortage and insect herbivory, inflicted by whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), caused stress in M. livida, based on the change in carbohydrates and starch content, and examined whether the plants produced distinct volatile composition in response to these stressors. Then, we tested whether bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), common pollinators of M. livida, were able to differentiate between plants suffering from water shortage and insect herbivory based only on volatile emission. We found that both water shortage and insect herbivory caused stress in the plants. We also found that the plants produced a distinct volatile composition in relation to the specific stress they were exposed to. Specifically, in comparison to control plants, insect herbivory increased the amounts of volatile alkanes, aldehydes, and alcohols, and reduced the amounts of esters, benzenoids, and phenylpropanoids. Water shortage reduced the amount of aldehyde volatiles and increased the amount of alcohol volatiles. Moreover, using choice experiments, we found that bumblebees differentiated between stressed and non-stressed plants based on their volatile compositions, and preferred less stressed ones. Our study indicated that pollinators may use floral volatiles in their foraging decisions and are highly sensitive to variation in the plant conditions. This suggests that volatile cues may create a constraint on the ability of the plants to secure their reproductive success in arid habitats, that are added to the direct stress created by the arid conditions themselves.

AB  - Tea plants are sensitive to soil moisture deficit, with the level of soil water being a critical factor affecting their growth and quality. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve water and nutrient absorption, but it is not clear whether AMF can improve the photosynthetic characteristics of tea plants. A potted study was conducted to determine the effects of Claroideoglomus etunicatum on plant growth, leaf water status, pigment content, gas exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in Camellia sinensis cv. Fuding Dabaicha under well-watered (WW) and drought stress (DS) conditions. Root mycorrhizal colonization and soil hyphal length were significantly reduced by the eight-week DS treatment. AMF inoculation displayed a significant increase in shoot and root biomass production. The relative water content, leaf water potential, nitrogen balance index, pigment content, maximum photometric effect (Fv/Fm, QY_max), and steady-state photometric effect Y (II) (QY_Lss) decreased dramatically, while the leaf water saturation deficit and steady-state non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ_Lss) generally increased under DS conditions. Mycorrhizal treatment induced significantly higher relative water content, leaf water potential, nitrogen balance index, pigment (chlorophyll, flavonoid, and anthocyanin) content, net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, QY_max, and QY_Lss; however, it resulted in a lower leaf water saturation deficit and NPQ_Lss under both WW and DS conditions, as compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. These results imply that AMF promoted tea plant growth and alleviated negative effects of DS by promoting gas exchange, regulating the water status of leaves, and regulating photosynthetic parameters.

AB  - Simple Summary Probiotics are used in the food industry as feed additives to maintain the balance of animal gut microbiota. They are also considered to have potential therapeutic effects against liver diseases. This study showed that dietary Lactobacillus supplementation improved liver function and reduced cholesterol levels in Jeju native pigs, with Toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling as the primary response in the gut against Lactobacillus and TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma as the central mediator cytokines in the gut and liver tissues. Lactobacillus supplementation may be applied to treat metabolic disorders of the liver, especially cholesterol-related disorders, in farm animals. We evaluated the dietary effects of multiple probiotics in Jeju native pigs, using basal diet and multi-probiotic Lactobacillus (basal diet with 1% multi-probiotics) treatments (n = 9 each) for 3 months. We analyzed growth performance, feed efficiency, backfat thickness, blood parameters, hematological profiles, adipokines, and immune-related cytokines in pig tissues. Average daily gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, backfat thickness, and body weight were not significantly different between both groups. In Lactobacillus group, total protein (p < 0.08) and bilirubin (p < 0.03) concentrations increased; blood urea nitrogen (p < 0.08), alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.08), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (p < 0.08) activities decreased. Lactobacillus group showed decreased adiponectin (p < 0.05), chemerin (p < 0.05), and visfatin expression in adipose tissues, and increased TLR4 (p < 0.05), MYD88 (p < 0.05), TNF-alpha (p < 0.001), and IFN-gamma (p < 0.001) expression in the liver. Additionally, NOD1 (p < 0.05), NOD2 (p < 0.01), and MYD88 (p < 0.05) mRNA levels in proximal colon tissue upregulated significantly. Colon, longissimus dorsi muscle, fat tissue, and liver histological analyses revealed no significant differences between the groups. Conclusively, Lactobacillus supplementation improved liver function and reduced cholesterol levels. Its application may treat metabolic liver disorders, especially cholesterol-related disorders.

AB  - Chronic stress constitutes a major risk factor for depression that can disrupt various aspects of homeostasis, including the gut microbiome (GM). We have recently shown that GM imbalance affects adult hippocampal (HPC) neurogenesis and induces depression-like behaviors, with the exact mechanisms being under active investigation. Here we hypothesized that the vagus nerve (VN), a key bidirectional route of communication between the gut and the brain, could relay the effects of stress-induced GM changes on HPC plasticity and behavior. We used fecal samples derived from mice that sustained unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to inoculate healthy mice and assess standard behavioral readouts for anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, conduct histological and molecular analyses for adult HPC neurogenesis and evaluate neurotransmission pathways and neuroinflammation. To study the potential role of the VN in mediating the effects of GM changes on brain functions and behavior, we used mice that sustained subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (Vx) prior the GM transfer. We found that inoculation of healthy mice with GM from UCMS mice activates the VN and induces early and sustained changes in both serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission pathways in the brainstem and HPC. These changes are associated with prompt and persistent deficits in adult HPC neurogenesis and induce early and sustained neuroinflammatory responses in the HPC. Remarkably, Vx abrogates adult HPC neurogenesis deficits, neuroinflammation and depressive-like behavior, suggesting that vagal afferent pathways are necessary to drive GM-mediated effects on the brain.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of people annually; however, our knowledge of the diffuse pathologies associated with TBI is limited. As diffuse pathologies, including axonal injury and neuroinflammatory changes, are difficult to visualize in the clinical population, animal models are used. In the current study, we used the central fluid percussion injury (CFPI) model in a micro pig to study the potential scalability of these diffuse pathologies in a gyrencephalic brain of a species with inflammatory systems very similar to humans. We found that both axonal injury and microglia activation within the thalamus and corpus callosum are positively correlated with the weight-normalized pressure pulse, while subtle changes in blood gas and mean arterial blood pressure are not. We also found that the majority of tissue generated up to 10 years previously is viable for immunofluorescent labeling after long-term refrigeration storage. This study indicates that a micro pig CFPI model could allow for specific investigations of various degrees of diffuse pathological burdens following TBI.

AB  - Euthanasia is the humane termination of an animal's life and an important consideration for scientists, veterinarians, regulators, and others contemplating investigations involving animals. Techniques for euthanasia must induce the most rapid, painless, and distress-free death possible. This study investigated the effectiveness of direct current induction of ventricular fibrillation for the euthanasia of sheep after a primary study in which artifacts or chemical contamination from injectable euthanasia agents were undesirable. Female crossbred adult sheep (Ovis aries; n = 12) under deep isoflurane general anesthesia were instrumented with electrophysiology catheters to induce ventricular fibrillation for euthanasia. Data regarding invasive arterial blood pressure, expired airway gases, limb lead electrocardiograms, and pulse oximetry were collected and assessed just prior to, immediately after, and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after energy delivery. In all animals, a single 10-s application of 9V of direct current to the right ventricular endocardium via the electrophysiology catheter induced persistent ventricular fibrillation. Arterial blood pressure (mean +/- 1 SD) immediately after fibrillation induction was 22.9 +/- 4.5 mm Hg, with negligible difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. The lack of differential pressure continued through the end of the monitoring period. Arterial blood pressure reached an initial nadir at 1 +/- 0.5 min after fibrillation induction, peaked (40.8 +/- 11.1 mm Hg) due to a vasoconstrictive reflex at 3 min after induction, and returned to a static uniform pressure (20.4 +/- 17.8 mm Hg) with mildly increased variability due to reflexive diaphragmatic contractions at 10 min after induction. The use of 9V direct current for the induction of ventricular fibrillation via an electrophysiology catheter is a reliable method of euthanasia in sheep.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors (Rs) are critical for cognitive functioning. D1 positive allosteric modulators (D1PAMs) activate D1Rs without desensitization or an inverted U-shaped dose response curve. DETQ, [2-(2,6dichlorophenyl)-1-((1S,3R)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2 (1H)-yl)ethan-1-one] is highly selective for the human D1Rs as shown in humanized D1R knock-in (hD1Ki) mice. Here, we have ascertained the efficacy of DETQ in aged [13-23-month-old (mo)] hD1Ki mice and their corresponding age-matched wild-type (WT; C57BL/6NTac) controls. We found that in aged mice, DETQ, given acutely, subchronically, and chronically, rescued both novel object recognition memory and social behaviors, using novel object recognition (NOR) and social interaction (SI) tasks, respectively without any adverse effect on body weight or mortality. We have also shown, using in vivo microdialysis, a significant decrease in basal DA and norepinephrine, increase in glutamate (Glu) and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) efflux with no significant changes in acetylcholine (ACh) levels in aged vs young mice. In young and aged hD1Ki mice, DETQ, acutely and subchronically increased ACh in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions in aged hD1Ki mice without affecting Glu. These results suggest that the D1PAM mechanism is of interest as potential treatment for cognitive and social behavioral deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders including but not restricted to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Simple Summary Diets and the trophic positions of animals are fundamental issues in their ecology. We analysed the isotopic niches (as a proxy for trophic niches) of common (Microtus arvalis), field (M. agrestis), and root (M. oeconomus) voles co-occurring in orchards, berry plantations, and nearby meadows using isotopic (delta N-15 and delta C-13) compositions from hair samples. We tested if the niche of the dominant common vole was widest, whether its width was related to the presence of other Microtus species, and whether there were intraspecific differences in average delta C-13 and delta N-1(5) stable isotope values. The obtained results showed relative stability in the trophic niche across the vegetative period. The isotopic niche of the common vole was the widest, exceeding the other two Microtus species by 1.6-3 times. Co-occurring vole species were separated according to delta C-13 (i.e., used different plants as main food), but they maintained similarity according to delta N-15 distribution. The effect of animal age and gender on the width of the trophic niche was strongest in root vole, which is a species that has spread across the country in the last 70 years. These results give new insights into the trophic ecology small herbivores, showing the impact of species co-occurrence. Diets and trophic positions of co-occurring animals are fundamental issues in their ecology, and these issues in syntopic rodents have been studied insufficiently. Using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios from hair samples, we analysed the trophic niches of common (Microtus arvalis), field (M. agrestis), and root (M. oeconomus) voles co-occurring in orchards, berry plantations, and nearby meadows (as control habitat to orchards and plantations). We tested if the niche of the dominant common vole was the widest, whether its width depended on the presence of other vole species, and whether there were intraspecific differences. Results suggest stability in the trophic niches of all three Microtus species, as season explained only 2% of the variance. The widest trophic niche was a characteristic of the dominant common vole, the range of delta C-13 values exceeding the other two species by 1.6, the range of delta N-15 values exceeding the other two species by 1.9, and the total area of niche exceeding that of the other voles by 2.3-3 times. In the meadows and apple orchards, co-occurring vole species were separated according to delta C-13 (highest values in the dominant common vole), but they maintained similar delta N-15 values. Results give new insights into the trophic ecology small herbivores, showing the impact of species co-occurrence.

   The present study indicated that fermented liquid feeding improved the growth performance of pigs, which might be associated with gastrointestinal hormone and intestinal functions. These results provided a new perspective for improving the growth performance of pigs.
   Accumulating evidences demonstrate that fermented feed and liquid feeding exerted a great beneficial influence on growth performance and health in the pig industry. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of fermented liquid feeding on the growth performance and intestinal function of pigs. Two hundred and eighty-eight 27-day-old weaned piglets (8.21 +/- 0.27 kg) were randomly allocated to a control group (basal diet (CON)), an antibiotic group (basal diet supplemented with antibiotics (AB)) and a fermented liquid feeding group (basal diet with fermented liquid feeding (FLF)), with 6 replicates per treatment and 16 weaned piglets per replicate. The experiment lasted for 160 days. Fresh fecal samples were collected to evaluate the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients from the last 4 days of each stage. The results are shown as follows: (1) Compared with the CON group, in the whole stage, the FLF diet significantly increased the final body weight (BW) and ADG of pigs (P < 0.05), and had a tendency to increase ADFI (P = 0.086), but had no effect on F/G. (2) The ATTD of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude ash (CA), crude fiber (CF), gross energy (GE), calcium (Ca) and total phosphorus (TP) in the FLF group was significantly elevated compared with those of the CON group at 8-20 kg stage (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the ATTD of EE in the FLF group was significantly increased compared with that of the CON group at the 50-75 kg and 100-125 kg stages (P < 0.05), and the ATTD of Ca was higher than that of CON group at the 100-125 kg stage (P < 0.05). (3) Compared with that of the CON group, the level of serum leptin in the FLF group had a tendency to decrease (P = 0.054), the level of serum ghrelin in the FLF group was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) and the level of serum peptide YY in the FLF group was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (4) The abundance of Lactobacillus in cecal and colonic digesta was observably enhanced in FLF group. Meanwhile, the abundance of Escherichia coli in cecal and colonic digesta were dramatically reduced in the FLF group compared with that in the CON and AB groups (P < 0.05). (5) The levels of acetic acid in colonic digesta were significantly increased in the FLF group (P < 0.05), and an increasing trend was observed in total VFA in colonic digesta compared with CON (P < 0.1). The levels of acetic acid in colonic digesta were significantly promoted in the FLF group compared with that of the AB group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that fermented liquid feeding improved the growth performance of pigs, which might be associated with gastrointestinal hormone and intestinal functions.

AB  - Background: Chronic stress is widely recognized as a critical factor that impairs synaptic plasticity dependent brain function and behavior, contributing to the onset of depression and anxiety disorders, which subsequently undermine learning and memory processes. Gastrodin (GAS), a prominent bioactive constituent of Gastrodiae Rhizoma exhibiting notable neuroprotective properties, holds significant potential for the prevention and treatment of stress-induced neurological dysfunction. However, the protective effects of GAS on stress-induced synaptic plasticity impairment and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. Objectives: To investigate the potential of GAS in protecting synaptic plasticity from chronic stress and its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Method: A chronic stress model was constructed in C57BL/6J mice, and the effects of GAS on synaptic plasticity were examined using Golgi staining and immunohistochemistry. Systematic behavioral analysis was employed to assess the impact of GAS on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive function of mice. Metabolomics, transcriptomics, Western blotting, immunolocalization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the administration of signal blockers were utilized to investigate the cellular and molecular pathways via which GAS safeguards synaptic plasticity. Results: The results showed that chronic stress exposure reduces the dendritic arbor complexity, density of dendritic spines, proportion of mushroom spines of hippocampal neurons, as well as disrupts synaptic function, impairs cognitive function and induces depressive-like behaviors. Importantly, impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and cognitive decline induced by chronic stress were significantly ameliorated following GAS treatment. Moreover, we identified the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling in hippocampal neurons as a potential mechanism through which GAS prevents synaptic plasticity impairment from chronic stress exposure. Blockade of cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling abolished the protective effects of GAS on synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons and behaviors in stress-exposed mice. Conclusion: This study is the first to identify GAS as a potential natural compound for alleviating stress-induced synaptic plasticity impairment and behavioral dysfunction by activating the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway in hippocampal neurons, offering a promising strategy for stress-induced neurological disorders.

AB  - Piptocephalis includes mycoparasitic fungi, mainly targeting mucoralean species. Until now, there has been no compilation of data on the taxonomy and geographic distribution of Piptocephalis, which is a barrier to the proper identification of species of this genus by taxonomists. The present study provides an overview of Piptocephalis with taxonomic and occurrence data, in addition to reporting P. graefenhanii and P. xenophila for the first time in South America. Both species were observed parasitizing Mucor spp. The P. graefenhanii was observed growing on paca dung and P. xenophila was observed on guinea-pig dung in Recife, northeastern Brazil. Aspects of their morphology are discussed and a key for the genus is presented.

AB  - Plants produce a variety of floral specialized (secondary) metabolites with roles in several physiological functions, including light-protection, attraction of pollinators, and protection against herbivores. Pigments and volatiles synthesized in the petal have been focused on and characterized as major chemical factors influencing pollination. Recent advances in plant metabolomics have revealed that the major floral specialized metabolites found in land plant species are hydroxycinnamates, phenolamides, and flavonoids albeit these are present in various quantities and encompass diverse chemical structures in different species. Here, we analyzed numerous floral specialized metabolites in 20 different Brassicaceae genotypes encompassing both different species and in the case of crop species different cultivars including self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Of the 228 metabolites detected in flowers among 20 Brassicaceae species, 15 metabolite peaks including one phenylacyl-flavonoids and five phenolamides were detected and annotated as key metabolites to distinguish SC and SI plant species, respectively. Our results provide a family-wide metabolic framework and delineate signatures for compatible and incompatible genotypes thereby providing insight into evolutionary aspects of floral metabolism in Brassicaceae species.

AB  - Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are a group of small and soluble proteins present in both vertebrates and insects. They have a high level of structural stability and bind to a large spectrum of odorant molecules. In the environmental field, benzene is the most dangerous compound among the class of pollutants named BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). It has several effects on human health and, consequently, it appears to be important to monitor its presence in the environment. Commonly, its detection requires the use of very sophisticated and time-consuming analytical techniques (GC-MS, etc.) as well as the presence of specialized personnel. Here, we present the application of an odorant-binding protein (pOBP) isolated from pigs as a molecular recognition element (MRE) for a low-energy impedenziometric biosensor for outdoor and real-time benzene detection. The obtained results show that the biosensor can detect the presence of 64 pM (5 mu g/m(3)) benzene, the limit value of exposure for human health set by the European Directive 2008/50/EC.

AB  - A wide variety of fish species have been displayed in public aquariums and zoological collections for over 150 years. Though the issue of pain perception in fish is still being debated, there is no disagreement that negative impacts on their welfare can significantly affect their health and wellbeing. A general description of the basic biological requirements for maintaining fish in captive environments is presented, but species-specific information and guidelines should be developed for the multitude of species being maintained. A combination of behavioral, performance, and physiological indicators can be used to assess the well-being of these animals. Ultimately, the goal for optimizing the welfare of fish should be to provide the best possible environment, husbandry, and social interactions to promote natural species-specific behaviors of the fish in captivity.

AB  - Changes in F-actin distribution and cortical F-actin morphology are important for blastocyst developmental competence during embryogenesis. However, the effect of paclitaxel as a microtubule stabilizer on embryonic development in pigs remains unclear. We investigated the role of F-actin cytoskeleton stabilization via P38 MAPK activation using paclitaxel to improve the developmental potential of blastocysts in pigs. In this study, F-actin enrichment and adducin expression based on blastomere fragment rate and cytokinesis defects were investigated in cleaved embryos after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Adducin and adhesive junction F-actin fluorescence intensity were significantly reduced with increasing blastomere fragment rate in porcine embryos. In addition, porcine embryos were cultured with 10 and 100 nM paclitaxel for two days after IVF. Adhesive junction F-actin stabilization and p-P38 MAPK activity in embryos exposed to 10 nM paclitaxel increased significantly with blastocyst development competence. However, increased F-actin aggregation, cytokinesis defects, and over-expression of p-P38 MAPK protein by 100 nM paclitaxel exposure disrupted blastocyst development in porcine embryos. In addition, exposure to 100 nM paclitaxel increased the misaligned alpha-tubulin of spindle assembly and adhesive junction F-actin aggregation at the blastocyst stage, which might be caused by p-P38 protein over-expression-derived apoptosis in porcine embryos.

AB  - High-frequency oscillatory activity in cognition-related neural circuits during wakefulness consistently induces the growth of dendritic spines and axonal terminals. Although these structural changes are essential for cognitive functions, it is hypothesized that if these newly expanded structures fail to establish functional connections, they may become superfluous. Sleep is believed to facilitate the reduction of such redundant structures to maintain neural homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying this pruning process during sleep remain poorly understood. In this study, that melatonin type 3 receptors (MT3Rs) are selectively expressed in the stellate neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is demonstrated, an area where high melatonin levels are detected during sleep. Activation of MT3Rs during sleep initiates the shrinkage of dendritic spines in stellate neurons by downregulating neural network activity and dephosphorylating synaptic proteins in the MEC. This process is disrupted when MT3R expression is knocked down or when MT3Rs are blocked during sleep. Notably, interference with MT3Rs in the MEC during sleep impairs the acquisition of spatial memory but does not affect object memory acquisition following sleep. These findings reveal novel molecular mechanisms involving melatonin and MT3Rs in the regulation of dendritic spine shrinkage during sleep, which is crucial for the acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory.
   Sleep is thought to promote the shrinkage of unnecessary synaptic structures to maintain homeostasis. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon during sleep are still not well understood. This study uncovers novel molecular mechanisms that involve melatonin/MT3Rs in the shrinkage of dendritic spines during sleep, which contributes to the acquisition and consolidation of spatial memory. image

AB  - Simple Summary Italian heavy pigs production differs from pig farming in other countries of the world mainly due to the high body weight and age at slaughter of the animals. This implies that peculiar animal needs may be addressed to achieve a high level of animal welfare during the pre-slaughter phases. This narrative review aims to collect the available information on welfare issues of Italian heavy pigs in the pre-slaughter phases, and to highlight recent findings and knowledge gaps. This work provides a narrative review of the available information on the welfare of Italian heavy pigs in the pre-slaughter phase (transport, lairage, and stunning). The meat from these pigs is used for specific PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) products, and the production rules for these specialties require higher body weight (160-170 kg) and age (in general more than 9 months) at slaughter than in most other countries. This may lead to specific behavioral and physiological needs of pigs. The present paper summarizes the main research findings and knowledge gaps for each of the pre-slaughter phases. Studies are presented according to the four principles of the Welfare Quality assessment protocol (good feeding, good housing, good health, and appropriate behavior). The results of the literature review indicate a lack of knowledge on several aspects. Most of studies were carried out in a single slaughterhouse, making it difficult to identify risk factors and confounding effects. Moreover, animal-based measures were assessed using different protocols, reducing the possibility of comparison across studies. These findings may serve as a basis for the development of specific research studies and policies aimed at enhancing the animal welfare level and the ethical attributes of this renowned production, also in accordance with consumers' expectations.

AB  - Lead-based ammunition (gunshot and bullets) frequently leaves small lead fragments embedded in the meat of wild-shot game animals. Australia produces several commercial game meat products from wild animals harvested with lead-based ammunition and has a growing population of recreational hunters. However, no studies have previously investigated the frequency of lead fragments or lead concentrations in Australian game meat. We examined 133 Australian minced game meat items of four types for evidence of lead contamination. Samples were meat from kangaroos (Macropus and Osphranter spp.; n=36) and Bennett's wallabies (Notamacropus rufogriseus; n=28) sold for human consumption, and deer ('venison'; multiple spp.; n=32) and stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis; n=37) harvested for private consumption by recreational hunters. All packages were studied by digital radiography to detect the presence of radio-dense fragments, assumed to be lead fragments from ammunition. Visible fragments were absent in commercially available kangaroo products, but were present in 4%, 28% and 35% of wallaby, venison and quail, respectively. Mean meat lead concentrations (mg/kg wet weight) were 0.01 +/- 0.01 for kangaroo, 0.02 +/- 0.01 for wallaby, 0.12 +/- 0.07 for venison, and 1.76 +/- 3.76 for quail. The Australian food standards threshold for livestock meat (0.1 mg/kg w.w.) was not exceeded by any kangaroo or wallaby products but was exceeded by 53% and 86% of venison and quail, respectively. Radiography only detected 35% of samples that were above the food safety threshold. While average lead concentrations in commercially available macropod (kangaroo and wallaby) meat were low, those in recreationally harvested game meat may pose health risks for hunters and associated consumers.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of warming water on growth in seven demersal fish species including Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and three species of redfish (Sebastes spp.) in the Northwest Atlantic and compares the changes in growth across species. Length-at-age data were collected from EU bottom trawl surveys from 1993 to 2018, and bottom temperature data were obtained from the Copernicus Marine Service. Generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to describe the temperature effects on growth. The analysis was carried out separately for males and females. Both sexes of all species except American plaice showed significant temperature effects on growth. To obtain the growth parameters, von Bertalanffy growth functions (VBGFs) were fitted to the predictions from best-fit GAMMs for all species and both sexes under five different bottom temperature scenarios (3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 degrees C). The predictions from all best-fit GAMMs were broadly similar in form to the fitted von Bertalanffy growth functions (R-2 > 90%). Increased bottom temperature generally resulted in a decrease in the asymptotic length (L-infinity) and an increase in the growth rate (k). The species with the most dramatic increase in k over the temperature range of 3 degrees C to 5 degrees C was Atlantic cod, for which k increased from 0.05 to 0.13 year(-1) in females and from 0.08 to 0.14 year(-1) in males. The maximum length (L-max), predicted by the VBGF at maximum age generally declined from 3 degrees C to 5 degrees C. The species with the most pronounced decline in L-max was beaked redfish (S. mentella). An increase in the proportion of smaller individuals could impact population productivity and result in lower biomass available to fisheries. Uneven changes in fish growth in the warming ocean could also have wider ecological implications and alter the trophic landscape.

AB  - The genus Culicoides includes numerous species that are biting nuisances and vectors of pathogens affecting humans, livestock, and wildlife. For instance, Culicoides paraensis is the primary vector of Oropouche virus to humans, while other species, such as Culicoides sonorensis, Culicoides insignis, and Culicoides venustus transmit viruses causing hemorrhagic disease in ruminants, particularly bovids and cervids. Current control practices for biting midges rely heavily on chemical insecticides, yet their efficacy and potential for insecticide resistance in biting midges remain poorly documented. We conducted laboratory and semifield experiments to evaluate permethrin susceptibility in wild biting midges collected on 5 Florida deer farms, including known and suspected hemorrhagic diseasevector species, using lab-reared mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) as a susceptible reference. The Culicoides species tested included: C. insignis (n = 944), C. stellifer (n = 269), C. debilipalpis (n = 68), C. venustus (n = 16), C. edeni (n = 5), C. furens (n = 5). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassays using 10.75 mu g permethrin per bottle resulted in 100% mortality within 30 min across all Culicoides spp. Similarly, semifield cage trials with ultra-low volume permethrin-based space sprays applied at maximum label rate caused 100% mortality of all Culicoides spp. and susceptible Ae. aegypti within 1 h after exposure. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of permethrin for controlling biting midges and suggest that significant resistance to permethrin has not developed in the Culicoides populations tested. This study provides a foundation for optimizing vector control strategies against biting midges by demonstrating their susceptibility to permethrin and emphasizing the need for informed, evidence-based practices.

AB  - Tuberculous granulomas are highly dynamic structures reflecting the complex host-mycobacterium interactions. The objective of this study was to compare granuloma development at the site of vaccination with BCG and its recombinant derivatives in goats. To characterize the host response, epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells (MNGC), T cell subsets, B cells, plasma cells, dendritic cells and mycobacterial antigen were labelled by immunohistochemistry, and lipids and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) were labelled by specific staining. Granulomas with central caseous necrosis developed at the injection site of most goats though lesion size and extent of necrosis differed between vaccine strains. CD4(+) T and B cells were more scarce and CD8(+) cells were more numerous in granulomas induced by recombinant derivatives compared to their parental BCG strain. Further, the numbers of MNGCs and cells with lipid bodies were markedly lower in groups administered with recombinant BCG strains. Microscopic detection of AFB and mycobacterial antigen was rather frequent in the area of central necrosis, however, the isolation of bacteria in culture was rarely successful. In summary, BCG and its recombinant derivatives induced reproducibly subcutaneous caseous granulomas in goats that can be easily monitored and surgically removed for further studies. The granulomas reflected the genetic modifications of the recombinant BCG-derivatives and are therefore suitable models to compare reactions to different mycobacteria or TB vaccines.

AB  - Understanding the seasonality of 137Cs concentrations in aquatic animals is crucial for reviving local inland fisheries. The seasonality of 137Cs concentrations in animals is expected to vary, even if focal species consume similarly contaminated foods because the 137Cs excretion rate is species-specific, and 137Cs uptake by foraging autochthonous food resources also vary among seasons. Here, we conducted a seasonal monitoring survey of dissolved 137Cs concentrations as an indicator of the contamination level of food resources and measured 137Cs concentrations in two carnivorous aquatic animals (Palaemon paucidens and Rhinogobius sp.) that share a trophic niche in a stream connected to a dam reservoir. The dissolved 137Cs concentration had clear seasonality-high in summer and low in winter. The 137Cs concentrations in the animals revealed a different seasonal pattern-it peaked in October in P. paucidens and peaked in February in Rhinogobius. Overall, the 137Cs concentration was relatively higher in P. paucidens than in Rhinogobius, suggesting that P. paucidens has a lower excretion rate than Rhinogobius. Consequently, the seasonality of the 137Cs concentration in P. paucidens showed temporal changes similar to those of the dissolved 137Cs concentration, which were likely affected by 137Cs uptake through foraging, whereas that in Rhinogobius was controlled by 137Cs excretion. This study shows that the seasonality of 137Cs concentration can differ between sympatric animals that share a trophic niche. Accumulating knowledge and comparing the seasonality of 137Cs concentrations in fisheries species based on the balance between uptake and excretion will be valuable to determine the appropriate seasons to obtain less-contaminated products.

AB  - In recent years, the primary development way of orchards has been large-scale mechanized terracing, which significantly disturbs soil profile and reduces soil quality. Soil aggregates and associated nutrients contents can be used as diagnostic markers of soil quality. However, the variation of these markers in Camellia oleifera orchards with land preparation methods (LPM) and plantation ages (PA) and the pathways by which they are affected remain unclear. Here, soil samples were collected from Camellia oleifera orchards developed on terrace and slope with different plantation ages (2, 5,10, 30 years) and soil depths (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm) to quantify them. The results showed the aggregate stability, SOC, TN, TP, C/P, and N/P ratios varied significantly with different LPM and PA. These indicators were significantly lower than the slope at the early stage of terrace construction. In particular, the MWD, aggregate-related C and N of terrace were 23.16 %, 45.92 %, and 23.53 % lower than the slope, respectively. With increasing plantation age, the difference between the terrace and slope gradually decreased. In 30-year-old plantations, some indicators of terrace even exceeded the slope, e.g., the MWD and aggregate-related C of terrace were 0.85 % and 1.32 % higher than the slope, respectively. This trend was more evident in the surface soil (0-20 cm). Meanwhile, it also showed that the newly built terraces were limited by C and N but gradually alleviated with increasing plantation age. The path analysis showed that the LPM had a greater effect on soil quality, mainly through aggregate composition and nutrients. Overall, although the soil quality of terraces would gradually improve with increasing plantation ages, it required a long time and economic cost. This study helps to deepen the understanding of soil nutrients change patterns after terracing and provides the theoretical basis for optimizing terracing.

AB  - Simple Summary The gut is able to "sense" nutrients and release gut hormones to regulate digestive processes. Accordingly, various gastrointestinal cell types possess transient receptor potential channels, cation channels involved in somatosensation, thermoregulation and the sensing of pungent and spicy substances. Recent research shows that both channels are expressed in enteroendocrine cell types responsible for the release of gut peptide hormones such as Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). A large array of herbal compounds, used in pig nutrition mostly for their antibacterial and antioxidant properties, are able to activate these channels. Cinnamaldehyde, occurring in the bark of cinnamon trees, acts as an agonist of Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)-channel. Capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, acts as an agonist of Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-channel. This study explored the ability of both compounds to stimulate the release of CCK and GLP-1, and whether this response was mediated by TRP channels, using an ex-vivo intestinal segment model. Results showed mainly the potential of cinnamaldehyde to interact with TRPA1 and trigger CCK and GLP-1 release, while yet being dependent on the location in the small intestine. Cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin have been reported to exert effects on the gastric function, mediated by the interaction with transient receptor potential ankyrin channel 1 (TRPA1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV1), respectively. This study examined whether these compounds could trigger the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in the pig's gut in a porcine ex-vivo intestinal segment model. Furthermore, it was verified whether this response was mediated by TRPA1 or TRPV1 by using the channel's antagonist. These gut peptides play a key role in the "intestinal brake", a feedback mechanism that influences the function of proximal parts of the gut. Structural analogues of cinnamaldehyde were screened as well, to explore structure-dependent activation. Results showed a significant effect of capsaicin on GLP-1 release in the proximal small intestine, TRPV1 independent. TRPA1 showed to be strongly activated by cinnamaldehyde, both in proximal and distal small intestine, evidenced by the release of CCK and GLP-1, respectively. Out of all structural derivates, cinnamaldehyde showed the highest affinity for TRPA1, which elucidates the importance of the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde moiety. In conclusion, cinnamaldehyde as a TRPA1 agonist, is a promising candidate to modulate gastric function, by activating intestinal brake mechanisms.

AB  - Carbendazim (CBZ), a broad-spectrum pesticide frequently detected in fruits and vegetables, could trigger potential toxic risks to mammals. To facilitate the assessment of health risks, this study aimed to characterize the cytochrome P450 (CYPs)-mediated metabolism profiles of CBZ by a combined experimental and computational study. Our results demonstrated that CYPs-mediated region-selective hydroxylation was a major metabolism pathway for CBZ in liver microsomes from various species including rat, mouse, minipig, dog, rabbit, guinea pig, monkey, cow and human, and the metabolite was biosynthesized and well-characterized as 6-OH-CBZ. CYP1A displayed a predominant role in the region-selective hydroxylation of CBZ that could attenuate its toxicity through converting it into a less toxic metabolite. Meanwhile, five other common pesticides including chlorpyrifos-methyl, prochloraz, chlorfenapyr, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil could significantly inhibit the region-selective hydroxylation of CBZ, and consequently remarkably increased CBZ exposure in vivo. Furthermore, computational study clarified the important contribution of the key amino acid residues Ser122, and Asp313 in CYP1A1, as well as Asp320 in CYP1A2 to the hydroxylation of CBZ through hydrogen bonds. These results would provide some useful information for the metabolic profiles of CBZ by mammalian CYPs, and shed new insights into CYP1A-mediated metabolic detoxification of CBZ and its health risk assessment.

AB  - Hydrosocial territories scholarship has contributed to advancing relational, power-sensitive, multiscalar understandings of water and its governance. Grounded in critical water studies, political ecology, and political geography, this scholarship draws attention to how water distributions are contested between different interest groups and their respective notions of how water is and should be governed at multiple interrelated spatial and temporal scales. We provide an overview of the literature on hydrosocial territories with the objective of tracing the development and application of this framework since its introduction in the mid-2010s. The article summarizes how hydrosocial territories research has developed conceptually, methodologically, and thematically. We find that hydrosocial territories research employs largely qualitative methodologies to study water-related disputes surrounding a diversity of themes including hydraulic infrastructures, agricultural production and export, urbanization, river basin management, extractive industries, and conservation. We conclude with a reflection on potential ways forward for hydrosocial territories scholarship.

AB  - TGF(3-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is phosphorylated during both muscle growth and muscle wasting. To understand how this can lead to such opposite effects, we first performed multiplex kinase array of mouse embryonic stem cells with and without stimulation of TAK1 to determine its potential downstream targets. The phosphorylation of these targets was then compared in three different models: hypertrophic longissimus muscle of Texel sheep, tibialis anterior muscle of mice with cancer-induced cachexia and C2C12-derived myofibers, with and without blockade of TAK1 phosphorylation. In both Texel sheep and in cancer-induced cachexia, phosphorylation of both TAK1 and p38 was increased. Whereas p90RSK was increased in Texel sheep but not cachexia and the phosphorylation of HSP27 and total Jnk were increased in cachexia but not Texel. To understand this further, we examined the expression of these proteins in C2C12 cells as they differentiated into myotubes, with and without blockade of TAK1 phosphorylation. In C2C12 cells, decreased phosphorylation of TAK1 leads to reduced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and HSP27 after 16 h and muscle fiber hypertrophy after 3 days. However, continuous blockade of this pathway leads to muscle fiber failure, suggesting that the timing of TAK1 activation controls the expression of context-dependent targets.

AB  - Simple Summary Several studies point out that the use of local forage legumes, such as sainfoin, can be appropriate for feeding sheep autochthonous breeds, with additional benefits also for the soil. Besides, sainfoin has a medium content of proanthocyanidins (PAC), also known as condensed tannins, the effects of which have been studied in fattening lambs but seldom on suckling lambs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of PAC of sainfoin fed to dams on the productive traits, weight of the digestive organs, and on carcass and meat quality of their suckling lambs. The inclusion of PAC from sainfoin in the dam diet did not produce detrimental changes on the growth and carcass and meat characteristics of their suckling lambs. Therefore, sainfoin can be fed to ewes during lactation to produce suckling lambs, achieving good performances and meat quality. Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) is a forage legume with a medium content of proanthocyanidins (PAC), which may affect animal performance and product quality. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of PAC from sainfoin fed to dams, using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a blocking agent, on the performance and carcass and meat quality of their suckling male lambs. After lambing, twenty lactating dams were fed fresh sainfoin ad libitum plus 200 g per day of barley; ten were orally dosed with water (Sainfoin), and ten were dosed orally with a water dilution of 100 g PEG (Sainfoin + PEG). Their lambs (4.1 +/- 0.64 kg at birth) suckled ad libitum until they reached the target slaughter weight of 10-12 kg. The presence of PAC in the dams' diet did not affect the growth, blood metabolites and carcass weight and fatness of the suckling lambs but decreased the lightness of caudal fat (p < 0.05) and increased the weight of the digestive compartments (p < 0.05). Regarding the meat characteristics, PAC only decreased polyphenols content (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the presence of PAC in the dams' diet had not significant effects on the performance and product quality of their suckling lambs.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda) is a global invasive agricultural pest. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), an important monocot crop cultivated worldwide, faces significant challenges from FAW, which has become a major threat to sorghum production. Plants have evolved a wide array of defense mechanisms to combat insect assault. Caterpillar secretions contain both elicitors and effectors, which can either amplify or suppress plant defenses, thereby influencing plant defense responses. In this study, we examined the role of FAW frass in modulating sorghum defenses. Our results suggest that frass application significantly induced sorghum defenses that impacted subsequent FAW herbivory. We also found that the exogenous frass application significantly elevated the phytohormone levels, specifically jasmonic acid and abscisic acid levels, potentially contributing to enhanced sorghum defense against FAW. Furthermore, FAW frass-treated plants exhibited transient increase in total flavonoids, a class of secondary metabolites, which was previously shown to have a detrimental impact on FAW growth and survival. FAW frass application on sorghum plants mitigated proliferation of specialist aphids (sugarcane aphids), though its effect on generalist aphids (greenbugs) was less pronounced. These findings highlight the role of FAW frass in mediating plant responses against both chewing and piercing-sucking insect pests, providing valuable insights into sorghum's defense mechanisms and its potential for pest management strategies.

AB  - Object-location memory (OLM) is a type of declarative memory for spatial information and consists of the individual's ability to establish accurate associations between objects and their spatial locations. Long-COVID describes the long-term effects of the COVID-19 disease. Long-COVID patients show medial temporal lobe dysfunction and neuropsychological alterations affecting memory. This study aimed to assess OLM in a group of Long-COVID patients, n=66, and a Control group of healthy individuals with similar age and sex composition, n=21, using an immersive virtual reality (iVR)-based OLM task. We also explored associations between the performance in the iVR-based OLM task and general cognitive function (MoCA), and both verbal (VSTM) and visuospatial (SSTM) span. The Long-COVID group showed fewer correct responses, made more task attempts, and invested more time in the iVR-based OLM task than the Control group. Delayed memory was more severely altered than immediate memory in Long-COVID participants. Better MoCA scores of the Long-COVID group were strongly associated with shorter times to complete the immediate recall of the iVR-based OLM task. Besides, the months elapsed since the COVID-19 infection were slightly associated with fewer correct responses in the immediate and 24-hour recalls. These results corroborate previous findings of memory alterations in the LongCOVID syndrome using an iVR-based OLM task, adding new evidence on spatial memory and long-term memory in this population. Implementing spatial iVR tasks to clinical research may improve our understanding of neuropsychological disorders.

AB  - The success of the galling insects sharing the same microhabitat depends both on the synchrony of their life cycles with the leaf flushing of the super-host plant and to the asynchrony among their life cycles. The asynchrony of the multivoltine life cycles of Lopesia spp. (Diptera-Cecidomyiidae) is favored by the constant leaf flushing in M. gemmulata, and favors the non-overlapping of gall induction periods. Peculiarly, the univoltine life cycle of the galling Lepidoptera on its stem galls is synchronized to the availability of mature host leaves during the rainy season, which is important for the water potential in host stem branches. The abundance of the Lopesia gall morphotypes follow the phenology of M. gemmulata, which obeys the seasonal pattern of water availability in the neotropical savanna climate.

AB  - Top borer is a major pest of sugarcane that adversely affects the cane yield and sugar recovery. However, the mineral nutrient status of plants plays a crucial role in providing resistance to herbivores since they are quite sensitive to changes in host plant nutrition. In the current finding, the effect of various silicon sources (silicon material (SM) 50% @ 15, 12, 10, and 8 kg/acre, rice husk ash (RHA) @ 200 and 400 kg/acre, and bagasse ash (BA) @ 200 and 400 kg/acre) at varied doses on the % incidence of top borer, cane yield, and quality traits in sugarcane cultivar Co 238 was studied. The addition of silicon significantly (p <= 0.05) enhanced the silicon concentration in sugarcane stalk and soil (available form). The incidence of top borer (TB) was reduced significantly (p <= 0.05) up to a maximum of -37.62%. Cane yield and its attributes were significantly (p <= 0.05) increased with the application of silicon except for germination (p >= 0.05). Juice quality traits such as Brix (% soluble solids in juice), Sucrose (%), Commercial cane sugar (CCS q/acre), and Pol% cane were also improved significantly (p <= 0.05) in a tested cultivar with the addition of silicon. With the increase in the number of days after planting the stalk silicon content increased maximum of up to 2.48% (T-4) and the available soil silicon level decreased. The correlation analysis revealed that stalk silicon content has a significant (p <= 0.05) strong negative association (r= -0.959) with % infestation of TB and a strong positive (0.86 < r > 0.95) association with all cane yield and juice traits (brix, sucrose, CCS and pol% cane). The TB larvae feeding on silicon-rich tissues with deposited silicon as phytoliths (SEM images) have worn-out mandibles. Economic analysis showed that SM 50% @ 12 kg/acre was sufficient for reducing the infestation of TB up to 35.67% along with enhancing cane yield (50.82%) and CCS (56.73%). Hence, silicon could be used as a vital component for the integrated management of TB.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of cryopreservation on stemness and proliferation potential of sheep spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in vitro.Methods: Sheep testicular cells were isolated and putative SSCs were enriched by the laminin-based differential plating method. Putative SSCs were co-cultured with the Sertoli cell feeder prepared by the Datura Stramonium Agglutinin (DSA-lectin)-based method. The cultured putative SSCs were cryopreserved in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-10% fetal bovine serum mixture (DMEM-10% FBS) media containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone or 10% DMSO plus 200 mM trehalose. Cryopreserved putative SSCs were evaluated for their proliferation potential using in vitro culture and stemness by immunocytochemistry. Finally, the transfection ability of cryopreserved putative SSCs was analyzed.Results: We isolated 91% viable testicular cells from sheep testes. The majority of the laminin enriched cells expressed the SSC related marker, ITGA6. Co-culture of sheep putative SSCs with Sertoli cell feeder resulted in the generation of stable colonies, and the expression of SSC marker was maintained after several passages. A significantly higher number of viable putative SSCs was recovered from SSCs cryopreserved in media containing 10% DMSO and 200 mM trehalose compared to 10% DMSO alone (P<0.01). Cryopreserved putative SSCs formed colonies and showed SSC marker expression similar to the non-cryopreserved putative SSCs. The appearance of green fluorescent colonies over the Sertoli cell feeder indicated that cryopreserved sheep SSCs were successfully transfected.Conclusions: Cryopreserved putative SSCs can retain their stemness, colony forming ability, and transfection efficiency in vitro. Our research may help in the effective preservation of germplasm and the generation of transgenic ovine species.

AB  - Investigating the responses of simplified hull girder (SHG) structures subjected to underwater explosions can yield valuable research insights for real ships. However, previous literature experiments predominantly utilized SHGs with plates of large relative thickness. To examine the ships' damage mechanisms, an underwater explosion experiment is conducted on an SHG with plates that closely approximate the relative thickness of those in real ships. After verifying the calculation accuracy, simulations of various cases are performed to obtain the response results. The damage mechanisms of the SHGs subjected to underwater explosions are discussed from the perspective of creases. The cumulative damage mechanism in a single underwater explosion is identified. Modes of collapse mechanisms, including hogging and sagging, are summarized, and prediction formulas for estimating the sizes of the core damage zone are provided. The results indicate that the damage phenomena on the thinner-walled SHG are more complex, resemble those observed in real ships, representing the evolution types from previous studies. For the SHG configuration employed, the hogging crease collapse mechanism exhibits an M-shaped pattern, while the sagging crease collapse mechanism displays a W-shaped pattern. The provided prediction formulas enable a quick estimation of the core damage zone size.

AB  - Southern East Asia is the dispersal center regarding the prehistoric settlement and migrations of modem humans in Asia-Pacific regions. However, the settlement pattern and population structure of paleolithic humans in this region remain elusive, and ancient DNA can provide direct information. Here, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene hominin (MZR), dated similar to 14.0 thousand years ago from Red Deer Cave located in Southwest China, which was previously reported possessing mosaic features of modern and archaic hominins. MZR is the first Late Pleistocene genome from southern East Asia. Our results indicate that MZR is a modem human who represents an early diversified lineage in East Asia. The mtDNA of MZR belongs to an extinct basal lineage of the M9 haplogroup, reflecting a rich matrilineal diversity in southern East Asia during the Late Pleistocene. Combined with the published data, we detected clear genetic stratification in ancient southern populations of East/Southeast Asia and some degree of south-versus-north divergency during the Late Pleistocene, and MZR was identified as a southern East Asian who exhibits genetic continuity to present day populations. Markedly, MZR is linked deeply to the East Asian ancestry that contributed to First Americans.

AB  - Bioacoustics can be a non-invasive, cost-effective way of studying echolocating bats, and is especially useful for detecting and identifying rare or cryptic species. The insectivorous bats of Madagascar are understudied in comparison to the rest of the island's fauna, and very little is known about their habitat use. Here, we used a remote bioacoustic surveying technique in a bat survey of the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, northwest Madagascar, to study constant frequency echolocating bats (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae). We used two passive acoustic monitoring units to automatically record bat activity from dusk until dawn in a range of habitat types that are characteristic of the region. Analysis of call acoustic parameters revealed three distinct constant-frequency phonic types within the national park, which we identified as Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Macronycteris commersoni), the red trident bat (Triaenops menamena) and an unknown phonic type of ca. 78 kHz. We found significant differences in the habitat usage of these three species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences among Madagascar's bats. Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the acoustic echolocation calls of these three phonic types. The 78 kHz calls do not match any of the other constant frequency-calling bat species currently described for Madagascar, indicating either acoustic divergence among bat sub-populations or the possible existence of a new undescribed species. These results highlight the need for increased survey efforts to gain an understanding of species-specific geographic distributions and habitat usage among Malagasy bats and to disentangle their cryptic species complexes.

AB  - BackgroundMitochondria, essential for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), integrate mt-DNA and nuclear-encoded genes. This cooperation extends to the mitochondrial translation machinery, involving crucial mtDNA-encoded RNAs: 22 tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) as adapters and two rRNAs (mt-rRNAs) for ribosomal assembly, enabling mitochondrial-encoded mRNA translation. Disruptions in mitochondrial gene expression can strongly impact energy generation and overall animal health. Our study investigates the tissue-specific expression patterns of mt-tRNAs and mt-rRNAs in buffalo.Material and methodsTo investigate the expression patterns of mt-tRNAs and mt-rRNAs in different tissues and gain a better understanding of tissue-specific variations, RNA-seq was performed on various tissues, such as the kidney, heart, brain, and ovary, from post-pubertal female buffaloes. Subsequently, we identified transcripts that were differentially expressed in various tissue comparisons.ResultsThe findings reveal distinct expression patterns among specific mt-tRNA and mt-rRNA genes across various tissues, with some exhibiting significant upregulation and others demonstrating marked downregulation in specific tissue contexts. These identified variations reflect tissue-specific physiological roles, underscoring their significance in meeting the unique energy demands of each tissue. Notably, the brain exhibits the highest mtDNA copy numbers and an abundance of mitochondrial mRNAs of our earlier findings, potentially linked to the significant upregulation of mt-tRNAs in brain. This suggests a plausible association between mtDNA replication and the regulation of mtDNA gene expression.ConclusionOverall, our study unveils the tissue-specific expression of mitochondrial-encoded non-coding RNAs in buffalo. As we proceed, our further investigations into tissue-specific mitochondrial proteomics and microRNA studies aim to elucidate the intricate mechanisms within mitochondria, contributing to tissue-specific mitochondrial attributes. This research holds promise to elucidate the critical role of mitochondria in animal health and disease.

AB  - Post-weaning diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F18 (E. coli F18) causes significant economic losses for pig producers. Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes core fucosylation; however, its role in mediating the resistance to E. coli F18 infection in pigs remains unknown. In this study, we systematically verified the relationship between FUT8 expression and E. coli resistance. The results showed that FUT8 was expressed in all detected tissues of Meishan piglets and that its expression was significantly increased in the duodenum and jejunum of E. coli F18-sensitive individuals when compared to E. coli F18-resistant individuals. FUT8 expression increased after exposure to E. coli F18 (p < 0.05) and decreased significantly after LPS induction for 6 h (p < 0.01). Then, the IPEC-J2 stable cell line with FUT8 interference was constructed, and FUT8 knockdown decreased the adhesion of E. coli F18ac to IPEC-J2 cells (p < 0.05). Moreover, we performed a comparative transcriptome study of IPEC-J2 cells after FUT8 knockdown via RNA-seq. In addition, further expression verification demonstrated the significant effect of FUT8 on the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and Toll-like signaling pathways. Moreover, the core promoter of FUT8, which was located at -1213 bp to -673 bp, was identified via luciferase assay. Interestingly, we found a 1 bp C base insertion mutation at the -774 bp region, which could clearly inhibit the transcriptional binding activity of C/EBP alpha to an FUT8 promoter. Therefore, it is speculated that FUT8 acts in a critical role in the process of E. coli infection; furthermore, the low expression of FUT8 is conducive to the enhancement of E. coli resistance in piglets. Our findings revealed the mechanism of pig FUT8 in regulating E. coli resistance, which provided a theoretical basis for the screening of E. coli resistance in Chinese local pig breeds.

AB  - The Ziwuling black goat is an indigenously in China, their offspring are frequently affected by congenital cryptorchidism. The extracellular matrix (ECM) contains cytokines and growth factors that regulate the development of the testis, and component changes often result in pathological changes. Cryptorchidism is closely related to structural changes in ECM. In this study, the histochemical staining, immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot combined with semi-quantitative analysis was used to describe the distribution of the important ECM components Collagen type IV (Col IV), laminin (LN)and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in the normal and cryptorchid testes of Ziwuling black goats. Results showed that: The histochemical staining showed that the dysplasia of seminiferous tubules and decreased number of Sertoli cells in cryptorchidism, as well as sparse collagen fiber. Meanwhile, the distribution of reticular fibers is relatively rich. Furthermore, the PAS and AB staining in the interstitial vessels and lamina propria of seminiferous tubules is weak. The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence revealed that Col IV, LN was strongly expressed in Leydig, Sertoli cells of normal testes and moderately positive in the spermatogonia and spermatids, but HSPG was not expressed in the spermatogonia. However, cryptorchidism, the expression of Col IV, LN and HPSG in Leydig, Sertoli cells significantly decreased, as well as the expression of Col IV and LN in capillary endothelial cells, but HSPG was moderately expressed in spermatogonia. Based on these data, the underdevelopment of spermatogenic epithelium, decreased synthesis function of collagen fibers and Leydig cells develop usually in the cryptorchidism were shown to be closely related to the abnormal metabolism of Col IV and LN. The positive expressed of HSPG in the spermatogonia of cryptorchid testes is related to the compensatory development of spermatogonia.

AB  - BackgroundPreserving plant genetic resources is essential for tackling global food security challenges. Effectively meeting future agricultural demands requires comprehensive and efficient assessments of genetic diversity in breeding programs and germplasm from gene banks. This research investigated the diversity of pheno-morphological traits, along with the fatty acid and tocopherol content and composition, in 135 double haploid lines of camelina.ResultsThe number of sub-branches, siliques number of main-branch and sub-branch, and seeds number in siliques of the main-branch displayed notable coefficients of variation with values of 33.19%, 30.32%, 29.23%, and 23.81% respectively. Within the current investigation, the measurements of height, sub-branch number, and thousand seed weight varied from 53.50 to 86.50 cm, 3.50 to 14, and 0.73 to 1.52 g, respectively. The analysis unveiled that the average content of omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids in the examined lines was approximately 33%, 20%, and 17%, respectively. The total tocopherol content varied between 675 and 877 ppm, predominantly consisting of gamma-tocopherol, which accounted for over 95% of the total content. The fatty acid C18:2 displayed a markedly strong positive correlation with alpha-tocopherol (0.99**), while C18:3 exhibited positive correlations with gamma-tocopherol (0.98**) and total tocopherol (0.98**). Furthermore, a positive correlation was evident between C20:1 and delta-tocopherol (0.98**). The scrutinized lines, specifically lines 35, 72, 94, and 126 demonstrated notable attributes regarding yield and yield components. Conversely, in the realm of biochemical traits, lines 35, 66, 47, 30, 65, 135, 83, 27, 4, 77, 62, 81, and 93 stood out for their elevated potential. The gene expression analysis related to the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway revealed distinct expression patterns. Specifically, the VTE1 gene exhibited the highest level of expression. In contrast, the VTE3 gene displayed the lowest level of expression compared to other genes.ConclusionsThe study's findings hold great potential for improving food security by enabling the selection of superior camelina parent plants based on specific traits. This approach can drive the development of high-yielding varieties with enhanced nutritional value and better-quality camelina oil.

AB  - Plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase their ability to overcome multiple stresses, but their impact on plant interactions with herbivorous insects is controversial. Here we show higher mortality of the leaf-chewer Spodoptera exigua when fed on tomato plants colonized by the AMF Funneliformis mosseae, evidencing mycorrhiza-induced resistance. In search of the underlying mechanisms, an untargeted metabolomic analysis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed. The results showed that mycorrhizal symbiosis had a very limited impact on the leaf metabolome in the absence of stress, but significantly modulated the response to herbivory in the damaged area. A cluster of over accumulated metabolites was identified in those leaflets damaged by S. exigua feeding in mycorrhizal plants, while unwounded distal leaflets responded similar to those from non-mycorrhizal plants. These primed-compounds were mostly related to alkaloids, fatty acid derivatives and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates. The deleterious effect on larval survival of some of these compounds, including the alkaloid physostigmine, the fatty acid derivatives 4-oxododecanedioic acid and azelaic acid, was confirmed. Thus, our results evidence the impact of AMF on metabolic reprograming upon herbivory that leads to a primed accumulation of defensive compounds.

AB  - Lipid metabolism plays an important role in the regulation of early embryonic development in mammals. However, the effect of lipid metabolism mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) on the early embryonic development of sheep remains unclear. In this study, rosiglitazone (RSG), a PPAR gamma activator, was added to the in vitro embryo culture (IVC) medium to regulate the continuous expression of PPAR gamma. This study aimed to evaluate PPAR gamma expression during early embryonic development in sheep as well as its effects on lipid deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels, apoptosis and lipid metabolismrelated gene expression, and embryonic development. PPAR gamma was not detected at 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stage, while widely expressed with obvious nuclear expression features in blastocysts. Notably, treatment with 5 mu M RSG in sheep parthenogenetic activated (PA) embryos significantly increased the blastocyst rate, lipid content, and GSH levels, while decreasing ROS levels. Further analysis revealed that RSG treatment upregulated the expression levels of antioxidant genes (SOD2 and CAT), anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2), and lipid metabolismrelated genes (SCD-1, CD36, PLIN2, FABP3, and FABP4). Taken together, these results suggest that PPAR gamma plays a vital role in promoting embryonic development by enhancing lipid metabolism and reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Phytate is the most abundant organic phosphorus (P) in the environment and is also an important bioavailable P source for algal blooms in some lakes. A novel Fe-Al-La (FAL) tri-metal composite adsorbent was developed by the coprecipitation method. The maximum adsorption capacity was 2.09 mu mol m(-2) at 298 K and an initial pH of 4.0, and it could keep high adsorption capacity when the pH varied from 4.0 to 9.0. The dominant process for the adsorption of phytate by the FAL adsorbent was surface chemical reactions mainly by monolayer coverage. The adsorption was best described by Langmuir isotherms, and its kinetics by a pseudo-second-order kinetic equation. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that adsorption of phytate by the FAL adsorbent was a spontaneous and endothermic process. The adsorption capacity decreased with pH variation from 3.2 to 11.0, especially when pH > 9.0. The sequence of strength of competition of coexisting anions with phytate was CO32- > SO42- > NO3- > Cl-. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) also competed for adsorption sites with phytate on the surface of the FAL adsorbent. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analyses showed that phytate had been adsorbed onto the surface of the FAL adsorbent and that Fe, Al and La all participated in adsorption. The prepared FAL adsorbent exhibited potential for removing both phytate and other phosphate species during treatment of wastewaters including those from pig and poultry manures. The FAL adsorbent could also be a potential agent for immobilization of both phytate and phosphate in overlying water and lake sediments. This study also indicated that eutrophication of lakes would increase the potential of phytate to be a bioavailable form of P in blooming of algae.

AB  - Intestinal infections caused by Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica pose a huge economic burden on the swine industry that is exacerbated by the development of antimicrobial resistance in these pathogens, thus raising the need for alternative prevention and treatment methods. Our aim was to test the beneficial effects of the flavonoid luteolin in an in vitro model of porcine intestinal infections. We infected the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 with E. coli and S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (10(6) CFU/mL) with or without previous, concurrent, or subsequent treatment with luteolin (25 or 50 mu g/mL), and measured the changes in the reactive oxygen species and interleukin-6 and -8 levels of cells. We also tested the ability of luteolin to inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to the cell layer, and to counteract the barrier integrity damage caused by the pathogens. Luteolin was able to alleviate oxidative stress, inflammation, and barrier integrity damage, but it could not inhibit the adhesion of bacteria to IPEC-J2 cells. Luteolin is a promising candidate to be used in intestinal infections of pigs, however, further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy. The use of luteolin in the future could ultimately lead to a reduced need for antibiotics in pig production.

AB  - Key message Comparative analysis of herbivory responsive miRNAs between pod borer susceptible C. cajan and its resistant Crop Wild Relative (CWR) C. scarabaeoides revealed miRNA-based regulation of defense genes and plant-insect interactions. Gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) is one of most devastating pests of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) worldwide, responsible for huge losses in crop productivity. The lack of genes conferring resistance to pod borer in pigeon pea has proven to be a bottleneck for its improvement. One of its CWR, C. scarabaeoides has demonstrated resistance to this pest and can be exploited for developing pest resistant crop varieties. Differences in expression patterns of herbivory responsive microRNAs in the susceptible C. cajan and resistant C. scarabaeoides after different time duration of pod borer infestation (2 h, 8 h and 18 h) were identified, characterized and functionally validated to understand their role in insect defense response. A total of 462 conserved and 449 novel miRNAs and 273 conserved and 185 novel miRNAs, were identified in C. cajan and C. scarabaeoides, respectively. Among the identified miRNAs, 65, 68 and 65 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressing between the C. scarabaeoides and C. cajan libraries 2 h, 8 h and 18 h post infestation, respectively. These miRNAs were found to target genes involved in a number of pathways contributing to defense and acquired resistance in C. scarabaeoides against pod borer, indicating miRNA-based regulation of defense pathways. Expression patterns of eight of these miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. This study provides novel insights into the miRNA-mediated plant-insect interactions and the mechanisms of regulatory pathways involved in insect defense. These findings can be utilized for further exploring the mechanism of herbivore defense in plant systems.

AB  - The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that energy intake for ungulates is maximised when forage biomass is at intermediate levels. Nevertheless, metabolic allometry and different digestive systems suggest that resource selection should vary across ungulate species. By combining GPS relocations with remotely sensed data on forage characteristics and surface water, we quantified the effect of body size and digestive system in determining movements of 30 populations of hindgut fermenters (equids) and ruminants across biomes. Selection for intermediate forage biomass was negatively related to body size, regardless of digestive system. Selection for proximity to surface water was stronger for equids relative to ruminants, regardless of body size. To be more generalisable, we suggest that the FMH explicitly incorporate contingencies in body size and digestive system, with small-bodied ruminants selecting more strongly for potential energy intake, and hindgut fermenters selecting more strongly for surface water.

AB  - Since 2007, the Oncofertility Consortium Annual Conference has brought together a diverse network of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and professional levels to disseminate emerging basic and clinical research findings in fertility preservation. This network also developed enduring educational materials to accelerate the pace and quality of field-wide scientific communication. Between 2007 and 2019, the Oncofertility Consortium Annual Conference was held as an in-person event in Chicago, IL. The conference attracted approximately 250 attendees each year representing 20 countries around the world. In 2020, however, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted this paradigm and precluded an in-person meeting. Nevertheless, there remained an undeniable demand for the oncofertility community to convene. To maintain the momentum of the field, the Oncofertility Consortium hosted a day-long virtual meeting on March 5, 2021, with the theme of "Oncofertility Around the Globe" to highlight the diversity of clinical care and translational research that is ongoing around the world in this discipline. This virtual meeting was hosted using the vFairs (R) conference platform and allowed over 700 people to participate, many of whom were first-time conference attendees. The agenda featured concurrent sessions from presenters in six continents which provided attendees a complete overview of the field and furthered our mission to create a global community of oncofertility practice. This paper provides a synopsis of talks delivered at this event and highlights the new advances and frontiers in the fields of oncofertility and fertility preservation around the globe from clinical practice and patient-centered efforts to translational research.

AB  - In brief Vaginal microbiota composition influences female fertility, however it has not been studied for measuring fertility level in female pigs. This study reveals significant vaginal microbiota composition differences between high reproductive performance and infertile sows, and demonstrates that the vaginal microbiota has promise for improving female pig selection using machine learning modeling.Abstract There is a need for reliable and effective biomarkers of female fertility and reproductive potential in the pork industry, as current selection protocols are not keeping up with the rate of improvement for other production-related traits. This study aimed to investigate the vaginal microbiota composition between sows of differing fertility status and identify candidate vaginal microbiota biomarkers of sow fertility. The vaginal microbiota of high reproductive performance sows (HRP, n = 52) with number of piglets born alive >= 13 and infertile sows (INF, n = 23), that remained nonpregnant after two consecutive rounds of artificial insemination, were investigated. Sequencing results revealed significantly different (P < 0.05) beta diversity at the genus level between HRP and INF vaginal microbiota communities. Accordingly, the composition of the vaginal microbiota diverged between HRP and INF sows, with INF sows having increased (P < 0.05) relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae XPB1014 group and HRP sows having increased (P < 0.05) relative abundance of Aerococcus and Staphylococcus at the genus level. Forty-two genera were selected as candidate biomarkers of sow fertility via partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and recursive feature elimination. The support-vector machine model classified sow fertility with 93.3% accuracy, supporting potential industry application to improve upon current methods for selection and recruitment in the breeding herd. Future investigations should validate the candidate vaginal microbiota biomarkers in a large, independent population of sows and gilts to evaluate their application for predicting future reproductive performance and assess their true industry applicability.

AB  - The Argentine stem weevil (ASW), a major pest in ryegrass pastures, causes significant agricultural losses. Ryegrass can establish a symbiotic association with Epichlo & euml; endophytic fungi, which supply chemical defenses, including peramine. This symbiosis helps protect ryegrass by providing peramine, which acts as a primary defense. In addition, ryegrass can activate induced defense mechanisms, with peramine remaining the central agent in response to herbivorous insect attacks. Therefore, this study assessed the feeding of the ASW on ryegrass carrying endophytic fungus and peramine levels in aerial organs and its effects on pest performance. Argentine stem weevil adults and larvae were placed on ryegrass leaves and stems to assess feeding. Two treatments were used: endophyte-free plants and endophyte-colonized plants. After ASW feeding damage, insect consumption was measured by the leaf area consumed. To evaluate peramine production and its increase in response to ASW attack, peramine levels in leaves were analyzed using liquid chromatography. Damaged E+ ryegrass plants showed significant increases in peramine, with adult and larval herbivory raising levels by 291% and 216% in stems and by 135% and 85% in leaves, respectively, compared to controls. Endophyte-free (E-) plants experienced more ASW damage, as insects preferred feeding on them, showing reduced activity as peramine levels rose in endophyte-infected (E+) plants. An oviposition assay confirmed insect preference for endophyte-free (E-) plants. Additionally, larvae reared on endophyte-infected (E+) plants had lower survival rates, correlating negatively with peramine levels. These results emphasize peramine's role in strengthening ryegrass defenses against ASW, impacting both feeding and larval development.

AB  - Simple Summary Small animals such as goats, sheep and chickens are an important source of income for rural livelihoods, especially for women farmers in Africa, because they are able to control the resources that come from the sale of these animals. However, one of the biggest problems they face is livestock diseases, even when vaccines are available. In Kenya, Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly infectious disease of goats with a mortality rate of more than 70%. A vaccine for CCPP is available but difficult to access by women in the rural areas. This study examines the gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from effectively accessing and adopting CCPP vaccination for their animals in the Machakos district of Kenya. Our results indicate that key constraints to vaccine access and adoption for rural smallholder women farmers are lack of a cold chain for vaccine maintenance, inadequate and late delivery of veterinary services, lack of information and training, and limited financial capacity to purchase the vaccine. If more resources, information, and training is made available to women smallholder farmers through government or the private sector, there would be improved livestock productivity, better livelihoods, and increased opportunities and agency for women. Most rural women smallholder farmers in Kenya generate income from the sale of small ruminant animals. However, diseases such as Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) prevent them from optimizing earnings. A crucial aspect for the control of CCPP is vaccination. In Kenya, CCPP vaccines are distributed through a government delivery mechanism. This study examines gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from accessing CCPP vaccines. Qualitative data collection tools used were focus groups discussions, focus meals, jar voices and key informant interviews. Using outcome mapping (OM) methodology, critical partners and stakeholders in the CCPP vaccine value chain (CCPP-VVC) were identified to be the manufacturers, importers, distributors, agrovets, public and private veterinarians, local leaders, and farmers. Respondents highlighted the barriers to be limited access to vaccines due to cold chain problems, inadequate and late delivery of services, lack of information and training on vaccines, and financial constraints. Identified opportunities that can support women's engagement in the CCPP-VVC are the Kenya Governments two-third gender rule, which requires that not more than two thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender, and positive community perception of female veterinarians. We conclude that more resources and training should be made available to women farmers, and that gender perspectives on policy development related to livestock production and disease prevention are urgently needed to improve livestock productivity and increase agency for women.

AB  - Purpose Dientamoeba fragilis (D. fragilis) is a common intestinal protozoan with a global distribution. In the present study, we aimed to determine genetic diversity of D. fragilis isolates with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in the southwest of Turkey and analyse the clinical findings. Materials and Methods The study included faecal samples from 200 individuals in Aydin, Turkey. The positivity of D. fragilis was determined with 18 S rRNA gene-based PCR assay. Six nested-PCR reactions were set to amplify partial D. fragilis housekeeping genes in the positive samples. The sequences were aligned with the references from GenBank to detect nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes. Additionally, the clinical findings and demographic characteristics of patients were statistically analysed between D. fragilis-infected and non-infected cases. Results The positivity of D. fragilis was 16% (32 out of 200 cases) with 18 S rRNA based-PCR, and all were classified as "genotype 1". The analysis of six MLST loci revealed different haplotypes only at one locus; the remaining five loci exhibited no polymorphisms. The haplotypes in the present study were identical to at least one previously reported reference, except the locus "large subunit of RNA polymerase II" locus. There were no significant differences in any of the clinical findings or demographic characteristics between the infected and non-infected groups. Conclusions Our study revealed a low genetic diversity of D. fragilis isolates from Turkey, like other countries including Italy, Denmark, the UK, Australia, and Brazil. The high degree of sequence similarity in housekeeping genes indicated the clonal distribution of D. fragilis.

AB  - NIN-like proteins (NLPs) are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that are unique to plants and play a pivotal role in responses to nitrate uptake and assimilation. However, a comprehensive analysis of NLP members in tea plants is lacking. The present study performed a genome-wide analysis and identified 33 NLP gene family members of Camellia sinensis that were distributed unequally across 5 chromosomes. Subcellular localisation predictions revealed that all CsNLP proteins were localised in the nucleus. Conservative domain analysis revealed that all of these proteins contained conserved RWP-RK and PB1 domains. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the CsNLP gene family into four clusters. The promoter regions of CsNLPs harboured cis -acting elements associated with plant hormones and abiotic stress responses. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that CsNLP8 was significantly upregulated in roots under nitrate stress conditions. Subcellular localisation analysis found CsNLP8 localised to the nucleus. Dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that CsNLP8 positively regulated the expression of a nitrate transporter gene (CsNRT2.2).

AB  - Introduction. Liver fibrosis is caused by continuous wound healing responses to various harmful stimuli, including viral infection, drugs, alcohol, and autoimmune liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of extracts of Periplaneta americana (EPA) in rats with pig serum-induced liver fibrosis to preliminarily assess the antifibrotic effect of EPA.
   Material and methods. Seventy rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (10 rats in each group): HC, the healthy control group; FC, the fibrotic control group; TL, low-dose EPA treatment group group; TM, medium-dose EPA group; TH, high-dose EPA treatment group; TC1, Panax notoginseng/Salvia mitiorrhiza treatment control group 1; TC2, colchicine treatment control group 2. TC1 and TC2 were used as the positive control to demonstrate the difference between EPA and the effects of other compounds. The liver fibrosis model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL pig serum twice a week for 13 weeks in all groups except for the HC group. The hepatic fibrosis model was established at the 7th week, and followingly, the corresponding compounds were administered once a day in all groups for 6 weeks. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity was determined in rat blood serum. We also measured liver fibrosis-related serum markers, including hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), type III pre-collagen (PC-III) and type IV collagen (IV-C). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson stainings were used to assess liver morphology and determine the stage of fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the protein expression of NF-kappa B, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in rat liver tissue.
   Results. Compared with that of the HC group, the liver tissue of the FC group presented obvious liver damage and collagen deposition. The serum levels of ALT, AST, HA, LN, PC-III and IV-C and the expression of NF-kappa B, alpha-SMA, TGF-beta 1 and TIMP-1 in the FC group were significantly higher than those in the HC group, the EPA treatment groups, the TC1 group and the TC2 group (P < 0.01). The levels of serum ALT, AST, HA, LN, PC-III and IV-C and the expression of alpha-SMA, NF-kappa B, TGF-beta 1 and TIMP-1 in the TL, TC1 and TC2 groups were significantly higher than those TM and TH groups (P < 0.05). EPA treatment significantly improved liver function, decreased collagen deposition and reversed the pathological changes related to liver fibrosis.
   Conclusions. We found that EPA could reduce liver inflammation, suppress liver cell degeneration and necrosis, and reduce the formation of liver fibrous tissue. Its mechanism might be associated with inhibiting the expression of TGF-beta 1, TIMP-1, NF-kappa B and alpha-SMA to block signal transduction pathways in the hepatic fibrosis process. Therefore, EPA, as a traditional Chinese medicine, might be potentially used to prevent and treat hepatic fibrosis in the future. However, further more experiments are necessary to verify its effectiveness and possible signaling pathways.

AB  - Feral cat predation is recognised as a significant threat to Australian wildlife that has contributed to population declines and extinctions. Cat predation of bats worldwide is a growing concern, though there are few studies focusing on Australian species. We consolidated empirical evidence of cat predation on the threatened Pilbara leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Observations in video and camera trap datasets demonstrated repeated predation of R. aurantia by several individual cats at three significant roosts. Between 2020 and 2023, we documented 183-200 bat kills at these sites. We recommend feral cat predation be formally recognised as a key threat to this species. To prevent declines at key colonies that would contribute to a population reduction, ongoing monitoring and proactive control of cats at known R. aurantia roosts should be prioritised. As demonstrated herein, camera trap monitoring is a valid method for quantifying the impact of feral cats at roost sites. Because relatively few individual cats at just a few sites can have a large impact, and most of the larger roost sites of R. aurantia have been discovered, there is potential for amelioration of this threat with multiple established and emerging methods deployed concurrently.

AB  - Kunzea ambigua is a small shrub belonging to the Myrtaceae family and the leaves are steam-distilled to produce a therapeutically active essential oil. With production moving from wild-harvested to orchardised stands, there is a need for harvest management of kunzea oil. This study compared the regrowth, essential oil content and composition of kunzea plants after harvesting vegetative material to a depth of 0.2 m above ground level (shallow-cut), relative to plants cut to a depth of 0.1 m above ground level (deep-cut) over the 2018/2019 growing season. Increased vegetative biomass accounted for the increased oil yield and was caused by consistently higher growth rates of 50 to 60% across all seasons in shallow-cut crops relative to those subject to deep-cut. Total soluble sugar concentrations were higher in the leaves and lower in the roots of deep-cut treated plants compared to the other treatments, indicating defoliated K. ambigua responds by mobilising sugars into above-ground biomass. The overall essential oil content of leaves was constant regardless of season, though the oil yield for shallow-cut was 1.9-fold higher at 11.79 +/- 0.23 g/m(2) compared to deep-cut (6.24 +/- 0.18 g/m(2)). An interactive effect of harvest intensity with season was recorded for all major components except for a non-significant effect of season on terpinen-4-ol. Bicyclogermacrene and alpha-pinene were elevated in both shallow- and deep-cut treatments relative to control (un-cut) in spring, possibly due to the plant defense response after de-foliation. The highest percentage of bioactive compounds (1,8-cineole and viridiflorol) were present in autumn. Therefore, the recovery of biomass post-harvest is optimised by shallow-cut harvests, and the profile of kunzea oil can be manipulated to elevate levels of specific bioactive components by selecting to crop in autumn/spring.

AB  - Distantly related mammals (e.g. jerboa, tarsiers, kangaroos) have convergently evolved elongated hindlimbs relative to body size. Limb elongation is hypothesized to make these species more effective jumpers by increasing their kinetic energy output (through greater forces or acceleration distances), thereby increasing take -off velocity and jump distance. This hypothesis, however, has rarely been tested at the population level, where natural selection operates. We examined the relationship between limb length, muscular traits and dynamics using Longshanks mice, which were selectively bred over 22 generations for longer tibiae. Longshanks mice have approximately 15% longer tibiae and 10% longer femora compared with random -bred Control mice from the same genetic background. We collected in vivo measures of locomotor kinematics and force production, in combination with behavioral data and muscle morphology, to examine how changes in bone and muscle structure observed in Longshanks mice affect their hindlimb dynamics during jumping and clambering. Longshanks mice achieved higher mean and maximum lunge -jump heights than Control mice. When jumping to a standardized height (14 cm), Longshanks mice had lower maximum ground reaction forces, prolonged contact times and greater impulses, without significant differences in average force, power or whole -body velocity. While Longshanks mice have longer plantarflexor muscle bodies and tendons than Control mice, there were no consistent differences in muscular cross-sectional area or overall muscle volume; improved lunge -jumping performance in Longshanks mice is not accomplished by simply possessing larger muscles. Independent of other morphological or behavioral changes, our results point to the benefit of longer hindlimbs for performing dynamic locomotion.

AB  - It is very significant to monitor livestock foraging behavior accurately and in real-time to further improve pasture management and livestock welfare. Although various algorithms have been developed to identify and classify animals' foraging behavior, it still has room to be improved in generality and function. In this study, a representative acoustic dataset generated by typical bodyweight sheep when grazing on various grasses and subsequent ruminating was created. Then an algorithm for the identification and classification of foraging behavior was proposed based on feature extraction technique and deep learning. Specifically, all prominent fragments in the acoustic signal were identified as events by the identification algorithm, and the events were classified as noise, chew, bite, chew-bite, or ruminating behavior through the classification model. The effect of each parameter on the identification algorithm was analyzed, and an optimal set of parameters was derived. As a result, the accuracy of 96.13% was achieved by the identification algorithm with the optimal parameters. Meanwhile, the performances of three common deep network models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN), were compared. The results showed that the RNN, CNN, and DNN model's accuracy were 93.17%, 92.53%, and 79.43%, respectively. The RNN model had a stronger classification capacity than the CNN model since it involved the inter-dependent information of adjacent events. The CNN model achieved a superior classification performance than the DNN model because the log-scaled Mel-spectrogram representation of the event waveform was more effective than the waveform itself. The algorithm proposed in this study could be well applied to identify and classify all foraging behaviors of typical weight sheep foraging freely on various grasses in the future.

AB  - The Aspergillus species are main causative agents of various infections such as invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients and these infections have high mortality rates. In this study, we provide insight in the species causing aspergillosis in Iran based on morphology and sequence data. Clinical (n = 117) and environmental isolates (n = 54) collected during 2010-2016 from University hospitals in Mashhad and Tehran (Iran) were identified both morphologically and molecularly using partial calmodulin (CaM) gene sequences. Clinical cases were identified based on EORTC/MSG criteria. Aspergillus flavus (n = 96, 55%) was the most prevalent species among the clinical and environmental isolates while A. fumigatus (n = 13, 7.5%) ranked fourth after A. tubingensis (n = 23, 13%) and A. welwitchiae (n = 18, 10%). Species such as A. tubingensis, A. welwitschiae, A. fumigatus, A. sydowii, A. neoniger and A. terreus were present in both clinical and environmental samples indicating the possible environmental source of infections. Interestingly, A. niger was isolated only once. Furthermore, 13 other rare and cryptic Aspergillus species were detected. Pulmonary and respiratory disorders (n = 33), followed by transplantation (n = 23), invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (n = 14), and haematological malignancies (n = 12) were major predisposing factors. According to EORTC/MSG criteria, there were 43 probable cases identified followed by 36 cases for each of proven and possible ones. Correct molecular identification will be useful for further epidemiological studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Carnivorous fish species, such as the Florida pompano, currently require expensive and unsustainable feed in order to be raised in an aquaculture setting. A waste product of the black soldier fly, frass has the potential to be an alternative carbohydrate source for these fish. This study aims to assess the potential of frass to mimic the growth, body, composition, and intestinal microbiome of pompano that can be achieved through commercial feed. Three diets with varying frass levels as well as a control diet were developed. The frass was found to increase the visceral somatic index and lower the hepatosomatic index. The frass did not alter the body composition or improve the growth performance, leading to a lower specific growth rate and higher feed conversion rate. The microbiome analysis showed the highest diversity of the gut flora in the control diet, while the frass diets showed signs of community imbalance. This may have been due to the decreased starch in the frass, which is usually metabolized by those microbial communities. Overall, frass diets are not ideal for carnivorous fish diets, but have could have potential for feed replacement in herbivore and detritivore fish species. The aquaculture industry is in need of sustainable fish feed to reduce the use of expensive and environmentally invasive wild-caught fish currently fed to many carnivorous species. The black soldier fly (BSF) has become a popular sustainable alternative protein source; however, the nutritional waste byproduct of BSF, frass, has not been extensively studied as a feed replacement in carnivorous species. This study evaluates the potential of BSF frass on the growth, body composition, and intestinal microbiome of the Florida pompano, Trachinotus carolinus. Four experimental diets were formulated containing different levels of frass, replacing plant-based carbohydrate sources. As a result of this study, the frass did not improve the growth performance, resulting in a lower specific growth rate and higher feed conversion rate. While the frass diets did not alter the body composition, the visceral somatic index (VSI) significantly increased compared to the control diet and the hepatosomatic index (HIS) was lowered. The microbiome analysis showed high variation among the diets, with the control diet having the most distinct consortia, which may have been driven by the increased levels of starch compared to frass diets. This study indicates that BSF frass may not be a suitable feed replacement for carnivorous pompano; however, frass could still potentially be a replacement feed for herbivore or detritivore fish and should be further studied.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene family is one of the largest and oldest protein families, consisting of ATP-driven transporters facilitating substrate transportation across cell membranes. However, little is known about the evolution and biological function of the ABC gene family in tea plants. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification and expression analysis of genes encoding ABC transporter proteins in Camellia sinensis. Our analysis of 170 ABC genes revealed that CsABCs were unevenly distributed across 15 chromosomes, with an amino acid length ranging from 188 to 2489 aa, molecular weight ranging from 20.29 to 277.34 kDa, and an isoelectric point ranging from 4.89 to 10.63. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CsABCs were divided into eight subfamilies, among which the ABCG subfamily was the most abundant. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of CsABCs indicated that they were present in various organelles. Collinearity analysis between the tea plant and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes revealed that the CsABC genes were homologous to the AtABC genes. Large gene fragment duplication analysis identified ten gene pairs as tandem repeats, and interaction network analysis demonstrated that CsABCs interacted with various types of target genes, with protein interactions also occurring within the family. Tissue expression analysis indicated that CsABCs were highly expressed in roots, stems, and leaves and were easily induced by drought and cold stress. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis of the relative expression level of the gene under drought and cold stress correlated with the sequencing results. Identifying ABC genes in tea plants lays a foundation for the classification and functional analysis of ABC family genes, which can facilitate molecular breeding and the development of new tea varieties.

AB  - We present a new photoswitchable spin label for light-induced pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance dipolar spectroscopy (LiPDS), the photoexcited triplet state of erythrosin B (EB), which is ideal for biological applications. With this label, we perform an in-depth study of the orientational effects in dipolar traces acquired using the refocused laser-induced magnetic dipole technique to obtain information on the distance and relative orientation between the EB and nitroxide labels in a rigid model peptide, in good agreement with density functional theory predictions. Additionally, we show that these orientational effects can be averaged to enable an orientation-independent analysis to determine the distance distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of these experiments above liquid nitrogen temperatures, removing the need for expensive liquid helium or cryogen-free cryostats. The variety of choices in photoswitchable spin labels and the affordability of the experiments are critical for LiPDS to become a widespread methodology in structural biology.

AB  - Measuring animal behaviour is important in the assessment of animal welfare. When interaction with the enrichment material (EM) can be measured, it can be used for detecting an increasing/decreasing interest in a certain EM. In this study, non-invasive sensor technologies were validated for measuring interaction with EM in pens with weaned fattening pigs. The experiment was carried out in four pens with six weaned pigs per pen (until a body weight of +/- 25 kg) at a semi-commercial farm. Pens were provided with EM (ball and piece of wood (and a rope in two of the four pens) connected to a chain). Different sensor technologies were tested: passive infra-red detectors (PIDs), tri-axial accelerometers (TAA) and neural network model algorithms (NNMA 1 and NNMA 2) based on video images. Per pen, a PID was placed above the EM which measured the movement of body heat around the chain ((sic)20 cm) in volts per second. A TAA was attached to the EM (at the top of the chain) and measured acceleration based on X-, Y- and Z-axis co-ordinates every second. A video camera was placed above each pen to record video images that were used to feed the NNMAs and for behavioural observations. Interaction with EM (shake, carry, nose, bite, chew or root) was manually scored per second per pig (pooled per pen afterwards) for 30 min of video footage per pen per week and was compared with data from PIDs, TAAs and NNMAs. F1 score (F1) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) were calculated to measure the performance of the sensor technologies. PIDs (F1 = 0.380, MCC = 0.192), as well as TAAs (X-axis: F1 = 0.482, MCC = 0.345; Y-axis: F1 = 0.524, MCC = 0.401; Z-axis: F1 = 0.465, MCC = 0.320; XYZ-axis: F1 = 0.474, MCC = 0.333), overestimated interaction with the EM which might be due to the relatively small pen size, resulting in piglets touching the EM without intentional interaction with the EM. NNMAs achieved the highest performance parameters (NNMA 1: F1 = 0.554, MCC = 0.466; NNMA 2: F1 = 0.540, MCC = 0.445). Overall, only moderate F1s and MCCs were reached. The results indicated that the individual sensor technologies are not yet appropriate to measure interaction with the EM. However, there is potential to measure interaction with EM by applying a multi-sensor approach (combination of PID, TAA and NNMA), but this merits further study.

AB  - Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Despite its prevalence, effective treatments remain elusive. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal synaptic functions in ASD development. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (RTMS) is a painless and effective treatment allowed for use in depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, its efficacy in treating autism is still under investigation. Low-frequency RTMS (LF-RTMS), which shows promise in reducing autismlike behaviors, is considered to regulate synaptic function. Objective: We observed and recorded the behaviors of mice to assess the impact of RTMS on their social interactions and repetitive activities. Subsequently, we examined GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal markers along with synaptic marker proteins to understand the underlying changes associated with these behaviors. Methods: To evaluate behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), several behavioral tests were conducted, focusing on sociability, repetitive behaviors, locomotion, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were employed to investigate the activity of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus, aiming to understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Results: LF-RTMS treatment effectively relieved the social disability and normalized synaptic function in the hippocampus of ASD mice model induced by valproate (VPA). Importantly, this treatment did not lead to any adverse effects on repetitive behavior, locomotion, anxiety, or depression. Conclusion: LF-RTMS attenuated social disability without affecting repetitive behavior, locomotion, anxiety, or depression. Changes in the expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal synaptic proteins in the hippocampus were also observed.

AB  - IntroductionMaternal sleep deprivation (MSD), which induces inflammation and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus, has been associated with learning and memory impairment in offspring. Melatonin (Mel) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective function. However, the beneficial effect of Mel on MSD-induced cognitive impairment and its mechanisms are unknown.MethodsIn the present study, adult offspring suffered from MSD were injected with Mel (20 mg/kg) once a day during postnatal days 61-88. The cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic plasticity associated proteins were examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.ResultsThe results showed that MSD impaired learning and memory in the offspring mice. MSD increased the levels of interleukin (IL)-1creIL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and decreased the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase receptor B, postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus. Furthermore, Mel attenuated cognitive impairment and restored markers of inflammation and synaptic plasticity to control levels.ConclusionsThese findings indicated that Mel could ameliorate learning and memory impairment induced by MSD, and these beneficial effects were related to improvement in inflammation and synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Biochar exhibits substantial potential for interaction with clay minerals upon its introduction into the environment. However, the precise impact of this interaction on the surface properties of biochar and its capacity for metal sorption, particularly in relation to varying biochar particle sizes, remains unclear. Therefore, this study focused on biochar particles derived from pig bone, varying in size, and subjected them to treatment with two common clay minerals (kaolinite and montmorillonite). The objective was to scrutinize their influence on the physicochemical properties of biochar and its binding affinity for Cadmium (Cd). The results revealed that postinteraction with kaolinite and montmorillonite, the Cd sorption capacity of large biochar particles (250-425 mu m) saw respective increments of 11.6% and 26.6%, whereas the Cd removal capacity of small biochar particles (25-75 mu m) experienced reductions of 8.8% and 18.5%, respectively. Additionally, the surface area of the large biochar particles increased by 19.5% and 32.9%, while that of the small biochar particles decreased by 31.3% and 17.7% after interactions with kaolinite and montmorillonite, respectively. Through the analysis of 2D-FTIRCOS, it was determined that regardless of particle size, COO- on the initial pig bone biochar exhibited the highest sensitivity for Cd adsorption. However, after interaction with kaolinite and montmorillonite, Al-O and Si-O-Al groups were identified as the most responsive for the small biochar particles, while -OH and O-P-O groups exhibited heightened sensitivity for the large biochar particles in adsorbing Cd. The results of this study offer valuable insights into how typical clay minerals can impact the surface properties and metal sorption capacity of biochar of varying particle sizes, which is advantageous for optimizing the production and environmental applications of biochar.

AB  - BackgroundCalcification is the primary cause of bioprosthetic material degradation, triggered by various factors. Although many studies have proposed different anti-calcification methods, most of them focus on a single target and modify it, while the treated tissue is still stored in glutaraldehyde, re-exposing them to calcification-prone environments, thus failing to achieve ideal clinical application.MethodsDecellularization was performed using surfactants Triton X-100, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) to remove cellular membrane phospholipid fragments. Sodium bisulfite (SBS) was then used to neutralize unbound aldehyde groups. Finally, the treated tissue was stored in a 75% glycerol solution. A series of biomechanical properties of the treated bovine pericardium were evaluated in vitro, and its anti-calcification properties were assessed through a 6-month in vivo implantation study using a sheep model.ResultsCompared with the glutaraldehyde-treated control group, the tissues treated with the new comprehensive anti-calcification method showed no significant changes in tensile strength or elongation at break. Additionally, no adverse effects on coagulation or hemolysis were observed, and the use of surfactants showed no significant cytotoxicity. Subcutaneous implantation in rats and mitral valve implantation in sheep model showed significantly improved anti-calcification performance compared to the glutaraldehyde control group.ConclusionThis study proposes a comprehensive anti-calcification treatment method, which includes removing cellular debris, reducing phospholipids, neutralizing residual aldehyde groups, and storing the tissue in glycerol. This approach offered a new avenue for further research in the field and significant potential for clinical application.

AB  - BACKGROUND Aphids have been mainly controlled by traditional chemical insecticides, resulting in unamiable risk to the environment over the last decades. Push-pull strategy is regarded as a promising eco-friendly approach for aphid management through repelling aphid away and attracting their natural enemy. Methyl salicylate (MeSA), one of typical HIPVs (herbivore-induced plant volatiles), can repel aphids and attract ladybugs. Our previous studies discovered a new lead compound 3e, a salicylate-substituted carboxyl (E)-beta-farnesene derivative that had effective aphid-repellent activity. However, whether 3e has attractive activity to ladybug like MeSA is unknown. Meanwhile, to discover a new derivative for both deterring aphid and recruiting ladybug is meaningful for green control of aphids. RESULTS Through the structural optimization of 3e, 14 new derivatives were designed and synthesized. Among them, compounds 4e and 4i had good aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) repellent activity, and compounds 3e, 4e and 4i had significant ladybug (Harmonia axyridis) attractive activity to males. Particularly, 4i exhibited manifest attractive effect on the females as well. Binding mechanism showed that 4i not only bound effectively with the aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) target ApisOBP9 thanks to its multiple hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen-bond, but also had strong binding affinity with ladybug target HaxyOBP15 due to the suitable steric space. Additionally, 4i displayed low toxicity to bee Apis mellifera. CONCLUSION Compound 3e does exhibit attractive activity to male ladybug as MeSA. However, the new derivative 4i, with both pleasant aphid-repellent and ladybug-attraction activities, can be considered as a novel potential push-pull candidate for aphid control in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Chronic stress exposure during adolescence is a significant risk factor for the development of depression. Chronic social defeat (CSD) in rodents is an animal model of depression with excellent ethological, predictive, discriminative, and face validity. Because the CSD model has not been thoroughly examined as a model of stress-induced depression within the adolescence stage, the present study analyzed the short- and long-term behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of CSD during early adolescence. Therefore, adolescent male Swiss-Webster (SW) mice were exposed to the CSD model from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND37. Twenty-four hours (mid-adolescence) or 4 weeks (early adulthood) later, mice were tested in two models of depression; the social interaction test (SIT) and forced swimming test (FST); cognitive deficits were evaluated in the Barnes maze (BM). Finally, corticosterone and testosterone content was measured before, during, and after CSD exposure, and serotonin transporter (SERT) autoradiography was studied after CSD in adolescent and adult mice. CSD during early adolescence induced enduring depression-like behaviors as inferred from increased social avoidance and immobility behavior in the SIT and FST, respectively, which correlated in an age-dependent manner with SERT binding in the hippocampus; CSD during early adolescence also induced long-lasting learning and memory impairments in the Barnes maze (BM). Finally, CSD during early adolescence increased serum corticosterone levels in mid-adolescence and early adulthood and delayed the expected increase in serum testosterone levels observed at this age. In conclusion: (1) CSD during early adolescence induced long-lasting depression-like behaviors, (2) sensitivity of SERT density during normal brain development was revealed, (3) CSD during early adolescence induced enduring cognitive deficits, and (4) results highlight the vulnerability of the adolescent brain to social stressors on the adrenal and gonadal axes, which emphasizes the importance of an adequate interaction between both axes during adolescence for normal development of brain and behavior.

AB  - The leftover vegetable oils after frying of food at higher temperature is toxic to environment as diminutive of technologies for proper disposal and reuse of waste cooking oil. An highly water soluble and emulsifier-free phosphorylated fatliquor with the emulsion stability of more than 60 min from economically cheap deep fried oils on transesterification with highly biodegradable ecologically innocuous and water soluble Poly (ethylene glycol) with p-Toluene Sulphonic acid followed by phosphorylation produces highly water dispersible and stable material for leather applications. The synthesised phosphorylated fatliquors were ascertained for the lubrication of collagen fibres and fibre splitting of goat skin by SEM analysis. The transesterification has confirmed by FT-IR, fat composition oils, COD, BOD, total solid in spent liquor were analysed. Physical characteristics of leathers were analysed by tensile strength, tear strength, elongation and quality assessments by hand evaluation by experts. Acid, iodine, saponification values, particle size of phosphorylated fatliquors, surface wettability, thermal stability of leathers were analysed and the properties compared. The finding can assist an emulsifier-free lubricating process significantly as currently available leather chemicals.

AB  - Plants respond to attacks by insects by releasing herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), which are known to influence the behavior of natural enemies, conspecific and heterospecific insects. However, little is known about how HIPVs induced by one insect species influence the behavior of an allospecific insect species, particularly if these insects belong to different feeding guilds. Here, using the interaction of two co-occurring insects with different feeding guilds - Bemisia tabaci (a sap sucking insect) and Tuta absoluta (a leaf mining insect) - on potato plants, we report that T. absoluta significantly preferred potato plants infested by B. tabaci. This preference is attributed to the B. tabaci-induced potato plant volatiles. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis further revealed notable alterations in volatile composition between B. tabaci-infested and uninfested plants. Additionally, gas chromatography coupled with electroantennogram detector (GC-EAD) analysis identified four compounds - undecane, beta-caryophyllene, beta-farnesene and germacrene D - in B. tabaci-induced potato plant volatiles that elicited responses from T. absoluta antennae. Our findings emphasize how B. tabaci infestation alters potato plant volatile composition, making them attractive to T. absoluta. Understanding the chemical ecology interactions between allospecific insects with different feeding guilds is crucial for understanding how different insect groups affect the host location of one another through HIPVs. This knowledge can contribute to the development of more effective pest management strategies against these economically important pests.

AB  - Simple Summary Nematodirus has a serious impact on the gastrointestinal health of ruminants and the economic development of animal husbandry. This study investigated Nematodirus infections of different rearing patterns in sheep in two well-known natural pastures in Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicated that the average infection rate was more than 50%. Then, a naturally occurring strain of Nematodirus was obtained by using numerous isolation methods. We recorded the detailed development process of the nematode eggs and tested for drug resistance, and the results showed that the isolated strains were found to be ivermectin-resistant strains. Our study provides useful data for the morphological study of Nematodirus and the prevention and control of nematodes, offering valuable species resources for studying anthelmintic resistance in nematodes. Nematodirus causes major economic losses in the development of the livestock industry, as they are common gastrointestinal parasites of cattle, sheep, and other ruminants. The present study investigated Nematodirus infections in sheep in the Hulunbuir and Xilingol Grasslands, two well-known natural pastures in Inner Mongolia, China. The results indicated that the average infection rate was more than 50%. Furthermore, a naturally occurring strain of Nematodirus was obtained using numerous isolation methods in the survey region. Conventional morphology and molecular biology were used to identify the strain. The larval migration inhibition test was used to determine the ivermectin level in the isolated strain. The results indicated that the larvae belonged to the species Nematodirus oiratianus. The strain was found to be ivermectin-resistant. Thus, these results recorded the detailed development processes of Nematodirus eggs, providing novel insights regarding the prevention and control of nematodes by using conventional anthelmintic regimens and by offering valuable species resources for studying anthelmintic resistance in nematodes.

AB  - Maturation of follicles is the primary condition for the initiation of puberty, and excessive apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs) will hinder the normal development of follicles in pigs. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 4 (STAT4) plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the mechanism of DNA methylation regulating STAT4 transcription and affecting follicle development in pigs remains unclear. To resolve this problem, we constructed a STAT4 overexpression vector and interference fragment to explore the effects of STAT4 on GC function and investigate the effects of changes in methylation status of the STAT4 promoter region on cell function and kisspeptin-1 (KISS1) expression, as well as the STAT4 effects on the development of the follicles of pigs and mice in vitro. We found that the expression of STAT4 decreased, while DNA methylation of the STAT4 promoter region increased with the growth of the follicles. After overexpression of STAT4, the apoptosis of GCs was increased but the proliferation, cell cycle and estrogen secretion of GCs were inhibited. When GCs were treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-Aza-CdR), the methylation of the STAT4 promoter region decreased, resulting in a significant increase in the expression of STAT4. Consequently, the expression of KISS1 was inhibited. At the same time, the expressions of genes related to cell proliferation, cell cycle and estrogen secretion signaling pathways decreased, while the expressions of genes related to the apoptosis signaling pathway increased. After infection with the STAT4 lentiviral vector (LV-STAT4) in follicles of mice, the expression of STAT4 in ovaries of mice significantly increased, and the expression of KISS1 was significantly decreased. The capillaries on the surface of follicles were constricted, the age of puberty onset in mice was delayed while the levels of GnRH, LH, FSH and E2 in serum were decreased. In conclusion, we found that reduced methylation status of the STAT4 promoter region promoted the transcription of STAT4 and then inhibited the expression of KISS1, as well as promoted the apoptosis of GCs and ultimately inhibited the normal development of follicles in mammals.

AB  - There is a growing concern about the genetic determinism of resilience and its possible implementation in breeding programs. The objective of our study was to elaborate novel resilience indicators in growing pigs based on the deviation from the expected growth curve and the increment of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin (HP) after applying a common vaccine. A total of 445 pigs were vaccinated with an attenuated Aujeszky vaccine at 12 weeks of age. Deviation from the expected body weight (Delta BW) given the growth curve of unvaccinated pigs at 28 days post-vaccination (DPV) and the increment of HP at 4 DPV (Delta HP) were suggested as resilience indicators. Challenged pigs that maintained their productivity and had a minor activation of HP were deemed resilient, whereas pigs that had low increment BW values and a high activation of HP were deemed susceptible. Pigs were also classified based on increment BW and increment HP relative to the expected BW at 28 DPV and to the basal level of HP, respectively. The concordance was high between both methods, indicating that Delta BW and Delta HP are not sensitive to the animal's expected BW nor the basal level of HP. The heritability estimates were moderate for increment BW (0.33) and low-to-moderate for increment HP (0.16). Our study suggests Delta BW and Delta HP as novel resilience indicators in pigs. The suggested indicators capture different aspects of resilience, are easy to measure, and are genetically controlled. Thus, they may be improved through selective breeding. Further analyses are needed to validate our findings.

AB  - Quercetin is a key flavonol in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) with various health benefits, and it often occurs in the form of glucosides. The roles of quercetin and its glucosylated forms in plant defense are generally not well-studied, and remain unknown in the defense of tea. Here, we found higher contents of quercetin glucosides and a decline of the aglucone upon Ectropis grisescens (E. grisescens) infestation of tea. Nine UGTs were strongly induced, among which UGT89AC1 exhibited the highest activity toward quercetin in vitro and in vivo. The mass of E. grisescens larvae that fed on plants with repressed UGT89AC1 or varieties with lower levels of UGT89AC1 was significantly lower than that of larvae fed on controls. Artificial diet supplemented with quercetin glucoside also reduced the larval growth rate, whereas artificial diet supplemented with free quercetin had no significant effect on larval growth. UGT89AC1 was located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its expression was modulated by JA, JA-ILE, and MeJA. These findings demonstrate that quercetin glucosylation serves a defensive role in tea against herbivory. Our results also provide novel insights into the ecological relevance of flavonoid glycosides under biotic stress in plants.

AB  - The environmental quality of the outdoor, as well as the health of people and animals, might be impacted by the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), NH3, and H2S from pig houses. The amount of study on the features of VOC and smell emission from pig fattening process locations is rather limited, and the assessment of the primary odor-causing compounds and health hazards is unclear; inadequate investigation has been done for the generation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. In this study, a portable odor meter was employed to measure odor levels and analyze the sources of odor at four different locations within the pigsty. Specific VOCs were collected using a Suma tank to determine the magnitude of odor, assess the formation of SOA and OFP, and evaluate associated health risks. Furthermore, online monitoring sensors were utilized to detect fluctuations in TVOC, H2S, and NH3 concentrations. Results showed that TVOC emissions outside the house were prominent in November and January, while inside the house, they were concentrated in December, with a maximum of 60,000 mu g center dot m-3, with an overall decreasing trend. H2S emissions were low, almost zero, and NH3 emissions showed a stable trend throughout the season, with a peak of 29.3 mu g center dot m-3 in mid-January. A total of 36 VOCs were detected, with the highest concentrations of acetaldehyde and undecane at 34.5 and 34.8 mu g center dot m-3, respectively, and the main odor-causing substances were acetaldehyde, NH3, and H2S; OFP contributed most to acetaldehyde and SOA contributed most to aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes. This research endeavor establishes a scientifically grounded framework for mitigating malodors and determining an optimal treatment methodology.

AB  - After exposure to cold stress, animals enhance the production of beige adipocytes and expedite thermogenesis, leading to improved metabolic health. Although brown adipose tissue in rodents is primarily induced by beta 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) stimulation, the activation of major beta-adrenergic receptors (ADRBs) in pigs has been a topic of debate. To address this, we developed overexpression vectors for ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3 and silenced the expression of these receptors to observe their effects on the adipogenic differentiation stages of porcine preadipocytes. Our investigation revealed that cold stress triggers the transformation of subcutaneous white adipose tissue to beige adipose tissue in pigs by modulating adrenergic receptor levels. Meanwhile, we found that ADRB3 promotes the transformation of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes. Notably, ADRB3 enhances the expression of beige adipose tissue marker genes, consequently influencing cellular respiration and metabolism by regulating lipolysis and mitochondrial expression. Therefore, ADRB3 may serve as a pivotal gene in animal husbandry and contribute to the improvement of cold intolerance in piglets.

AB  - Monitoring the weight of fattening pigs represents a fundamental requirement for efficient livestock management. While traditional weight measurement approaches have demonstrated operational limitations in largescale farming environments, computer vision-based estimation methods have faced accuracy challenges due to the variability in pig postures. This study introduces the Cascade Vision Detection Algorithm for Monitoring Fattening Pig Weight (CVDA-MFPW), which integrates four complementary methodological components into a comprehensive end-to-end weight monitoring pipeline: Cascaded Visual Detection for systematic image processing, Posture-Based Quality Screening for automated pose assessment, Point Cloud-Based Morphometric Feature Extraction for precise measurement acquisition, and Morphological Feature-Based Weight Estimation for accurate prediction. The research methodology leveraged a dataset comprising 117 fattening pigs, yielding 17,406 samples for instance segmentation and 6,048 samples for keypoint recognition and morphological feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the RTM-Det instance segmentation algorithm achieved robust performance metrics, with average precision rates of 94.69% and 91.84% for bounding boxes and masks respectively. The RTM-Pose keypoint detection system exhibited strong accuracy with a 90.59% average precision rate. Edge deployment evaluation revealed particularly favorable outcomes within the high posture score range (66-100), achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.53, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.08, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.63%, with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.82. The system demonstrated consistent performance across different hardware platforms, with inference times of 7.85 and 22.18 s on varying configurations, suggesting feasibility for deployment in commercial livestock management systems.

AB  - Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions-called embodied decisions-that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to "change mind" between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference-a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings - namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

AB  - Heavy metals are major environmental pollutants that affect organisms across different trophic levels. Herbivorous insects play an important role in the bioaccumulation, and eventually, biomagnification of these metals. Although effects of heavy metal stress on insects have been well-studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects remain poorly understood. Here, we used the RNA-Seq profiling and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approaches to unravel these mechanisms in the polyphagous pest Spodoptera litura exposed to lead (Pb) at two different concentrations (12.5 and 100 mg Pb/kg; PbL and PbH, respectively). Altogether, 1392 and 1630 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 58, 114 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in larvae exposed to PbL and PbH, respectively. After exposed to PbL, the main up regulated genes clusters and proteins in S. litura larvae were associated with their metabolic processes, including carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, but the levels of cytochrome P450 associated with the pathway of xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism were found to be decreased. In contrast, the main up regulated genes clusters and proteins in larvae exposed to PbH were enriched in the metabolism of xenobiotic by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and other drug metabolism enzymes, while the down regulated genes and proteins were found to be closely related to the lipid (lipase) and protein (serine protease, trypsin) metabolism and growth processes (cuticular protein). These findings indicate that S. litura larvae exposed to PbL could enhance food digestion and absorption to prioritize for growth rather than detoxification, whereas S. litura larvae exposed to PbH reduced food digestion and absorption and channelized the limited energy for detoxification rather than growth. These contrasting results explain the dose-dependent effects of heavy metal stress on insect life-history traits, wherein low levels of heavy metal stress induce stimulation, while high levels of heavy metal stress cause inhibition at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

AB  - Background Tea (Camellia sinensis L) has efficient aluminum (Al) accumulation mechanisms, Al accumulation in different tea varieties is affected by the distribution of Al fractions in soil. However, little is known about the changes in Al fractions based on the aggregates in soils of different tea varieties. Methods The distribution of Al fractions in aggregates collected from soils planted with four tea varieties (C. sinensis 'Fuding Dabaicha' (FD), Chuancha No. 3 (CC3), Chuanmu No. 217 (CM217) and Chuannong Huangyazao (CN)) was investigated by continuous extraction method. Results Results showed significant differences in the distributions of Al fractions among the soils. The FD soil had the highest organic matter-bound Al (Or-Al) concentration, which was related to its high proportion of > 5 mm aggregates and the high Or-Al concentration in the > 5 mm aggregates. The CC3 soil had the highest concentrations of total aluminum (T-Al), water-soluble aluminum (Ws-Al) and exchangeable aluminum (Ex-Al), and the accumulation of T-Al, Ws-Al and Ex-Al depended on the highest concentrations of T-Al, Ws-Al and Ex-Al in the > 5 mm and < 0.25 mm aggregates among the four soils. Therefore, these differences in the Al fraction distributions among the soils were related to the changes in soil aggregate compositions and the aggregate-associated Al fractions. Conclusions This study helps elucidate the mechanisms of Al sequestration, and provides evidence for developing appropriate management plans to prevent an increase in Al concentrations in the soils of CC3 and FD by adjusting the soil aggregate composition and the Al concentration of aggregates.

AB  - Most research that has been done regarding Steller sea lions (SSLs; Eumetopias jubatus) has been during the breeding season. Adult SSLs are known to have high among-year breeding-season site fidelity, typically with movement away from breeding-season locations during non-breeding seasons. Using non-breeding-season sighting data of permanently marked SSLs from four areas in Alaska and broad-scale breeding-season sightings, we estimated among-year non-breeding-season site fidelity (i.e., the probability a SSL moves from its breeding-season location to a specific non-breeding-season area). Some SSLs, especially females, have high site fidelity to non-breeding-season areas; fidelity is markedly lower for males. We found no evidence that site fidelity varied among natal rookeries, but our sample sizes were relatively small, possibly limiting our ability to determine such effects. With our estimates of non-breeding-season site fidelity, coupled with previously demonstrated breeding-season site fidelity, we concluded that SSLs should be considered partial migrants (i.e., migratory behavior exhibited by only some individuals in a population) with at least some individual SSLs, particularly females, exhibiting migratory behavior.

AB  - The pituitary is a vital endocrine organ for synthesis and secretion of gonadotropic hormones (FSH and LH), and the gonadotropin showed fluctuations in animals with different fecundity. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as regulatory factors for the reproductive process. However, the profiles of lncRNAs and their roles involved in sheep fecundity remains unclear. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing for the sheep pituitary gland associated with different fecundity, and identified a novel candidate lncRNA LOC105613571 targeting BDNF related to gonadotropin secretion. Our results showed that expression of lncRNA LOC105613571 and BDNF could be significantly upregulated by GnRH stimulation in sheep pituitary cells in vitro. Notably, either lncRNA LOC105613571 or BDNF silencing inhibited cell proliferation while promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, lncRNA LOC105613571 knockdown could also downregulate gonadotropin secretion via inactivation AKT, ERK and mTOR pathway. In addition, co-treatment with GnRH stimulation and lncRNA LOC105613571 or BDNF knockdown showed the opposite effect on sheep pituitary cells in vitro. In summary, BDNF-binding lncRNA LOC105613571 in sheep regulates pituitary cell proliferation and gonadotropin secretion via the AKT/ERK-mTOR pathway, providing new ideas for the molecular mechanisms of pituitary functions.

AB  - The destruction of periodontal alveolar bone (AB) caused by periodontitis is regarded as one of the major reasons for tooth loss. The inhibition of bone resorption and regeneration of lost AB are the desirable outcomes in clinical practice but remain in challenge. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is one current approach for achieving true restoration of AB defects (ABD). Antler stem cells (AnSC) are capable of renewing a huge mammalian bony appendage, the deer antler, suggesting an unparalleled potential for bone regeneration. Herein, we investigated the effectiveness of deer AnSCs conditioned medium (CM, AnSC-CM) for repair of surgically-created ABD using a rat model and sought to define the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that AnSC-CM effectively induced regeneration of AB tissue; the outcome was significantly better than human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell conditioned medium (hBMSC-CM). AnSC-CM treatment upregulated osteogenic factors and downregulated osteoclastic differentiation factors; stimulated proliferation, migration and differentiation of resident MSCs toward osteogenic lineage cells; modulated macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and suppressed osteoclastogenesis. That AnSC-CM resulted in better outcomes than hBMSC-CM in treating ABD was attributed to the cell compatibility as both AnSCs and AB tissue are neural crest-derived. In conclusion, the effects of AnSC-CM on AB tissue regeneration were achieved through both promotion of osteogenesis and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. We believe that AnSC-CM is a candidate for effective treatment of ABD in dental clinical practice but will require investment in further development.

AB  - Simple Summary Indigenous Tswana sheep are an important agricultural resource that largely contribute to the economic, socio-cultural and spiritual aspects of resource-poor farmers. Therefore, as was the aim of this study, exploring and describing the production system in which they are raised, their management including breeding practices is thus crucial to inform researchers, farmers, and policymakers on the formulation of sustainable improvement strategies, sustainable utilization and conservation of these vital animal genetic resources. In the southern part of Botswana, indigenous Tswana sheep are mostly kept by single males aged 51-60 mostly with primary and secondary levels of education. Most Tswana sheep are kept for cash generation through sales, followed by meat consumption and ceremonial obligations, especially in the southern district. Most farmers across districts castrate their young rams at over 3 months of age and most farmers rely on natural pastures for feeding. Feed supplementation is conducted mostly during the dry season while no supplementation is generally practiced during the wet season as there is plenty of palatable forage. Most farmers prefer Tswana rams over exotic breeds because of their ability to survive and reproduce under the Botswana harsh environment. This information is crucial in the formulation of sustainable improvement strategies. The aim of this study was to describe the indigenous Tswana sheep production systems, their management and farmers' preferred selection traits when selecting breeding rams in four southern districts of Botswana. A total of 105 households; Kgatleng (n = 30), Kweneng (n = 27), southern (n = 24) and south-east (n = 24) districts were interviewed using structured questionnaire. An index-based approach was used to rank farmers' most preferred traits for their production systems. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The Chi-square test was used to assess the statistical significance among categorical variables. The results indicated that indigenous Tswana sheep are mainly kept by males, single people, aged between 51 and 60 years possessing primary and secondary education. Management practices across the districts include castration, health care and supplementation mostly during the dry season. Superior fitness traits of indigenous Tswana rams over exotic rams were considered more important when selecting breeding rams in Kgatleng, Kweneng and south-east while in the southern district, rams were mainly selected based on body size. Most farmers kept breeding rams while those who did not keep rams depended on communal rams for service. This information is important in designing successful breeding programs and strategies for the conservation and sustainable utilization of indigenous Tswana sheep genetic resources.

AB  - Research on C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) has been widely reported for humans and select animal species, yet immune reagents are limited for pig chemokines. Our goal is to provide veterinary immunologists and the biomedical community with new commercial immune reagents and standardized assays. Recombinant porcine CXCL10 (rPoCXCL10) protein was produced by yeast expression and used to generate a panel of alpha CXCL10 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). All mAbs were assessed for cross-inhibition and reactivity to orthologous yeast expressed CXCL10 proteins. Characterization of a panel of nine alpha PoCXCL10 mAbs identified six distinct antigenic determinants. A sensitive quantitative sandwich ELISA was developed with anti-PoCXCL10-1.6 and -1.9 mAb; reactivity was verified with both rPoCXCL10 and native PoCXCL10, detected in supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with rPoIFN gamma or PMA/Ionomycin. Immunostaining of in vitro rPoIFN gamma stimulated pig spleen and blood cells verified CXCL10 + cells as CD3-CD4-CD172+, with occasional CD3-CD4 + CD172 + subsets. Comparison studies determined that alpha PoCXCL10-1.4 mAb was the ideal mAb clone for intracellular staining, whereas with alpha PoCXCL10-1.1 and -1.2 mAbs were best for immunohistochemistry analyses. These techniques and tools will be useful for evaluating swine immune development, responses to infectious diseases and vaccines, as well as for improving utility of pigs as an important biomedical model.

AB  - Simple Summary Different types of endoparasites are present in small ruminants, especially in sheep. One of the most important parasites are the gastrointestinal nematodes (Trichostrongylidae). Emaciation, anorexia, decreased productivity, and diarrhea are observed in infected animals. These infections cause great economic damage to sheep owners through production losses and treatment costs. In connection with the frequent treatment of sheep against endoparasite infections, anthelmintic resistance has developed. Due to the global anthelmintic resistance situation, the principles of parasite control have changed. New alternatives have been sought, and one of the most researched alternatives is phytotherapy. Different plants with anthelmintic activity would be valuable for the control of ruminant helminths. Phytotherapy would reduce the use of synthetic drugs and reduce treatment costs. Due to the high prevalence of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep, the growing anthelmintic resistance, and the development of organic farming systems, sustainable alternatives are being sought. One such method is phytotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro ovicidal and larvicidal activity of extracts of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) growing in Latvia on gastrointestinal nematodes (Trichostrongylidae) in sheep. The leaves and flowers of the tansy were extracted separately in 70%, 50%, and 30% ethanol and acetone. Six concentrations were prepared from each extract 500 mg/mL, 200 mg/mL, 100 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. In vitro egg hatching test and micro-agar larval development test were performed. Extracts of tansy have strong larvicidal activity. The highest percentage of larvae inhibition for most of the extracts was 100%, but for egg inhibition, it was 95.8% for the 200 mg/mL concentration of 50% acetone and 93.3% for the 500 mg/mL concentration of 50% ethanol leaf extracts. All tansy extracts had ovicidal and larvicidal activity against Trichostrongylidae in sheep.

AB  - Simple Summary Rye and rapeseed meal can be alternative feed components for weaner piglets instead of wheat and soybean meal. Both components can help to meet current challenges in pig nutrition, such as increasingly dry weather conditions and the high amount of imported soybean. Since they contain more and differently composed fiber, effects on digestive physiology and intestinal microbiota might help to maintain gut health and prevent post-weaning diarrhea. This study shows that despite a similar composition of the large intestinal microbiota, the higher amount and solubility of complex carbohydrates from rye lead to a higher fermentative activity compared to wheat, which is considered a beneficial effect. The high amount of insoluble dietary fiber in rapeseed-based diets lowered bacterial metabolic activity and caused a shift toward insoluble fiber degrading bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the effect of fiber-rich rye and rapeseed meal (RSM) compared to wheat and soybean meal (SBM) on fiber digestibility and the composition and metabolic activity of intestinal microbiota. At weaning, 88 piglets were allocated to four feeding groups: wheat/SBM, wheat/RSM, rye/SBM, and rye/RSM. Dietary inclusion level was 48% for rye and wheat, 25% for SBM, and 30% for RSM. Piglets were euthanized after 33 days for collection of digesta and feces. Samples were analyzed for dry matter and non-starch-polysaccharide (NSP) digestibility, bacterial metabolites, and relative abundance of microbiota. Rye-based diets had higher concentrations of soluble NSP than wheat-based diets. RSM-diets were higher in insoluble NSP compared to SBM. Rye-fed piglets showed a higher colonic and fecal digestibility of NSP (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). RSM-fed piglets showed a lower colonic and fecal digestibility of NSP than SBM-fed piglets (p < 0.001). Rye increased jejunal and colonic concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) compared to wheat (p < 0.001, p = 0.016, respectively). RSM-fed pigs showed a lower jejunal concentration of SCFA (p = 0.001) than SBM-fed pigs. Relative abundance of Firmicutes was higher (p = 0.039) and of Proteobacteria lower (p = 0.002) in rye-fed pigs compared to wheat. RSM reduced Firmicutes and increased Actinobacteria (jejunum, colon, feces: p < 0.050), jejunal Proteobacteria (p = 0.019) and colonic Bacteroidetes (p = 0.014). Despite a similar composition of the colonic microbiota, the higher amount and solubility of NSP from rye resulted in an increased fermentative activity compared to wheat. The high amount of insoluble dietary fiber in RSM-based diets reduced bacterial metabolic activity and caused a shift toward insoluble fiber degrading bacteria. Further research should focus on host-microbiota interaction to improve feeding concepts with a targeted use of dietary fiber.

AB  - Forest loss and habitat fragmentation threaten Asian elephants by isolating populations, hindering species movement, disconnecting habitat patches, and changing ecological processes. Constructing ecological corridors are considered critical initiatives to conserve Asian elephants by restoring and strengthening connectivity. Although most studies effectively assess habitat suitability for elephants and identify potential conflict areas with humans, they often fall short of utilizing this information to create effective ecological corridors. Therefore, this study aims to determine the potential ecological corridors by considering the conflict area and suitability of Asian elephant habitat in Jeli, Kelantan. In this study, habitat suitability was developed using MaxEnt software, considering seven variables, where distance from the river was identified as the highest contribution to the habitat suitability of Asian elephants, followed by elevation and LULC. The habitat suitability map was then converted to a landscape resistance map, which was used to predict the potential ecological corridors for Asian elephants. The circuit theory and least-cost path were integrated using the Circuitscape software to identify a suitable corridor for Asian elephants. The habitat suitability analysis shows that only 15 % of the study area is suitable for elephants. 50 % of the area is unsuitable because it is far from water sources. The corridor analysis shows that ten suitable corridors were constructed in this study. The longest corridor is 1705 m, while the shortest is 230 m. Thus, suitable habitat conditions, well-connected and well-designed corridors are crucial for elephant populations to survive in a fragmented landscape, mitigate human conflicts, and encourage sustainable and harmonious coexistence.

AB  - Central glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity is enhanced following traumatic events, playing a key role in the stress-related cognitive abnormalities of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). GR antagonists are expected to have potential as pharmacological agents to treat PTSD-related symptoms such as anxiety and fear memory disruption. However, an incubation period is usually required and stress-induced abnormalities do not develop immediately following the trauma; thus, the optimal intervention timing should be considered. Single prolonged stress (SPS) was employed as a rodent PTSD model to examine the effects of early or late (1-7 versus 8-14 days after the SPS) sub-chronic RU486 (a GR antagonist) administration. Behaviorally, fear conditioning and anxiety behavior were assessed using the fear-conditioning test and elevated T-maze (ETM), respectively. Neurochemically, the expressions of GR, FK506-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FKBP4 and FKBP5), and early growth response-1 (Egr-1) were assessed in the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hypothalamus, together with the level of plasma corticosterone. Early RU486 administration could inhibit SPS-induced behavioral abnormalities and glucocorticoid system dysregulation by reversing the SPS-induced fear extinction deficit, and preventing SPS-reduced plasma corticosterone levels and SPS-induced Egr-1 overexpression in the hippocampus. Early RU486 administration following SPS also increased the FKBP5 level in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. Finally, both early and late RU486 administration inhibited the elevated hippocampal FKBP4 level and hypothalamus GR level in the SPS rats. Early intervention with a GR antagonist aids in the correction of traumatic stress-induced fear and anxiety dysregulation.

AB  - Simple Summary: MicroRNAs play crucial roles in regulating adipogenesis and fat storage; their role in regulating castrated male pig adipose growth is worth elucidating. Four nine-fold differentially expressed miRNAs were selected to investigate their functions on the regulation of adipose development based on our previous study. In 3T3-L1 cells and backfat tissues of castrated and intact male pigs, miR-F4-C12 was identified as involved in the adipose development using qRT-PCR and oil O staining. PIK3R1 was proposed by the TargetScan, miRDB and starBase as a target of miR-F4-C12 and verified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot. These results revealed that miR-F4-C12 may regulate adipose accumulation in castrated male pigs by targeting PIK3R1. Our data provide a valuable foundation to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in adipose tissue metabolism to castration-induced sex hormone deficiency.
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute small regulatory molecules for a wide array of biological activities (18 similar to 24 nucleotides in length), including adipogenesis and adipose deposition. Their effect is, however, incompletely defined in inducing fat accumulation in castrated male pigs. Based on our study, four nine-times miRNAs were selected to examine their functions in adipose formation activities. In 3T3-L1 cells and backfat tissues of castrated and intact male pigs, miR-F4-C12 was identified as a factor in adipose development utilizing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Further, miR-F4-C12 was identified to promote fat development, suggesting that miR-F4-C12 was involved in adipogenesis. Moreover, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) was proposed by the TargetScan, miRDB and starBase as a target of miR-F4-C12 and verified through a two-luciferase reporter assay. The over-expression of miR-F4-C12 dramatically decreases the PIK3R1 protein level in 3T3-L1 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of PIK3R1 in castrated pigs are reduced relative to intact pigs, providing further evidence that PIK3R1 is involved in regulating adipose accumulation. These results suggest that miR-F4-C12 involves adipose development and may regulate subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation by targeting PIK3R1 in castrated male pigs.

AB  - Background The elemental defense hypothesis states a new defensive strategy that hyperaccumulators defense against herbivores or pathogens attacks by accumulating heavy metals. Brassica juncea has an excellent ability of cadmium (Cd) accumulation. However, the elemental defense effect and its regulation mechanism in B. juncea remain unclear. Results In this study, we profiled the elemental defense effect and the molecular regulatory mechanism in Cd-accumulated B. juncea after Alternaria brassicicola infection. B. juncea treated with 180 mg Kg(- 1) DW CdCl2 2.5H(2)O exhibited obvious elemental defense effect after 72 h of infection with A. brassicicola. The expression of some defense-related genes including BjNPR1, BjPR12, BjPR2, and stress-related miRNAs (miR156, miR397, miR398a, miR398b/c, miR408, miR395a, miR395b, miR396a, and miR396b) were remarkably elevated during elemental defense in B. juncea. Conclusions The results indicate that Cd-accumulated B. juncea may defend against pathogens by coordinating salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and elemental defense in a synergistic joint effect. Furthermore, the expression of miRNAs related to heavy metal stress response and disease resistance may regulate the balance between pathogen defense and heavy metal stress-responsive in B. juncea. The findings provide experimental evidence for the elemental defense hypothesis in plants from the perspectives of phytohormones, defense-related genes, and miRNAs.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) content plays an important role in pork quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) implicate various biological processes; however, the regulatory mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in porcine IMF remains elusive. Hence, the study assessed the circRNA expression profiling in the longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs with high (H) and low (L) IMF content to unravel their regulatory functions in improving meat quality. The RNA sequencing analysis identified 29,732 circRNAs from six sampled pigs, most of which were exon-derived. In the muscle, 336 were differentially expressed (DE) between the H and L IMF groups; 196 circRNAs were upregulated, and 140 were downregulated. Subsequent qRT-PCR validation of 10 DE circRNAs revealed expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that most significantly enriched DE circRNAs host genes were linked to lipid metabolism and adipogenesis processes. The circRNA-miRNA regulatory network analysis found several circRNAs targeting miRNAs associated with adipogenesis. Finally, a novel circRNA, circPPARA, was identified with the expression positively correlated with the IMF content. Detailed analysis revealed that circPPARA was formed via head-to-tail splicing and was more stable than the linear PPARA, predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Functional studies using overexpression and siRNA constructs demonstrated that circPPARA promotes differentiation and hinders the proliferation of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes. Moreover, the dual-luciferase assay revealed that circPPARA adsorbed miR-429 and miR-200b, thereby promoting intramuscular adipogenesis in pigs. Our results identified a candidate circRNA, circPPARA, that affects porcine IMF content. The study provides knowledge of the regulatory functions of circRNAs in intramuscular adipogenesis and abundant resource for future research on circRNAs in pigs.

AB  - In life cycle assessments of livestock systems, toxicity-related impacts are not commonly considered or only specific aspects (such as pesticides, manufacturing of inputs) are assessed. In this context, the aim of this study was to define a framework for assessing toxicity-related impacts and to characterize human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity for a livestock product based on applying the state-of-the-art models PestLCI Consensus and USEtox. Furthermore, methodological gaps were discussed and ways forward were suggested. The case study focused on Danish pork production and the toxicity results were reported per kg 'meat' (the parts of pig used for human consumption) leaving the slaughterhouse. The assessment framework included the use of pesticides and heavy metals in feed production, the use of veterinary pharmaceuticals in pig production, and the manufacturing of inputs. The use of cleaning agents could not be assessed with the currently available methods. New characterization factors were calculated for 35 chemicals not available in USEtox. For Danish pork production, feed production was the main contributor to the analyzed toxicity impacts. The use of pesticides was the main driver for organic substances while heavy metal emissions related to the application of pig manure to fields were the hotspot for metal-based substances. The use of veterinary pharmaceuticals contributed only to freshwater ecotoxicity by 3%. PestLCI Consensus estimates were compared with different approaches. The impact of metabolites of pesticides and veterinary pharmaceuticals was assessed and discussed. Methodological gaps and research needs were identified regarding the assessment of pesticides, veterinary pharmaceuticals, metal-based substances, inorganic substances, and combined exposure to multiple chemicals. Better data related to the use and chemical properties of substances are needed to reduce uncertainty in toxicity modeling.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of protein and energy balance in the diet on the reproductive performance at the first lambing of Garut ewes. A completely randomized design was used to test 3 different diet treatments for Garut ewes con-taining various crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) balances, namely GC1 (12.0% CP and 57.0% TDN), GC2 (12.8% CP and 61.7% TDN), and GC3 (13.7% CP and 66.5% TDN). This study involved 29 heads of Garut ewes, aged 20-22 months, with an average body weight of 30.52 +/- 2.20 kg. The collected data were analysed by Duncan's multiple range test. The results showed that different CP and TDN balances in the diet had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on post-partum body weight, CP intake and TDN intake of Garut ewes at first lambing where GC3-treated ewes produced the significantly highest post-partum body weight (40.0 kg), CP intake (114.7 g) and TDN intake (601.7 g). GC3-treated ewes produced more twin lambs with an average lamb crop 1.90. It is suggested that Garut ewes at first lambing to consume a diet containing 13.7% CP and 66.5% TDN balance to increase their post-partum body weights and produced more twin lambs.

AB  - The outbreak of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. represents a devastating epidemic that severely affects oil tea (Camellia oleifera) production in China. However, the unknown resistance mechanism to anthracnose in C. oleifera has impeded the progress of breeding disease-resistant varieties. In this study, we investigated the physiological responses of resistant and susceptible lines during C. gloeosporioides infection. Our results showed that the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) in both disease-resistant and susceptible lines increased by C. gloeosporioides infection. Also, disease-resistant lines exhibited lower MDA, but higher POD, SOD, and CAT activities compared to susceptible lines. The accumulation of flavonoids in both resistant and susceptible C. oleifera leaves increased following C. gloeosporioides infection, and the increase was greater in resistant lines. Further, we identified and functionally characterized the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (CoDFR) from the resistant C. oleifera line. We showed that the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of CoDFR is 1044 bp encoding 347 amino acids. The overexpression of CoDFR in tobacco altered the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes, resulting in an increased flavonoid content in leaves. CoDFR transgenic tobacco plants exhibited increased anthracnose resistance. Furthermore, the transgenic plants had higher salicylic acid content. These findings offer potential insights into the pivotal role of CoDFR involved in flavonoid-mediated defense mechanisms during anthracnose invasion in resistant C. oleifera.

AB  - To enhance the sorption efficiency of heavy metals by modified biochar, biochars derived from pig manure at different pyrolyzing temperatures (300 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 700 degrees C) were oxidized and thiolated using H2O2 and 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, respectively. The physicochemical properties of biochars and sorption kinetics, isotherms, and mechanisms for Pb and Cd were studied. Oxidation and thiolation decreased the aromaticity and ash content, and increased the polarity and the specific surface area and pore volume of biochars. Oxidation introduced oxygen-containing functional groups into biochars, and the oxidation reaction took place at C=C bonds. The thiolation of oxidized biochar prepared at moderate-temperature had the highest sulfur content (4.43%) due to that this biochar was rich in oxygen-containing groups, which can act as the active sites for thiol groups loading. Sorption capacity of biochars for heavy metals increased by 2.58-4.22 times with the increase of pyrolyzing temperature, except the original biochar prepared at moderate-temperature, which had the highest Pb sorption capacity. The distribution coefficient of heavy metals onto modified biochars was enhanced by up to 85.4%. Oxidization treatment was more suitable for immobilization of low concentrations of Cd onto low- and moderate-temperatures biochars, while thiolation treatment was more suitable for immobilization of high concentrations of heavy metals. The sorption of heavy metals by biochars occurred via cation exchange, precipitation, cation-pi EDA interactions and complexation. The contribution percentage of complexing with functional groups increased after modification. The results suggest that oxidization and thiolation treatments of animal manure biochars are promising methods for the treatment of heavy metals polluted environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herbivore attack is a major type of biotic stress that greatly affects the development and quality of tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L) O. Kuntze]. Tea plant produces many glycosylated compounds that enhance resistance to herbivores. An example is quercetin, one of the major flavonols of tea plants, which was glycosylated to involve responses to various environmental stresses. However, not much is known about the biosynthesis of glycosylated quercetin derivatives in tea plant in response to herbivorous attack. Here, we found that E. grisescens attack significantly increased the contents of quercetin 3-O-glucoside and quercetin 7-O-glucoside in tea leaves, and exogenous application of these two compounds improved the E. grisescens resistance of tea plant. Integrated transcriptome and phylogenetic analyses identified CsUGT95B11 gene, encoding a quercetin glycosyltransferase, which was upregulated in response to E. grisescens attack. Enzymatic assays showed that CsUGT95B11 preferentially glycosylated quercetin to produce quercetin 7-O-glucoside with a kcat & sdot;Km- 1 value of 9655.52 M- 1 s- 1. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that CsUGT95B11 was dispersed in the cytoplasm of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and Arabidopsis protoplast. Suppression of CsUGT95B11 reduced the quercetin glucoside content of tea leaves and impaired resistance of tea plant to E. grisescens. These results indicate that CsUGT95B11 is a quercetin glycosyltransferase that enhances resistance of tea plant to E. grisescens, providing insights into the mechanism of flavonol glycosylation regulating interactions between plants and herbivores.

AB  - The tribe Junoniini is a predominantly Paleotropical group of the cosmopolitan butterfly subfamily Nymphalinae (Nymphalidae), with highest diversity in the Afrotropical region. Its systematics and relationships are not entirely resolved. Question marks remain concerning the validity of some genera; and the apparently close relationship between the IndoAustralian genus Yoma and the Afrotropical Protogoniomorpha, as evidenced by molecular phylogenies, remains a puzzle. Here, we present a cladistic analysis, based on 42 characters of the male and female genitalia of 41 species of Junoniini belonging to six genera, nearly all of them continental Afrotropical, and 3 species of two Indo-Australian genera Yoma and Rhinopalpa. A ML COI-based tree is produced for 36 species of Afrotropical Junoniini and Yoma. The molecular data are consistent with previous studies. However, morphological analysis does not confirm a close relationship between Protogoniomorpha and Yoma. Despite the evolution of a number of modifications, the male genitalia within all genera and species of the Junoniini share a cohesive build plan, in particular a transformed sacculus, from which Yoma is highly divergent. The position of the genus Kamilla, previously synonymized with Junonia, is discussed. Three East African coast taxa, Junonia elgiva stat. reinst., Protogoniomorpha nebulosa stat. reinst. and Salamis amaniensis stat. reinst., and one from central Africa, Precis silvicola stat. reinst. are raised to species level, based on comparative analysis of their male genitalia.

AB  - Silicon (Si) protects plants against insect herbivores; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Polyamines (PAs) play a crucial role in plant-insect interactions. Here, the involvement of Si in putrescine (Put) metabolism and its role in rice resistance against striped stem borer (SSB, Chilo suppressalis Walker) were investigated. The results showed that SSB larval infestation led to a substantial accumulation of free Put in rice seedlings. Si application increased rice resistance against SSB and repressed the SSB attack-induced accumulation of Put, in parallel with a decreased expression of Put biosynthesis genes encoding arginine decarboxylase (ADC1 and ADC2). Moreover, Si application had no significant effect on the wounding-induced expression of ADC1 and ADC2, but attenuated the further elevation in the transcription of ADC1 and ADC2 induced by SSB larvae oral secretion. Simultaneously, Si addition reduced the Put and spermidine contents in SSB-attacked plants. Furthermore, the exogenous application of Put attenuated Si-enhanced resistance against SSB larvae, whereas exogenous D-arginine, an inhibitor of ADC, showed similar effects to Si on rice resistance against SSB. Our findings indicate that Si improves rice resistance to SSB, at least partly by reducing herbivory-stimulated putrescine accumulation.

AB  - The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, widely regarded to be upregulated in the aging brain. Here we investigated the interaction between aging and TSPO immunomodulatory function in the mouse hippocampus, a region severely affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Surprisingly, we found that TSPO levels were decreased in brain innate immune populations in aging. Aging resulted in a reversal of TSPO knockout transcriptional signatures following inflammatory insult. TSPO deletion drastically exacerbated inflammatory transcriptional responses in the aging hippocampus, while dampening inflammation in the young hippocampus. This age-dependent effect of TSPO was linked to NF-k beta and interferon regulatory transcriptional networks. Drugs that disrupt the cell cycle and induce DNA damage, such as heat shock protein and topoisomerase inhibitors, were identified to mimic the inflammatory transcriptional signature characterizing aging in TSPO knockout mice most closely. These findings indicate that TSPO plays a protective role in brain aging. This TSPO-aging interaction is an important consideration in the interpretation of TSPO-targeted biomarker and therapeutic studies, as well as in vitro studies that cannot model the aging brain.

AB  - Camellia is the largest genus in the family Theaceae. Due to phenotypic diversity, frequent hybridization, and polyploidization, an understanding of the phylogenetic relationships between Camellia species remains challenging. Comparative chloroplast (cp) genomics provides an informative resource for phylogenetic analyses of Camellia. In this study, 12 chloroplast genome sequences from nine Camellia species were determined using Illumina sequencing technology via de novo assembly. The cp genome sizes ranged from 156,545 to 157,021 bp and were organized into quadripartite regions with the typical angiosperm cp genomes. Each genome harbored 87 protein-coding, 37 transfer RNA, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes in the same order and orientation. Differences in long and short sequence repeats, SNPs, and InDels were detected across the 12 cp genomes. Combining with the complete cp sequences of seven other species in the genus Camellia, a total of nine intergenic sequence divergent hotspots and 14 protein-coding genes with high sequence polymorphism were identified. These hotspots, especially the InDel (similar to 400 bp) located in atpH-atpI region, had sufficient potential to be used as barcode markers for further phylogenetic analysis and species identification. Principal component and phylogenetic analysis suggested that regional constraints, rather than functional constraints, strongly affected the sequence evolution of the cp genomes in this study. These cp genomes could facilitate the development of new molecular markers, accurate species identification, and investigations of the phylogenomic relationships of the genus Camellia.

AB  - In this experiment, glucose master liquor and corn steep liquor were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, and Candida utilis was used as a strain to ferment yeast feed. The OD value and number of yeast cells were used as response values to optimize the medium components of the yeast feed through a response surface methodology. The optimal medium components were a glucose master liquor concentration of 8.3%, a corn steep liquor concentration of 1.2%, and a KH2PO4 concentration of 0.14%. Under this condition of fermentation, the OD value was 0.670 and the number of yeast cells was 2.72 x 10(8)/mL. Then, we fed Candida utilis feed to Dongliao black piglets, and the effects of the yeast feed on the piglets' growth performance, fecal microbiota, and plasma metabolic levels were investigated through 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics. In total, 120 black piglets with an average initial weight of 6.90 +/- 1.28 kg were randomly divided into two groups. One group was fed the basic diet (the CON group), and the other was supplemented with 2.5% Candida utilis add to the basic diet (the 2.5% CU group). After a pre-feeding period, the formal experiments were performed for 21 days. The results showed that the addition of Candida utilis to the diet did not affect growth performance compared with the control group. Meanwhile, no significant differences were observed in the serum biochemical indices. However, piglets in the 2.5% CU group had a significantly altered fecal microbiota, with an increased abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Lactobacillus, and Muribaculaceae_unclassified. Regarding the plasma metabolome, the 12 differential metabolites detected were mainly enriched in the histidine, tryptophan, primary bile acid, and caffeine metabolic pathways. Regarding the integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis, differential metabolites correlated with fecal flora to variable degrees, but most of them were beneficial bacteria of Firmicutes. Collectively, dietary Candida utilis feed had no adverse effect on growth performance; however, it played an important role in regulating fecal flora and maintaining metabolic levels.

AB  - Colostrum/Milk is a chief repertoire of antioxidant peptides. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a viable target for Parkinson's Disease (PD), as this pathway deduced to be impaired in PD. Cullin-3 is one of the crucial E3 ligase responsible for its regulation. The present study screened peptide libraries of buffalo colostrum & milk peptides for Cullin-3 inhibition, thus ensuing activation of Nrf2 to alleviate the molecular etiopathology in PD using the C. elegans as a model. The structure was modelled, binding sites analyzed and peptideinteractions analyzed by docking. Among the 55 sequences (<= 1 kDa), the peptide SFVSEVPEL having the highest dock score (-16.919) was synthesized and evaluated for its effects on oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, neurochemical marker and Nrf2/Skn-1 levels. The lead peptide alleviated the oxidative pathophysiology and behavioural deficits associated with PD in C. elegans.

AB  - The present investigation was done to evaluate genetic variability and estimation of genetic parameters of morphological and agro-physiological traits in Camelina sativa (L.) using biometrical genetic techniques. For this purpose, 136 Camelina doubled haploid line genotypes were assessed in a randomized complete blocks design with three replicates in the Field Research, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, during the 2014-2015 cropping season. The results of the analysis of variance showed significant differences between the genotypes for all studied traits. High estimates of genetic gain and broad-sense heritability were observed for the number of pods per plant, the number of pods per main branch plant, and the weight of 1000 seeds indicating high genetic potential, a low effect of environment, and the predominant role of additive gene effect on their expression. The number of pods per plant, biological yield, shoot weight, and pod straw weight showed the highest genetic positive correlation with kernel yield. Some agronomic traits such as the number of pods per plant, the number of pods per main branch plant, biological yield, root weight, shoots weight, pod straw weight and the number of lateral branches showed the highest phenotypic positive correlation with kernel yield. Moreover, the highest genotypic and phenotypic covariance was observed for kernel yield with the number of pods per plant, the number of pods per main branch plant, biological yield, plant height with roots, shoots weight, and length of lateral branch respectively. We observed the highest environmental covariance of kernel yield with biological yield. High coheritability was observed between seed length and root weight, seed length and plant height, the number of pods per lateral branch and the number of seeds per pod, kernel yield and seed length, plant height and weight of 1000 seeds. This suggests the selection of either of the traits would simultaneously affect the others, positively.

AB  - Whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) persists in adult and aged humans continues to be extensively debated. A major question is whether the markers identified in rodents are reliable enough to reveal new neurons and the neurogenic trajectory in primates. Here, to provide a better understanding of AHN in primates and to reveal more novel markers for distinct cell types, droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is used to investigate the cellular heterogeneity and molecular characteristics of the hippocampi in macaques across the lifespan and in aged humans. All of the major cell types in the hippocampus and their expression profiles were identified. The dynamics of the neurogenic lineage was revealed and the diversity of astrocytes and microglia was delineated. In the neurogenic lineage, the regulatory continuum from adult neural stem cells (NSCs) to immature and mature granule cells was investigated. A group of primate-specific markers were identified. We validated ETNPPL as a primate-specific NSC marker and verified STMN1 and STMN2 as immature neuron markers in primates. Furthermore, we illustrate a cluster of active astrocytes and microglia exhibiting proinflammatory responses in aged samples. The interaction analysis and the comparative investigation on published datasets and ours imply that astrocytes provide signals inducing the proliferation, quiescence and inflammation of adult NSCs at different stages and that the proinflammatory status of astrocytes probably contributes to the decrease and variability of AHN in adults and elderly individuals.

AB  - Simple Summary The hippocampus region of birds is a pivotal area for learning and memory. Early-life conditions can have a long-lasting impact on animals. However, the influence of early-life and later-life environments on animals' health and welfare has not been well-studied. This study addresses the impact of early-life enrichment and the later environment on the learning ability and hippocampal responses in chicks. We found that the early-life environmental complexity did not prepare better for learning ability in response to life challenges in the future. This study indicates that perches and litter materials, which enriched early-life conditions, were conducive to improved stress responses later in life in terms of neural- and immune-related gene expression and functional pathways. This can be attributed to the "silver spoon" effect. However, the enrichment through litter materials alone in early life does not improve the hippocampal plasticity in later stressed environments. In addition, early-life barren conditions that match later-life conditions have beneficial impacts on neural development, supporting the match and mismatch theory. This study helps us to understand the relationship between early- and later-life environments from the perspective of animal neural- and immune-related development. It also has the potential to guide the treatment of mental problems and personal health in humans based on the interactions between the early-life and later-life environments. In this study, we hypothesized that complex early-life environments enhance the learning ability and the hippocampal plasticity when the individual is faced with future life challenges. Chicks were divided into a barren environment group (BG), a litter materials group (LG), and a perches and litter materials group (PLG) until 31 days of age, and then their learning abilities were tested following further rearing in barren environments for 22 days. In response to the future life challenge, the learning ability showed no differences among the three groups. In the hippocampal KEGG pathways, the LG chicks showed the downregulation of neural-related genes neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and neurexins (NRXN1) in the cell adhesion molecules pathway compared to the BG (p < 0.05). Immune-related genes TLR2 in Malaria and Legionellosis and IL-18 and IL18R1 in the TNF signaling pathway were upregulated in the LG compared to in the BG (p < 0.05). Compared to the BG, the PLG displayed upregulated TLR2A in Malaria (p < 0.05). The PLG showed upregulated neural-related gene, i.e., neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7-like (CHRNA8) in the nicotine addiction pathway and secretagogin (SCGN) gene expression, as compared to the LG (p < 0.05). In conclusion, early-life environmental complexities had limited effects on the learning ability in response to a future life challenge. Early-life perches and litter materials can improve neural- and immune-related gene expression and functional pathways in the hippocampus of chicks.

AB  - Simple Summary The study assessed anaemia (low haemoglobin levels) due to iron deficiency in new-born lambs and goat kids. Blood samples were taken from lambs and kids under different management systems at one month of age, and those reared indoors and suckling their mothers showed lower haemoglobin levels than those on milk replacer (which is fortified with iron) or those reared outdoors, indicating iron deficiency anaemia. As a follow-up, lambs and kids from those "at-risk" settings were enrolled on a trial injecting iron into half the animals in the first one to eight days of life. Those injected animals showed higher haemoglobin levels at one month of age (i.e., not getting anaemia) than untreated ones, and there was also a trend towards higher growth rates in treated animals, especially in twin lambs. This study aimed to assess iron deficiency anaemia in new-born lambs and goat kids and was carried out in two parts: (1) Twenty blood samples were taken from one-month-old lambs and kids under different systems and were tested for haemoglobin. Three groups of lambs were compared: indoor reared on maternal milk, indoor reared on milk replacer, and outdoor reared on maternal milk. Indoor-reared kids were compared: those fed on maternal milk and fed on milk replacer. Indoor-reared kids and lambs on maternal milk showed significantly lower haemoglobin levels than those on milk replacer or reared outdoors. (2) On farms with indoor-reared lambs or goat kids on maternal milk, an intervention trial was carried out: animals were randomly assigned at 1-8 days of age to either receive 300 mg (lambs) or 150 mg iron (goat kids) as intramuscular iron dextran, and growth rates were compared after one and two months. Haemoglobin levels at one month were also compared in randomly selected animals from both groups. Treated lambs and kids showed higher haemoglobin levels at one month of age and a numerically increased growth rate that was statistically significant for twin lambs. Iron dextran improves haemoglobin levels in these animals and may lead to higher growth rates, especially in twin lambs.

AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are highly dynamic macromolecular protein structures that facilitate molecular exchange across the nuclear envelope. Aberrant NPC functioning has been implicated in neurodegeneration. The translocated promoter region (Tpr) is a critical scaffolding nucleoporin (Nup) of the nuclear basket, facing the interior of the NPC. However, the role of Tpr in adult neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. Using super-resolution (SR) and electron microscopy, we defined the different subcellular localizations of Tpr and phospho-Tpr (P-Tpr) in NSPCs in vitro and in vivo. Elevated Tpr expression and reduced P-Tpr nuclear localization accompany NSPC differentiation along the neurogenic lineage. In 5xFAD mice, an animal model of AD, increased Tpr expression in DCX+ hippocampal neuroblasts precedes increased neurogenesis at an early stage, before the onset of amyloid-beta plaque formation. Whereas nuclear basket Tpr interacts with chromatin modifiers and NSPC-related transcription factors, P-Tpr interacts and co-localizes with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) at the nuclear chromatin of NSPCs. In hippocampal NSPCs in a mouse model of AD, aberrant Tpr expression was correlated with altered NPC morphology and counts, and Tpr was aberrantly expressed in postmortem human brain samples from patients with AD. Thus, we propose that altered levels and subcellular localization of Tpr in CNS disease affect Tpr functionality, which in turn regulates the architecture and number of NSPC NPCs, possibly leading to aberrant neurogenesis.

AB  - We developed a programmable LED array to evaluate different wavelength illumination (UV, blue, green, yellow, amber, and red) and modulation schemes to improve catch rates in insect traps. The device can communicate through Bluetooth (R) with a simple Android app to update the operational settings to facilitate field experiments, including which LEDs to operate, when to operate (always, night only, or predefined intervals after sunset and/or before sunrise), and to change the LED intensities/modulation during operation. We used the devices to evaluate different wavelengths to improve catches in traps for coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus) in the field, as well as to evaluate lighting preferences of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP; Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). In both cases, insects were most strongly attracted to constant UV illumination. However, CRB avoided traps with any "visible" wavelength LEDs placed in panels of traps, while ACP was moderately attracted to blue, yellow, and amber. For CRB, UV illumination of cups at the bottom of panel traps reduced catch rates compared to UV illumination higher in the panels of traps, consistent with observations of dorsal orientation towards light observed by other researchers in nocturnal beetles and moths. Finally, we provide some hardware design recommendations to improve the energy efficiency of similar devices for more widespread deployment in insect traps and for controlling the LEDs to evaluate the effects of intensity and modulation with minimal pulsing, which our observations suggest may result in insects avoiding traps.

AB  - Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. Lignosus rhinocerus (Cooke) Ryvarden (also known as tiger milk mushroom), has been reported to exhibit a range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antioxidative, immunomodulatory and anti-asthmatic activities. Thus far, there is limited research that has explored its ability to mediate vascular effects in vivo. Therefore, this study investigated the antihypertensive and vascular protective effects of L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotia supplementation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats served as a normo-tensive control group. SHR were orally administered with L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotia (100 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, respectively) for 8 weeks, and blood pressure was monitored every 2 weeks. Vascular function was evaluated using an organ bath (aorta) and wire myograph (renal artery) at the treatment endpoint. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in the aorta and renal artery were evaluated using dihydroethidium (DHE) and difluoro fluorescein acetate (DAF-FM) fluorescence assays, respectively. Total plasma nitrate/nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were evaluated via colorimetric assays. In vivo treatment with L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotia sig-nificantly attenuated the increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP). It also alleviated vascular dysfunction and decreased elevated ROS in the aorta and renal arteries of the treated SHRs. Moreover, L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotia attenuated plasma TNF-alpha level but increased total plasma nitrate/nitrite, albeit slightly, coupled with significantly increased NO at the vascular level. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that L. rhinocerus TM02 (R) sclerotia supplementation exerted blood pressure lowering effects, partly attributed to improvements in vascular function via reduction in vascular oxidative stress.

AB  - An important component of post-release monitoring of biological control of invasive plants is the tracking of species interactions. During post-release monitoring following the initial releases of the weevil Ceutorhynchus scrobicollis Nerenscheimer and Wagner (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata (Marschall von Bieberstein) Cavara and Grande (Brassicaceae), in Ontario, Canada, we identified the presence of larvae of the tumbling flower beetle, Mordellina ancilla Leconte (Coleoptera: Mordellidae), in garlic mustard stems. This study documents the life history of M. ancilla on garlic mustard to assess for potential interactions between M. ancilla and C. scrobicollis as a biological control agent. Garlic mustard stems were sampled at eight sites across southern Ontario and throughout the course of one year to record the prevalence of this association and to observe its life cycle on the plant. We found M. ancilla to be a widespread stem-borer of late second-year and dead garlic mustard plants across sampling locations. This is the first host record for M. ancilla on garlic mustard. The observed life cycle of M. ancilla indicates that it is unlikely to negatively impact the growth and reproduction of garlic mustard and that it is unlikely to affect the use of C. scrobicollis as a biological control agent.

Ceci est la premi & egrave;re fois que nous observons l'association entre C. scrobicollis et l'alliaire officinale. Nous confirmons que M. ancilla consomme la moelle des tiges de l'alliaire officinale vers la fin de la vie de cette plante bisanuelle et continue de consommer la moelle de la plante morte, & eacute;mergeant l'ann & eacute;e prochaine. Selon nos donn & eacute;es, il est improbable que M. ancilla ait un effet sur ni l'agent de lutte biologique C. scrobicollis, ni la croissance out la reproduction de l'alliaire officinale.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disruptions and heat stress can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier damage, increasing the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. However, whether eating according to the circadian rhythm during the day when the ambient temperature is higher or eating against the circadian rhythm at night when the ambient temperature is relatively suitable, is better for the gut health of diurnal animals in summer has not been clarified. In this study, growing pigs were randomly assigned to a daytime-restricted feeding or nighttime-restricted feeding (NRF) group and raised for 18 days in summer with mild heat stress. Our results showed that NRF alleviated heat stress in pigs, as reflected by increased feed intake and decreased drinking. Microbiome analysis revealed that NRF increased the diversity of gut microbiota and abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and decreased the abundance of gram-negative and potentially pathogenic bacteria, thereby increasing SCFAs and reducing lipopolysaccharide production in the colon. These changes enhanced colonic barrier function and reduced colitis and systemic inflammation by upregulating tight junction proteins and mucin. Our findings indicate that although nighttime eating does not align with the biological habits of pigs, consuming food at a relatively suitable ambient temperature is more beneficial for gut health and homeostasis during hot seasons. Our research provides a reference for guiding the healthy feeding of farm animals in summer and a basis for developing a lifestyle that promotes gut health for individuals in tropical regions.
   This study revealed that choosing a time period with a relatively suitable temperature for eating may increase short-chain fatty acids and reduce lipopolysaccharide production by optimizing the gut microbial composition, thereby improving colonic barrier function and reducing the risk of colitis and systemic inflammation, which is more beneficial for intestinal health and homeostasis compared with eating according to the circadian rhythm for diurnal animals during the hot season (17.4-33.9 degrees C).image

AB  - Background: Camellia oleifera Abel. (C. oleifera) is an important traditional woody species in China that produces edible oil. However, the current literature lacks a proper understanding of C. oleifera's ability to adapt to different photoperiods.
   Results: Our results indicate that the photoperiod can significantly impact flowering time in C. oleifera. We grew a total of nine samples under the short day condition (SD), middle day condition (MD) and long day condition (LD). Transcriptome analysis yielded 66.94 Gb of high-quality clean reads, with an average of over 6.73 Gb of reads for per sample. Following assembly, a total of 120,080 transcripts were obtained and 94,979 unigenes annotated. A total of 3475 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the SD_MD,SD_LD, and MD_LD gene sets. Moreover, WGCNA identified ten gene modules. Genes in pink module (92 genes) were positively correlated with SD, and negatively correlated with both MD and LD. Genes in the magenta module (42 genes) were positively correlated with MD and negatively correlated with both LD and SD. Finally, genes in the yellow module (1758 genes) were positively correlated with both SD and MD, but negatively correlated with LD. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that genes in the pink, magenta, and yellow modules were involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and circadian rhythm pathways. Additionally, eight hub genes (GI, AP2, WRKY65, SCR, SHR, PHR1, ERF106, and SCL3) were obtained through network analysis. The hub genes had high connectivity with other photoperiod-sensitive DEGs. The expression levels of hub genes were verified by qRT-PCR analysis.
   Conclusion: An increase in light duration promotes earlier flowering of C. oleifera. Flavonoid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and circadian rhythm pathways may function in the photoperiodic flowering pathway of C. oleifera. We also identified eight hub genes that may play a role in this pathway. Ultimately, this work contributes to our understanding of the photoperiodic flowering pathway of C. oleifera and further informs molecular breeding programs on the plant's photoperiodic sensitivity.

AB  - Post-mortem interval (PMI) estimation is a critical task in forensic science. In this study, we used maggots collected from pig carcasses and applied an integrated proteomics and metabolomics approach to determine potential candidate substances for the estimation of PMI. After methanol precipitation, the supernatant containing metabolites and the protein pellet were separated and subjected to metabolomic and proteomic analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). MS/MS data were analyzed for identification and quantification using Proteome Discoverer and Compound Discoverer software. A total of 573 metabolites and more than 800 porcine proteins were identified in maggots. This is the first dataset of proteins and metabolites in maggots collected from porcine carcasses. In this study, guanosine monophosphate, xanthine, inosine, adenosine, and guanine were detected with a similar tendency to increase during early days of maggot development and then decreased gradually. We broadly profiled various biomolecules through analysis in the spot of incident. Especially, we confirmed that proteome and metabolome profiling could be performed directly and indirectly.

AB  - Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain that binds to GABA receptors and hyperpolarizes the postsynaptic neuron. Gabazine acts as a competitive antagonist to type A GABA receptors (GABAAR), thereby causing diminished neuronal hyperpolarization and GABAAR-mediated inhibition. However, the biochemical effects and the potential regulatory role of astrocytes in this process remain poorly understood. To address this, we investigated the neuronal responses of gabazine in rat cortical cultures containing varying ratios of neurons and astrocytes. Electrophysiological characterization was performed utilizing microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with topologically controlled microcircuit cultures that enabled control of neuronal network growth. Biochemical analysis of the cultures was performed using traditional dissociated cultures on coverslips. Our study indicates that, upon gabazine stimulation, astrocyte-rich neuronal cultures exhibit elevated electrophysiological activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB; receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor), along with distinct cytokine secretion profiles. Notably, neurons lacking proper astrocytic support were found to experience synapse loss and decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, astrocytes contributed to neuronal viability, morphology, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and overall neuronal network functionality, highlighting the multifunctional role of astrocytes.image
   This study investigated the effects of the GABAAR selective competitive antagonist gabazine on neural cell cultures. The cultures contained various ratios of neurons and astrocytes, examining the role of astrocytes in neuronal electrophysiology and biochemistry. The setup included a topologically-controlled microcircuit system on microelectrode arrays for electrophysiological assessment and dissociated cell cultures on coverslips for biochemical analysis. Astrocytes modulated neuronal responses to gabazine, resulting in increased electrical activity in astrocyte-rich co-cultures. Moreover, co-cultures exhibited distinct cytokine secretions, most notably the secretion of VEGF, improved viability, and enhanced neuronal network connectivity. Co-cultures with astrocyte support had increased p-TrkB levels and synapse preservation after gabazine administration. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which astrocytes modulate and facilitate neuronal responses, especially when the inhibitory mechanisms are disrupted. Created with Biorender.com.image

AB  - The emerging elicitor protein PeBL1, extracted from Brevibacillus laterosporus A60, was tested against the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) for its biocontrol potential. Its effects on M. euphorbiae survival, lifespan, immature development, adult reproductive performance, and pest-pathogen interaction were assessed using electrical penetration graphs (EPGs), The levels of jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET) were significantly increased in the B. laterosporus-treated C. annuum seedlings, indicating substantial accumulation. Brevibacillus laterosporus improved the height of the C. annuum L. plant and the surface structure of the leaves, by reducing M. euphorbiae reproduction and preventing colonization, according to the findings of this study. The activation of pathways was also part of the defensive response (JA, SA, and ET). The use of B. laterosporus for integrated pest management in the agroecosystem appears to be suitable based on these findings against M. euphorbiae.

AB  - This study examined the effects of dietary Mannan-Oligosaccharides (MOS) on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, immune function, and intestinal morphology in fattening Tan sheep. Twenty-eight four-month-old male Tan sheep were assigned to four groups and received a basal diet supplemented with 0%, 1%, 2%, or 3% MOS for 56 days following a 14-day adaptation period.Results indicated that MOS supplementation significantly increased average daily gain (ADG) in a dose-dependent manner (P <= 0.05). Serum biochemical analyses showed a linear and quadratic reduction in triglyceride (TG) levels, and a linear and quadratic increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (P <= 0.05). Total cholesterol (TC) levels decreased linearly, whereas urea nitrogen (UN) levels increased linearly with higher MOS levels (P <= 0.05). Mannan-Oligosaccharides also enhanced total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and catalase (CAT) activity, with both parameters increasing linearly (P <= 0.05). Immune function was significantly improved, demonstrated by elevated levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (P <= 0.05). Additionally, 2% and 3% MOS groups showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (P <= 0.05). Linear increases were noted in serum IgG, IgA, IgM, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels, while IL-10 and IFN-gamma levels exhibited both linear and quadratic increases (P <= 0.05).Intestinal morphology analysis revealed significant improvements in jejunal villus height, crypt depth reduction, and the villus-to-crypt ratio, with these parameters showing both linear and quadratic changes in response to increasing MOS levels (P <= 0.05). In conclusion, 2% MOS supplementation is recommended for enhanced growth performance, metabolic health, immune function, and intestinal integrity in fattening Tan sheep.

AB  - Circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) is a potential risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanistic link between CRD and AD is still not fully understood. CRD may lead to intestinal barrier impairment. Several studies in animals and humans suggest a connection between gut microbiota disturbance, intestinal barrier damage and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of CRD on cognition in mice and explored the role of intestinal barrier and inflammatory responses in this process. CRD modulates the composition of gut microbiota, impairs intestinal barrier integrity, and induces both peripheral and central inflammation and cognitive impairment in mice. Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic which modulates the gut microbial composition and increases intestinal barrier integrity, effectively suppresses inflammatory responses, and rescues cognitive impairment induced by CRD. Furthermore, the impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis, tau hyperphosphorylation, and loss in synaptic proteins in CRD mice is also reversed by Rifaximin. These data identify that the impaired intestinal barrier integrity related to gut microbiota disturbance plays a key role in CRD-induced inflammatory responses and cognitive impairments in mice, and Rifaximin is effective in preventing CRD-induced cognitive deficit through protecting the gut barrier and ameliorating neuroinflammation.

AB  - Despite the known impacts of weaning on animal health, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, particularly how psychological and nutritional stress differentially affect gut health and immune function over time. This study hypothesized that early weaning exerts distinct short- and long-term effects on lamb stress physiology, immunity, and gut health, mediated by specific molecular pathways. Twelve pairs of full-sibling male Hu sheep lambs were assigned to control (CON) or early-weaned (EW) groups. Plasma stress/immune markers were dynamically monitored, and intestinal morphology, antioxidant capacity, apoptosis, and transcriptomic profiles were analyzed at 5 and 28 days post-weaning. Early weaning triggered transient psychological stress, elevating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones (cortisol, catecholamines) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha) within 1 day (p < 0.05); however, stress responses were transient and recovered by 7 days post-weaning. Sustained intestinal remodeling was observed in EW lambs, featuring reduced ileal villus height, increased crypt depth (p < 0.05), and oxidative damage (MDA levels doubled vs. CON; p < 0.01). Compensatory epithelial adaptation included increased crypt depth but paradoxically reduced villus tip apoptosis. The transcriptome analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression related to immune function, fat digestion, and metabolism. Key DEGs included APOA4, linked to lipid transport adaptation; NOS2, associated with nitric oxide-mediated immune-metabolic crosstalk; and mitochondrial gene COX1, reflecting energy metabolism dysregulation. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed NOS2 as a hub gene interacting with IDO1 and CXCL11, connecting oxidative stress to immune cell recruitment. Early weaning exerts minimal lasting psychological stress but drives persistent gut dysfunction through transcriptome-mediated changes in metabolic and immune pathways, highlighting key genes such as APOA4, NOS2, and COX1 as potential regulators of these effects.

AB  - Featured Application Electronic nose can be a simple, portable, solvent free, rapid and relatively inexpensive device to assess the authenticity of "Pasture milk" before its processing. It can be used to protect producers and consumers of milk and dairy products from potential fraud. The nutritional peculiarities of dairy products made with milk from pasture-fed ruminants would require a rapid control to be authenticated and limit the risk of fraud. In the current study, ninety milk samples from two groups of goats were analysed by electronic nose, quantitative descriptive sensory (QDA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis with the aim of discriminating between milk produced on grazing and on a confinement feeding system. The raw milk samples were taken at five different times over a period of three months (April, May and June 2021) from eighteen individual Saanen goats divided into two groups, one of which was fed outdoors on a highly biodiverse pasture. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), carried out on electronic nose data, was able to classify the two types of milk in terms of an animal feeding system (88% correct classification). Pasture milk scored higher for sensory descriptors such as "Grassy" and "Sweet aromatic" odours. Terpene compounds were the chemical class that qualitatively differentiates the pasture milk while volatile fatty acids were the most present quantitatively. Electronic nose has proven to be a rapid, reproducible and simple method for authenticating pasture raw milk in routine control analyses.

AB  - Extensive evidence supports the role of the immune system in modulating brain function and behaviour. However, past studies have revealed striking heterogeneity in behavioural phenotypes produced from immune system dysfunction. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we studied the neuroanatomical differences among 11 distinct genetically modified mouse lines (n = 371), each deficient in a different element of the immune system. We found a significant and heterogeneous effect of immune dysfunction on the brains of both male and female mice. However, by imaging the whole brain and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we were able to identify patterns within the heterogeneous phenotype. Certain structures-such as the corpus callosum, midbrain, and thalamus-were more likely to be affected by immune dysfunction. A notable brain-behaviour relationship was identified with neuroanatomy endophenotypes across mouse models clustering according to anxiety-like behaviour phenotypes reported in literature, such as altered volume in brains regions associated with promoting fear response (e.g., the lateral septum and cerebellum). Interestingly, genes with preferential spatial expression in the most commonly affected regions are also associated with multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated diseases. In total, our data suggest that the immune system modulates anxiety behaviour through well-established brain networks.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including PCDD/Fs, PCBs, and PBDEs, are major environmental and food safety concerns due to their bioaccumulative and toxic properties. However, comprehensive research on the concentrations and influencing factors of POPs across different food types and regions, particularly in underdeveloped regions of western China, remains scarce. This study conducted a comprehensive assessment of POPs contamination in six food types (pig liver, pork, freshwater fish, marine fish, beef, and eggs) from western China by integrating environmental, geographical, socio-economic data, and food POP concentrations with machine learning and multivariate analyses to evaluate distribution patterns, key influencing factors, and associated health risks. The results showed distinct contamination patterns across food types and regions. Among all food, pig liver exhibited the highest levels of & sum;PCDD/Fs, while marine fish showed elevated PBDEs and ndl-PCBs, highlighting the influence of organ-specific bioaccumulation and global oceanic pollution. Freshwater fish displayed higher & sum;PCDD/Fs due to localized agricultural and industrial pollution. Regional differences were most pronounced in pork, with higher contamination in Yunnan and Sichuan, driven by industrial emissions, biomass burning, and geographical factors. Regression models, particularly Random Forest and SHAP analyses, identified food type, latitude, GDP, and climatic conditions as key predictors of POP variability. Risk assessments indicated that dietary exposure to POPs from high-consumption foods remained within safety thresholds, posing no significant health risks to the general population.

AB  - This study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong antioxidant activity and potential probiotic properties from yak milk and dairy products in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Initial screening of the isolates was performed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay and a hydrogen peroxide tolerance test. Subsequently, the antioxidant capacity of the isolates was assessed through five distinct assays: 2,2 '-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging ability, superoxide anion radical scavenging ability, hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, a DPPH scavenging assay, and a reducing activity assay. The strains with the stronger antioxidant potential were then further evaluated for their probiotic properties. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted on Lactobacillus plantarum QL01. Among 1205 isolates, 9 strains exhibited potential antioxidant capabilities. Following probiotic property evaluation, QL01 was identified as a safe candidate due to its strong growth, strong adhesion ability, and resilience to acidic, bile, and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Genome analysis revealed that most of QL01's genes were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Further examination of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors confirmed its safety, meanwhile genes linked to adhesion and stress responses underscored its probiotic potential. In conclusion, QL01, a strong antioxidant strain, was successfully isolated, and its probiotic potential was confirmed through comprehensive in vitro and genomic analyses.

AB  - BackgroundThis experiment aimed to investigate effects of dietary l-theanine supplementation on pork quality and muscle fiber type transformation in finishing pigs. In a 30-day experiment, 18 healthy Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) pigs with an average body weight of 86.03 +/- 0.83 kg were randomly divided into three groups (a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 500 and 1000 ppm l-theanine, respectively), with six duplicates and one pig per replicate. ResultsThe results showed that dietary 1000 ppm l-theanine supplementation significantly reduced (P < 0.05) b*(24 h) and drip loss. Dietary 1000 ppm l-theanine supplementation significantly increased (P < 0.05) slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein expression and the percentage of slow-twitch fibers, as well as significantly decreased (P < 0.05) fast MyHC protein expression and the percentage of fast-twitch fibers, accompanied by an increase in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities and a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. In addition, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was activated by l-theanine. ConclusionTogether, this study demonstrated for the first time that dietary supplementation of 1000 ppm l-theanine can improve pork color and drip loss and promote muscle fiber type transformation from fast-twitch to slow-twitch in finishing pigs.

AB  - Sleep restriction is a growing issue in our modern society and thus it is crucial to uncover its neurocognitive consequences. Especially declarative memory is negatively affected by sleep loss due to its critical dependence on the hippocampus, a brain area known to be susceptible to sleep loss. Studies have shown that even a half night sleep restriction is sufficient to induce impairments in a range of hippocampus-dependent forms of memory. Nevertheless, memory performance is, at least to some extent, dependent on other cognitive functions. The aim of the current study was to reveal whether memory deficits observed after one night sleep deprivation, as observed in animal studies, translate to man, and whether these effects are mediated by impairments in other cognitive domains. We hypothesized that the memory paradigms would be affected but that, due to the short nature of the sleep restriction, this effect would not be mediated by other cognitive functions. To this end, fiftyfive healthy participants conducted a test battery containing paradigms measuring verbal learning, spatial memory, attention, working memory, and response inhibition after a night of regular sleep or acute partial sleep restriction. The results of the study showed an impairment in both hippocampus-dependent memory tests, while no negative consequences of sleep deprivation were revealed on the other cognitive domains. In conclusion, our data indicate that the observed deficit in memory performance after a half night sleep deprivation is not mediated by impairments in attention (alerting, orienting, and executive control), working memory, or motor inhibitory control mechanisms.

AB  - Karin Kaymagi is a type of Tulum cheese traditionally produced from sheep milk and ripened in tripe following the addition of cream to the curd. In this study, it was traditionally produced by mixing certain proportions of raw sheep and cow milk (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100). The samples were allowed to ripen, and analyses were made for chemical, biochemical, electrophoretic, sensory, and textural properties at the 3(rd), 30(th), 60(th), and 90(th) days of ripening. According to the results obtained, both cheese type and ripening time had significant effects on dry matter, fat, protein, salt, salt in dry matter, % lactic acid, pH, ripening rate, NPN ratio, and PPN ratio (P < 0.05). Only cheese type had a remarkable effect on salt in dry matter and fat in dry matter (P < 0.05). The highest lipolysis value was determined in the samples made of sheep milk only (KK2) (P < 0.05). Electrophoretic analysis showed that alpha S1-casein and beta-casein concentrations decreased until the end of ripening. Sensory analysis denoted that the KK2 sample was appreciated the most based on colour, appearance, structure, taste, and odor scores (P < 0.05).

AB  - In oocytes, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation and maternal mRNAs translation is regulated by cis -ele-ments, including polyadenylation signal (PAS) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) in 3'-UTR. Recent studies illustrate non-canonical polyadenylation mechanisms of translational regulation in mouse oocytes, which is different from that in Xenopus oocytes. However, it is still unclear if this regulation in rodent oocytes functions in the domestic animal oocyte. Here, by using sheep as an animal model, we cloned the 3'-UTRs of Cpeb1 or Btg4 and ligated it into the pRK5-Flag-Gfp vector. Variant numbers and positions of PASs and CPEs within the 3'-UTRs were constructed to detect their effects on translational control. After in vitro-transcription and microinjection into sheep fully grown germinal vesicle stage oocytes, the expression efficiency of mRNAs was detected by the GFP and flag expression. Our results show that: (i) PAS located at the proximal end of 3'-UTR can mediate the translation of the maternal mRNAs, as long as they locate far from CPEs; (ii) The proximal PAS has higher efficiency in regulating transcription than the distal one; (iii) increase of PAS number can promote the translational activity more efficiently; (iv) a single CPE located close to PAS (<50 bp) in 3'-UTRs of Cpeb1 or Btg4 could partially repress translation. In 3'-UTRs of Btg4, two CPEs have a higher inhibitory effect, and three CPEs can completely inhibit mRNA translation. These results confirm the existence of the non-canonical mecha-nism in domestic animal oocytes.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A timely and accurate estimation of body weight in finishing pigs is critical in determining profits by allowing pork producers to make informed marketing decisions on group-housed pigs while reducing labor and feed costs. This study investigated the usefulness of feeding behavior data in predicting the body weight of pigs at the finishing stage. We obtained data on 655 pigs of three breeds (Duroc, Landrace, and Large White) from 75 to 166 days of age. Feeding behavior, feed intake, and body weight information were recorded when a pig visited the Feed Intake Recording Equipment in each pen. Data collected from 75 to 158 days of age were split into six slices of 14 days each and used to calibrate predictive models. LASSO regression and two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Long Short-term Memory network) were selected to forecast the body weight of pigs aged from 159 to 166 days using four scenarios: individual-informed predictive scenario, individual- and groupinformed predictive scenario, breed-specific individual- and group-informed predictive scenario, and groupinformed predictive scenario. We developed four models for each scenario: Model_Age included only age, Model_FB included only feeding behavior variables, Model_Age_FB and Model_Age_FB_FI added feeding behavior and feed intake measures on the basis of Model_Age as predictors. Pearson?s correlation, root mean squared error, and binary diagnostic tests were used to assess predictive performance. The greatest correlation was 0.87, and the highest accuracy was 0.89 for the individual-informed prediction, while they were 0.84 and 0.85 for the individual- and group-informed predictions, respectively. The least root mean squared error of both scenarios was about 10 kg. The best prediction performed by Model_FB had a correlation of 0.83, an accuracy of 0.74, and a root mean squared error of 14.3 kg in the individual-informed prediction. The effect of the addition of feeding behavior and feed intake data varied across algorithms and scenarios from a small to moderate improvement in predictive performance. We also found differences in predictive performance associated with the time slices or pigs used in the training set, the algorithm employed, and the breed group considered. Overall, this study?s findings connect the dynamics of feeding behavior to body growth and provide a promising picture of the involvement of feeding behavior data in predicting the body weight of group-housed pigs.

AB  - Hypoxemia and oxidative stress, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in undernourished twin sheep pregnancies, has been described in near-term studies. Our aim was to evaluate if the counteractive effects of maternal nutritional or antioxidant supplementation on the fetal redox status were evident before the accelerated fetal growth phase. Forty twin-bearing ewes grazing on natural Patagonian prairie were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10 each; P: control ewes consuming mainly natural pasture; P+A: pasture plus antioxidants; P+C: pasture plus concentrate; P+A+C: pasture plus antioxidants and concentrate). Daily herbal antioxidants were supplemented in a feedstuff concentrate as a premix from day 35 until day 100 of gestation, when fetal venous cord blood samples and biometric measurements were obtained via cesarean section. The fetuses from group P were clearly hypoxemic. An analysis of variance showed that maternal antioxidant supplementation showed a trend of increased PO2, SatHb, and Ht, effects not observed in P+C fetuses. Antioxidants decreased the fetal MDA concentration (p < 0.05). Fetal TAC was increased by the antioxidants and concentrate (p < 0.05). Antioxidant supplementation showed a trend to increase fetal body weight but not biometry. The results suggest that negative effects of oxidative stress occur earlier than the overt growth arrest, and the maternal administration of antioxidants may constitute a good nutritional strategy for the early prevention of IUGR.

AB  - The involvement of the sensorimotor system in the perception of painful actions has been repeatedly demon-strated. Yet the cognitive processes corresponding to sensorimotor activations have not been identified. In particular, the respective role of higher-level and lower-level action representations such as goals and grips in the recognition of painful actions is not clear. Previous research has shown that in a neutral context, higher-level action representations (goals) are prioritized over lower-level action representations (grips) and guide action recognition. The present study evaluates to what extent the general priority given to goal-related information in the processing of visual actions can be modulated by a context of pain. We used the action violation paradigm developed by van Elk et al. (2008). In the present action tasks, participants had to judge whether the grip or the goal of object-directed actions displayed in photographs was correct or not. The actress in the photograph could show either a neutral facial expression or a facial expression of pain. In the control task, they had to judge whether the actress expressed pain. In the action tasks, goals influenced grip judgements more than grips influenced goal judgements overall, corroborating the priority given to goal-related information previously re-ported. Critically, the impact of irrelevant goal-related information on the identification of incorrect grips dis-appeared in the pain context. Moreover, judgements in the control task were similarly influenced by grip and goal-related information. Results suggest that a context of pain reduces the reliance on higher-level action for action judgments. Findings provide novel directions regarding the cognitive and brain mechanisms involved in action processing in painful situations and support pluralist views of action understanding.

AB  - In vitro maturation (IVM) is not a routine assisted reproductive technology (ART) for oocytes collected from early antral (EA) follicles, a large source of potentially available gametes. Despite substantial improvements in IVM in the past decade, the outcomes remain low for EA-derived oocytes due to their reduced developmental competences. To optimize IVM for ovine EA-derived oocytes, a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-mediated follicle-enclosed oocytes (FEO) system was compared with a validated cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) protocol. Gonadotropin stimulation (eCG and/or hCG) and/or somatic cell coculture (ovarian vs. extraovarian-cell source) were supplied to both systems. The maturation rate and parthenogenetic activation were significantly improved by combining hCG stimulation with ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells coculture exclusively on the FEO system. Based on the data, the paracrine factors released specifically from OSE enhanced the hCG-triggering of oocyte maturation mechanisms by acting through the mural compartment (positive effect on FEO and not on COC) by stimulating the EGFR signaling. Overall, the FEO system performed on a developed reproductive scaffold proved feasible and reliable in promoting a synergic cytoplasmatic and nuclear maturation, offering a novel cultural strategy to widen the availability of mature gametes for ART.

AB  - The dynamics of household and regional economy of Banni grasslands in India were studied based on primary data collected from 280 households across 13 villages. Each household had one primary occupation and, on average, two secondary occupations. Pastoralism and charcoal production employed 58 and 28% of households as primary occupations, respectively, whereas leather work, services and tourism employed 4% of households each. Further, pastoralism and charcoal production employed 60 and 48% of households, respectively, as secondary occupations. Highest and lowest average annual net returns were realized from the sale of milk and milk products ((sic) 414,070/HH) and honey and gum collection ((sic) 2827/HH), respectively. The Banni grassland is still a traditional society predominantly based on the primary sector as it employed 88% of the households and contributed 91% to the economy. Pastoralism alone contributed 82% to the economy of the Banni region followed by charcoal production (8%) and tourism (5%), whereas all other occupations contributed <1-2% each. Contribution from secondary and tertiary sectors was very low. Pastoralism has evolved in the region, but it continues to be the dominant livelihood option. Therefore, arresting and addressing the land degradation process in Banni grasslands is of paramount importance to sustain the livelihoods and the ecology.

AB  - Root-associated microbiomes play a crucial role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants can enrich beneficial microbes to increase their stress-relieving ability. Above-ground insect herbivory is among the most detrimental stresses for plants, especially to crop production. However, few studies have explored how root-associated microbiomes respond to herbivores and influence plant-defense functions under herbivory stress. We investigate the changes and functional role of root-associated microbial communities under herbivory stress using leafminer (Liriomyza trifolii) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) as a focal system. We did this by using a combination of 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling and metagenomic sequencing to test for differences in co-occurrence networks and functions between cowpea plants infested and noninfested with leafminers. The results demonstrated that leafminer infestation caused a shift in the rhizosphere microbiome, which was characterized by a significant variation in microbiome community structure and composition, the selection of hub microbes involved in nitrogen (N) metabolism, and functional enrichment related to N metabolism. Notably, nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium species were actively enriched and selected to be hubs in the rhizosphere. Inoculation with Bradyrhizobium enhanced cowpea performance under leafminer stress and increased protease inhibitor levels to decrease leafminer fitness. Overall, our study characterized the changes of root-associated microbiota between leafminer-infested and noninfested cowpea plants and revealed the mechanisms underlying the rhizosphere microbiome shift that enhance plant performance and defense against herbivory. Our findings provide further support for the notion that plants enrich rhizosphere microbes to counteract aboveground insect herbivores.

AB  - This study aims to improve the load factor and reduce the residual rate of the Hermetia illucens L. feeding bucket. Based on the sand bucket feeding conveyor designed in the early stage, the technological characteristics of biotransformation of pig manure with Hermetia illucens L., and the mechanism of the bucket shape feeding and transport, the 4-day-old Hermetia illucens L. larvae was firstly inoculated in the pig manure environment with a water content of 75% at 26 degrees C. Then, the single factor experiment was conducted to compare the effect of pig-manure bulking thickness on the biotransformation efficiency of Hermetia illucens L. The results demonstrated that when the thickness of pig manure was 0.10-0.15 m, the biotransformation efficiency of Hermetia illucens L. was relatively high, and the weight loss rate of pig manure was more than 50%. Hence, the thickness of pig manure was an essential factor influencing the efficiency of bucket feeding transportation. On this basis, the physical parameters such as shape size, particle size distribution, and water content of the Hermetia illucens L. sand particles after biotransformation of pig manure were determined. Furthermore, the discrete element method was adopted to establish the numerical simulation model of the bucket shape feeding conveyer under the combination of discrete element simulation and bench test, so as to simulate the bucket shape feeding transport process with insect sands after cleaning the Hermetia illucens L. larva as the test object. Meanwhile, a mechanics and kinematics analysis was conducted for the stress of the horizontal and vertical directions, the mass of materials in the bucket, and the leakage area of the bucket to reveal the mechanism of feeding filling conveying and leakage bucket. Additionally, the main factors influencing the bucket material feeding transport efficiency were comprehensively determined, including feed speed, bucket rotating speed, and feeding depth. The test indicators such as bucket load factor, variation coefficient, and residual rate were established. Besides, a three-factor three-level orthogonal combination experiment was conducted by combining with the Box-Behnken test method. Then, the regression mathematical model between the indexes and factors was set up to analyze the influence law of various factors on the evaluation indicators. The parameters were optimized with the regression model. The model validation test results suggested that the bucket rotating speed was 6.5r.min-1 when the feed speed was 45 mm.s(-1); the experimental values of the load factor, variation coefficient, and residual rate were consistent with the theoretical optimization values when the feeding depth was 15 cm, with the relative errors of 2.14%, 5.84%, and 6.40%, respectively. Thus, the model optimization is reliable. Under the condition of the optimization parameters, the bench test equipment was established, and the experiment was performed. With the mixture of Hermetia illucens L. insect sand as the experimental material, its load factor, variation coefficient, sand retention rate, and larvae loss rate were 81.23%, 1.48%, 1.85%, and 3.75%, respectively, which met the experimental and actual production requirements. The research results provided a theoretical reference for the design and optimization of the bucket shape feeding conveying machinery of Hermetia illucens L. insect sand.

AB  - Increasing technological development results in more sources of the extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF), which is recognized as an environmental risk factor. The results of the past study indicate that the ELF-EMF can affect the level of DNA methylation. The study aimed to determine whether the ELF-EMF induces changes in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the endometrium of pigs during the periimplantation period. Endometrial slices (100 +/- 5 mg) collected on days 15-16 of pregnancy were exposed in vitro to the ELF-EMF at a frequency of 50 Hz for 2 h of treatment duration. To determine the impact of the ELFEMF on elements of epigenetic regulations involved in DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA biogenesis in the endometrium, the DNMT1 and DNMT3a; EZH2, UHRF1, and MBD1; DICER1 and DGCR8 mRNA transcript and protein abundance were analyzed using Real-Time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Moreover, EED and SUZ12 mRNA transcript, global DNA methylation, and the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) were analyzed. The changes in the abundance of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, EZH2 mRNA transcript and protein, EED and SUZ12 mRNA transcript, global DNA methylation level, HDAC activity, and the abundance of proteins involved in microRNA biogenesis evoked by the ELF-EMF in the endometrium were observed. The ELF-EMF possesses the potential to alter epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the porcine endometrium. Observed alterations may be the reason for changes in the transcriptomic profile of the endometrium exposed to the ELF-EMF which in turn may disrupt biological processes in the uterus during peri-implantation.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used organophosphorus pesticide. Increasing evidence has shown that exposure to CPF in early life might induce neurodevelopmental disorders, but the pathogenesis remains uncertain. Synaptic plasticity plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment. This study aimed to investigate the effect of CPF on synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons and establish the cellular mechanism underlying these effects. Using CPF-exposed rat and primary hippocampal neurons model, we analyzed the impact of CPF on the synaptic morphology, the expression level of a presynaptic protein, a postsynaptic protein and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), as well as the effects on the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. We found that the synapses were shortened, the spines were decreased, and the expression of synaptophysin (Syp), postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), GluN1, GluA1 and Wnt7a, as well as active beta-catenin in primary hippocampal neurons was decreased. Our study suggests that CPF exposure induced dysregulation of synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampal neurons, which might provide novel information regarding the mechanism of CPF-induced neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - In Canada, the 2014 Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Pigs proposed the continued operation of existing stall barns after 2024 on condition that bred sows be given access to periodic exercise. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of periodic exercise on sow welfare. Sows (n = 180) were assigned to one of three treatments: stall-housed (Control: C); stall-housed and exercised weekly for 10 min (Exercise: E); and group-housed (Group: G). Sow postures and stereotypies were recorded once per week in early, mid and late gestation before (AM) and after (PM) exercise. Female piglets (n = 168 from C, E and G sows) underwent isolation and novel object tests at 19-22 days of age. Postures differed by treatment in AM with G sows lying more and sitting less than C and E sows, which did not differ. In PM, E sows sat more than G sows, with C sows being intermediate. In early gestation, G sows performed fewer stereotypies than E sows, with C sows being intermediate. In mid gestation, G sows performed fewer stereotypies than C and E sows, which did not differ. Piglets from C sows were more active in the novel object test than E and G piglets, which did not differ. Group housing improved sow comfort (indicated by postures) and reduced sow stress (indicated by stereotypies), but periodic exercise did not. Decreased activity level in piglets from sows given greater freedom of movement indicates that gestation housing can influence the behaviour of offspring.

   We previously generated TP53 mutant pigs that exhibit a sex-specific patho-phenotype due to altered regulation of numerous X chromosome genes. In this study, we explored the effect of p53 deficiency on ACE2 expression in pigs. First, we identified the p53 binding site in the ACE2 promoter and could show its regulatory effect on ACE2 expression by luciferase assay in porcine primary kidney fibroblast cells. Later, quantitative PCR and western blot showed tissue-and gender-specific expression changes of ACE2 and its truncated isoform in p53-deficient pigs. We believe these findings will broaden the knowledge on ACE2 regulation and COVID-19 susceptibility.

AB  - Clinical and preclinical evidence has indicated that estrogen depletion leads to memory impairments and increases the susceptibility to neural damage. Here, we have sought to investigate the effects of Cannabidiol (CBD) a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa, on memory deficits induced by estrogen depletion in rats, and its underlying mechanisms. Adult rats were subjected to bilateral ovariectomy, an established estrogen depletion model in rodents, or sham surgery and allowed to recover for three weeks. After that, they received daily injections of CBD (10 mg/kg) for fourteen days. Rats were tested in the inhibitory avoidance task, a type of emotionally-motivated memory. After behavioral testing they were euthanized, and their hippocampi were isolated for analysis of components of the Akt/GSK30 survival pathway and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. Results revealed that ovariectomy impaired avoidance memory, and CBD was able to completely reverse estrogen depletion-induced memory impairment. Ovariectomy also reduced Akt/GSK30 pathway's activation by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK30 and Bcl2 levels, which were ameliorated by CBD. The present results indicate that CBD leads to a functional recovery accompanied by the Akt/GSK30 survival pathway's activation, supporting its potential as a treatment for estrogen decline-induced deterioration of neural functioning and maintenance.

AB  - Background Primate lentiviruses (HIV1, HIV2, and Simian immunodeficiency virus [SIV]) cause immune deficiency, encephalitis, and infectious anemia in mammals such as cattle, cat, goat, sheep, horse, and puma. Objective This study was designed and conducted with the main purpose of confirming the overall codon usage pattern of primate lentiviruses and exploring the evolutionary and genetic characteristics commonly or specifically expressed in HIV1, HIV2, and SIV. Methods The gag, pol, and env gene sequences of HIV1, HIV2, and SIV were analyzed to determine their evolutionary relationships, nucleotide compositions, codon usage patterns, neutrality, selection pressure (influence of mutational pressure and natural selection), and viral adaptation to human codon usage. Results A strong 'A' bias was confirmed in all three structural genes, consistent with previous findings regarding HIV. Notably, the ENC-GC3s plot and neutral evolution analysis showed that all primate lentiviruses were more affected by selection pressure than by mutation caused by the GC composition of the gene, consistent with prior reports regarding HIV1. The overall codon usage bias of pol was highest among the structural genes, while the codon usage bias of env was lowest. The virus groups showing high codon bias in all three genes were HIV1 and SIVcolobus. The codon adaptation index (CAI) and similarity D(A, B) values indicated that although there was a high degree of similarity to human codon usage in all three structural genes of HIV, this similarity was not caused by translation pressure. In addition, compared with HIV1, the codon usage of HIV2 is more similar to the human codon usage, but the overall codon usage bias is lower. Conclusion The origin viruses of HIV (SIVcpz_gor and SIVsmm) exhibit greater similarity to human codon usage in the gag gene, confirming their robust adaptability to human codon usage. Therefore, HIV1 and HIV2 may have evolved to avoid human codon usage by selection pressure in the gag gene after interspecies transmission from SIV hosts to humans. By overcoming safety and stability issues, information from codon usage analysis will be useful for attenuated HIV1 vaccine development. A recoded HIV1 variant can be used as a vaccine vector or in immunotherapy to induce specific innate immune responses. Further research regarding HIV1 dinucleotide usage and codon pair usage will facilitate new approaches to the treatment of AIDS.

AB  - Herbivorous insects depend on the host plant to optimize their overall reproductive success, and balanced fertilization may alter the plant's quality against herbivory. Life history traits of the Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) were determined under laboratory conditions using either unfertilized and fertilized plants of bean [Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae)], chrysanthemum [Chrysanthemum x morifolium (Asteraceae)], potato [Solanum tuberosum (Solanaceae)], bell pepper [Capsicum annuum (Solanaceae)], and tomato [Solanum lycopersicum (Solanaceae)]. Results indicated that L. trifolii completed development on all studied unfertilized and fertilized plants. Nevertheless, a higher performance of the leaf miner was observed on bean and bell pepper plants compared to the other plants. Furthermore, there was an interaction of the host plant and fertilization with Calcium Aria or Sitam negatively affecting the fitness-related traits of the leaf miner. Application of these fertilizers resulted in delayed immature development of L. trifolii, decreased survival rate, and reduced adult longevity and fecundity. The activity of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzymes, as well as phenolic, flavonoid, and lignin content were higher in Calcium Aria + Sitam fertilized plants, intermediate in Calcium Aria and Sitam treated plants, and the lower in unfertilized plants. The development and survival of L. trifolii on different host plants, considering fertilization options, become important for deploying cultural control practices against this important pest species.

AB  - Epilepsy is a severe neurological disease manifested by spontaneous recurrent seizures due to abnormal hyper-synchronization of neuronal activity. Epilepsy affects about 1% of the population and up to 40% of patients experience seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs, thus highlighting an urgent need for novel treatments. In this regard, anti-inflammatory drugs emerged as potential therapeutic candidates. In particular, specific molecules apt to resolve the neuroinflammatory response occurring in acquired epilepsies have been proven to counteract seizures in experimental models, and humans. One candidate investigational molecule has been recently identified as the lipid mediator n-3 docosapentaenoic acid-derived protectin D1 (PD1(n-3DPA)) which significantly reduced seizures, cell loss, and cognitive deficit in a mouse model of acquired epilepsy. However, the mechanisms that mediate the PD1(n-3DPA) effect remain elusive. We here addressed whether PD1(n-3DPA) has direct effects on neuronal activity independent of its anti-inflammatory action. We incubated, therefore, hippocampal slices with PD1(n-3DPA) and investigated its effect on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the CA1 pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that inhibitory drive onto the perisomatic region of the pyramidal neurons is increased by PD1(n-3DPA), and this effect is mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors. Our data indicate that PD1(n-3DPA) acts directly on inhibitory transmission, most likely at the presynaptic site of inhibitory synapses as also supported by Xenopus oocytes and immunohistochemical experiments. Thus, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, PD1(n-3DPA) anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects may be mediated by its direct action on neuronal excitability by modulating their synaptic inputs.

TI  - Amelioration of walnut, peony seed and camellia seed oils against d-galactose-induced cognitive impairment in mice by regulating gut microbiota
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Diet adjustment will affect the health of gut microbiota, which in turn influences the development and function of the organism's brain through the gut-brain axis. Walnut oil (WO), peony seed oil (PSO) and camellia seed oil (CSO), as typical representatives of woody plant oils, have been shown to have the potential to improve cognitive impairment in mice, but the function mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we comparatively investigated the neuroprotective effects of these three oils on d-galactose (d-gal)-induced cognitive impairment in mice, and found that the ameliorative effect of WO was more prominent. During the behavioral experiments, supplementation with all three oils would improve spatial learning and memory functions in d-gal mice, with a significant reduction in the error times (p < 0.001) and a significant increase in step-down latency (p < 0.001); walnut oil supplementation also significantly increased the number of hidden platform traversals, the target quadrant spent times and percentage of distance (p < 0.05). The results of biomarker analysis showed that WO, in addition to significantly inhibiting d-gal-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as did PSO, significantly increased the ACh content in the mouse brain (p < 0.05) and modulated neurotransmitter levels. The results of further microbiota diversity sequencing experiments also confirmed that dietary supplementation with all three oils affected the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota in mice. Among them, WO significantly restored the balance of the mouse gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) and decreasing the abundance of harmful bacteria (Clostridium, Shigella, Serratia), which was consistent with the results of behavioral experiments and biomarker analyses. Based on the analysis of the fatty acid composition of the three oils and changes in the gut microbiota, it is hypothesized that there is a correlation between the fatty acid composition of the dietary supplement oils and neuroprotective effects. The superiority of WO over PSO and CSO in improving cognitive impairment is mainly attributed to its balanced composition of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the occurrence of hyperuricemia and its influence on health have drawn lots of concern all over the world. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia in various studies, effective medications without side effects are not available. Nutraceutical supplements have attracted much attention due to their beneficial and non-toxic side effects compared to chemical compounds. In the present study, mice with hyperuricemia induced by potassium oxalate and hypoxanthine were given hydrolysate of goat milk casein (HGMC) to investigate its beneficial effects on hyperuricemia. HGMC significantly alleviated body weight loss and abnormal water consumption in hyperuricemic mice. Further study showed that HGMC effectively eliminated renal histological damage in mice with hyperuricemia. Real-time PCR and western blot results revealed that HGMC alleviated protein levels of inflammation-associated proteins and cellular pyroptosis-associated proteins, including NLRP3, TNF-alpha, Caspase1 and TGF-beta. Intestinal microbial sequencing showed that supplementation of HGMC increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria and decreased pathogenic flora. In conclusion, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of HGMC on hyperuricemia are associated with regulating inflammation and modulating intestinal bacteria in mice.

AB  - Coffee pulp has been included in ruminant diets; but until now, little has been known about how the addition of ensiled coffee pulp (ECP) affects the growth performance of lambs. This study explores the diet's antioxidant capacity, tannins, and caffeine concentration and its effect on water intake, growth performance, rumen variables, in vivo digestibility, nitrogen balance, and carcass and meat characteristics of lambs fed ECP. Thirty-six male Pelibuey lambs were distributed randomly to one of three treatments (n = 12): without ECP0; diet with 10% ECP10, and diet with 20% ECP20. The diets' antioxidant capacity, tannins, and caffeine concentration were similar (p > 0.05) for all treatments. The diets' antioxidant compounds and the blood serum's antioxidant capacity were affected (p < 0.05). Dry matter and water intake, body-weight gain, and feed conversion were not significant (p > 0.05). No differences (p > 0.05) were found in the rumen variables or the nitrogen balance. However, the in vivo digestibility of crude protein was affected (p < 0.05). Carcass and meat quality were not affected (p > 0.05) by the inclusion of ECP, except temperature and redness (a*) at seven days of storage, respectively. Including up to 20% of ECP in the diet of lambs did not affect the growth performance, rumen variables, or nitrogen balance; however, the antioxidant compounds of the diets, the antioxidant capacity in blood serum, and the in vivo digestibility of crude protein were different. There was an increase in the redness (a*) and lower temperature in the Longissimus dorsi muscle, keeping lightness (L*), yellowness (b*), water-holding capacity, and texture at seven storage days.

AB  - Saponins make up an important group of natural glycosidic compounds which are distinguished by triterpene or steroidal aglycone. Although widely distributed in terrestrial flora, especially higher plants, they can also be found in some marine organisms. Cytotoxic activity is one of the most frequently reported from a wide array of pharmacological activities known for these metabolites. The current review is an update of our previous paper-Saponins as cytotoxic agents (Podolak et al. Phytochem Rev 9:425-474, 2010), and covers studies that were since published (2010-2021). This part refers to triterpene saponins and complements the first, which was devoted solely to steroidal saponins (Sobolewska et al. Phytochem Rev 19:139-189, 2020). Cytotoxic activities in vitro and in vivo are presented with a main focus on structure-activity relationships and molecular mechanisms of action.

AB  - Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus Temminck, 1847) is one of the Asian elephant sub-species distributed in Sumatera Island and classified as endangered species due to hunting and high habitat fragmentation. This study aimed to analyze the genetic relationship of Sumatran elephants based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cyt b). Blood samples were collected from 11 elephants in Seblat Natural Ecotourism Park. Based on mt-DNA Cytochrome b gene analysis, low genetic diversity was found in the Sumatran elephant population, indicated by 99-100% sequence similarity among elephant samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all elephants were in the same clade and has a close relationship with Borneo elephants. Additionally, the Median-joining network illustrated only two haplotypes in the Sumatran elephant population. The low genetic diversity of the Sumatran elephant indicates that a strategic breeding program should be seriously taken into account to prevent the Sumatran elephant from extinction.

AB  - Developing modern circular agriculture is one of the important ways to promote agricultural sustainable development, facilitating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations. However, when agricultural production operators constructed particular systems, they often lacked accurate data support and parameter matching. Consequently, problems such as unknown input and output, low circulation efficiency, and lack of comprehensive evaluation occurred, increasing challenges for efficient circulation of the systems. Therefore, based on sufficient data collection and field investigation, this research integrated emergy analysis and life cycle assessment to conduct sustainability evaluation on the modern Straw-Sheep-Cropland agro-pastoral circular system. Then the system was optimized by means of coupling parameter adjustment and key technology regulation. The results showed that the whole system required lower total emergy input after optimization. And the total weighted value of potential environmental impacts of the optimized system was 47.12% of that of the original system. Meanwhile, annual environmental service emergy in air, water, and soil was reduced significantly compared with the original one. In general, the optimized system had good performance in reduction, reuse, and controllability, so its sustainability was also high. This research formed a systematic method suitable for evaluating and optimizing the modern agro-pastoral circular system, which provided accurate guidance for the scientific construction and sustainable development of circular agriculture systems.

AB  - Hyperlipidemia and hypertension are modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. About 25% of adults over age 65 use both antihypertensives (AHTs) and statins to treat these conditions. Recent research in humans suggests that their combined use may delay or prevent dementia onset. However, it is not clear whether and how combination treatment may benefit brain function. To begin to address this question, we examined effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), administration on memory function, anxiety-like behavior, adult hippocampal neurogenesis and angiogenesis in adult and middle-aged male C57Bl/6J mice. In adult mice (3-months-old) combination (combo) treatment, as well as administration of each compound individually, for six weeks, accelerated memory extinction in contextual fear conditioning. However, pattern separation in the touchscreen-based location discrimination test, a behavior linked to adult hippocampal neurogenesis, was unchanged. In addition, dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis and vascularization were unaffected. In middle-aged mice (10-months-old) combo treatment had no effect on spatial memory in the Morris water maze, but did reduce anxiety in the open field test. A potential underlying mechanism may be the modest increase in new hippocampal neurons (similar to 20%) in the combo as compared to the control group. DG vascularization was not altered. Overall, our findings suggest that statin and anti-hypertensive treatment may serve as a potential pharmacotherapeutic approach for anxiety, in particular for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients who have impairments in extinction of aversive memories.

AB  - Although previous studies have shown that an enriched environment (EE) promotes neurogenesis and alters DNA and histone modifications, it remains largely unknown whether an EE affects epitranscriptome in the context of neuronal development. Here, we showed that EE exposure enhanced the pool of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSPCs) and promoted neuronal differentiation of aNSPCs. EE exposure also improved cognitive capabilities and altered the expression of genes relating to neuronal development, neurogenesis, and memory. N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (MeRIP-seq) data analysis revealed that EE exposure increased the global level of m(6)A and led to differential m(6)A mRNA modification. Differential m(6)A modification-associated genes are involved in neuronal development, neurogenesis, and so on. Notably, EE exposure decreased the protein level of m(6)A eraser Fto, but did not affect the protein level of m(6)A writers METTL3 and METTL14. Taken together, our results suggest that enriched environment exposure induces differential m(6)A mRNA modification and adds a novel layer to the interaction between the environment and epigenetics in the context of postnatal neuronal development.

AB  - Consumers all over the world incorporate natural phytochemicals into their diets on a regular basis in order to maintain and improve health and prevent diseases. Athletes and sports professionals are increasingly turning to naturally occurring plant extracts and phytochemicals to boost physical performance, aid in workout recovery, and maintain health. Even though exercise has numerous scientifically proven health benefits, it can also be compared to a double-edged sword in which low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and generation induce beneficial physiological adaptation in working skeletal muscles, whereas high levels of ROS may harm critical cellular structures. However, Rooibos, a native South African herbal tea with unique polyphenolic components and bioactivities, has the ability to increase the endogenous antioxidant defense system and neutralize ROS. A growing body of evidence suggests that Rooibos may be useful as an ergogenic aid, offering athletes and the greater fitness community an efficacious product. Previously, Rooibos has been linked to anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, and other health benefits. In this narrative review, we primarily focus on published human intervention studies that evaluated Rooibos' ergogenic aid potential, its modulatory effect on healthy persons' antioxidant defense systems and improved exercise outcomes.

AB  - Background: Diarrhea and intestinal dysfunction commonly occur in young mammals, causing malnutrition and growth retardation in both human and livestock. As the traditional Chinese herb, mulberry leaf contains various bioactive compounds and showed several health benefits, such as regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and modulating gut microbiota. Mulberry leaf exhibits the potential to modulate redox homeostasis and improve gut health, but the function and underlying mechanisms remains elucidative. Purpose: To investigate the benefit of mulberry leaf on intestinal barrier in weanling pigs, illustrate the possible involvement of Keap1-Nrf2 mediated anti-oxidation and gut microbiota. Methods: Chemical compositions of mulberry leaf powder (MLP) and mulberry leaf extract (MLE) were determined. The effects of MLP on growth performance, intestinal barrier integrity, anti-oxidative capacity, immune function and gut microbiota were evaluated in weaned pigs. The regulation of redox homeostasis by MLE and the involvement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling were further determined in H2O2 induced oxidative stress (OS) model in IPEC-J2 cells via determining reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by flow cytometry and related protein abundance by western blot analysis. Results: In weanling pigs, MLP reduced diarrhea incidence, and increased villus height, intestinal integrity and expression of tight junctions in intestinal mucosa. The improvement of intestinal barrier by MLP was associated with the enhancement in anti-oxidative capacity and the changes in gut microbiota and related short chain fatty acids production. Our study further revealed the direct regulation of MLE on tight junction expressions and ROS production to alleviate H2O2 induced OS in IPEC-J2 cells via the activating Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway. Conclusions: Mulberry leaf in diet improved epithelial barrier via the direct anti-oxidation through the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway and the indirect modulation of gut microbiota in weaned pigs.

AB  - Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) is an important pest of cruciferous plants, which is harmful all over the world, causing serious economic losses, and its drug resistance is increasing rapidly. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a green control method and does not cause resistance. In this study, transcriptomics and bioinformatics were used to explore the effects of irradiation on the reproductive function of Plutella xylostella, and the response mechanism of sterility under irradiation was initially revealed. We identified 3342 (1682 up-regulated, 1660 down-regulated), 1963 (1042 up-regulated, 921 down-regulated) and 1531 (721 up-regulated, 810 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 200 Gy vs CK (Control Check), 400 Gy vs CK and 400 Gy vs 200 Gy groups, respectively. GO and KEGG analyses were performed for DEGs in each group. The results showed that 200 Gy activated the downstream phosphorylation pathway and inhibited the cytochrome p450 immune response mechanism. 400 Gy promoted protein decomposition and absorption pathways, autophagy pathways, etc. Down-regulated genes were concentrated in the transformation process of energy metabolizing substances such as ATP, phosphorylation signaling pathway, and insulin, while up-regulated genes were concentrated in biological regulation and metabolic processes. Eight genes in the phosphorylation pathway were selected for qRT-PCR verification, and the results showed that the phosphorylation of different dose groups was regulated in different ways. 400 Gy used positive feedback regulation, while the phosphorylation of F1 used negative feedback regulation.

AB  - Indirect plant defense may be mediated by volatiles released after oviposition and/or herbivory or by exogenous application of plant hormones such as methyl jasmonate (MeJa), signaling host presence to parasitoids. There is still incipient information regarding phytohormone action on crop plant defense, especially among tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L., Solanaceae) and the parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). We aimed to evaluate T. pretiosum chemotaxis and parasitism in response to eggs and tomato plants exposed to Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelichiidae) oviposition and herbivory, with and without MeJa. We conducted laboratory (olfactometry and parasitism) and semi-field (parasitism) bioassays with T. pretiosum in response to treatments with MeJa (0.5 mM) applied to tomato plants, and the interaction with its host, on plants with T. absoluta oviposition and herbivory. Methyl jasmonate presence directly on eggs did not affect T. pretiosum chemotaxis and parasitism. However, it did intensify this natural enemy's foraging behavior and parasitism when applied to the plant. Therefore, the use of MeJa in the T. absoluta and T. pretiosum tomato system may be beneficial, increasing parasitoid recognition and parasitism. Strategies aimed at improving biological control combined with environmentally friendly techniques, such as the use of phytohormones, are of utmost importance towards more sustainable agriculture.

AB  - In Japan, Camellia japonica and Camellia rusticana are naturally distributed. Despite differences in their habitats and morphologies, they have been classified by various researchers as either varieties, subspecies, or species. The taxonomic position of C. japonica and C. rusticana remain unclear because morphological comparisons have been restricted to limited areas and quantitative data are scarce. C. rusticana grows in snowy places, unlike C. japonica. While C. japonica displays ornithophily, C. rusticana displays entomophily. Both species have adapted to different growing environments and pollinators, which have altered the morphology of flowers and leaves. We therefore quantitatively estimated the differentiation between these two taxa by comparing the morphologies of leaf hypodermis, flower form, petal color, and filament color in twenty populations. Our findings allowed us to differentiate these two species by the presence or absence of a leaf hypodermis. We also discovered an intermediate type of leaf hypodermis, which might also be caused by hybridization. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the flower morphologies between these species were significantly different. The petal and filament colors were also significantly different. Our quantitative analysis suggests that speciation caused by differences in both pollinators and environment is one of the factors involved in this group. These findings in C. japonica and C. rusticana help to explain speciation processes for other species as well. Copyright (C) 2020 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background The use of beneficial microorganisms as an alternative for pest control has gained increasing attention. The objective of this study was to screen beneficial rhizosphere bacteria with the ability to enhance tomato anti-herbivore resistance. Results Rhizosphere bacteria in tomato field from Fuqing, one of the four locations where rhizosphere bacteria were collected in Fujian, China, enhanced tomato resistance against the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura, an important polyphagous pest. Inoculation with the isolate T6-4 obtained from the rhizosphere of tomato field in Fuqing reduced leaf damage and weight gain of S. litura larvae fed on the leaves of inoculated tomato plants by 27% in relative to control. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence identities indicated that the isolate T6-4 was closely related to Stenotrophomonas rhizophila supported with 99.37% sequence similarity. In the presence of S. litura infestation, inoculation with the bacterium led to increases by a 66.9% increase in protease inhibitor activity, 53% in peroxidase activity and 80% in polyphenol oxidase activity in the leaves of inoculated plants as compared to the un-inoculated control. Moreover, the expression levels of defense-related genes encoding allene oxide cyclase (AOC), allene oxide synthase (AOS), lipoxygenase D (LOXD) and proteinase inhibitor (PI-II) in tomato leaves were induced 2.2-, 1.7-, 1.4- and 2.7-fold, respectively by T6-4 inoculation. Conclusion These results showed that the tomato rhizosphere soils harbor beneficial bacteria that can systemically induce jasmonate-dependent anti-herbivore resistance in tomato plants.

AB  - Little is known about how different plant-based diets influence the insect herbivores' oral secretion (OS) composition and eventually the plant defense responses. We analyzed the OS composition of the generalist Lepidopteran insect, Helicoverpa armigera feeding on the host plant tomato (OSH), non-host plant capsicum (OSNH), and artificial diet (OSAD) using Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. Higher numbers and levels of alkaloids and terpenoids were observed in OSH and OSNH, respectively while OSAD was rich in phospholipids. Interestingly, treatment of H. armigera OSAD, OSH and OSNH on wounded tomato leaves showed differential expression of (i) genes involved in JA and SA biosynthesis and their responsive genes, and (ii) biosynthetic pathway genes of chlorogenic acid (CGA) and trehalose, which exhibited increased accumulation along with several other plant defensive metabolites. Specifically, high levels of CGA were detected after OSH and OSNH treatments in tomato leaves. There was higher expression of the genes involved in phenyl-propanoid biosynthesis, which may lead to the increased accumulation of CGA and related metabolites. In the insect bioassay, CGA significantly inhibited H. armigera larval growth. Our results underline the differential accumulation of plant and insect OS metabolites and identified potential plant metabolite(s) affecting insect growth and development.

AB  - Free-range and confined feeding are typical farming strategies that produce vastly different outcomes in pig immune development. In this study, we extensively evaluated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from individually raised Meishan pigs under two distinct conditions: normal captivity (NC) and arch soil free-range (ASF), using single-cell sequencing technology. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the influence of various farming approaches on immune cell development. Our analysis identified 11 immune cell subtypes. Using differential gene analysis, we demonstrated that ASF produced the largest impact on the B cells and gamma delta T cell (gamma delta T cells) transcriptional profile, with subsequent impact on na & iuml;ve CD4+ T cells and na & iuml;ve CD8+ T cells. Based on our IL-16 network central analysis, relative to NC cells, signals obtained by B cells, effector and memory CD4+ T cells, and na & iuml;ve CD4+ T cells were drastically diminished in the ASF cells. Additionally, we conducted an extensive network analysis using CellChat, and demonstrated a marked augmentation of axes related to cellular signal transduction and immunologic activity, including IL-16, RESISTIN, and MIF, among ASF cells. This indicated that various farming approaches differently impacted pig immune activity, and this process was primarily mediated by cell-cell communication. In conclusion, these findings not only enhance the available knowledge of the association between farming approaches and immune modulation, but also provide essential information for the sustainable establishment of animal husbandry and animal health management.

AB  - A new species of gall midge, Gagnemyia alstoniae Adair and Kolesik, is described from flower bud galls on milkwood tree Alstonia actinophylla (A. Cunn.) K. Schum. in far northern Australia. Galled flower buds fail to open and set seed. Larva, pupa, male, and female of the new species are described and illustrated. A new genus, Gagnemyia Adair and Kolesik, is proposed to contain the new species. Gagnemyia is tentatively placed in the tribe Clinodiplosini and is characterised by a robust aedeagus bearing asetose sensilla, an undivided male hypoproct that is wrapped around the aedeagus, a needle-like ovipositor, toothed tarsal claws and larval terminus bearing two pairs of corniform and two pairs of setiform papillae. This is the first record for Cecidomyiidae feeding on Apocynaceae in Australia.

AB  - Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is an injury caused by overuse of the Achilles tendon or sudden force on the Achilles tendon, with a considerable inflammatory infiltrate. As Achilles tendinopathy progresses, inflammation and inflammatory factors affect the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tendon. Gastrodin(Gas), the main active ingredient of Astrodia has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally decellularized extracellular matrix(dECM)material and has a high content of growth factors as well as good biocompatibility. However, the reparative effects of SIS and Gas on Achilles tendinopathy and their underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, it is found that SIS hydrogel loaded with gastrodin restored the mechanical strength of the Achilles tendon, facilitated ECM remodeling, and restored ordered collagen arrangement by promoting the translocation of protein synthesis. It also decreases the expression of inflammatory factors and reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells by inhibiting the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. It is believed that through further research, Gas + SIS may be used in the future for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy and other Achilles tendon injury disorders.
   Cell-free pig small intestinal submucosa synthesized by a drug delivery system for the Achilles tendon injury repair, SIS hydrogel load gastrodin inhibits the NF-kappa B signaling pathways, reduces inflammation, promotes the extracellular matrix remodeling, promotes tendon regeneration process. image

AB  - Injury by herbivores is a major biotic stress that limits soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] crop production. Among the main soybean insect pests, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner is responsible for causing significant economic damage in soybean. The primary management strategy for this insect is chemical control and use of Bt transgenic soybean. Alternative strategies, such as host plant resistance, are considered an efficient and less-aggressive method, especially in association with other strategies as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. In this study, we evaluated 30 soybean genotypes to verify antixenosis expression through oviposition, attractiveness, and food consumption tests. From this, we selected 13 promising genotypes to verify the possible presence of antibiosis. Our results suggest that antixenosis was found in genotypes 'TMG 133' RR, 'TMG 1179' RR, 'IAC 19', 'IAC 17', 'IAC 100', D75-10169, and IAC 78-2318. By influence on behavior and negative impact on larval viability, antixenosis and antibiosis were indicated for the genotypes IAC 74-2832, 'IAC 19', 'IAC 17', 'IAC 100', and PI 274454. 'TMG 7062' IPRO was found to provide antibiosis resistance by negatively affecting larval development and viability. Because of reduced food consumption by larvae, antixenosis was indicated for 'IAC 24'. These genotypes should be considered in soybean breeding programs focusing on soybean resistance to A. gemmatalis.

AB  - Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and Myrrh (Commiphora Myrrha) essential oils (EOs) stand out for their benefits in terms of health and functionality. Buffalo set yogurt enriched with different concentrations of EOs (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9%) were investigated. The effects of addition on sensory, syneresis, antibacterial activity, and bioactive properties (total phenol content and antioxidant activity) of yogurt were studied. The most acceptable organoleptic properties of treated yogurt were those samples treated with Eucalyptus oil. The levels of syneresis were decreased by increasing the concentration of EOs. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, and total phenolic content were enhanced by increasing the concentration of EOs. Yogurt with 0.9% Eucalyptus oil showed the highest antioxidant activity and total phenolic content. The same concentration of Eucalyptus oil showed the highest antibacterial activity against S. typhimurium (the inhibition zone was 20.63 mm) then E. coli (the inhibition zone was 19.43 mm). On the other hand, the highest antibacterial effect against L. monocytogene was for Myrrh oil-enriched yogurt by 0.9% and the inhibition zone was 19.21 mm. The obtained results showed that Eucalyptus and Myrrh oils can be applied to yogurt to improve its beneficial properties in terms of physical characteristics and for human health due to their antioxidant activity and phenolic materials.

AB  - The Arabidopsis MAP Kinases (MAPKs) MPK6 and MPK3 and orthologs in other plants function as major stress signaling hubs. MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation and are negatively regulated by MAPK-inactivating phosphatases (MIPPs), which alter the intensity and duration of MAPK signaling via dephosphorylation. Un-like in other plant species, jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation in Arabidopsis is apparently not MPK6- and MPK3- dependent, so their role in JA-mediated defenses against herbivorous insects is unclear. Here we explore whether changes in MPK6/3 phosphorylation kinetics in Arabidopsis MIPP mutants lead to changes in hormone synthesis and resistance against herbivores. The MIPPs MKP1, DsPTP1, PP2C5, and AP2C1 have been implicated in re-sponses to infection, drought, and osmotic stress, which all impinge on JA-mediated defenses. In loss-of-function mutants, we found that the four MIPPs alter wound-induced MPK6/3 phosphorylation kinetics and affect the accumulation of the defense hormones JA, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid, as compared to wild type plants (Col -0). Moreover, MPK6/3 misregulation in MIPP or MAPK mutant plants resulted in slight changes in the resistance to Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera exigua larvae as compared to Col-0. Our data indicate that MPK6/3 and the four MIPPs moderately contribute to wound signaling and defense against herbivorous insects in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Generating stable livestock pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be used for complex genome editing, cellular agriculture, gamete generation, regenerative medicine and in vitro breeding schemes. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in characterizing pluripotency markers for livestock species. In this study, we investigated embryo development and gene expression of the core pluripotency triad (OCT4, NANOG, SOX2) and cell lineage commitment markers (REX1, CDX2, GATA4) in the presence of three small molecules and their combination [PD0325901 (FGF inhibitor), SB431542 (TGF beta inhibitor), and CHIR99021 (GSK3B inhibitor)] from day 2-7 post-insemination in goat. Significant reduction in rate of blastocyst formation was observed when SB was used along with PD or CHIR and their three combinations had more sever effect. SB and CHIR decreased the expression of SOX2 while increasing the GATA4 expression. PD decrease the relative expression of NANOG, OCT4 and GATA4, while increased the expression of REX1. Among the combination of two molecules, only SB + CHIR combination significantly decreased the expression of GATA4, while the combination of the three molecules significantly decreases the expression of NANOG, SOX2 and CDX2. According to these results, the inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway, by PD may lead to blocking the hypoblast formation as observed by reduction of GATA4. OCT4 and NANOG expressions did not show signs of maintenance pluripotency. GATA4, NANOG and OCT4 in the PD group were downregulated and REX1 as EPI-marker was upregulated thus REX1 may be considered as a marker of EPI/ICM in goat.

AB  - Simple Summary An understanding of tabanid alighting and feeding behavior on vertebrate hosts may result in more effective disease management and control strategies. The purpose of this study was to determine the tabanid behavior of beef cattle. The alighting behavior, time of day, duration of tabanid feeding on beef cattle, as well as variables associated with tabanid infestation, were recorded. According to the results, the lower leg was the most tabanids infested location. The greatest number of tabanids landing on cattle occurred at midday. Temperature was the most important factor for tabanids landing on hosts. To forecast the tabanids' reactions to environmental factors, regression analysis was carried out.Abstract Tabanidae (horse flies and deer flies) are hematophagous insects that cause direct and indirect damage to animal production. The aims of this study were to determine the preferred site, time of day, and duration of tabanid feeding on beef cattle and identify factors related to infestation by tabanids. The population of tabanids was surveyed on certain body parts of the beef cattle (fore udder, tail, navel, leg, dewlap, body, and under) during the morning hours (9.00-10.30 a.m.), midday (12.00-13.30 a.m.), and afternoon (15.30-17.00 p.m.) every day for 10 days. The findings showed that two genera, Tabanus Linnaeus, 1758, and Chrysops Meigen, 1803, landed on the cows. The leg was statistically significantly the most frequent landing site for tabanids (15.067 +/- 7.54) compared with other parts. The average feeding duration for each insect was 2.76 +/- 1.77 min. The results showed that a significant number of tabanids were present during midday, as compared with the morning and afternoon. Temperature was found to be positively associated with fly abundance. A regression model was derived in this study (y = 4.23x - 116.09). This information is important for tabanid control and prevention in beef cattle.

AB  - Accumulation of hair waste is a major burden to the leather industry, causing a negative impact on the industry's sustainable development. The industry is already bogged down by the usage of synthetic re-tanning agents that are not only extremely challenging for biodegradation but also release free-form of formaldehyde in the final leather stage. This research work focuses on developing a formaldehyde-free bio-based re-tanning agent from hair waste. In order to do so, hair waste is subjected to alkali hydrolysis and subsequently graft-copolymerized with methacrylic acid (MAA). These treatments were optimal using 20 % (w/w) sodium hydroxide and thermal activity at 90 degrees C. This resulted in effective hydrolysis of red sheep hair, which was the ideal candidate in this study. The hydrolysate was subjected to monomer in situ polymerization (using MAA) with potassium per sulfate/sodium meta-bisulphite redox system, leading to the development of keratin hydrolysate-g-methacrylic acid (KH-g-MA) copolymer (this was noted both at a laboratory level and pilot scale). The obtained KH-g-MA copolymer exhibited ideal characteristics such as increased protein content (78.3 +/- 1.2), appropriate particle size (1516 nm), suitable pH (5) and required viscosity of 512 cP. The developed KH-g-MA copolymer was then applied as a re-tanning agent in the leather manufacturing process. Significant improvement in leather's mechanical strength characteristics was observed. In addition, the organoleptic properties of leather such as fullness, softness and grain tightness showed much improvement. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed an enhanced surface smoothness and filling of the voids in experimental leather in comparison to the control leather. This recycle and reuse strategy of hair waste not only helps resolve issues with handling of hair solid waste but also results in producing an eco-friendly re-tanning agent in leather manufacturing, thereby paving the way for cyclic economic utilization and cleaner environment.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), recently underwent a notable range-expansion event in western Canada, resulting in access to the novel host jack pine, Pinus banksiana Lamb. We assessed the suitability of jack pine for mountain pine beetle, as well as the historic host lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm., and the non-Pinus host white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, to help inform an assessment of the risk of future spread into Canada's boreal forest and to further our understanding of host use in bark beetles. Several performance traits we measured were similar between lodgepole pine and jack pine, but gallery length and productivity indicated that lodgepole pine was the more suitable host. Development appeared to be faster in jack pine; however, in contrast to previous studies, we attribute it to oviposition arresting earlier in the novel host compared to the other hosts and not a difference in development rate. Initial productivity was surprisingly high in spruce, but we found evidence of a delayed negative effect that manifested as reduced cold tolerance, delayed development, and high mortality of late-instar larvae. Although jack pine is a suitable host for the mountain pine beetle, our results indicate that the beetle's eruptive potential could be lower in jack pine compared to lodgepole pine, given all other factors are equal. Other factors that may also affect mountain pine beetle population dynamics require additional research and include the composition and structure of jack pine forests, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions.

AB  - Endometrial receptivity is critical for the successful establishment of pregnancy in ruminants. Interferon tau (IFNT) plays a key role in promoting embryo attachment by activating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, which induces the expression of a series of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In our previous study, sequencing analysis of goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) treated with 20 ng/mL IFNT revealed a differentially expressed long non-coding RNA located on the STAT3 antisense chain, which we designated STAT3-AS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of STAT3-AS in establishing endometrial receptivity in goats. The results showed that STAT3-AS was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of gEECs, and its expression increased significantly in the uterus on day 15 of pregnancy. STAT3AS expression was upregulated in gEECs treated with IFNT alone or in combination with progesterone and estradiol. Knockdown of STAT3-AS using specific short interfering RNA significantly inhibited the expression of classical ISGs such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 and 2 ',5 '-oligodenylate synthetase 2, as well as uterine endometrial receptivity-related genes including homeobox gene A11, integrin beta 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, gEEC proliferation and the STAT3 pathway were suppressed in the absence of STAT3AS. However, pretreatment with the STAT3 activator RO8191 restored the effect of silencing STAT3-AS on endometrial receptivity. Overall, these results suggest that STAT3-AS is an important regulator of endometrial receptivity in goats and that it regulates endometrial receptivity through the STAT3 pathway.

AB  - Recent studies on intergenerational transmission of learning and memory performances demonstrated that parental spatial training before fertilization could facilitate learning and memory in the offspring, but many questions remain unclarified. Essential issues regarding whether and how long the effects of parental training in a task can last in several generations, and whether learning a task repeated in the successive generations can enhance a load of multigenerational effects. In the present study, the spatial performances of F1 and F2 generations of male offspring of fathers or grandfathers spatially trained in the Morris Water Maze were evaluated and compared with the performance of a control sample matched for age and sex. Further, to investigate the memory process in F1 and F2 male offspring, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p-ERK1/2 and acetylated histone 3 lysine 14 (H3K14) expression levels in the hippocampus were analyzed. The findings showed that paternal training reduced escape latencies and increased time spent in the target quadrant by F1 and F2 male offspring. Besides, paternal spatial training repeated in two generations did not enhance the beneficial effects on offspring's spatial performances. These findings were supported by neurobiologic data showing that paternal training increased BDNF and p-ERK1/2 in the hippocampus of F1 and F2 male offspring. Furthermore, the hippocampal level of acetylated H3K14 increased in the offspring of spatially trained fathers, reinforcing the hypothesis that the augmented histone acetylation might play an essential role in the inheritance of spatial competence.

AB  - Crop sanitation (removal of host plant debris) is often recommended for managing arthropod pests in adjacent crop fields and/or subsequent crop cycles by limiting their food sources. However, the responses of insect pests to deteriorating food conditions in post-harvest fields remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of food shortage on the fitness of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) larvae, quantifying their sensitivity to varying severities and durations of semistarvation and complete food deprivation. Our fitted models supported our hypothesis that larval fitness declines proportionally with reduced food consumption prior to deprivation, indicating a lack of adaptive physiological changes to mitigate starvation. We also found that starved larvae could forage and recover to some extent if refeeding occurred promptly. Surprisingly, the lingering time of larvae that failed to pupate was not consistently longer under milder starvation. These multi-faceted evidences demonstrate the importance of thorough post-harvest crop sanitation in local pest control, given their high sensitivity to food availability and limited capacity for recovery. This study contributes to practical pest management strategies and enhances our understanding of starvation biology in herbivorous insects.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer<acute accent>s (AD) and physiological ageing are characterized by a decline in neurogenesis and in the polysialylated isoforms of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) expression within the hippocampus and specifically in the dentate gyrus (DG). In the 3xTG-AD mouse model, which mimics the human disease in both pathological and behavioral features, this decline in PSA-NCAM is associated with the presence of A(3 plaques at 9 months and Tau tangles at 12-15 months. In this work we studied the presence of PSA-NCAM at early ages (1-6 months) in the same model. Our results demonstrated that even as early as the first month of age there is a strong decrease in PSA-NCAM dendritic tree mainly altering the molecular layer (MolL) coverage affecting the synaptic plasticity and furthermore confirmed by the reduction of PSA-NCAM area density (Sv) in the 3xTG-AD. Similar and more marked early changes were seen during aging in both NTG and 3xTg-AD animals. Our results demonstrate for the first time a precipitate decrease of PSA-NCAM cells at such very early phases of the disease. This result suggests an early effect of the disease in the progression of immature and pluripotent cells resulting in an ulterior and early diminution of neurogenesis and therefore an impaired hippocampal cellular and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - This study develops a toolkit of sustainability indicators to analyze the economic, environmental, and social performance of various pasture-based production systems rearing Karagkouniko sheep (both specialized and mixed), and compares it with the intensive Lacaune production system in the same region. The analysis showed that despite the lower milk productivity, the group of specialized livestock Karagkouniko farms was more profitable compared to the Lacaune (35% higher net profit) production system, mainly due to savings in purchased feedstuff (64% lower expenses). This implies that grazing-if properly managed-can indeed enhance the profitability of farms. The group of mixed Karagkouniko farms-cultivating crops for both feedstuff and markets-was the least profitable group (-144.76 per ewe) as well as the least efficient in terms of use of energy (EUR 4.66 of output per EUR 1 of energy cost) and agrochemical inputs (537.2 kg of fertilizers and 3.3 liters of pesticides per ha). This suggests that strong organizational skills are required to effectively manage both crop and livestock production. Trade-offs were also observed between the sustainability dimensions. To address these trade-offs and ensure a transition to more sustainable agriculture, a comprehensive framework should be developed, integrating a mix of socioeconomic and agro-environmental schemes.

AB  - A considerable amount of the food is wasted each year, creating an urgent global problem with negative economic and environmental effects. Livestock manure, a by-product of intensive animal farming, can contribute to environmental issues if not properly managed. While biochar, a product of pyrolysis, can speed up the composting process and improve compost quality, sawdust is frequently used in composting to balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. This study aimed to investigate the effects of biochar on compost quality in co-composting food waste and swine manure and the influence of raw materials in obtaining good quality ecofriendly compost. Experimental manipulations were conducted both with feedstock materials present and absent. The findings revealed that a biochar concentration of 6% had a positive impact on the composting process. Furthermore, the presence or absence of feedstocks influenced the composting rate and the quality of the compost. Through the addition of biochar, moisture balance and porosity were improved, promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms. Organic waste can be managed more sustainably and agricultural systems may be improved by keeping it out of landfills and composting it with biochar. According to this study, a proper balance of feedstock composition is equally important to the addition of biochar. The study contributes to the understanding of the composting process and the role of balancing feedstock components for the production of good quality compost.

AB  - Blister blight, caused by the fungus Exobasidium vexans, is a major disease affecting tea plants. This study aimed to isolate and evaluate the efficacy of endophytic bacterial strains as potential biocontrol agents against the disease. Thirteen endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from healthy tea plants collected in Thach That, Hanoi, Vietnam. Six of these strains exhibited antagonistic effects against E. vexans, with strains R8 and S2 showing the highest inhibition. Heat-treated bacterial supernatants lost their antifungal activity, indicating that the inhibitory compounds were protein-based. Strain R8, identified as Bacillus subtilis, also demonstrated plant growth-promoting traits, including the production of Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and phosphate solubilization. Greenhouse trials showed that both chemical fungicides and antagonistic bacteria significantly reduced disease incidence, with the preventative application of chemical fungicide being the most effective (control efficacy of about 91.05%), followed by preventative inoculation with antagonistic bacteria (82.77%). Additionally, treated plots yielded significantly more fresh tea shoots, with an increase of 19.02% and 21.17% for antagonistic bacteria and chemical fungicide treatments, respectively, compared to the control. These findings suggest that B. subtilis R8 holds promise as a biocontrol agent, providing both disease suppression and yield enhancement in tea cultivation.

AB  - Cadmium is a carcinogen that can induce ER stress, DNA damage, oxidative stress and cell death. The yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways paly crucial roles in response to various stresses. Here, we demonstrate that the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway and the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway are all essential for yeast cells to defend against the cadmium-induced toxicity, including the elevated ROS and cell death levels induced by cadmium. We show that the UPR pathway is required for the cadmium-induced phosphorylation of HOG_MAPK Hog1 but not for CWI_MAPK Slt2, while Slt2 but not Hog1 is required for the activation of the UPR pathway through the transcription factors of Swi6 and Rlm1. Moreover, deletion of HAC1 and IRE1 could promote the nuclear accumulation of Hog1, and increase the cytosolic and bud neck localisation of Slt2, indicating crucial roles of Hog1 and Slt2 in regulating the cellular process in the absence of UPR pathway. Altogether, our findings highlight the significance of these two MAPK pathways of HOG and CWI and their interrelationship with the UPR pathway in responding to cadmium-induced toxicity in budding yeast.

AB  - Simple Summary The production of piglets can cause stress particularly during the challenging transition of weaning them from sow's milk to solid feed in a production setting. Supporting piglet feeding is essential to maintain overall health and growth performance, which is influenced by multiple factors. Key to driving feed intake is the release of an appetite-inducing hormone that propels animals to feed until they are full, triggering a hormone for feed cessation. Supporting the function of feed hormone release offers the potential to help piglets transition from sow's milk to solid foods more readily. This work assessed how a combination of feed additives may potentially influence nutrient utilisation and feed hormone levels on a cellular level. The results highlight how the inclusion of a blend of key feed additives in diets may support weaning piglets through higher levels of feed hormone release and nutrient utilisation compared to traditional butyrate feed additive alone.Abstract In piglets, it is observed that early weaning can lead to poor weight gain due to an underdeveloped gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is unsuitable for an efficient absorption of nutrients. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate have demonstrated their ability to improve intestinal development by increasing cell proliferation, which is vital during this transition period when the small and large intestinal tracts are rapidly growing. Previous reports on butyrate inclusion in feed demonstrated significantly increased feed intakes (FIs) and average daily gains (ADGs) during piglet weaning. Similar benefits in piglet performance have been observed with the inclusion of yeast cell wall in diets. A proprietary mix of yeast cell wall, SCFAs, and zinc proteinate (YSM) was assessed here in vitro to determine its impact on cellular growth, metabolism and appetite-associated hormones in ex vivo small intestinal pig cells and STC-1 mouse intestinal neuroendocrine cells. Intestinal cells demonstrated greater cell densities with the addition of YSM (150 ppm) compared to the control and butyrate (150 ppm) at 24 h. This coincided with the higher utilisation of both protein and glucose from the media of intestinal cells receiving YSM. Ghrelin (an appetite-inducing hormone) demonstrated elevated levels in the YSM-treated cells on a protein and gene expression level compared to the cells receiving butyrate and the control, while satiety hormone peptide YY protein levels were lower in the cells receiving YSM compared to the control and butyrate-treated cells across each time point. Higher levels of ghrelin and lower PYY secretion in cells receiving YSM may drive the uptake of protein and glucose, which is potentially facilitated by elevated gene transporters for protein and glucose. Greater ghrelin levels observed with the inclusion of YSM may contribute to higher cell densities that could support pig performance to a greater extent than butyrate alone.

AB  - Background Recent research has indicated that parental use of central nervous system-targeting medications during periconceptional periods may affect offspring across various developmental and behavioral domains. The present study sought to investigate the potential influence of paternal use of donepezil, a specific reversible central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that activates the cholinergic system to promote cognition, on offspring.
   Results In this study, male rats were bred after 21 days of oral donepezil administration at a dose of 4 mg/kg to generate F1 offspring. Both male and female F-1 offspring displayed enhanced performance in learning and short-term memory tests, including novel object recognition, Y maze, and operant learning. Transcriptomic analysis revealed notable alterations in genes associated with the extracellular matrix in the hippocampal tissue of the F1 generation. Integration with genes related to intelligence identified potential core genes that may be involved in the observed behavioral enhancements.
   Conclusions These findings indicate that prolonged paternal exposure to donepezil may enhance the learning and memory abilities of offspring, possibly by targeting nonneural, extracellular regions. Further research is required to fully elucidate any potential transgenerational effects.

AB  - The Southeastern Coastal Hinterland geomorphic province of South Africa is dissected by deep valleys created by tectonic uplift in the early Miocene and late Miocene/early Pliocene. We hypothesised that seedlings of Vachellia nilotica, V. tortilis and V. karroo grown from seeds from different valleys would differ in growth and spinescence because of geographical separation. Ninety seedlings (30 per species) were grown for 3 months in uniform conditions in a greenhouse. Mean height of V. nilotica and V. tortilis seedlings was greatest for the Phongolo populations and lowest for the Thukela populations. Maximum stem diameter of both species was attained by individuals from the Phongolo population. Mean spine dry mass of V. nilotica seedlings was greatest for the Phongolo population, suggesting a growth-defence trade-off, but did not differ for V. tortilis. Results suggested that Phongolo populations of V. nilotica and V. tortilis may be characterised by morphotypes clearly distinct from those in the other valleys. Unclear and inconsistent results for V. karroo in this study suggested subtly different morphotypes occur in each valley. We propose that distinct Phongolo morphotypes of V. nilotica and V. tortilis are explained as evolutionary adaptations to moderate fire and high browsing pressure compared to populations South of Phongolo.

AB  - Background Intrinsic connectivity networks, including the default mode network (DMN), are frequently disrupted in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the main hub of the posterior DMN, where the therapeutic regulation of this region with real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) has yet to be explored. Methods We investigated PCC downregulation while processing trauma/stressful words over 3 NFB training runs and a transfer run without NFB (total n = 29, PTSD n = 14, healthy controls n = 15). We also examined the predictive accuracy of machine learning models in classifying PTSD versus healthy controls during NFB training. Results Both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli, where the PTSD group additionally showed reduced symptoms of distress. We found that both groups were able to downregulate the PCC with similar success over NFB training and in the transfer run, although downregulation was associated with unique within-group decreases in activation within the bilateral dmPFC, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and bilateral temporal pole/gyri. By contrast, downregulation was associated with increased activation in the right dlPFC among healthy controls as compared to PTSD. During PCC downregulation, right dlPFC activation was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Finally, machine learning algorithms were able to classify PTSD versus healthy participants based on brain activation during NFB training with 80% accuracy. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate PCC downregulation with real-time fMRI NFB in both PTSD and healthy controls. Our results reveal acute decreases in symptoms over training and provide converging evidence for EEG-NFB targeting brain networks linked to the PCC.

AB  - As the formation of adventitious roots (AR) is an important component of in vitro regeneration of tea plants, the propagation and preservation of Huangshan Bitter tea (Camellia gymnogyna Chang) cuttings have been hindered due to its lower rooting rate. As light is a crucial environmental factor that affects AR formation, this study aimed to investigate the special role of red light (RL) in the formation of AR in Huangshan Bitter tea plants, which has not been well understood. Huangshan Bitter tea plants were induced with white light (control, WL) and red light (660 nm, RL) qualities 36 days after induced treatment (DAI) to investigate dynamic AR formation and development, anatomical observation, hormones content change, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of the transcriptome. Results showed that RL promoted the rooting rate and root characteristics compared to WL. Anatomical observations demonstrated that root primordium was induced earlier by RL at the 4 DAI. RL positively affected IAA, ZT and GA(3) content and negatively influenced ABA from the 4 to 16 DAI. RNA-seq and analysis of differential expression genes (DEGs) exhibited extensive variation in gene expression profiles between RL and WL. Meanwhile, the results of WGCNA and correlation analysis identified three highly correlated modules and hub genes mainly participated in 'response to hormone', 'cellular glucan metabolic progress', and 'response to auxin'. Furthermore, the proportion of transcription factors (TFs) such as ethylene response factor (ERF), myeloblastosis (MYB), basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and WRKYGQK (WRKY) were the top four in DEGs. These results suggested that the AR-promoting potential of red light was due to complex hormone interactions in tea plants by regulating the expression of related genes. This study provided an important reference to shorten breeding cycles and accelerate superiority in tea plant propagation and preservation.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of myocyte development and traits, yet insight into the genetic basis of variation in miRNA expression is still limited. Here, we present a systematic analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for miRNA profiling in longissimus muscle of pigs from an eight-breed crossed heterogeneous population. By integrating the whole-genome sequencing and miRNAomics data, we map 54 cis- and 292 trans-eQTLs at high resolution that are associated with the expression of 54 and 92 miRNAs, respectively. Twenty-three trans-acting loci are identified to affect the expression of nine myomiRs (known muscle-specific miRNAs). MiRNAs in mammalian conserved miRNA clusters are found to be subjected to regulation by shared cis-eQTLs, while the expression of mature miRNA-5p/-3p counterparts is more likely to be regulated by different cis-eQTLs. Fine mapping and bioinformatics analyses pinpoint the peak cis-eSNP of miR-4331-5p, rs344650810, which is located in its seed region, as a causal variant for the changes in expression and function of this miRNA. Additionally, rs344650810 is significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with the density and percentage of type I muscle fibers. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive atlas of miRNA-eQTLs in porcine skeletal muscle and new insights into regulatory mech-anisms of miRNA expression.

AB  - Latrophilin-3 (LPHN3) is a brain specific G-protein coupled receptor associated with increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cognitive deficits. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate a constitutive knockout (KO) rat of Lphn3 by deleting exon 3, based on human data that LPHN3 variants are associated with some cases of ADHD. Lphn3 KO rats are hyperactive with an attenuated response to ADHD medication and have cognitive deficits. Here, we tested KO, heterozygous (HET), and wildtype (WT) rats to determine if there was a gene-dosage effect. We tested the rats in home-cage activity starting at postnatal day (P)35 and P50, followed by tests of egocentric learning (Cincinnati water maze [CWM]), spatial learning (Morris water maze [MWM]), working memory (radial water maze [RWM]), incidental learning (novel object recognition [NOR]), acoustic startle response (ASR) habituation, tactile startle response (TSR) habituation, prepulse modification of acoustic startle, shuttle-box passive avoidance, conditioned freezing, and a mirror image version of the CWM. KO and HET rats were hyperactive. KO and HET rats had egocentric (CWM) and spatial deficits (MWM), increased startle response, and KO rats showed less conditioned freezing on contextual and cued memory; there were no effects on working memory (RWM) or passive avoidance. The selective gene-dosage effect in Lphn3 HET rats indicates that Lphn3 exhibits dominate expression on functions where it is most abundantly expressed (striatum, hippocampus) but not on behaviors mediated by regions of low expression. The data add further evidence to the impact of this synaptic protein on brain function and behavior.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on the tibia, liver, and gut, and on performance, when supplementing nursery pigs with different levels of rare earth-chitosan chelate (RECC). A total of 80 piglets, weaned at 7.67 +/- 0.09 kg, were randomly assigned to groups RECC0 (RECC, 0 mg/kg diet), RECC200 (RECC, 200 mg/kg diet), RECC400 (RECC, 400 mg/kg diet), and RECC600 (RECC, 600 mg/kg diet), with four replicates in each group and five pigs per replicate during a 28 d experiment. Samples of the left hind tibia, serum, and feces were collected for analysis. The results indicated that, compared to pigs from group RECC0, pigs from group RECC200 presented with the following: a longer trabecular perimeter (p < 0.05), a larger trabecular area (p < 0.01), a higher trabecular number (p < 0.05), a smaller degree of trabecular separation (p < 0.01), and a lower number of osteoclasts (p < 0.01) in the tibia; higher abundances of beneficial fecal bacteria such as g_Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, g_UCG_005, g_Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, g_Acetitomaculum, g_Glutamicibacter, g_Frisingicoccus, and g_Alistipes; higher (p < 0.01) serum levels of IgM, IgA, IgG, and IL-10; a lower (p < 0.01) serum concentration of TNF-alpha; a higher (p < 0.05) average daily gain and feed conversion ratio; and a lower (p < 0.01) incidence of diarrhea. The dietary addition of RECC contributes to improvements in tibia quality, gut health, and performance in nursery pigs.

AB  - The naturally occurring stable isotopes of potassium (41K/39K, expressed as delta 41K) have the potential to make significant contributions to vertebrate and human biology. The utility of K stable isotopes is, however, conditioned by the understanding of the dietary and biological factors controlling natural variability of delta 41K. This paper reports a systematic study of K isotopes in extant terrestrial endothermic vertebrates. delta 41K has been measured in 158 samples of tissues, biofluids, and excreta from 40 individuals of four vertebrate species (rat, guinea pig, pig and quail) reared in two controlled feeding experiments. We show that biological processing of K by endothermic vertebrates produces remarkable intra-organism delta 41K variations of ca. 1.6 parts per thousand. Dietary delta 41K is the primary control of interindividual variability and delta 41K of bodily K is +0.5-0.6 parts per thousand higher than diet. Such a trophic isotope effect is expected to propagate throughout trophic chains, opening promising use for reconstructing dietary behaviors in vertebrate ecosystems. In individuals, cellular delta 41K is related to the intensity of K cycling and effectors of K homeostasis, including plasma membrane permeability and electrical potential. Renal and intestinal transepithelial transports also control fractionation of K isotopes. Using a box-modeling approach, we establish a first model of K isotope homeostasis. We predict a strong sensitivity of delta 41K to variations of intracellular and renal K cycling in normal and pathological contexts. Thus, K isotopes constitute a promising tool for the study of K dyshomeostasis.
   Graphical Abstract The natural abundances of potassium stable isotopes in endothermic vertebrates are controlled by diet and by the cellular and systemic cycling of potassium.

AB  - This study presents underwater explosion tests with three different TNT charge weights to investigate the dynamic responses of a fixed steel sheet. A finite element model was established and benchmarked by comparing the bubble development and deformation distribution from the tests. The steel sheet shows a deformation process of hogging, sagging, and hogging again, due to the actions of shock waves, bubble expansion, bubble collapse, and bubble pulsation. The air may be sucked into the bubble during the hogging process, making the bubble collapse earlier and resulting in a relatively lower sagging deformation for large charge weights of TNT. The deformation caused by bubble pulsation is larger than that by the shock waves, owing to the large time duration of bubble pulsation. A parametric analysis was conducted to study the influence of steel grade, plate thickness, detonation distance, and the shape and position of charges on the dynamic behavior of steel plates subjected to underwater explosions. It shows that the damage to the steel plate gradually decreases, with the increase in steel strength, plate thickness, and detonation distance. The influence of the shape and position of charges is limited. The largest deformation is observed when the detonation distance increases to bubble radius.

AB  - Interaction with the environment appears necessary for the maturation of sensorimotor and cognitive functions in early life. In rats, a model of sensorimotor restriction (SMR) from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P28 has shown that low and atypical sensorimotor activities induced the perturbation of motor behavior due to muscle weakness and the functional disorganization of the primary somatosensory and motor cortices. In the present study, our objective was to understand how SMR affects the muscle-brain dialogue. We focused on irisin, a myokine secreted by skeletal muscles in response to exercise. FNDC5/irisin expression was determined in hindlimb muscles and brain structures by Western blotting, and irisin expression in blood and cerebrospinal fluid was determined using an ELISA assay at P8, P15, P21 and P28. Since irisin is known to regulate its expression, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in the same brain structures. We demonstrated that SMR increases FNDC5/irisin levels specifically in the soleus muscle (from P21) and also affects this protein expression in several brain structures (as early as P15). The BDNF level was increased in the hippocampus at P8. To conclude, SMR affects FNDC5/irisin levels in a postural muscle and in several brain regions and has limited effects on BDNF expression in the brain.

AB  - Herbivorous insects require mechanisms to deal with defence compounds produced by their host plants. Despite an array of secondary compounds associated with defence, eucalypts are hosts to many insect species that readily obtain nutrients also produced by these plants. Gonipterus weevils are foliage-feeding eucalypt specialists as larvae and adults, with a notable characteristic of protecting their eggs with a hardened frass-like substance. The aim of this study was to assess plant, weevil frass and egg capsule chemistry to determine how the weevil eliminates plant secondary metabolites. We hypothesised that noxious compounds would be metabolised prior to elimination and that egg capsules would be composed of frass and additional substances. Weevils were fed on Eucalyptus globulus plants for seven days, with their frass and egg capsules collected daily, and the damaged, first, fully-expanded leaves of the host collected at the end of the assay. Compounds present in each sample were extracted in hexane and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The most abundant compounds in each sample were waxes and terpenoids, and metabolism of 1,8-cineole was evident, with two metabolites that may have semiochemical activity. Comparative analysis revealed significant differences between all samples, with shared compounds varying in relative proportions and exclusive compounds in sample type. These findings contribute to the understanding of Gonipterus physiology and highlight the differences between frass and the cover of egg capsules.

AB  - This study assessed the effect of donor ' s age and two different extenders in the sperm quality of chilled semen in Majorera bucks. In experiment 1, semen was individually processed from 5 young (10-12 months old) and 4 mature (3-5 years old) bucks and then was diluted in two different extenders: EY (Tris-glucose, 12% egg yolk) and CEY (Tris-glucose, 12% clarified egg yolk) and cooled at 4 degrees C; semen quality (sperm motility, percentages of alive spermatozoa, acrosome status and abnormal spermatozoa) was evaluated at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr after cooling. In experiment II, 72 Majorera goats were assigned to four experimental groups: for groups 24-EY (n = 18) and 24-CEY (n = 18), goats were inseminated with EY and CEY cooled semen for 24 hr, respectively, while for groups 72-EY (n = 18) and 72-CEY (n = 18), goats were inseminated with EY and CEY cooled semen for 72 hr, respectively. In vitro results confirmed that only ejaculate volume and sperm concentration were significantly different between young and mature bucks. In addition, semen quality was similar between both diluents, presenting values for the first 48 hr similar to that recorded in fresh samples. The fertility rate was around 70% after 24 hr (4 degrees C) in both groups, but the kidding rate was significantly lower (44.4%, p < .05) in goats inseminated with EY diluent preserved for 72 hr. Our results showed that the semen samples may be stored at 4 degrees C in media with egg yolk or clarified egg yolk, and, therefore, the use of clarified egg yolk may represent a valid alternative to chill semen samples. Finally, young bucks (older than 10-12 months) of Majorera breed could be successfully used in breeding programmes with similar efficacy to older males.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cordycepin, the main active component of Cordyceps militaris, exhibits various pharmacological activities, including anti-tumor and antioxidant effects. However, its antidepressant effect and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Aim of review: This study aimed to explore the antidepressant effect of cordycepin and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model was established to assess antidepressant effect of cordycepin. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics with integrated network pharmacology were used to find differential metabolites in serum, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid of rats and identify potential target by cordycepin. Western blot and Real-time PCR were applied to validate the signaling pathway. Results: Cordycepin alleviated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors by weight gain, sucrose preference increment, immobility time reduction, total travelling distance extension and serum corticosterone levels reduction. Metabolomics showed that cordycepin reversed CUMS-induced metabolic disturbances through alanine and TCA cycle metabolism pathways. Network pharmacology identified GSK3(3 as a potential target. Cordycepin increased protein levels of p-GSK3(3, (3-catenin and nuclear (3-catenin, and enhanced transcription of downstream genes PKM, LDHA, Cyclin D1 and C-myc in brains of CUMS-induced rats. Conclusions: This study indicated that cordycepin exerted antidepressant effect by modulating GSK3(3/(3-catenin pathway, suggesting its potential as a candidate agent for depression.

AB  - The role of microbial decay and subterranean termites (Blattodea: Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) in loss of litter mass was evaluated on the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve (TGPP) of The Nature Conservancy in northeastern Oklahoma. Four field sites, each consisting of four blocks of land with each block sub-divided into two plots were established. Using in-ground baiting systems, termites were eliminated from one plot in each block. Galvanized steel mesh bags containing grass litter were placed on both the soil surface and buried 15 cm deep in plots containing foraging termites (not baited), and in plots without termites (baited) and evaluated for loss of litter mass after 12 months. Loss of litter mass from soil-surface bags in termite-infested, non-baited plots was 22.3%, while loss from soil-surface bags in termite-free baited plots was 25.0%. Loss of litter mass from buried bags in termite non-baited plots was 35.5%, while loss from buried bags in termite-free baited plots was 35.7%. There were no significant differences in loss of litter mass in non-baited versus baited plots, but loss of mass from buried bags was significantly greater than that from soil surface bags.

AB  - A Rhinolophus ferrumequinum maternity roost in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, U.K. was monitored from 1994 to 2023, as part of the U.K. national survey between days 92-112 (1 April = day 1). The onset of births, determined from pup forearm lengths, occurred earlier than anticipated in five years from days 63-77, in 1997, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2014. In those five years between 0.5-20.6% of the exit count would have been pups 28-35 days old, which were nearly adult size and able to fly outside the roost (9.5 +/- 8.5%, 0 +/- SD). Since 2014 the population exceeded 650 adult bats and there was insufficient time to measure pup forearm lengths whilst adults were out of the roost so alternative methods of estimating birth timing were devised. Nightly external activity periods at the maternity roost identified the date when births commenced and presumed foraging activity changed from pre-partum, when bats were absent from dusk to dawn, to post-partum when mothers returned to feed their pups. Changes in the onset of early births were statistically related to changes in the integrated air temperature, defined as the accumulated temperature above a threshold in April of 7 degrees C (degree days). A significant (P < 0.01) polynomial equation explained a moderate proportion (R-2 = 33.6%) of the non-linear increase in the integrated air temperature over time. The probability of an early birth onset (P) was predicted by a significant (P = 0.014) binary logistic model. The odds of an early birth onset, relative to a later birth onset, was elevated by 1.04 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.08) for every one degree day increase in integrated air temperature. The probability of an early birth onset increased from P = 0.107 when the integrated air temperature was 38.7 degree days up to P = 0.942 when the integrated air temperature was 152.0 degree days. At the principal U.K. maternity roosts integrated air temperatures in April were in the same ranges annually from 2011 to 2023. Therefore, monitoring of the integrated air temperature in April provides a simple non-invasive method to predict the extent and pace of the shift in birth timing of R. ferrumequinum in future associated with climate change.

AB  - Antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs) are a distinct population of skeletal mesenchymal stem cells found in regenerating deer antlers, with strong stemness and renewal capacity in vitro. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as potential therapeutic candidates that can mediate donor cells' beneficial effects. Here, we tested the effects of ABPC-derived EVs (EVsABPC) on aging in mice and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We identified a variety of unique factors in EVsABPC and showed that in vitro, EVsABPC attenuated phenotypes of senescence in bone marrow stem cells. In aged mice and macaques, EVsABPC substantially increased femoral bone mineral density. Further, intravenous EVsABPC improved physical performance, enhanced cognitive function and reduced systemic inflammation in aged mice, while reversing epigenetic age by over 3 months. In macaques, EVABPC treatment was also neuroprotective, reduced inflammation, improved locomotor function and reduced epigenetic age by over 2 years. Our findings position ABPCs as an emerging and practical source of EVs with translational value for healthy aging interventions.

AB  - Transcription factors play important roles in the growth and development of various tissues in pigs, such as muscle, fat, and bone. A transcription-factor-scale activation library based on the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 (Cas9) system could facilitate the discovery and functional characterization of the transcription genes involved in a specific gene network. Here, we have designed and constructed a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) sgRNA library, containing 5056 sgRNAs targeting the promoter region of 1264 transcription factors in pigs. The sgRNA library, including sgRNA with MS2 loops, is a single-vector system and is packaged with lentivirus for cell screening. Porcine PK15 cells expressing the porcine OCT4 promoter driving EGFP, dCas9 fused with VP64, and MS2-binding protein-p65-HSF1 were constructed, and then, the sgRNA activation library was used to screen the transcription factors regulating OCT4 expression. After the lentiviral transduction and deep sequencing of the CRISPR sgRNAs library, the highest ranking candidate genes were identified, including 31 transcription factors activating OCT4 gene expression and 5 transcription factors inhibiting OCT4 gene expression. The function and gene regulation of the candidate genes were further confirmed by the CRISPR activation system in PK15 cells. The CRISPR activation library targeting pig transcription factors provides a promising platform for the systematic discovery and study of genes that determine cell fate.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the cerebellum histology and immunohistochemistry in porcupine (Hystrix cristata) and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). Two adult porcupines and two adult guinea pigs were used. For general histology, crystal violet and Luxol fast blue stains were applied. For immunohistochemistry, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), neurofilament 200 (NF200), calbindin D-28K, and glial fibrillary-associated protein (GFAP) were investigated. The cerebellar cortex in both species was composed of three cellular layers: molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell (PC) layers. Purkinje cells in the porcupine showed a purple-colored and dark blue-colored cytoplasm in reaction to the crystal violet and Luxol fast blue staining, respectively. In the guinea pig, PC has a uniform reaction to the Luxol fast blue with dark-blue-colored cytoplasm. However, in response to the crystal violet, some PC with dark-purple cytoplasm showed stronger reaction than other PC which showed light-purple cytoplasm. The PC layer in some folia of the porcupine cerebellum was composed of 2-3 layers. The expression rates of calbindin D-28K, MAG, GFAP, and NF200 in the porcupine cerebellum were determined to be 19%, 42.5%, 62%, and 30%, respectively. These values were determined to be 27%, 34%, 43.5%, and 31.5%, respectively, in the guinea pig cerebellum.

AB  - Memory is essential in defining our identity by guiding behavior based on past experiences. However, aging leads to declining memory, disrupting older adult's lives. Memories are encoded through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic strength, which are regulated by the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline. While cognitive aging research demonstrates how dopaminergic neuromodulation from the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area regulates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory, recent findings indicate that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus sends denser inputs to the hippocampus. The locus coeruleus produces dopamine as biosynthetic precursor of noradrenaline, and releases both to modulate hippocampal plasticity and memory. Crucially, the locus coeruleus is also the first site to accumulate Alzheimer's-related abnormal tau and severely degenerates with disease development. New in-vivo assessments of locus coeruleus integrity reveal associations with Alzheimer's markers and late-life memory impairments, which likely stem from impaired dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. Bridging research across species, the reviewed findings suggest that degeneration of the locus coeruleus results in deficient dopaminergic and noradrenergic modulation of hippocampal plasticity and thus memory decline.

AB  - Most animals encounter social challenges throughout their lives as they compete for resources. Individual re-sponses to such challenges can depend on social status, sex, and community-level attributes, yet most of our knowledge of the behavioral and physiological mechanisms by which individuals respond to challenges has come from dyadic interactions between a resource holder and a challenger (usually both males). To incorporate dif-ferences in individual behavior that are influenced by surrounding group members, we use naturalistic com-munities of the cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, and examine resident dominant male responses to a territorial intrusion within the social group. We measured behavior and steroid hormones (testosterone and cortisol), and neural activity in key brain regions implicated in regulating territorial and social dominance behavior. In response to a male intruder, resident dominant males shifted from border defense to overt attack behavior, accompanied by decreased basolateral amygdala activity. These differences were context dependent - resident dominant males only exhibited increased border defense when the intruder secured dominance. Neither sub-ordinate males nor females changed their behavior in response to a territorial intrusion in their community. However, neural activity in both hippocampus and lateral septum of subordinates increased when the intruder failed to establish dominance. Our results demonstrate how a social challenge results in multi-faceted behavioral, hormonal, and neural changes, depending on social status, sex, and the outcome of an intruder challenge. Taken together, our work provides novel insights into the mechanisms through which individual group members display context-and status-appropriate challenge responses in dynamic social groups.

AB  - Inhabiting some of the world ' s most inhospitable climatic regions, the Sunite Mongolian sheep generates average temperatures as low as 4.3 degrees C and a minimum temperature of-38.8 degrees C; in these environments, they make essential cold adaptations. In this regard, scapular fat tissues from Mongolian sheep were collected both in winter and summer for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify genes related to adaptive thermogenesis. In the transcriptome analysis, 588 differentially expressed genes were identified to participate in smooth muscle activity and fat metabolism, as well as in nutrient regulation. There were 343 upregulated and 245 downregulated genes. GO and KEGG pathway analyses on these genes revealed their participation in regulating smooth muscle activity, metabolism of fats, and nutrients. Proteomic analysis showed the differential expression of 925 proteins: among them, there are 432 up- and 493 down-expressed proteins. These proteins are mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory chain complex assembly, and ATP production by electron transport. Furthermore, using both sets at a more detailed level of analysis revealed over-representation in gene ontology categories related to hormone signaling, metabolism of lipids, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle, and especially the process of oxidative phosphorylation. The identified essential genes and proteins were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively; key metabolic network constriction was constructed. The present study emphasized the critical role of lipid turnover in scapular fat for thermogenic adaptation in Sunite sheep.

AB  - A catalogue of natural enemies considered and released as biological control (biocontrol) agents against invasive alien plants in South Africa has been maintained for many years, and is updated here to include the period 2011-2020. The current catalogue reorders and separates data for exotic natural enemies that have been approved as classical biocontrol agents, from those on exotic natural enemies that have been considered but not released, exotic natural enemies that have been inadvertently introduced into South Africa with host plants that include target weed species, and locally sourced natural enemies that have been considered as bioherbicides. Ninety weed species have been targeted for biocontrol, with 310 exotic natural enemies considered, 136 classified as de jure or de facto classical biocontrol agents, and 92 established in the field on 66 target weeds. Ten of these species were found to have established independently of being released while research on them was in progress. An additional six exotic species have been found established on target weeds, and 11 locally sourced natural enemies have been considered for inundative or augmentative biocontrol, of which two have been developed commercially. Of the exotic natural enemies deliberately established, 35% inflict extensive damage to their host plants. Insects make up the majority of biocontrol agents (90%), with the balance of 8% being fungi and 2%, mites. Both establishment rates and damage levels vary between taxa. Five biocontrol agents previously considered established, have not been found in the field for several years and their persistence is in doubt. Outcomes of biocontrol at a plant population level are indicated for 54 target weeds on which agents have been established for over a decade. The increase in numbers of target weeds considered, as well as biocontrol agents released, over the past decade, has been enabled by continued generous funding and an efficient release-approval process.

AB  - Simple Summary Inappropriate environmental conditions in pig buildings are detrimental for both pig and farm-staff health and welfare. With ongoing technological developments, a variety of sensor technology is available and can be used to measure environmental conditions such as air temperature, relative humidity, and ammonia and dust concentrations in real time. Moreover, a tool was recently developed to give farmers an objective assessment of pigs' respiratory health by continuously measuring coughing in finisher pigs. This study assessed baseline levels of coughing on a farm free of respiratory disease, and aimed to identify relationships between environmental conditions and coughing frequency in pigs. Six replicates were conducted. Coughing levels in healthy pigs were overall low, and coughing frequency can be predicted by environmental conditions such as high ammonia concentrations and high ventilation rates. Results of this study can be used as guidelines to determine normal coughing levels in healthy pigs, and to calibrate the alarm systems of tools that measure coughing frequency, such as the cough monitor used in this study. The collection and amalgamation of data from a variety of sources related to health, welfare, and performance are important in order to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the pig industry. This study aimed to assess baseline levels of coughing on a farm free of respiratory disease, and to identify relationships between environmental conditions and coughing frequency in finisher pigs. Six replicates were conducted (690 pigs in total). A cross-correlation analysis was performed and lags of the predictor variables were carried forward for multivariable regression analysis when significant and showing r > 0.25. Results show that coughing frequency was overall low. In the first replicate, coughing was best predicted by exposure to higher ammonia concentrations that occurred with a lag of 1, 7, and 15 days (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively), while in the sixth replicate coughing frequency was best predicted by the exposure to lower relative humidity and higher ventilation rates with a lag of 7 and 15 days (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Ammonia concentrations varied according to ventilation rates recorded on the same day (r > -0.70). In conclusion, guidelines on coughing levels in healthy pigs and calibration of the alarm systems of tools that measure coughing frequency can be extrapolated from this study. Environmental risk factors are associated with the respiratory health of finisher pigs.

AB  - Females of brood parasitic shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, search and prospect host nests, synchronizing parasitism with host laying. This behavior is sex-specific, as females perform this task without male's assistance. Host nests must be removed from the female's memory "library" after being parasitized, to avoid repeated parasitism, or when they become unavailable because of predation. Thus, females must adjust their stored information about host nest status more dynamically than males, possibly leading to differences in learning flexibility. We tested for sex differences in a visual (local cues) and a spatial discrimination reversal learning task, expecting females to outperform males as an expression of greater behavioral flexibility. Both sexes learned faster the spatial than the visual task during both acquisition and reversal. In the visual task there were no sex differences in acquisition, but females reversed faster than males. In the spatial task there were no sex differences during either acquisition or reversal, possibly because of a ceiling effect: both sexes learned too fast for differences in performance to be detectable. Faster female reversal in a visual but not spatial task indicates that the greater behavioral flexibility in females may only be detectable above some level of task difficulty.

AB  - Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), Hermetia illucens L., are widely used to reduce the mass of various wastes. However, the potential metal tolerance mechanisms during periods of waste bioconversion by BSFL remain largely unknown. To further reveal the mechanisms, BSFL were used to treat the agricultural organic wastes, including pig manure (PM), cow manure (COM), spent mushroom substrate (SMS), and wet distiller grains (WDG). After these individual and combined waste(s) were treated by BSFL, we investigated the waste reduction rates and evaluated the responses of BSFL gut microbes to heavy metals of agricultural organic wastes. Additionally, the colloidal particles of residual wastes were characterized by combing energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Size potential, Zeta potential, and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. Results indicated that the waste reduction rates were up to 74% in COM+WDG and 69% in WDG, most of heavy metals (e.g., Zn and Co) from organic wastes were not accumulated in the bodies of mature larvae after treatment. Further, results obtained from the prediction of gene function on the basis of 16 S rRNA data revealed that the presence of multi-resistance genes in the gut of BSFL can help the larvae resist Zn and/or Co stress. In addition, the drug sensitivity test implied that BSFL5_L and BSFL6_L from BSFL gut bacterial strains have multi-resistance to Co and Zn. Additionally, EDX results revealed that the colloidal particles in five waste residues after BSFL treatment are mainly consisted of Fe, Ca and Si, which can capture heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Mn). Results from EEM spectroscopy and PARAFAC showed that tryptophan-like and humic-like accumulatively account for 56%- 68% of all components. Importantly, these two components could strongly bind the metal elements and form colloidal particles with high stability, and therefore reduce the heavy metal pollution of agricultural organic wastes. Our findings offered an environment-friendly method to treat agricultural organic wastes, which would be far-reaching influence to our environment.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is the cause of the most severe economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. PRRSV is extremely diverse in Europe, which poses a significant challenge to disease control within a country or any region. With the combination of phylogenetic reconstruction and network analysis, we aimed to uncover the major routes of the dispersal of PRRSV clades within Hungary. In brief, by analyzing >2600 ORF5 sequences, we identified at least 12 clades (including 6 clades within lineage 1 and 3 clades within lineage 3) common in parts of Western Europe (including Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands) and identified 2 novel clades (designated X1 and X2). Of interest, some genetic clades unique to other central European countries, such as the Czech Republic and Poland, were not identified. The pattern of PRRSV clade distribution is consistent with the route of the pig trade among countries, showing that most of the identified clades were introduced from Western Europe when fatteners were transported to Hungary. As a result of rigorous implementation of the national eradication program, the swine population was declared officially free from PRRSV. This map of viral diversity and clade distribution will serve as valuable baseline information for the maintenance of PRRSV-free status in the post-eradication era.

AB  - Urban freshwaters, their sediments and resident biota are often highly susceptible to microplastic contamination from catchment-specific sources. Water velocity and spatiotemporal dynamics within the system can impact microplastic loads, while biological features may additionally impact levels within freshwater biota. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations in microplastic loads collected from sediment, macroinvertebrate and fish samples from an urban watercourse (Bourne Stream) in Dorset, southwest England. Sediment particles were mostly fragments of colours (especially orange and purple) whereas microplastics in both macroinvertebrates and fishes were blue/green and fibres. Across all sample types, the dominant particle size class was <= 100 mu m. Median (M) and range (R) of microplastic loads within each sample type were sediment: M = 0.06, R = 0-0.36 particles g-1; macroinvertebrates: M = 0, R = 0-4 particles per batch; and fishes: M = 1, R = 0-6 particles per individual. Sediment loads varied spatially, with the highest load in the most upstream site, whereas biotic loads did not vary across space and time. Macroinvertebrate batch loadings varied between taxa and feeding guild, with counts significantly higher in annelids but lower in herbivores. Fish counts were higher in species with true, differentiated stomachs, but with the effects of species, feeding guild and body size being non-significant. Within sites, mean microplastic loads did not correlate between sediment, macroinvertebrate and fish samples. These results suggest that sediment freshwater microplastic loadings may vary spatially but that these trends are not reflected by, or correlated to, those in the biota where ingestion varies with biological traits. Assessments of freshwater microplastic contamination must therefore consider sampling spatiotemporally and across different biotic communities to fully understand the scale of contamination, and to subsequently undertake effective mitigation steps.

AB  - BackgroundOutbreaks of insect pests in paddy fields cause heavy losses in global rice yield annually, a threat projected to be aggravated by ongoing climate warming. Although significant progress has been made in the screening and cloning of insect resistance genes in rice germplasm and their introgression into modern cultivars, improved rice resistance is only effective against either chewing or phloem-feeding insects.ResultsIn this study, the results from standard and modified seedbox screening, settlement preference and honeydew excretion tests consistently showed that Qingliu, a previously known leaffolder-resistant rice variety, is also moderately resistant to brown planthopper (BPH). High-throughput RNA sequencing showed a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the infestation site, with 2720 DEGs in leaves vs 181 DEGs in sheaths for leaffolder herbivory and 450 DEGs in sheaths vs 212 DEGs in leaves for BPH infestation. The leaf-specific transcriptome revealed that Qingliu responds to leaffolder feeding by activating jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes and genes regulating the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways that are essential for the biosynthesis of salicylic acid, melatonin, flavonoids and lignin defensive compounds. The sheath-specific transcriptome revealed that Qingliu responds to BPH infestation by inducing salicylic acid-responsive genes and those controlling cellular signaling cascades. Taken together these genes could play a role in triggering defense mechanisms such as cell wall modifications and cuticular wax formation.ConclusionsThis study highlighted the key defensive responses of a rarely observed rice variety Qingliu that has resistance to attacks by two different feeding guilds of herbivores. The leaffolders are leaf-feeder while the BPHs are phloem feeders, consequently Qingliu is considered to have dual resistance. Although the defense responses of Qingliu to both insect pest types appear largely dissimilar, the phenylpropanoid pathway (or more specifically phenylalanine ammonia-lyase genes) could be a convergent upstream pathway. However, this possibility requires further studies. This information is valuable for breeding programs aiming to generate broad spectrum insect resistance in rice cultivars.

AB  - Voles are small herbivorous rodents that can display both circadian activity rhythms (similar to 24-h periodicity) and ultradian activity rhythms (similar to 1- to 6-h periodicity). Ultradian rhythms are observed on an individual level, but also in synchronized populations. Ultradian rhythm period has been suggested to be influenced by energy balance, but the underlying mechanisms of ultradian rhythmicity are poorly understood. We manipulated energy balance by implementing the "work-for-food" paradigm, in which small rodents are exposed to increasing levels of food scarcity at different ambient temperatures in the laboratory. Photoperiodical spring-programmed voles on high workload changed their nocturnal circadian activity and body temperature rhythm to ultradian patterns, indicating that a negative energy balance induces ultradian rhythmicity. This interpretation was confirmed by the observation that ultradian patterns arose earlier at low temperatures. Interestingly, a positive relationship between ultradian period length and workload was observed in tundra voles. Spectral analysis revealed that the power of ultradian rhythmicity increased at high workload, whereas the circadian component of running wheel activity decreased. This study shows that the balance between circadian and ultradian rhythmicity is determined by energy balance, confirming flexible circadian and ultradian rhythms in females and males of 2 different vole species: the common vole (Microtus arvalis) and the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic activities from biologically active peptides produced by fermented sheep milk with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei M11 (MG027695), as well as to purify and characterize the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and anti-diabetic peptides produced from fermented sheep milk. RESULTS: After 48 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C, sheep milk demonstrated significant changes in anti-diabetic effects and ACE-I effects, with inhibition percentages observed for ACE inhibition (76.32%), alpha-amylase (70.13%), alpha-glucosidase (70.11%) and lipase inhibition (68.22%). The highest level of peptides (9.77 mg mL-1) was produced by optimizing the growth conditions, which included an inoculation rate of 2.5% and a 48 h of incubation period. The comparison of molecular weight distributions among protein fractions was conducted through sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, whereas spots were separated using 2D gel electrophoresis according to both the molecular weight and pH. Peptide characterization with ultra-filtration membranes at 3 and 10 kDa allowed the study to assess molecular weight-based separation. Nitric oxide generated by lipopolysaccharide and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 immune cells were both inhibited by sheep milk fermented with M11. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to assess changes in functional groups after fermentation, providing insights into the structural changes occurring during fermentation. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that fermentation with L. paracasei (M11) led to significant changes in fermented sheep milk, enhancing its bioactive properties, notably in terms of ACE inhibition and anti-diabetic activities, and the generation of peptides with bioactive properties has potential health benefits.

AB  - The die-off of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum in the 1980s highlighted its crucial role as a primary grazer in tropical western Atlantic coral reefs. However, natural recovery has been slow, exacerbated by a new die-off in 2022. Interest in actively restoring D. antillarum populations has grown with the emergence of culture and rearing techniques. Restocking reefs with laboratory-reared urchins shows potential for enhancing coral reef resilience by reducing algal cover and promoting coral settlement, but success rates vary. Predation and migration contribute to low retention rates, with distinguishing between them is challenging. In this study near Saba, Caribbean Netherlands, we released 200 laboratory-reared D. antillarum on a reef and monitored for D. antillarum retention and potential D. antillarum predator presence and interaction for 35 days. Only 40% of the urchins were still present on the reef after day one. The Spanish hogfish Bodianus rufus was identified as the primary daytime predator, responsible for nine direct predation events. No nighttime predation was observed, but interaction with a batwing coral crab Carpilius corallinus was noted. These insights can help optimize future restocking attempts and emphasize the importance of assessing predator presence beforehand. Reefs with high abundances of predators such as Spanish hogfish should be avoided for D antillarum restocking. In addition, before being released, lab-reared animals should be given time to acclimate to conditions in the wild by being placed in protected in situ cages. Here, they could also grow to larger sizes that are less vulnerable to predation.

AB  - Living organisms are frequently exposed to multiple biotic and abiotic stress forms during their lifetime. Organisms cope with stress conditions by regulating their gene expression programs. In response to different environmental stress conditions, yeast cells activate different tolerance mechanisms, many of which share common signaling pathways. Flocculation is one of the key mechanisms underlying yeast survival under unfavorable environmental conditions, and the Tup1-Cyc8 corepressor complex is a major regulator of this process. Additionally, yeast cells can utilize different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to modulate gene expression during stress conditions. Here, we show that the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway is involved in the regulation of yeast flocculation. We observed that the HOG MAPK pathway was constitutively activated in flocculating cells, and found that the interaction between phosphorylated Hog1 and the FLO genes promoter region increased significantly upon sodium chloride exposure. We found that treatment of cells with cantharidin decreased Hog1 phosphorylation, causing a sharp reduction in the expression of FLO genes and the flocculation phenotype. Similarly, deletion of HOG1 in yeast cells reduced flocculation. Altogether, our results suggest a role for HOG MAPK signaling in the regulation of FLO genes and yeast flocculation.
   Living organisms are frequently exposed to multiple forms of biotic and abiotic stress during their lifetime and can cope with these conditions through context-dependent modulation of their gene expression programs. Here, we investigate the role of Hog1 in the regulation of yeast flocculation, which is a critical mechanism underlying yeast survival under unfavorable environmental conditions. image

AB  - This study examined the combined effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT), organic loading rate (OLR) and heat pretreatment of manure (70 degrees C, 1 h) on the fate of E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens, C. difficile, and on chemical parameters (volatile fatty acids and ammonia) that may inactivate pathogens. Semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic reactors were fed with pig manure and horse feed. The operating conditions were 2, 3, 4 COD.L-1.d(-1) (OLR), 24, 35, 46 days (HRT) and use or not of a thermal pretreatment. The levels of the chemical parameters did not reach concentrations capable of inactivating the four bacteria. Anaerobic digestion led to a Log io removal > 3 (E. coli), 0.9-2.1 (enterococci), 0.1-0.6 (C. perfringens) and 0-1 (C. difficile). Increasing HRT only reduced the concentration of E. coli in the digestate. Increasing OLR reduced the Log(10) removal of enterococci and C. difficile. The heat pretreatment led to non-detection of E. coli in the digestate, reduced the concentration of C. perfringens by 0.8-1.3 Log(10) and increased the concentration of C. difficile by 0.04-0.7 Log(10). Enterococci, not detected in the heated manure, were present in the digestate. The distribution of genes encoding virulence factors of C. difficile (tcdA and tcdB) and C. perfringens (cpa, cpb2 and cpb) was not impacted by anaerobic digestion or by the heat pretreatment. Enterococci, C. perfringens, C. difficile were present in the digestate at relatively stable concentrations regardless of the operating conditions, indicating that even with heat pretreatment, the biosafety of digestate cannot be guaranteed in mesophilic conditions.

AB  - Host plants are an important selective factor for the evolution of reproductive traits in herbivorous insects. Among different host plants, offspring will be exposed to different environmental conditions, and parents are expected to allocate reproductive resources adaptively to their offspring according to such environmental heterogeneity. Elasmucha putoni Scott (Hemiptera: Acanthosomatidae) is a bivoltine shield bug showing maternal care. We examined the variation in reproductive traits, that is, egg size, clutch size and the trade-off between them, between two generations of a population and two populations of the same (later) generation, which differ in their host plants. Controlling for female body size, a significant difference was detected in egg size, but not in clutch size between the earlier generation on Morus australis and the later one on Euptelea polyandra or Rosa multiflora. Moreover, there was no difference in the two traits between the populations (one using E. polyandra and another using R. multiflora) of the same generation. A significant trade-off between egg size and clutch size was detected in the earlier generation on M. australis but not in the later generation on E. polyandra or R. multiflora. This is the first study indicating variable reproductive allocation according to different host plants in herbivorous insects with maternal care.

AB  - Social communication and interaction deficits, memory impairment, and anxiety-like behavior are characterized in many people identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A thorough understanding of the specific aspects that contribute to the deficiencies associated with ASD can aid research into the etiology of the disorder while also providing targets for more effective intervention. As part of the ASD pathophysiology, alterations in synaptogenesis and abnormal network connections were seen in high-order brain areas, which control social behavior and communication. The early emergence of microglia during nervous system development may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and the pathobiology of ASD. Since aquaporin-4 (AQP4) appears to be required for the basic procedures of synapse activation, certain behavioral and cognitive impairments as well as disturbance in water homeostasis might likely arise from AQP4 deficiency. Here, through the measurement of the water content of the hippocampus and behavioral experiments we aim to explore the contribution of astrocytic AQP4 to the autism-like behavior induced by prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure and whether inhibition of AQP4 per se can induce autistic-like behavior in control rats. Microinjection of TGN-020 (10 & mu;M, i.c.v), a specific AQP4 inhibitor, for 7 successive days before behavioral tasks from postnatal day 28 to 35 revealed that inhibition of AQP4 in the control offspring caused lower social interaction and locomotor activity, higher anxiety, and decreased ability to recognize novel objects, very similar to the behavioral changes observed in offspring prenatally exposed to VPA. However, VPA-exposed offspring treated with TGN-020, showed no further remarkable behavioral impairments than those detected in the autisticlike rats. Furthermore, both control offspring treated with TGN-020 and offspring exposed to VPA had a considerable accumulation of water in their hippocampi. But AQP4 inhibition did not affect the water status of the autistic-like rats.The findings of this study revealed that control offspring exhibited similar hippocampal water retention and behavioral impairments that were observed in maternal VPA-exposed offspring following inhibition of astrocytic AQP4, whereas, in autistic-like rats, it did not produce any significant change in water content and behaviors. Findings suggest that AQP4 deficiency could be associated with autistic disorder and may be a potential pharmaceutical target for treating autism in the future.

AB  - Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are potential trap crops to attract the yellow peach moth (Conogethes punctiferalis) in orchards but the volatile compounds released from sunflowers and their effects on C. punctiferalis behaviour are not clear. Here we used solid phase micro-extraction to collect volatiles released from flower disks of sunflowers, identified them by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and examined the attractiveness of some of the compounds to mated female adult C. punctiferalis moths in Y-tube olfactometer choice tests. We detected nine volatile compounds (alpha-Pinene, beta-Phellandrene, Camphene, beta-Pinene, 3-Carene, D-Limonene, Eucalyptol, gamma-Terpinen, and Valencene) with consistently large peak areas for alpha-Pinene and beta-Phellandrene. Among tested volatiles, both alpha-Pinene and beta-Phellandrene were attractive to C. punctiferalis in olfactometer tests but this was only significant for higher concentrations of beta-Phellandrene. This suggests that beta-Phellandrene may promote C. punctiferalis oviposition on sunflower disks. This study provides insights into volatile chemical mediated responses of insect herbivores to trap crops.

AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTEs), including heavy metal exposures, have been associated with numerous negative pregnancy and birth outcomes. However, the association between PTE exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has not yet undergone a comprehensive systematic review. Consequently, this study undertook the first-ever systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies concerning this association. All relevant articles published in English were searched in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science until November 6, 2023, adhering to the MOOSE guidelines. The quality of retrieved studies was evaluated based on the Gascon et al. method. The meta-analysis of association estimates was performed using random effects meta-analysis. Egger's regression was employed to evaluate publication bias. In total, 16 articles (n = 116,728 participants) were included in our review, with 11 eligible for meta-analysis. Quality assessment categorized five studies (31%) as excellent, nine studies (56%) as good, and two studies (13%) as fair. Maternal high levels of Hg during pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of GDM (for each one-quartile increase in Hg: 1.20, 95% CI 1.08, 1.31), while serum Cd levels during the second trimester were associated with a lower risk of GDM (for each one-quartile increase in Cd: 0.76, 95% CI 0.65, 0.87). Furthermore, exposure to Pb was not associated with higher risk of GDM. In summary, our comprehensive review and meta-analysis underscore the possible negative influence of Hg exposure on GDM.

AB  - The aim of this research was to assess the effects of fruit purees of banana, kiwi, mango, red berry, and strawberry on the microbiological, physicochemical, antioxidant, and sensory properties of sheep yogurt. The fruit purees were characterized for their microbiological profile before yogurt production, and no spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms were detected in any of the purees analyzed. Yogurt productions were carried out under industrial conditions using pasteurized sheep's milk and selected starter cultures of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Five experimental yogurt productions (EYP) were made by adding 10 % (w/w) of each fruit puree, while the control yogurt production (CYP) was puree-free. Plate counts revealed that levels of viable Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus exceeded 8.0 log cfu/g in all CYP and EYP samples after 3 d of refrigerated storage. The addition of fruit purees reduced fat percentage until to 7 % and increased of antioxidant activity, especially with red berry puree. Except for banana, the addition of fruit purees resulted in a statistically significant increase (p < 0.0001) in the total terpene VOC profiles of EYP. Notably, the terpene content in mango-flavored yogurt was eightfold greater than that observed in the control trial. Sensory evaluation revealed a reduction in unpleasant odor and off-flavor, and an increase of about 50 % in overall acceptance for all EYP in comparison to CYP. Therefore, adding fruit purees to sheep yogurt is a promising strategy for the valorization of Sicilian sheep's milk.

   Korean purebred pigs are generally selected according to their production and reproduction traits in order to optimize commercial pig performance. It is, therefore, crucial to assess the genetic parameters of these traits to understand their genetic potential. For this reason, we analyzed three production traits (average daily gain, ADG; days to 105 kg weight, DAYS105; backfat thickness, BFT) and three reproduction traits (age at first farrowing, AFF; total number of piglets born, TNB; total number born alive, NBA) in Korean Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire pigs using animal models. We found that production traits were moderately to highly heritable, whereas reproduction traits were mostly lowly heritable. Evidence of selection improvement of DAYS105 and ADG without increasing BFT was also available. Genetically, NBA and TNB were positively and tightly linked, which further pointed to the need for careful breeding plans that consider the negative impact of higher TNB over NBA on piglets' mortality. Furthermore, AFF needs systematic attention in relation to genetic progress. Overall, most of our estimates suggested further improvement possibilities through selection. We argue that current genetic parameters could greatly assist future breeding and selection decisions for performance improvements in Korean pigs for specific purposes.
   The study aimed to investigate the genetic parameters of the production and reproduction traits of Korean Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire pigs. Three production traits, namely average daily gain (ADG), age at 105 kg body weight (DAYS105) and backfat thickness (BFT), and three reproduction traits, namely age at first farrowing (AFF), total number of piglets born (TNB) and number of piglets born alive (NBA), were analyzed. The reproduction dataset was based on first-parity gilts only. However, the production dataset comprised pigs of both sexes. Genetic parameters were estimated from individual datasets using a multiple-trait animal model in AIREMLF90 software. The heritability values of ADG, DAYS105 and BFT were 0.34-0.36, 0.41-0.44 and 0.38-0.48, respectively, across breeds. Heritability values for AFF, TNB and NBA were 0.07-0.14, 0.09-0.11 and 0.09-0.10, respectively. Strong genetic correlations existed between ADG and DAYS105 (-0.97) and between TNB and NBA (0.90 to 0.96). In line with breeding goals, all productive traits in Duroc pigs, and all reproduction traits except AFF in Landrace and Yorkshire pigs, also showed noticeable improvements in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that our findings on economic traits would greatly assist future pig breeding decisions in Korea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herbivory risk is mediated by plant traits related to nutrition and defense that can vary within a species by genotype and age. Prior herbivore damage accrued by a plant can also interact with these traits to alter future herbivory potential by changing plant quantity or quality. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a perennial crop where aboveground biomass is harvested annually and with varieties differing in nutrition and defenses, making it conducive to evaluating varietal resistance mechanisms. Using data from 16 sugarcane varieties and 28 years, we assessed damage from the primary pest in Louisiana, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis, SCB), relative to variety, crop year (ratoon), plant traits, and incidence of prior herbivory.RESULTS: SCB damage differed among varieties but not crop year, mostly following previously established classifications of SCB resistance, and correlated with select nutritional and defense traits. Within a crop year, the probability of SCB damage increased with prior conspecific damage on the same stalk. However, the strength of this prior damage effect did not match known resistance patterns but still differed with variety.CONCLUSIONS: Interactions of plant variety, traits, and prior pest damage but not age impacted sugarcane borer risk. Borer damage was associated with nutritional traits of fiber and sugar content, but not consistently with defensive traits like high stalk wax or hair density, indicating there may be additional resistance traits or indirect impacts of these traits on predators.

AB  - Pathological impairments in the regulation of affect (i.e., emotion) and flexible decision-making are commonly observed across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and are thought to reflect dysfunction of cortical and subcortical circuits that arise in part from imbalances in excitation and inhibition within these structures. Disruptions in GABA transmission, in particular, that from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVI), has been highlighted as a likely mechanism by which this imbalance arises, as they regulate excitation and synchronization of principle output neurons. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium ion (GIRK/Kir3) channels are known to modulate excitability and output of pyramidal neurons in areas like the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus; however, the role GIRK plays in PVI excitability and behavior is unknown. Male and female mice lacking GIRK1 in PVI (Girk1(flox/flox):PVcre) and expressing td-tomato in PVI (Girk1(flox/flox):PVCre:PVtdtom) exhibited increased open arm time in the elevated plus-maze, while males showed an increase in immobile episodes during the forced swim test (FST). Loss of GIRK1 did not alter motivated behavior for an appetitive reward or impair overall performance in an operant-based attention set-shifting model of cognitive flexibility; however it did alter types of errors committed during the visual cue test. Unexpectedly, baseline sex differences were also identified in these tasks, with females exhibiting overall poorer performance compared to males and distinct types of errors, highlighting potential differences in task-related problem-solving. Interestingly, reductions in PVI GIRK signaling did not correspond to changes in membrane excitability but did increase action potential (AP) firing at higher current injections in PVI of males, but not females. This is the first investigation on the role that PVI GIRK-signaling has on membrane excitability, AP firing, and their role on affect and cognition together increasing the understanding of PVI cellular mechanisms and function.

AB  - BACKGROUNDPlants release a diverse array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play a role in interactions with other plants and arthropod herbivores. The potential of using plants that emit either repellent or attractive VOCs to help managing insect populations have been shown. However, the response of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), a major sucking insect pest worldwide, to VOCs from cabbage and infested with conspecific remains unknown. This study investigated how VOCs released by cabbage infested or uninfested by Myzus persicae influenced host selection in seven different cultivars. and compared under infested and non-infested conditions.RESULTSUsing headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS), we identified 22 VOCs from non-infested cabbage plants and 33 from aphid-infested plants across the seven cabbage cultivars. Infested plants emitted a greater diversity and higher amounts of volatiles, dominated by terpenes and green leaf volatiles. Caryophyllene was the only compound common in both infested and non-infested plants. In olfactometer assays, wingless Myzus persicae showed a significant attraction to conspecific-infested plants with the strongest response to the cultivar QG 80. However, this increased attraction was not consistent across all cultivars, highlighting the need for further studies to understand the ecological implications and potential benefits or drawbacks of this attraction.CONCLUSIONOur findings highlight the potential of using VOC-emitting trap crops for the targeted management of Myzus persicae. By identifying key volatiles that attract aphids, this study provides a foundation for developing eco-friendly pest control strategies. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) were determined in raw milk from Nigerian cattles (cow, goat and sheep), to assess the environmental pollution, impact on milk quality and health risk. Nine composite samples were collected from five states in Northwest Nigeria, being the major cattle breeders. The samples were wet digested and PTEs determined using ICP-OES. 45 PTEs were ascertained of which Nitrogen (43754 mg/L) and Strontium, Sr (0.007 mg/L) recorded the highest and least mean concentration respectively. The mean concentration of other PTEs were: Selenium (0.253 +/- 0.077), Cadmium (0.040 +/- 0.0411), Mercury (0.048 +/- 0.037), Silver (0.088 +/- 0.013), Arsenic (0.044 +/- 0.006), Boron (0.056 +/- 0.005), Aluminium (0.014 +/- 0.002), Tin (0.109 +/- 0.019), Lead (0.018 +/- 0.006), Gold (0.088 +/- 0.048), Manganese (214.8 +/- 18.754), Iron (473.9 +/- 55.901), Zinc (247.9 +/- 15.874), Copper (84.5 +/- 12.905), Nickel (0.0031 +/- 0.001), Molybdenum (0.459 +/- 0.160), Cobalt (0.055 +/- 0.020), Chromium (0.028 +/- 0.008), Vanadium (0.185 +/- 0.051), Calcium (24988 +/- 16302), Magnesium (5733 +/- 1460.8), Potassium (6555 +/- 1199.6), Sodium (17.59 +/- 2.914), Phosphorus (497.2 +/- 90.38), Bismuth (0.055 +/- 0.032), Cerium (0.048 +/- 0.043), Argon (0.083 +/- 0.011), Silicon (0.265 +/- 0.110), Sulphur (0.087 +/- 0.009), Titanium (0.073 +/- 0.030) and Bromine (0.021 +/- 0.005). Others are Platinum (0.021 +/- 0.008), Antimony (0.088 +/- 0.007), Iodine (0.16 +/- 0.022), Caesium (0.374 +/- 0.037), Barium (0.025 +/- 0.009), Lanthanum (0.115 +/- 0.182), Samarium (0.150 +/- 0.095), Palladium (1.47 +/- 0.991), Curium (0.042 +/- 0.009), Fermium (0.036 +/- 0.0098), Americium (0.826 +/- 0.618) and Rubidium (0.048 +/- 0.044). The Pearson's correlation and paired sample t-test showed that most of the PTEs have similar origin at 0.05% significant level, and all the cattle had the same level of exposure to the PTEs respectively in the area. Raw milk is about 80% water and so, the determined PTEs concentrations are considered very high in the analyzed samples. The presence of Pb in the milk is a concern since Pb is a toxin at any concentration. The high content of PTEs in milk is attributed to the indiscriminate and artisanal mining activities in the region, and the fact that the animals are free rangers. The health risk factors were below unity (HR < 1) and so were not potential hazards. However, the environmental contaminations by these PTEs are very substantial and if this type of milk is taken raw or used for the production of dairy products like cheese and butter, then there may be a serious health condition on the consumer since they are not biodegradable.

AB  - Palaeognathae is an ancient bird lineage that includes the volant tinamous and six flightless lineages: ostrich, rhea, cassowary, emu, kiwi (extant) and moa, elephant bird (extinct). Over the past decade, a consensus has emerged on the relationships within the group. In this consensus, the ostrich branch splits first, followed by rheas, a clade containing tinamou and moa and a clade with the emu and cassowary sister to the kiwi and elephant bird. However, the timing of the origin of these major clades remains uncertain. In phylogenomic studies, the origin of the crown Palaeognathae is typically dated to the K-Pg boundary (similar to 66 Ma), though one study suggested a younger Early Eocene age (similar to 51 Ma). This discrepancy might result from the number and position of fossil priors (calibration strategies) or by differences in genomic regions sampled (data types). We investigated the impact of calibration strategies and data types on the timing of the Palaeognathae root using genomic sequences from nuclear (noncoding [CNEE and UCE] and coding [first and second codon positions]) and mitogenomic datasets. The nuclear dataset included 14 Palaeognathae species (13 extant and the extinct moa), while the mitogenomic included 31 species, covering all extant and extinct lineages. The datasets were analyzed with and without internal calibrations. The age estimates were more influenced by calibration strategy than data type, although some nuclear data (CNEE) produced substantially younger ages except for the Casuariiformes node, whilst another dataset (PRM) from a previous study estimated younger ages for Casuariiformes compared to the other datasets. Nevertheless, our results consistently placed the origin of crown Palaeognathae around the K-Pg boundary (62-68 Ma), even when using the original dataset that produced the Eocene age. These findings demonstrate that multiple internal calibrations yield consistent results across different sequence types and taxon schemes, providing robust estimates of the crown Palaeognathae age. This improved timing enhances our understanding of the early evolutionary history of this clade, particularly regarding the placement of enigmatic Paleocene fossils, such as Lithornithidae and Diogenornis, which in this timeframe can be assigned to internal branches within the crown Palaeognathae.

AB  - A long-term perspective on bat populations is lacking in most ecosystems. We describe fluctuations in capture rate, sex ratio, body condition, site fidelity and longevity of banded bats over two decades as part of an annual banding study in a montane forest. We focus on five species previously omitted from mark-recapture analyses because band returns were too low. Each species was infrequently trapped and/or retrapped, though this was often highly variable. A degree of site fidelity was recorded for all species, even those where trap success was low. We recorded maximum longevity (likely an underestimate) of at least 5 years for eastern falsistrelle Falsistrellus tasmaniensis and 7 years for Gould's long-eared bat Nyctophilus gouldi and golden-tipped bat Phoniscus papuensis. Although N. gouldi was assumed to be highly detectable in harp traps, recaptures were few and none were retrapped more than once. No female greater-broad-nosed bat Scoteanax rueppellii were captured, a minor male bias was evident for F. tasmaniensis and sex ratios were close to parity for N. gouldi, P. papuensis and eastern horseshoe bat Rhinolophus megaphyllus. Body condition and mass were mostly stable over the study and were not related to periods of drought (except perhaps F. tasmaniensis in 2019) or higher rainfall. Although we recorded some degree of site fidelity among years, the extent of any seasonal or nomadic movements remains largely unknown.

AB  - Ischaemic stroke is characterized by a sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain, resulting in a corresponding loss of neurologic function. As a result of this process, neurons in the ischaemic core are deprived of oxygen and trophic substances and are consequently destroyed. Tissue damage in brain ischaemia results from a complex pathophysiological cascade comprising various distinct pathological events. Ischaemia leads to brain damage by stimulating many processes, such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, acidotoxicity, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, less attention has been given to biophysical factors, including the organization of the cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of cells. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to evaluate whether the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) procedure, which is a commonly accepted experimental model of ischaemia, could affect cytoskeleton organization and the paracrine immune response. The abovementioned aspects were examined ex vivo in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) subjected to the OGD procedure. We measured cell death/viability, nitric oxide (NO) release, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) levels. Next, the impact of the OGD procedure on cytoskeletal organization was evaluated using combined confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Concurrently, to find whether there is a correlation between biophysical properties and the immune response, we examined the impact of OGD on the levels of crucial ischaemia cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10) in OHCs and calculated Pearsons' and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. The results of the current study demonstrated that the OGD procedure intensified cell death and nitric oxide release and led to the potentiation of HIF-1 ff release in OHCs. Moreover, we presented significant disturbances in the organization of the cytoskeleton (actin fibers, microtubular network) and cytoskeleton-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), which is a neuronal marker. Simultaneously, our study provided new evidence that the OGD procedure leads to the stiffening of OHCs and a malfunction in immune homeostasis. A negative linear correlation between tissue stiffness and branched IBA1 positive cells after the OGD procedure suggests the pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia. Moreover, the negative correlation of pro- and positive anti-inflammatory factors with actin fibers density indicates an opposing effect of the immune mediators on the rearrangement of cytoskeleton induced by OGD procedure in OHCs. Our study constitutes a basis for further research and provides a rationale for integrating biomechanical and biochemical methods in studying the pathomechanism of strokerelated brain damage. Furthermore, presented data pointed out the interesting direction of proof-ofconcept studies, in which follow-up may establish new targets for brain ischemia therapy.

AB  - In spite of many anti-cancer drugs utilized in clinical treatment, cancer is still one of the diseases with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide, owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment. Compared with conventional 2D tumor models, 3D scaffolds could provide structures and a microenvironment which stimulate native tumor tissues more accurately. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the main component of the cell in the microenvironment that is mainly composed of three-dimensional nanofibers, which can form nanoscale fiber networks, while the decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has been widely applied to engineered scaffolds. In this study, pig kidney was used as the source material to prepare dECM scaffolds. A chemical crosslinking method was used to improve the mechanical properties and other physical characteristics of the decellularized pig kidney-derived scaffold. Furthermore, a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was used to further investigate the biocompatibility of the scaffold to fabricate a tumor model. The results showed that the existence of nanostructures in the scaffold plays an important role in cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Therefore, the pig kidney-derived matrix scaffold prepared by decellularization could provide more cell attachment sites, which is conducive to cell adhesion and proliferation, physiological activities, and tumor model construction.

AB  - Behavioural contagion is an automatic process through which a behaviour performed by an individual (trigger) is reproduced by an observer (responder) without necessarily replicating the exact motor sequence. It has been linked to inter-individual synchronisation and possibly emotional contagion. Play can convey emotions and enhance social bonding, although its contagiousness is understudied. To verify social play contagion presence and modulating factors, we gathered audio-video data on social play, distance and affiliation on a group of savannah African elephants (15 individuals) at Parque de la Naturaleza de Cabarceno (Cantabria, Spain). Social play was contagious as it was more likely started by uninvolved elephants (within 3-min) in Post-Play Condition (PP) - after that other elephants had started playing - than in Matched-control Condition (MC; no previous play). Social play contagion mostly occurred within 30 m - probably due to elephants' limited visual acuity - and it was highest between individuals that affiliated the most, with the distance-affiliation interaction having no effect. The most prominent individuals in the social play network were also the most influential in the play contagion network (Eigenvector-centrality measure). Play contagion was socially modulated, thus suggesting it may extend from motor replication to the replication of the underlying affective state.

AB  - Arginine (ARG)/Citrulline (CIT) deficiency is associated with increased sepsis severity after infection. Supplementation of CIT to susceptible patients with ARG/CIT deficiency such as preterm newborns with suspected infection might prevent sepsis, via maintaining immune and vascular function. Caesareandelivered, parenterally nourished preterm pigs were treated with CIT (1g/kg bodyweight) via oral or continuous intravenous supplementation, then inoculated with live Staphylococcus epidermidis and clinically monitored for 14 h. Blood, liver, and spleen samples were collected for analysis. In vitro cord blood stimulation was performed to explore how CIT and ARG affect premature blood cell responses. After infection, oral CIT supplementation led to higher mortality, increased blood bacterial load, and systemic and hepatic inflammation. Intravenous CIT administration showed increased inflammation and bacterial burdens without significantly affecting mortality. Liver transcriptomics and data from in vitro blood stimulation indicated that CIT induces systemic immunosuppression in preterm newborns, which may impair resistance response to bacteria at the early stage of infection, subsequently causing later uncontrollable inflammation and tissue damage. The early stage of CIT supplementation exacerbates sepsis severity in infected preterm pigs, likely via inducing systemic immunosuppression.

AB  - This work contains the results of fern-arthropod interactions from a midland Atlantic Rainforest locality and addresses the taphonomic, morphological and ecological implications of insect damage on ferns to interpret them on fossil plant assemblages. Six functional feeding groups - margin feeding, hole feeding, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, mining and galling - are present on the three fern species inhabiting the understory of an Araucaria Forest in the Atlantic Forest biome, southern Brazil. We recognised 19 damage types (DTs), including 14 arthropod-induced DTs, three of which are newly proposed herein. Five of the DTs found were first recorded on ferns. Of the DTs found, the proportion of guilds such as mining and galling shows a significant similarity with those of an upland locality. Products of arachnids and insect behaviour on ferns made up 25% of all fern-arthropod interactions in the midland locality, which included dead bodies and byproducts from processes of arthropod life cycle, which are unlikely to be preserved in the fossil record. This rate of arthropod products consists of significant evidence of interactions to unveil deep-time relationships between arthropods and plants. Lastly, leaf damage on living ferns is more frequent than those occurring in fossil plant assemblages.

AB  - In order to achieve optimal growth and health of farm animals, a different amount/ratio of essential amino acids in the feed is necessary in each phase of life. Knowledge about which amino acids are essential and in which quantities/proportions they are best administered has already greatly advanced the pig and poultry sector and is still being generated today. For the still young, rapidly developing insect sector, this knowledge could mean a major step forward towards breeding optimization. Therefore, in this research the needs of the 2 most commercially reared insect species, namely mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) (MW) and black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) (BSF), were investigated. The focus was on requirements for lysine, methionine, threonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan based on evidence from the literature and those of pigs. Semi-artificial diets based on at least 25% wheat bran (MW) and chicken feed/water (30/70) (BSF) (basic feed important for structure and certain micronutrients) supplemented with sugar and synthetic amino acids were tested. The diets were isoenergetic and isoproteinous. Of the amino acids studied, one was administered in different doses per experiment. The non-essential glutamic acid was used as a substitute at lower doses. Growth, as measured by weight gain, and survival were observed. The following results were for MW and BSF respectively. For lysine from a content of 0.35 g/100 g diet and 0.53 g/100 g diet no extra growth was noticeable. For methionine this was from 0.13 g/100 g and 0.16 g/100 g. Each time more threonine was given, a significant difference could be noticed and the minimum doses were around 0.42 g/100 g and 0.49 g/100 g. With tryptophan, for MW, there were no differences between the different concentrations. At the lowest dose of 0.06 g/100 g the maximum growth was already reached, whereas for BSF this was at 0.13 g/100 g.

AB  - Simple Summary Many plants contain natural secondary compounds that can exert medicinal effects. Parasitism in sheep is an animal welfare issue and affects performance. Much is unknown about natural plant compounds and how they could potentially serve as an alternative to traditional dewormers. Therefore, a series of preliminary studies conducted in the lab and in lambs were used to determine potential anti-parasitic effects of loline. Loline is an alkaloid found naturally in many fescue-type grasses and is considered non-toxic to mammals. Results from the studies were mixed. Despite potential promising results in the lab, there was limited evidence to support an anti-parasitic effect of loline in lambs. Discrepancies between lab and lamb studies were potentially a result of loline contact time with parasite larvae, mode of ingestion or the forms of loline present. Loline, an alkaloid with several derivatives, has suggested antimicrobial and anthelmintic properties. Therefore, loline was investigated as a natural anthelmintic against Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Teladorsagia circumcincta, and Haemonchus contortus. Preliminary in vitro studies had reduced L3 T. circumcincta establishment but no effect on L3 T. colubriformis larvae migration or H. contortus establishment. While loline-treated lambs had lower establishment of L4 and adult T. circumcincta and L4 T. colubriformis, L4 and adult H. contortus appeared unaffected. Following preliminary study, an in vivo experiment examined lambs infected with a mix of L4 T. circumcincta, T. colubriformis, and adult H. contortus. These lambs were treated with either a loline seed extract (LOL, n = 7), nothing (CON, n = 7), or a non-loline seed extract (NIL, n = 2). There were no differences in worm burdens, fecal egg counts, weight gain, or feed intake between treatments. However, an average growth efficiency (kg LWG/kg DM intake) was detected (p = 0.01) in CON (0.18) which was less than LOL (0.24) or NIL (0.23). There was limited evidence to support an in vivo anti-parasitic effect of loline despite in vitro studies indicating potential benefits. Discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro studies results were potentially a result of loline contact time with larvae, mode of ingestion or the forms of loline present.

AB  - Tibetan sheep are already well adapted to cold season nutrient stress on the Tibetan Plateau. Rumen, an important nutrient for metabolism and as an absorption organ in ruminants, plays a vital role in the cold stress adaptations of Tibetan sheep. Ruminal microbiota also plays an indispensable role in rumen function. In this study, combined multiomics data were utilized to comprehensively analyze the interaction mechanism between rumen epithelial miRNAs and microbiota and their metabolites in Tibetan sheep under nutrient stress in the cold season. A total of 949 miRNAs were identified in the rumen epithelium of both cold and warm seasons. A total of 62 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were screened using FC > 1.5 and p value < 0.01, and a total of 20,206 targeted genes were predicted by DE miRNAs. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that DE miRNA-targeted genes were mainly enriched in axon guidance(ko04360), tight junction(ko04530), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels(ko04750) and metabolism-related pathways. Correlation analysis revealed that rumen microbiota, rumen VFAs and DE miRNAs were all correlated. Further study revealed that the targeted genes of cold and warm season rumen epithelial DE miRNAs were coenriched with differential metabolites of microbiota in glycerophospholipid metabolism (ko00564), apoptosis (ko04210), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels (ko04750), small cell lung cancer (ko05222), and choline metabolism in cancer (ko05231) pathways. There are several interactions between Tibetan sheep rumen epithelial miRNAs, rumen microbiota, and microbial metabolites, mainly through maintaining rumen epithelial barrier function and host homeostasis of choline and cholesterol, improving host immunity, and promoting energy metabolism pathways, thus enabling Tibetan sheep to effectively respond to cold season nutrient stress. The results also suggest that rumen microbiota have coevolved with their hosts to improve the adaptive capacity of Tibetan sheep to cold season nutrient stress, providing a new perspective for the study of cold season nutritional stress adaptation in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Fattening lambs' behaviors and vitality statuses reflect health status and animal welfare directly. However, current detection methods for these aspects primarily rely on manual observation, which is inefficient. This paper aims to achieve precise and intelligent recognition of fattening lambs' behaviors and vitality statuses. Through the comprehensive literature review, field observations, and consultations with experts, four pivotal behaviors (running, sleeping, socialization, and wandering), alongside four vitality statuses (excitement, hungry, lethargy, and normal) are identified as crucial indicators that mirror the health status of fattening lambs. A visual system is established to collect and construct a dataset of fattening lambs, and a five-fold cross-validation method is employed to determine the basic model. Furthermore, an improved lightweight YOLOv8n model, named SheepYOLO, is developed in this paper. Sheep-YOLO utilizes the FasterNet network to reduce model complexity and incorporates the Mixed Local Channel Attention (MLCA) module, SIoU loss function, and Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures (CARAFE) to enhance the model's adaptability to varying breeding densities and lighting conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the optimization strategies, comparison experiments are conducted in this paper. The experimental results show that Sheep-YOLO achieved Params of 1.905 M and GFLOPs of 5.5 G, with a high mAP0.5 of 96.1 % on the test set and a detection speed of 79.317 FPS(12.61 ms/per image). Compared to the basic YOLOv8n, Sheep-YOLO achieves a 36.6 % reduction in Params and a 30 % decrease in GFLOPs, while maintaining higher mAP0.5 and faster detection speed. Besides, Sheep-YOLO surpasses widely used algorithms such as YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv5n, YOLOv10n, RT-DETR, and Faster-RCNN regarding both lightweight performance and precision. Therefore, this study provides potential technical support for precise and intelligent recognition of the behaviors and vitality statuses of fattening lambs, contributing to the health monitoring and early disease prediction of sheep.

AB  - BACKGROUND This study explored the genetic variability in the New Zealand sheep population for economically important skin traits. Skins were collected at slaughter from two progeny test flocks, resulting in 725 skins evaluated for grain strain, flatness, crust leather strength and overall suitability for shoe leather. DNA profiles collected from skins post-slaughter were matched to individual animals using previously collected high-density genotypes. RESULTS Considerable phenotypic variation for skin traits was observed, with around 40% of the skins being identified as suitable for high-value shoe leather production. Several key traits associated with leather production, including flatness, tear strength, grain strength and grain strain were found to be moderate to highly heritable (h(2) = 0.28-0.82). There were no major significant genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks associated with many of the traits examined, however, one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reached significance for the flatness of the skin over the hindquarters. CONCLUSION This research confirms that suitable lamb skins can be bred for use as high-value shoe leather. While moderately to highly heritable, skin traits in New Zealand lambs appear to be polygenic with no genes of major effect underlaying the traits of interest. Given the complex nature of these traits, the identification and selection of animals with higher-value skins may be enabled by geomic selection. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are more prevalent in men than in women, though AUD diagnoses in women are growing rapidly, making an understanding of sex differences in alcohol-related behaviors increasingly important. The development of AUDs involves the transition from casual, low levels of alcohol drinking to higher, maladaptive levels. The ability of low dose alcohol to drive reward and drug seeking may differ in males and females, and this could underlie differences in susceptibility to AUD. In this study we sought to determine whether a history of chronic, low dose ethanol exposure (0.5 g/kg; i.p.) could drive sucrose reward seeking and motivation, and whether this differed between male and female mice. Adult mice were trained to lever press for a liquid sucrose reward on two reinforcement schedules: a random interval (RI) schedule and a variable ratio (VR) schedule. After training, mice were tested on each of these levers for reward motivation using a progressive ratio test. We found that a history of low dose ethanol exposure increased sucrose reward motivation in male mice, but only on the RI lever and only when exposure occurred proximal to learning. Female mice were more motivated for sucrose on the RI lever than the VR lever regardless of ethanol exposure condition. These findings indicate that training on different reinforcement schedules affects reward motivation. Further, we show that males are more susceptible to the effects of low dose ethanol on sucrose reward motivation than females. These data broaden our understanding of sex differences in reward seeking as a result of ethanol exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary The benefits of rearing chicks in complex environments rather than barren environments are well established. However, the typical rearing environments for modern laying hens are still considerably more barren than the complex forest habitat of their ancestors. This small-scale experimental study investigated whether giving chicks of white Bovans Robust the possibility to express choices between different variants of the same resource could result in them being better able to cope with challenges, as well as being better able to make the most of new opportunities. We found that chicks with access to different types of litter and perches were less fearful, less chronically stressed, and were better prepared to cope with pathogenic challenges. Furthermore, they were more successful in a repeated opportunity test, implying an improved learning ability. Overall, the results suggest that rearing laying hen chicks in an environment with access to variation in relevant resources could be a simple and feasible way to increase complexity under commercial conditions. This input could result in them being more resistant to infection and better able to adapt to novel situations later in life. Early experience of a complex environment can improve biologically relevant traits related to coping abilities. However, the mechanisms underlying these positive effects have not been well explored. We hypothesized that giving chicks possibilities to express choices within relevant resources could be an important part of the mechanism, as well as a novel way to increase environmental complexity. In a balanced design, laying hen hatchlings of the white hybrid Bovans Robust were reared in a "single-choice" environment (single litter and perch type) or a "multi-choice" environment (four different litter and perch types). Immunological and behavioral indicators of chicks' coping abilities were explored in this experimental study at three weeks of age. Chicks from "multi-choice" environments had shorter durations of tonic immobility, lower heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, higher natural antibody concentrations, and were more successful in gaining novel food rewards in a repeated opportunity test. These results imply that chicks having access to variation within resource types were less fearful, experienced less chronic stress, would be more able to cope with pathogenic challenges, and potentially had an improved learning ability. To conclude, the more complex environment, achieved by increasing chicks' possibilities to choose, seemed to make chicks better prepared for potential challenges, boosting their adaptive capacities and their ability to make the most of opportunities.

AB  - When rams and ewes interact freely, dominant rams perform the greatest number of copulations. However, the sexual preference of the female might influence the final distribution of ejaculations, and preference for subordinate rams could be evolutionary advantageous. To determine the sexual preference of the ewe for dominant (DOM) or subordinate (SUB) rams when rams? activity is restricted, 28 ewes and 8 rams were used. Rams were classified into DOM and SUB by competition in pairs for an estrous ewe and were kept in dyads until the end of the experiment. Ewes were induced into estrus using progestagen-impregnated intravaginal sponges, and 24 h after sponge withdrawal, the sexual preference of the ewe for DOM or SUM rams was determined individually. Both rams were tethered with a 4 m long lasso in opposite corners of a 4m ? 12m pen, and all the interactions were video-recorded. The test was repeated with seven ewes for each dyad of rams. The evaluation period started when the ewe allowed her first mount and ended with the last. At the end of each test, each ewe was removed from the pen and the location of the rams were exchanged. The time the ewe received the first to the last mating averaged 16:55 ? 1:25 h:min. Overall, ewes entered more times and remained longer in the zone of the SUB (entrances: 68.9 vs 29.1; pooled SEM = 9.0; P = 0.001; time into the zone: 3.66 ? 0.56 h vs 1.04 ? 0.51 h; P=<0.0001, for SUB and DOM rams, respectively). In 25 % of the tests, only the SUB ram mated the ewes. The number mounts and mates were significantly greater in SUB than DOM rams (mounts: 22.35 ? 3.07 vs 10.86 ? 2.84; P = 0.0005; mates: 10.50 ? 0.94 vs 3.79 ? 1.07; P < 0.0001 for SUB and DOM rams respectively). It was concluded that estrous ewes prefer to interact and be mounted and mated by subordinate rather than by dominant rams when rams? activity is restricted.

AB  - Tieguanyin tea, a renowned oolong tea, is one of the ten most famous teas in China. The Squamosa Promoter Binding Protein (SBP)-box transcription factor family, widely present in plants, plays a crucial role in plant development, growth, and stress responses. In this study, we identify and analyze 22 CsSBP genes at the genome-wide level. These genes were distributed unevenly across 11 chromosomes. Using Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum L. as model organisms, we constructed a phylogenetic tree to classify these genes into six distinct subfamilies. Collinearity analysis revealed 20 homologous gene pairs between AtSBP and CsSBP, 21 pairs between SiSBP and CsSBP, and 14 pairs between OsSBP and CsSBP. Cis-acting element analysis indicated that light-responsive elements were the most abundant among the CsSBP genes. Protein motif, domain, and gene architecture analyses demonstrated that members of the same subgroup shared similar exon-intron structures and motif arrangements. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression profiles of nine CsSBP genes under light, shade, and cold stress using qRT-PCR analysis. Notably, CsSBP1, CsSBP17, and CsSBP19 were significantly upregulated under all three stresses. This study provides fundamental insights into the CsSBP gene family and offers a novel perspective on the mechanisms of SBP transcription factor-mediated stress responses, as well as Tieguanyin tea's adaptation to environmental variations.

AB  - Interactions between jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways in plants are important for regulating metabolite production and resistance functions against environmental stresses. These interactions in plants have mostly been reported to be antagonistic, but also to be synergistic under specific external inducing conditions. At present, publications on plant JA-SA interactions lack a bibliometric analysis. External inducing factors that elicit synergism of JA-SA interactions need to be explored. Here, we use bibliometrics to analyze publications on plant JA-SA interactions over the past three decades, and analyze external inducing factors that influence the quality of JA-SA interactions in plants by meta-analysis. More contributions have been made by authors in China, Netherlands, the United States of America, and Germany than elsewhere. Considerable research has been performed on variation in plant defense mediated by two pathways, the transduction mechanisms of JA-SA signaling crosstalk, and plant hormone signaling networks. Meta-analysis showed that the excitation sequence of the two pathways, and the concentrations of pathway excitors are key factors that affect pathways interactions. The JA and SA pathways tend to be reciprocally antagonistic when elicited simultaneously, whereas JA-SA interactions tend to be synergistic when the two pathways are elicited at different times and the pre-treated inducer is at a lower concentration. The SA pathway is more susceptible to being synergized by the JA pathway. Key molecular nodes identified in the JA-SA signaling interaction in model plants, and prospects for future research are discussed.

AB  - Modelling of a mineral dissolution front propagation is of interest in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields. The dissolution of minerals often involves complex physico-chemical processes at the solid-liquid interface (at nano-scale), which at the micro-to-meso-scale can be simplified to the problem of continuously moving boundaries. In this work, we studied the diffusion-controlled congruent dissolution of minerals from a meso-scale phase transition perspective. The dynamic evolution of the solid-liquid interface, during the dissolution process, is numerically simulated by employing the Finite Element Method (FEM) and using the phase-field (PF) approach, the latter implemented in the open-source Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). The parameterization of the PF numerical approach is discussed in detail and validated against the experimental results for a congruent dissolution case of NaCl (taken from literature) as well as on analytical models for simple geometries. In addition, the effect of the shape of a dissolving mineral particle was analysed, thus demonstrating that the PF approach is suitable for simulating the mesoscopic morphological evolution of arbitrary geometries. Finally, the comparison of the PF method with experimental results demonstrated the importance of the dissolution rate mechanisms, which can be controlled by the interface reaction rate or by the diffusive transport mechanism.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that exposure to air particulate matter (PM) increases the incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and exerts a significant neurotoxic effect on the nervous system, especially on the immature nervous system. Here, we selected PND28 rats to simulate the immature nervous system of young children and used neurobehavioral methods to examine how exposure to PM affected spatial learning and memory, as well as electrophysiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics to study the morphology of hippocampus and the function of hippocampal synapses. We discovered that spatial learning and memory were impaired in rats exposed to PM. The morphology and structure of the hippocampus were altered in the PM group. In addition, after exposure to PM, the relative expression of synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95) proteins decreased dramatically in rats. Furthermore, PM exposure impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 pathway. Interestingly, RNA sequencing and bioinformat-ics analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were rich in terms associated with synaptic function. Five hub genes (Agt, Camk2a, Grin2a, Snca, and Syngap1) that may play a significant role in the dys-functionality of hippocampal synapses were identified.Our findings implied that exposure to PM impaired spatial learning and memory via exerting impacts on the dysfunctionality of hippocampal synapses in juvenile rats and that Agt, Camk2a, Grin2a, Snca, and Syngap1 may drive PM-caused synaptic dysfunction.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) is a constituent of the TGF-beta superfamily, known for its ability to stimulate bone and cartilage formation. The investigation of bmp6's involvement in the formation of intermuscular bones in fish has garnered significant attention in recent years. The rib cage is an important skeletal structure that plays a protective function for internal organs in fish. However, there has been limited research conducted on the effects of the bmp6 gene on rib development. Silver carp is one of four major fish in China, favoured for its affordability and tender muscle. Nevertheless, the presence of numerous intermuscular bones in silver carp significantly hinders the advancement of its palatability and suitability for processing. This study showcases the effective utilisation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the purpose of disrupting the bmp6 gene in silver carp, leading to the creation of chimeras in the P0 generation, marking the first instance of such an achievement. The chimeras exhibited complete viability, normal appearance, and partial intermuscular bones loss, with approximately 30% of them displaying rib bifurcation or bending. Subsequently, a transcriptome analysis on ribs of P0 chimeras and wild-type silver carp was conducted, leading to the identification of 934 genes exhibiting differential expression, of which 483 were found to be up-regulated and 451 were found to be down-regulated. The results of the KEGG analysis revealed that the "NF-kappa B signalling pathway", "Hippo signalling pathway", "osteoclast differentiation", and "haematopoietic cell lineage" exhibited enrichment and displayed a significant correlation with bone development. The up-regulated genes such as tnf alpha, fos, and ctgf in pathways may facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts, whereas the down-regulation of genes such as tgfb2 and tgfbr1 in pathways may hinder the formation and specialisation of osteoblasts, ultimately resulting in rib abnormalities. This study presents novel findings on the impact of bmp6 gene deletion on the rib development of silver carp, while simultaneously investigating the previously unexplored molecular mechanisms underlying rib defects in fish.

AB  - Increases in human life expectancy have led to increases in the prevalence of senile dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. This is a major problem because there are no curative treatments for these diseases, and patients with unmanaged cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms experience many social problems. Sulforaphane is a type of organosulfur compound known as an isothiocyanate. It is derived from glucoraphanin, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbages, via an enzymatic reaction that is triggered by plant damage (e.g., chewing). Sulforaphane exhibits activity against cancer, inflammation, depression, and severe cardiac diseases. It can also alleviate oxidative stress and neural dysfunction in the brain. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the electrophysiological and behavioral basis of the effects of sulforaphane on learning and memory. Therefore, we evaluated whether acute sulforaphane administration affected long-term potentiation (LTP) in organotypic cultured rat hippocampal tissues. We also measured the effect of sulforaphane on the performance of three behavioral tests, the Y-maze test, the passive avoidance test, and the Morris water maze, which assess shortterm memory, avoidance memory, and short and long-term spatial memory, respectively. We found that sulforaphane increased the total field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in a dosedependent manner after high frequency stimulation and attenuated scopolamine-induced interference of the fEPSP in the hippocampal CA1 area. Sulforaphane also restored cognitive function and inhibited memory impairment as indicated by the alleviation of the negative neurological effects of scopolamine, i.e, a lowered ratio of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, a reduced step-through latency in the passive avoidance test, and an increased navigation time in the Morris water maze. These results indicate that sulforaphane can effectively prevent the attenuation of LTP and cognitive abilities induced by cholinergic and muscarinic receptor blockade. Further research is warranted to explore the potential therapeutic and prophylactic utility of sulforaphane for improving learning and memory, especially in those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background: Metarhizium is one of the entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) that has been widely reported as a useful agent for controlling the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Application of this fungus as a biopesticide is influenced by regional environmental conditions that affect the pathogenic activity against the targeted pest. Several studies have proven that the native fungal isolates have strong pathogenic activity than EPF introduced from other regions. The identification of local EPF species is a strategic approach to develop potential biopesticides with standard properties including host specificity, climate suitability, and significantly suppressing the target pest population. This study aimed to identify Metarhizium species isolated from infected CRB larvae with high pathogenicity to host pests in East Java, Indonesia. Results: Thirteen isolates were obtained which were divided into 4 clades based on phylogenetic analysis by the ITS rDNA region, namely M. anisopliae var. lepidiotae, M. anisopliae var. anisopliae, M. brunneum, and M. majus. Identified Metarhizium species exhibited varied sizes of conidia, but fell within the size ranges reported in previous studies. Interestingly, the isolate MaSi produced conidial lengths well above the range of conidial sizes recorded and placed these isolates (M. anisopliae) in the MGT clade, known as MALC (M. anisopliae s.l. with large conidia). The present investigation reported that isolates MaLe, MaMa, MaWa, and MaSi produced higher mortality values than other isolates, supporting that M. majus and MALC had higher pathogenicity against O. rhinoceros larvae than other Metarhizium species. Neighbor-joining analysis showed a close resemblance between the isolate MaMa and the strain ARSEF 1946, which was isolated from the CRB. In addition, the isolate MaMa had the highest virulence against O. rhinoceros larval cadaver with a faster lethal time (for 50% mortality). This result indicated a possible relationship between phylogenetic status or DNA sequence polymorphisms with Metarhizium pathogenicity and host specificity. Conclusions: The local species of Metarhizium have been isolated from infected CRB larvae, and M. majus isolates exhibited high pathogenicity against O. rhinoceros larvae. The close similarity of M. majus isolates and CRB-isolated strains suggests a possible relationship between pathogenicity and host specificity with phylogenetic status or DNA sequence polymorphisms.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a low-protein (LP) diet supplemented with sodium butyrate (SB), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on nutrient utilization and lipid and amino acid metabolism in weaned pigs. A total of 120 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire pigs (initial body weight: 7.93 +/- 0.65 kg) were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments, including the control diet (CON), LP diet, LP + 0.2% SB diet (LP + SB), LP + 0.2% MCFA diet (LP + MCFA) and LP + 0.2% n-3 PUFA diet (LP + PUFA). The results show that the LP + MCFA diet increased (p < 0.05) the digestibility of dry matter and total P in pigs compared with the CON and LP diets. In the liver of the pigs, the metabolites involved in sugar metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation significantly changed with the LP diet compared with the CON diet. Compared with the LP diet, the altered metabolites in the liver of the pigs fed with the LP + SB diet were mainly associated with sugar metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism; the altered metabolites in the liver of pigs fed with the LP + MCFA and LP + PUFA diets were mainly associated with lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. In addition, the LP + PUFA diet increased (p < 0.05) the concentration of glutamate dehydrogenase in the liver of pigs compared with the LP diet. Furthermore, the LP + MCFA and LP + PUFA diets increased (p < 0.05) the mRNA abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the liver compared with the CON diet. The LP + PUFA diet increased (p < 0.05) mRNA abundances of fatty acid synthase in the liver compared with the CON and LP diets. Collectively, the LP diet supplemented with MCFAs improved nutrient digestibility, and the LP diet supplemented with MCFAs and n-3 PUFAs promoted lipid and amino acid metabolisms.

AB  - Studies on the selection of floral traits usually consider pollinators and sometimes herbivores. However, humans also exert selection on floral traits of ornamental plants. We compared the preferences of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), and humans for flowers of snapdragon. From a cross of two species, Antirrhinum majus and Antirrhinum linkianum, we selected four Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). We characterised scent emission from whole flowers and stamens, pollen content and viability, trichome density, floral shape, size and colour of floral parts. We tested the preferences of bumblebees, thrips, and humans for whole flowers, floral scent bouquets, stamen scent, and individual scent compounds. Humans and bumblebees showed preferences for parental species, whereas thrips preferred RILs. Colour and floral scent, in combination with other floral traits, seem relevant phenotypes for all organisms. Remarkably, visual traits override scent cues for bumblebees, although, scent is an important trait when bumblebees cannot see the flowers, and methyl benzoate was identified as a key attractant for them. The evolutionary trajectory of flowers is the result of multiple floral traits interacting with different organisms with different habits and modes of interaction.

AB  - Pig face recognition is a promising, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for monitoring pigs. However, rapid growth alters their appearance, challenging facial recognition. To address this, we build a cross-time-scale dataset with 33,434 images of 137 Bamaxiang pigs (26-76 days old). To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we train and evaluat five CNN models on it. Specifically, ConvNeXt, ResNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, and MobileNet achieve accuracies of 98.6 %, 97.2 %, 96.6 %, 93.9 %, and 65 %, respectively. Temporal scalability analysis show accuracy dropping from 97 % to 69 % as the training-test gap increased from 0 to 24 days. Besides, ResNet18 with a triplet loss function reaches 88.5 % accuracy. While pig face recognition performs well, it remains highly sensitive to short-term facial changes, requiring future models to capture temporal features.

AB  - It is necessary to study small-ruminant production systems in a spatial context, as different areas, depending on their natural, socioeconomic, and cultural context, will respond differently to the effects of such causal factors. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between technology use and farm and farmer characteristics in dairy sheep production by developing a farm typology using multivariate statistical analysis and comparing it with the multi-scale sustainability evaluation of the Natural Resource Management Systems (NRMS) method. Quantitative and qualitative data were evaluated and compared using the NRMS method and cluster analysis to identify groups of farms. Fourteen variables were considered for the analysis, resulting in four farm systems with the NRMS method, named Intensive, Semi-Intensive, Semi-Extensive, and Extensive; however, when analyzing the data by cluster analysis, the following clusters were used: Cluster 1, Semi-Extensive Dairy Systems (SEDSs); Cluster 2, Semi-Intensive Systems (SIDSs); Cluster 3, Semi-Extensive Cheese Systems (SECSs); and Cluster 4, Intensive Dairy Systems (IDSs). This study concludes that the traditional classification of dairy sheep farms based on their dependence on natural resources can be enriched by incorporating additional indicators that allow for a more comprehensive and accurate characterization of farms.

AB  - Exposure to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) is known to enhance the defense responses in plants. This so-called priming effect has only been marginally studied in intercropping systems. We tested whether HIPVs from cowpea, which often serves as an intercrop alongside maize, can prime herbivore-induced volatile emissions in maize. Conventional volatile collection assays and real-time mass spectrometry revealed that maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs from cowpea infested with Spodoptera exigua caterpillars emitted more than control plants when they themselves were subsequently damaged by the same pest. The enhanced emission was only evident on the first day after infestation. Maize plants that were exposed to HIPVs from cowpea infested by S. frugiperda larvae showed no priming effect and released considerably less upon S. frugiperda infestation than upon S. exigua infestation. The latter may be explained by the fact that S. frugiperda is particularly well adapted to feed on maize and is known to suppress maize HIPV emissions. Our results imply that HIPVs from cowpea, depending on the inducing insect herbivore, may strongly prime maize plants. This deserves further investigation, also in other intercropping systems, as it can have important consequences for tritrophic interactions and crop protection.

AB  - The 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops age-related neuropathology and sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments. The purpose of this study was to examine whether age-related changes in motor function affected working memory performance in 5xFAD mice in the Hebb-Williams Maze (HWM). At 6 months of age, the 5xFAD mice performed better than the WT (B6SJL) mice on the accelerating rotarod, but much worse at 12 months of age. The 5xFAD and WT mice did not differ in days to acquisition in the HWM at 6 months of age, but the WT mice took longer at 12 months of age. The number of errors increased with maze difficulty and at 6 months of age, the 5xFAD mice made more errors than the WT mice only on difficult problems. At 12 months of age 5xFAD mice made more errors than WT mice at each level of problem difficulty. The latency to solve the problems was higher for the 5xFAD mice than the WT mice in the difficult problems at 6 months of age and in the intermediate problems at 12 months of age. Although body weight had some effect on rotarod performance, there were no systematic effects of motor deficits on either errors or latency measures in the test trials of the HWM. These results indicate that the 5xFAD mice had deficits in working memory in the HWM and that these deficits were not confounded by impaired motor performance.

AB  - INGA FOOD, S.A. initiated a crossbreeding program between two Iberian pig varieties, Retinto (R) and Entrepelado (E), with the goal of producing a hybrid sow (F1). Several studies have been conducted to evaluate its productive performance, and these studies have revealed differences in litter size between the two reciprocal crosses, suggesting the presence of genomic imprinting effects. To further investigate these effects, this study introduces a multivariate gametic model designed to estimate gametic correlations between paternal and maternal effects originating from both genetic backgrounds involved in the reciprocal crosses. The dataset consisted of 1258 records (the total number born-TNB and the number born alive-NBA) from 203 crossbred dams for the Entrepelado (sire) x Retinto (dam) cross and 700 records from 125 crossbred dams for the Retinto (sire) x Entrepelado (dam) cross. All animals were genotyped using the GeneSeek((R)) GPP Porcine 70 K HDchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The results indicated that the posterior distribution of the gametic correlation between paternal and maternal effects was distinctly different between the two populations. Specifically, in the Retinto population, the gametic correlation showed a positive skew with posterior probabilities of 0.78 for the TNB and 0.80 for the NBA. On the other hand, the Entrepelado population showed a posterior probability of a positive gametic correlation between paternal and maternal effects of approximately 0.50. The differences in the shape of the posterior distribution of the gametic correlations between paternal and maternal effects observed in the two varieties may account for the distinct performance outcomes observed in the reciprocal crosses.

AB  - Due to a lack of understanding of the disease epidemiology and comprehensive control measures, tea leaf spot caused by Didymella segeticola has a significant negative impact on tea yield and quality in the tea plantations of Southwest China. Phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) is a phenazine compound derived from Pseudomonas species that exhibits antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. However, its inhibitory mechanism is not yet clear. The current study evaluated the inhibitory activity of PCN against various phytopathogenic fungi and found that PCN has inhibitory activity against multiple pathogens, with a half-maximal effective concentration value for D. segeticola of 16.11 mu g/ml in vitro and a maximum in-vivo curative activity of 72.28% toward tea leaf spot. Morphological changes in the hyphae after exposure to PCN were observed through microstructure and ultrastructure analysis and indicated that PCN causes abnormalities in the hyphae, such as cytoplasmic coagulation, shortened hyphal inter-septum distances, and unclear boundaries of organelles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PCN upregulated the expression of genes related to energy metabolism. PCN significantly reduced the ATP concentration in the hyphae and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Molecular docking analysis indicated that PCN binds to one of the candidate target proteins, pyruvate dehydrogenase, with lower free energy of -10.7 kcal/mol. This study indicated that PCN can interfere with energy metabolism, reducing ATP generation and ultimately affecting hyphal growth. Overall, PCN shows potential for future application in the control of tea leaf spot due to its excellent antifungal activity and unique mode of action.

AB  - Camellia sinensis tea has received considerable attention due to its beneficial effects on health, particularly due to its antioxidant properties that are affected by several factors, which have a high influence on the final quality of black tea. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological properties of Azorean C. sinensis black tea from five different zones of tea plantation in order to select specific areas to cultivate tea rich in targeted compounds beneficial to human health. The free radical scavenging activity (FRSA), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), ferrous ion chelating (FIC) activities, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and tannins were determined by colorimetric methods, and catechin and theaflavin contents were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The results indicated that samples from Zone E (341 m above the sea level) presented higher values of FRSA (EC50 = 7.22 mu g/mL), FRAP (EC50 = 9.06 mu g/mL), and FIC activities (79.83%) and higher values of total phenolics (264.76 mg GAE/g DE) and almost all catechins. For TFC, the values were very similar between zones, and for theaflavins content, Zone A showed the best levels, followed by Zone E. In general, these results clearly highlight that altitude plays a significant role in enhancing certain compounds of tea, thereby influencing its quality.

AB  - Repeated exposure to stress (chronic stress) can cause excess levels of circulating cortisol and has detrimental influences on various cognitive functions including long-term memory and navigation. However, it remains an open question whether chronic stress affects path integration, a navigational strategy that presumably relies on the functioning of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. The entorhinal cortex is a brain region in the medial temporal lobe, which contains multiple cell types involved in spatial navigation (and episodic memory), and a high number of corticosteroid receptors, predisposing it as a potential target of cortisol effects. Here, our goal was to investigate the association between chronic stress and path integration performance. We assessed chronic stress via hair cortisol concentration (physiological measure) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (subjective measure) in 52 female participants aged 22-65 years. Path integration was measured using a virtual homing task. Linear mixed models revealed selective impairments associated with chronic stress that depended on error type and environmental features. When focusing on distance estimations in the path integration task, we observed a significant relationship to hair cortisol concentrations indicating impaired path integration particularly during trials with higher difficulty in participants with high hair cortisol concentrations. This relationship especially emerged in the absence of spatial cues (a boundary or a landmark), and particularly in participants who reported high levels of subjectively experienced chronic stress. The findings are in line with the hypothesis that chronic stress compromises path integration, possibly via an effect on the entorhinal grid cell system.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) are a large class of structurally diverse molecules, mainly consisting of terpenoids, phenolic compounds, and nitrogen-containing compounds, which play active roles in plant development and stress responses. The biosynthetic processes of PSMs are governed by a sophisticated regulatory network at multiple levels. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) may serve as post-transcriptional regulators for plant secondary metabolism through acting on genes encoding either transcription factors or participating enzymes in relevant metabolic pathways. High-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the large-scale identifications of ncRNAs potentially involved in plant secondary metabolism in model plant species as well as certain species with enriched production of specific types of PSMs. Moreover, a series of miRNA-target modules have been functionally characterized to be responsible for regulating PSM biosynthesis and accumulation in plants under abiotic or biotic stresses. In this review, we will provide an overview of current findings on the ncRNA-mediated regulation of plant secondary metabolism with special attention to its participation in plant stress responses, and discuss possible issues to be addressed in future fundamental research and breeding practice.

AB  - Binge patterns of alcohol use, prevalent among adolescents, are associated with a higher probability of developing alcohol use disorders (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and depression. Additionally, adverse life events strongly predict AUD and other psychiatric disorders. As such, the combined fields of stress and AUD have been well established, and animal models indicate that both binge-like alcohol exposure and stress exposure elevate anxiety-like behaviors. However, few have investigated the interaction of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) and adult stressors. We hypothesized that AIE would increase vulnerability to restraintinduced stress (RS), manifested as increased anxiety-like behavior. After AIE exposure, in adulthood, animals were tested on forced swim (FST) and saccharin preference (SP) and then exposed to either RS (90 min/5 days) or home-cage control. Twenty-four hours after the last RS session, animals began testing on the elevated plus maze (EPM), and were re-tested on FST and SP. A separate group of animals were sacrificed in adulthood after AIE and RS, and brains were harvested for immunoblot analysis of dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Consistent with previous reports, AIE had no significant effect on closed arm time in the EPM (anxiety-like behavior). However, in male rats the interaction of AIE and adult RS increased time spent in the closed arms. No effect was observed among female animals. AIE and RS-specific alterations were found in glial and synaptic markers (GLT1, FMRP and PSD-95) in male animals. These findings indicate AIE has sex-specific effects on both SP and the interaction of AIE and adult RS, which induces a propensity toward anxiety-like behavior in males. Also, AIE produces persistent hippocampal deficits that may interact with adult RS to cause increased anxiety-like behaviors. Understanding the mechanisms behind this AIE-induced increase in stress vulnerability may provide insight into treatment and prevention strategies for alcohol use disorders.

AB  - Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, affecting the brain's reward system by decreasing dopaminergic neurotransmission. It is known that dopaminergic neurotransmission is also reduced in Parkinson's disease (PD), and high adiposity is considered a risk factor for the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. This study aimed to assess the effects of obesity on neuroinflammatory and neurochemical parameters in an animal model of reserpine-induced PD. The obese group showed increased inflammation and oxidative damage as well as inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and II and DNA damage in the evaluated structures. The PD group did not show inflammation or mitochondrial dysfunction but exhibited oxidative damage in the hippocampus. The combination group (obesity + PD) showed reduced inflammation and oxidative stress and increased activity of complexes I and II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in most of the analyzed structures. On the other hand, obesity + PD caused oxidative damage to proteins in the liver, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cerebral cortex and oxidative stress in the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced catalase activity. Furthermore, the combination group showed DNA damage in blood, liver, and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, it was observed that the association of obesity and PD did not increase inflammation, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction in most of the evaluated structures but increased oxidative damage and induced mechanisms that led to DNA damage in peripheral tissues and brain structures.

AB  - Seal lice (Anoplura) parasitize amphibious hosts, such as pinnipeds, and are uniquely adapted to an oceanic environment. As obligate, permanent ectoparasites feed on the blood of their hosts and are completely dependent on them. While studies have begun to explore general diving adaptations, research into seal lice's sensory biology remains limited. In contrast to the vast majority of insects, including human lice, seal lice are devoid of eyes and depend on antennal sensory reception. This study aims to describe the morphology and putative function of antennal sensilla in five seal lice species: Antarctophthirus microchir, A. carlinii, A. lobodontis, A. ogmorhini, and Lepidophthirus macrorhini, which parasitize the South American sea lion, Weddell seal, crabeater seal, leopard seal, and southern elephant seal, respectively. The antennal structures of each species were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, and eight morphotypes were identified: spine, cuticular lobe, sensilla squamiformia, sensilla chaetica, sensilla basiconica I and II, tuft organs, and pore organs. The morphology of sensilla and their distribution on the antennal flagellum exhibited variability among genera and species. For instance, the southern elephant louse (Lepidophthirus macrorhini) is characterized by the presence of sensilla squamiformia, while Antarctophthirus spp. are distinguished by sensilla chaetica.

AB  - Sheep have been one of the most important groups of animals since ancient times. However, the knowledge of their migration routes and genetic relationships is still poorly understood. To investigate sheep maternal migration histories alongside Eurasian communications routes, in this study, we obtain mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from 17 sheep remains in 6 Chinese sites and 1 Uzbekistan site dated 4429-3100 years before present (BP). By obtaining the mitogenomes from the sheep (4429-3556 BP) found in the Tongtian Cave site in Xinjiang, Altai region of northwest China, our results support the emergence of haplogroup C sheep in Xinjiang as early as 4429-3556 BP. The combined phylogenetic analyses with extant ancient and modern sheep mitogenomes suggest that the Uzbekistan-Altai region may have been a migration hub for early sheep in eastern Asia. At least two migration events have taken place for sheep crossing Eurasia to China, one passing by Uzbekistan and Northwest China to the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River at approximately 4000 BP and another following the Altai region to middle Inner Mongolia from 4429 BP to 2500 BP. Overall, this study provides further evidence for early sheep utilization and migration patterns in Eastern Asia.

AB  - Main conclusion Increased resistance to insect herbivory in grain amaranth plants is associated with increased betalain pigmentation, either naturally acquired or accumulated in response to blue-red light irradiation. Betalains are water-soluble pigments characteristic of plants of the Caryophyllales order. Their abiotic stress-induced accumulation is believed to protect against oxidative damage, while their defensive function against biotic aggressors is scarce. A previous observation of induced betalain-biosynthetic gene expression in stressed grain amaranth plants led to the proposal that these pigments play a defensive role against insect herbivory. This study provided further support for this premise. First, a comparison of "green" and "red" Amaranthus cruentus phenotypes showed that the latter suffered less insect herbivory damage. Coincidentally, growth and vitality of Manduca sexta larvae were more severely affected when fed on red-leafed A. cruentus plants or on an artificial diet supplemented with red-leaf pigment extracts. Second, the exposure of A. cruentus and A. caudatus plants, having contrasting pigmentation phenotypes, to light enriched in the blue and red wavelength spectra led to pigment accumulation throughout the plant and to increased resistance to insect herbivory. These events were accompanied by the induced expression of known betalain-biosynthetic genes, including uncharacterized DODA genes believed to participate in this biosynthetic pathway in a still undefined way. Finally, transient co-expression of different combinations of betalain-biosynthetic genes in Nicotiana benthamiana led to detectable accumulation of betalamic acid and betanidin. This outcome supported the participation of certain AhDODA and other genes in the grain amaranth betalain-biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - As previous data showing the negative impact of semen agitation during transport on sperm quality was obtained only in tube-type packages, this study aimed to compare two packages for boar semen dose (bag or tube) submitted to different agitation times. Ejaculates from thirty different boars were diluted in BTS extender, packed in bags or tubes in split sample, and submitted to agitation for 0, 6, or 12 h at 100 rpm at 17 degrees C. Semen doses were stored for up to 168 h and evaluated for quality traits. Analyses were conducted as repeated measures, including package type, agitation time, storage time (or incubation for TRT) and their interactions. A longer agitation time resulted in reduced sperm motility, increased pH, decreased apoptotic-like changes cells percentage, reduced mitochondrial activity, increased ROS, and decreased sperm motility after TRT (P < 0.05). Tube packages exhibited higher sperm motility during storage and after TRT, a higher proportion of cells with no apoptotic-like changes and cells with high mitochondrial activity than bags (P < 0.01). The significant interaction between storage time and package type (P < 0.01) showed that tubes had higher pH levels after 72 h, consistently increasing up to 168 h than bags. The integrity was significantly reduced in bags compared to tubes after 12 h of agitation at 120 h of storage (P < 0.01). Acrosome membrane integrity decreased with increased agitation time, which was particularly pronounced in bags compared to tubes (P < 0.05). Overall, tube packaging offered superior protection, particularly under prolonged agitation conditions.

AB  - Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, biology is tied to the continuous availability of its host (corn, Zea mays L.). Annual rotation of corn with a nonhost, like soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) was a reliable tactic to manage western corn rootworm. Behavioral resistance to annual crop rotation (rotation resistance) allowed some eastern U.S. Corn Belt populations to circumvent rotation by laying eggs in soybean and in cornfields. When active in soybean, rotation-resistant adults commonly consume foliage, in spite of detrimental effects on beetle survival. Rotation-resistant beetle activity in soybean is enabled by the expression of certain proteinases and an adapted gut microbiota that provide limited protection from soybean antiherbivore defenses. We investigated the effects of corn and soybean herbivory on rotation-resistant female survival and initiation of flight using mortality assays and wind tunnel flight tests. Among field-collected females tested with mortality assays, beetles from collection sites in a cornfield survived longer than those from collection sites in a soybean field. However, reduced survival due to soybean herbivory could be restored by consuming corn tissues. Field-collected beetles that fed on a soybean tissue laboratory diet or only water were more likely to fly in a wind tunnel than corn-feeding beetles. Regardless of collection site and laboratory diet, 90.5% of beetles that flew oriented their flights upwind. Diet-related changes in the probability of flight provide a proximate mechanism for interfield movement that facilitates restorative feeding and the survival of females previously engaged in soybean herbivory.

AB  - Liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) is a parasite of herbivores including wildlife. Macropods, such as Eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and Common wallaroo (Osphranter robustus), are frequently observed sharing grazing sites with domestic livestock. The impact of Macropods, as reservoirs of infection, on livestock production and risks to cross-species transmission are largely unknown. In Phase 1 of this study, liver and faecal samples were collected from 245 Macropods (181 Eastern grey kangaroos, 64 Common wallaroos) cohabiting livestock farms (n = 7) in the Northern Tablelands regions of New South Wales. Total fluke (TFC) and fluke eggs (FEC) were counted in the liver and faeces, respectively, to assess prevalence. Faecal antigens were also measured using the commercial Bio-X Diagnostic Monoscreen AgELISA Fasciola hepatica kit (cELISA) to assess suitability as a diagnostic tool. In Phase 2, Macropod faecal samples were collected from 60 livestock farms to conduct FEC and assess prevalence by region. Liver fluke was prevalent in 22% of Eastern grey kangaroo and 20% of Common wallaroos with prevalence as high as 45% in the Eastern grey kangaroo. Fluke burdens ranged from 1 to 122 flukes (mean = 9 flukes) with a FEC range of 0-195 eggs per gram (epg) of faeces (mean = 18 epg). Evidence of dead and live flukes trapped within fibrotic capsules confirms the ability of Macropods to resolve infections. cELISA proved highly specific (100%) and sensitive (98%) in liver fluke detection however fibrotic capsules observed in the liver may reduce the correlation of coproantigens with fluke burden. Phase 2 revealed that 27% of livestock farms had Macropods infected with liver fluke. Overall, this study confirmed Eastern grey kangaroo and Common wallaroo are susceptible hosts and potential reservoirs for liver fluke and, monitoring infections in Macropods would assist in livestock disease management.

AB  - IntroductionMesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) are central in immune anatomy. MLNs are associated with the composition of gut microbiota, affecting the central system and immune system. Gut microbiota was found to differ among individuals of different social hierarchies. Nowadays, excision of MLNs is more frequently involved in gastrointestinal surgery; however, the potential side effects of excision of MLNs on social dominance are still unknown. MethodsMLNs were removed from male mice (7-8 weeks old). Four weeks after MLN removal, social dominance test was performed to investigate social dominance; hippocampal and serum interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were investigated; and histopathology was used to evaluate local inflammation of the ileum. The composition of the gut microbiota was then examined to understand the possible mechanism, and finally intraperitoneal injection of IL-10 was used to validate the effect of IL-10 on social dominance. ResultsThere was a decrease in social dominance in the operation group compared to the control group, as well as a decrease in serum and hippocampal IL-10 levels, but no difference in serum and hippocampal IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels, and no local inflammation of the ileum after MLN removal. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundance of the class Clostridia was decreased in the operation group. This decrease was positively associated with serum IL-10 levels. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of IL-10 in a subset of mice increased social dominance. ConclusionsOur findings suggested that MLNs contributed to maintaining social dominance, which might be associated with reduced IL-10 and the imbalance of specific flora in gut microbiota.

AB  - Emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) from kitchen waste composting plants causes significant environmental issues. This paper characterized the emission profiles of VOCs and GHGs from KW composting with different operating parameters. Quantitative results showed that emission intensities spanned 7.4-folds (VOCs: 196-1456 mu g center dot m-3) to 8.2-folds (GHGs: 79-647 mg center dot m-3) between C1 (R1M1A1) and C9 (R3M2A3). Seven categories of VOCs were identified, with the 'Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene' (BTEX) group as the most abundant chemical family. Most VOCs (except for esters) and GHGs predominantly emerged post-thermophilic phase and declined as temperatures receded. Orthogonal experiments were performed to ascertain the impacts of parameters on emissions control, and considering emissions, efficiency, and costs, the optimal parameter combination was the C/N ratio of 35, AR of 0.6 L center dot kg-1DM center dot min-1, and MC of 60 %. High-throughput sequencing was utilized to identify functional microbes related to the gases transformation across C1 (R1M1A1) and C9 (R3M2A3) composting systems. Acinetobacter drove the initial release of alcohol and acid VOCs, Pseudomonas generated alcohols/sulfides during thermophilic phases, and sustained Bacillus correlated with ketone emissions. BTEX-degraders, represented by Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas, declined postthermophilically, coinciding with emission peaks. Methanosaeta-dominated methanogens promoted CH4 generation, whereas methanotrophs (e.g., Methylocystis) subsequently converted CH4 through multifunctional metabolism. Autotrophic nitrification (dominated by Nitrobacter) and heterotrophic denitrification (dominated by Bacillus and Pseudomonas) drove N2O generation, which can be regulated through oxygen diffusion and C/N ratio optimization. This paper would like provide theoretical guidance for the in-situ control of VOCs and GHGs in practical KW composting process.

AB  - Agriculture and livestock farming significantly contribute to the success of all United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 and are pivotal in the sustainability transition of the European agri-food sector. However, those sectors have been criticized for generating negative environmental externalities. In this context, adopting indicators able to evaluate agriculture and sheep farming sustainability is essential for fostering sustainable development in the primary sector and defining appropriate policies to support it. Such indicators are crucial for understanding if European Union policies striving to realize win-win opportunities based on synergy between farms' environmental and economic dimensions are realistic. This paper focuses on this wave of interest and has two aims. First, it intends to investigate the existence of synergies or trade-offs between those dimensions using a trade-off analysis. To this end, a significant set of economic and environmental farm indicators was selected, and two composite indicators were created. Second, it aims to investigate the relationship between those two indicators and some pivotal structural and socio-demographic variables. This study was carried out on 219 Sardinian sheep farms included in the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network. The findings showed a low synergy between the economic and environmental spheres, a relationship between economic indicators and farmers' ages and organic production variables, and no relationships between the environmental dimension and the analyzed variables.

AB  - Environmental noise stress affects non-auditory brain regions such as the hippocampus; an area of the brain implicated in cognition and emotion. Recent experimental data indicate that dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and overexpression of NMDA receptors may cause anxiety. In this experiment, we evaluated the effect of nanocurcumin on anxiety-like behavior and the expression of tight junctions and NMDA receptor subunits in the hippocampus of rats exposed to traffic noise. Forty rats were assigned to control (CON), stress (ST), nanocurcumin (NC), and nanocurcumin+stress (NC+ST) groups. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated through an elevated zero maze apparatus. The gene expression of tight junctions and NMDA receptor subunits was examined by real-time PCR in the hippocampus. Statistical analysis showed that noise exposure developed anxiety-like behavior and elevated the corticosterone level in the ST group compared to the CON group. The nanocurcumin administration decreased the stress and anxiety in the NC+ST group compared to the ST animals. While the noise stress reduced the gene expression of tight junctions occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1, the nanocurcumin administration increased them in the NC+ST animals. Furthermore, the noise stress elevated the gene expression of the NMDA receptor subunits GRIN1 and GRIN2B. The NC+ST animals showed a modification of these subunits compared to the ST animals. Our findings showed that noise exposure promotes stress and anxiety and impairs the NMDA receptor structure and BBB integrity. The nanocurcumin treatment partly restores the destructive effects of noise exposure.

AB  - Simple Summary The horned type of sheep, including the polled phenotype and scurs phenotype, emerged during the process of artificial domestication. Sheep serve as an optimal animal model for investigating the correlation between quality and quantity traits of horns, as well as the multi-gene regulatory mechanism underlying these traits. While significant progress has been made in understanding the effects of natural selection and sex selection on horn phenotypes, there is limited research on polymorphisms resulting from artificial selection. Through genome-wide association analysis, this study reveals the genetic mapping of horn phenotypes, polled genes, and superior haplotypes to provide valuable insights into studying the genetic mechanisms governing horn traits and other specific characteristics in ruminants while also laying a foundation for breeding.Abstract The types and morphology of sheep horns have been extensively researched, yet the genetic foundation underlying the emergence of diverse horn characteristics during the breeding of polled Tibetan sheep has remained elusive. Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed on 103 subtypes (normal large horn, scurs, and polled) differentiated from G2 (offspring (G2) of parent (G1) of polled) of the polled core herd. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosome 10 of the relaxin family peptide receptor 2 (RXFP2) gene exhibited positive correlations with horn length, horn base circumference, and horn base interval. Furthermore, in genotyping 382 G2 individuals, significant variations were observed for each specific horn type. Three additional mutations were identified near the target SNP upstream of the amplification product. Finally, the RXFP2-specific haplotype associated with the horned trait effectively maintained horn length, horn base circumference, and horn base interval in Tibetan sheep, as confirmed by population validation of nine loci in a sample size of 1125 individuals. The present study offers novel insights into the genetic differentiation of the horned type during improvement breeding and evolution, thereby establishing a robust theoretical foundation for polled Tibetan sheep breeding and providing valuable guidance for practical production.

AB  - The integration of biological nitrogen (N) removal with struvite-type material recovery, which contained phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), was proved to be technically feasible in pig slurry treatment. Phosphate (PO4) salts were precipitated by raising the pH-value, using denitrified effluent and waste sludge purged from the bioreactor. When P was limiting, the unbalanced composition of the denitrified effluent resulted in low K-removal efficiency from the liquid phase; 10 % maximum when the initial pH-value was adjusted to 11.5 (93 % PO4-P recovery). By processing the waste sludge in two steps, using first ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an acidifier to release PO4 while preventing calcium interference, the K-removal efficiency reached 25 % (75 % PO4-P recovery). When K was limiting, the addition of newberyite particles resulted in the highest K-removal efficiency, up to 90 % (under online pH control to 10.5). Overall, new opportunities are envisaged for producing second-generation fertilizers potentially containing 0-1 % N, 11-17 % P and 6-8 % K.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is an important contributor in regulating plant growth and development as well as secondary metabolites synthesis, so as to promote the formation of tea quality and flavor. Theanine, polyphenols, and caffeine are important secondary metabolites in tea plant. In this study, the responses of Camellia sinensis roots to N deprivation and resupply were investigated by metabolome and RNA-seq analysis. N deficiency induced content increase for most amino acids (AAs) and reduction for the remaining AAs, polyphenols, and caffeine. After N recovery, the decreased AAs and polyphenols showed a varying degree of recovery in content, but caffeine did not. Meanwhile, theanine increased in content, but its related synthetic genes were down-regulated, probably due to coordination of the whole N starvation regulatory network. Flavonoids-related pathways were relatively active following N stress according to KEGG enrichment analysis. Gene co-expression analysis revealed TCS2, AMT1;1, TAT2, TS, and GOGAT as key genes, and TFs like MYB, bHLH, and NAC were also actively involved in N stress responses in C. sinensis roots. These findings facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism of N regulation in tea roots and provide genetic reference for improving N use efficiency in tea plant.

AB  - Recreational abuse of solvents continues, despite cyclohexane (CHX) is used as a safe replacement in gasoline or adhesive formulations. Increasing evidence indicates that CHX inhalation affects brain functioning; however, scanty information is available about its effects on behavior and brain activity upon drug removal. In this study, we used CD1 adult mice to mimic an intoxication period of recreational drugs for 30 days. During the CHX exposure (-30,000 ppm), we analyzed exploratory and biphasic behaviors, stereotypic circling, and locomotion. After CHX removal (24 h or a month later), we assessed anxiety-like behaviors and quantified c-Fos cells in motor-and anxiety-related brain regions. Our findings indicate that the repeated inhalation of CHX produced steady hyperactivity and reduced ataxia, sedation, and seizures as the exposure to CHX progressed. Also, CHX decreased grooming and rearing behaviors. In the first week of CHX inhalation, a stereotypic circling behavior emerged, and locomotion increased gradually. One month after CHX withdrawal, mice showed low activity in the center zone of the open field and more buried marbles. Twenty-four hours after CHX removal, c-Fos expression was low in the dorsal striatum, ventral striatum, motor cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral hippocampus. One month later, c-Fos expression remained low in the ventral striatum and lateral hypothalamus but increased in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and primary motor cortex. This study provides a comprehensive behavioral characterization and novel histological evidence of the CHX effects on the brain when is administered in a recreational-like mode.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) was applied to evaluate duckweed ponds and constructed wetlands as polishing steps in pig manure liquid fraction treatment. Using nitrification-denitrification (NDN) of the liquid fraction as the starting point, the LCA compared direct land application of the NDN effluent with different combinations of duckweed ponds, constructed wetlands and discharge into natural waterbodies. Duckweed ponds and constructed wetlands are viewed as a viable tertiary treatment option and potential remedy for nutrient imbalances in areas of intense livestock farming, such as in Belgium. As the effluent stays in the duckweed pond, settling and microbial degradation reduce the remaining phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations. Combined with duckweed and/or wetland plants that take up nutrients in their plant body, this approach can reduce over-fertilisation and prevent excessive nitrogen losses to aquatic environments. In addition, duckweed could serve as an alternative livestock feed and replace imports of protein destined for animal consumption. The environmental performance of the overall treatment systems studied was found to depend greatly on assumptions about the possible avoidance of potassium fertiliser production through the field application of effluents. If it is as-sumed that the potassium contained in the effluent replaces mineral fertiliser, direct field application of the NDN efflu-ent performed best. If the application of NDN effluent does not lead to mineral fertiliser savings or if the replaced K fertiliser is of low grade, duckweed ponds seem to be a viable additional step in the manure treatment chain. Consequently, whenever background concentrations of N and/or P in fields allow for effluent application and potas-sium fertiliser substitution, direct application should be favoured over further treatment. If direct land application of the NDN effluent is not an option, the focus should be on long residence times in duckweed ponds to allow for maxi-mum nutrient uptake and feed production.

AB  - During the peripartum period, women are at an increased risk to develop perinatal distress, presenting as symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Yet, due to practical and ethical restrictions, our understanding of this condition remains limited. Animal studies that focus on the neuropsychiatric mechanisms associated with the postpartum period, often ignore the genetical predisposition factor. We therefore investigated whether pregnancy could alter the bio-behavioural profile of the Flinders sensitive and resistant line rats, and whether these effects are exacerbated by a postpartum stressor. Postpartum dams were compared to nulliparous controls in behavioural tests, analysing depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours. Next, postpartum dams were subjected to a maternal separation and early weaning (MSEW) regimen, with their behaviour and serotonergic and noradrenergic concentrations compared to rats not separated from their pups. Regardless of strain, pregnancy decreased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze and hippocampal serotonin concentrations. Time spent immobile in the forced swim test was also increased, with a significant effect in the FRL and a strong trend in the FSL rats. MSEW reversed these behaviours in both strains and increased social interaction with a male counterpart in the FSL rats, without influencing hippocampal or cortical serotonin or norepinephrine. Taken together, these results suggest that pregnancy influences postpartum behaviour, in a strain-dependent manner. Contrary to what we expected, MSEW overall decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours, with strain specific differences, indicating that a chronic, predictable stressor may not necessarily adversely affect postpartum behaviour.

AB  - Aim Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), most subsequently developing refractory epilepsy, causes a significant burden to the society. microRNAs have been demonstrated as key regulators and therapeutic targets in epilepsy. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to test whether miR-485 could be a potential target for DRE. Methods and results An in vivo DRE model was developed in Sprague-Dawley rats by lithium chloride-pilocarpine and screened by antiepileptic drugs. We found that miR-485-5p in hippocampus was significant downregulated at early stage and recovered to normal level at late stage of DRE. Overexpression of miR-485-5p in dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus in DRE rats could significantly decrease the frequency of seizures and the numbers of epileptiform spikes of hippocampal DG neuron, and could specifically decrease SV2A expression without affecting PSD-95 expression in DG. Furthermore, miR-485-5p overexpression could significantly downregulate the expression of efflux transporter related to multidrug resistance (ABCC1) in hippocampus at late stage of DRE. Finally, a specific expression pattern of neuronal signaling-transduction proteins (LRP4, MDM4, p53, and TMBIM1) for DRE was observed, and miR-485-5p overexpression could modulate these proteins' expression levels toward normal in hippocampus both at early and late stage of DRE. Conclusion Collectively, these results suggest that miR-485 was a potential target for anti-DRE, and this effects might be partially via miR-485-5p/homeostatic-synaptic plasticity-molecule axis and/or targeting efflux transporter (ABCC1) and other neuronal signaling-transduction proteins (LRP4, MDM4, p53, and TMBIM1).

AB  - Plants emit green leaf volatiles (GLVs) in response to biotic and abiotic stress. Receiver plants perceive GLVs as alarm cues resulting in activation of defensive or protective mechanisms. While this is well documented, it is not known how GLVs are perceived by receiver cells and what the structural determinants are for GLV activity. We tested whether the carbon chain length in (Z)-3-fatty alcohols with four to nine carbons and the double bonds in six-carbon alcohols contribute to bioactivity. In Solanum peruvianum suspension-cultured cells we found that (Z)-3-fatty alcohols, except (Z)-3-butenol, induce medium alkalinization and MAP kinase phosphorylation, two signaling responses often tied to the perception of molecular patterns that function in plant immunity and resistance to herbivores. In tomato (S. lycopersicum) seedlings, we found that (Z)-3-fatty alcohols induce inhibition of root growth. In both signaling and physiological responses, (Z)-3-octenol and (Z)-3-nonenol had a higher bioactivity than (Z)-3-heptenol and (Z)-3-hexenol, with (Z)-3-butenol only being active in root growth assays. Bioactivity correlated not only with chain length but also with lipophilicity of the fatty alcohols. The natural GLVs (E)-2-hexenol and the saturated 1-hexanol exhibited a higher bioactivity in pH assays than (Z)-3-hexenol, indicating that the presence and position of a double bond also contributes to bioactivity. Our results indicate that perceiving mechanisms for (Z)-3-fatty alcohols show a preference for longer chain fatty alcohols or that longer chain fatty alcohols are more accessible to receptors.

AB  - Simple Summary The horse-chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella Deschka and Dimic, 1986 (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), is an ornamental invasive alien insect pest that invaded Russia in the beginning of the 21st century. With the help of volunteers, we clarified the secondary range of species in the European part of Russia and performed extensive sampling of insect specimens for molecular genetic analysis. The pest was confirmed in 24 administrative regions in the European part of Russia. In southern Russia, it produced spectacular outbreaks in 2021. The DNA barcoding data obtained for 201 specimens from European Russia indicates the presence of two haplotypes, which are also known from the secondary range of this species in Eastern and Western Europe. Based on the intensive monitoring conducted by our team and volunteers in 2021, the secondary range of an alien horse-chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimic, 1986 (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), was specified in European Russia. This invasive pest was confirmed in 24 out of 58 administrative regions of Russia, which it has occupied for approximately 16 years. Analysis of the COI mtDNA gene sequenced in 201 specimens collected in 21 regions of the European part of Russia indicates the occurrence of two haplotypes (A and B), which are also present in the secondary range of C. ohridella in Eastern and Western Europe. The haplotype A dominated and was present in 87.5% of specimens from European Russia. In 2021, C. ohridella produced spectacular outbreaks in Aesculus hippocastanum in southern Russia, where it damaged more than 50% of the leaves in trees in 24 out of 30 distant localities. In the south of the country, the pest infested Acer pseudoplatanus, whereas other species of Acer of European, East Asian, and North American origin showed no signs of attacks. Taking into account that Ae. hippocastanum is present in most regions of European Russia, we expect a further range expansion of C. ohridella up to the Ural Mountains.

AB  - Porcine steroid hormone profiles have some unique characteristics. We previously studied human and murine steroidogenesis using steroidogenic cells-derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To investigate porcine steroidogenesis, we induced steroidogenic cells from porcine subcutaneous preadipocytes (PSPA cells), which originate from MSCs. Using cAMP, adenovirus-mediated introduction of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)/adrenal 4binding protein (Ad4BP) induced the differentiation of PSPA cells into sex steroid-producing cells. Introducing SF-1/Ad4BP also induced the aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1) gene. Porcine AKR1C1 had 178-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which converts androstenedione and 11-ketoandrostenedione into testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosteorne (11KT). Furthermore, differentiated cells expressed hydroxysteroid 118-dehydrogenase 2 (HSD11B2) and produced 11KT. HSD11B2 was expressed in testicular Leydig cells and the adrenal cortex. 11KT was present in the plasma of both immature male and female pigs, with slightly higher levels in the male pigs. T levels were much higher in the male pigs. It is noteworthy that in the female pigs, the 11KT levels were >10-fold higher than the T levels. However, castration altered the 11KT and T plasma profiles in the male pigs to near those of the females. 11KT induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in porcine vascular endothelial cells. These results indicate that 11KT is produced in porcine adrenal glands and testes, and may regulate cardiovascular functions through eNOS expression.

AB  - Water-filtered infrared A and visible light (wIRA/VIS), shown to reduce chlamydial infections in vitro and in vivo, might represent an innovative therapeutic approach against trachoma, a neglected tropical disease caused by ocular infection with the bacterium C. trachomatis. In this in vivo study, we assessed the impact of wIRA radiation in combination with VIS (wavelength range 595-1400 nm, intensity 2100 W/m2) on the retina and cornea in a guinea pig animal model of inclusion conjunctivitis. We investigated the effects 19 days after wIRA/VIS irradiation by comparing a single and double wIRA/VIS treatment with a sham control. By immunolabeling and western blot analyses of critical heat-and stress-responsive proteins, we could not detect wIRA/VIS-induced changes in their expression pattern. Also, immunolabeling of specific retinal marker proteins revealed no changes in their expression pattern caused by the treatment. Our preclinical study suggests wIRA/VIS as a promising and safe therapeutic tool to treat ocular chlamydial infections.

AB  - Extensive rare earth element (REE) mining activities have caused REE contamination of ambient agricultural soils, posing threats to associated food webs. Here, a simulated lettuce-snail food chain was conducted to evaluate the trophic transfer characteristics and the consequent effects of REEs on consumers. After 50-day exposure to soil, lettuce roots dose-dependently accumulated 9.4-76 mg kg(-1) REEs and translocated 3.7-20 mg kg(-1) REEs to shoots. Snails feeding on REE-contaminated shoots accumulated 3.0-6.7 mg kg(-1) REEs with trophic transfer factors of 0.20-0.98, indicating trophic dilution in the lettuce-snail system. REE profiles in lettuce and snails indicated light REE (LREE) enrichment only in snails and the varied REE profiles along the food chain. This was corroborated by toxicokinetics. Estimated uptake (K-u) and elimination (K-e) parameters were 0.010-2.9 kg(shoot) kg(snail)(-1) day(-1) and 0.010-1.8 day(-1), respectively, with higher K-u values for LREE and HREE. The relatively high K-e, compared to K-u, indicating a fast REE elimination, supports the trophic dilution. Dietary exposure to REEs dose-dependently affected gut microbiota and metabolites in snails. These effects are mainly related to oxidative damage and energy expenditure, which are further substantiated by targeted analysis. Our study provides essential information about REE bioaccumulation characteristics and its associated risks to terrestrial food chains near REE mining areas.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the appearance and frequencies of the Booroola polymorphism of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1b (BMPR1B) gene (FecB) and the Embrapa polymorphism of the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene (FecG(E)) in sheep in Thailand. A total of 454 crossbred sheep blood samples were collected from four provinces in Thailand during August 2022 to July 2023. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to identify the FecB and FecG(E) genotypes. The history of ewe birth types was collected from the owners to analyze the association between fecundity (Fec) genotypes and the history of birth types. The genotypic frequencies of FecB for homozygous genotype (B/B), heterozygous genotype (+/B), and wildtype (+/+) were 0.22%, 1.54%, and 98.24%, respectively. Meanwhile, the genotypic frequencies of FecG(E) for homozygous genotype (E/E), heterozygous genotype (+/E), and wildtype (+/+) were 0.00%, 2.42%, and 97.58%, respectively. Furthermore, three ewes exhibited both FecB and FecG(E) genotypes. Fisher's exact test revealed that possession of the FecB genotype was associated with multiple births (p < 0.01). Both FecB and FecG(E) mutations were identified in crossbred sheep in Thailand. Sheep containing FecB allele could be alternative candidates to be selected to improve the prolificacy of crossbred sheep in Thailand.

AB  - IntroductionMaternal nicotine use has been suggested to affect the behavior of children and is linked to changes in neurological systems; however, the specific mechanism is yet to be understood. MethodsMice were used to establish a maternal nicotine intoxication model. At postnatal day 60 (adolescent stage), male offspring were tested for behavioral tasks including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, light/dark box, object recognition, Morris water maze (MWM), and forced swimming. Enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to measure plasma concentrations of neurotransmitters including norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and corticosterone. Serotonin transporter (Sert), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), cAMP response element binding protein (Creb), and phosphorylated (p)Creb mRNA levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsMale offspring of nicotine-intoxicated dams had significantly reduced sucrose preference, mobility time in the forced swimming test, and locomotor and exploratory activities. Offspring in the maternal nicotine intoxication group showed increased signs of depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Recognition memory in the MWM was compromised in these animals. The hippocampal and prefrontal cortical regions showed significant changes in Bdnf, pCreb, and Sert gene expression, whereas CREB mRNA levels were unaffected. Moreover, compared to the controls, neurogenesis and neuronal viability were also reduced in these animals. ConclusionPrenatal nicotine exposure might affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and reduce neurogenesis, potentially leading to depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficiencies in male offspring.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a highly important beverage crop renowned for its unique flavour and health benefits. Chlorotic mutants of tea, known worldwide for their umami taste and economic value, have gained global popularity. However, the genetic basis of this chlorosis trait remains unclear. In this study, we identified a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL), qChl-3, responsible for the chlorosis trait in tea leaves, linked to a non-synonymous polymorphism (G1199A) in the magnesium chelatase I subunit (CsCHLI). Homozygous CsCHLIA plants exhibited an albino phenotype due to defects in magnesium protoporphyrin IX and chlorophylls in the leaves. Biochemical assays revealed that CsCHLI mutations did not affect subcellular localization or interactions with CsCHLIG and CsCHLD. However, combining CsCHLIA with CsCHLIG significantly reduced ATPase activity. RNA-seq analysis tentatively indicated that CsCHLI inhibited photosynthesis and enhanced photoinhibition, which in turn promoted protein degradation and increased the amino acid levels in chlorotic leaves. RT-qPCR and enzyme activity assays confirmed the crucial role of asparagine synthetase and arginase in asparagine and arginine accumulation, with levels increasing over 90-fold in chlorotic leaves. Therefore, this study provides insights into the genetic mechanism underlying tea chlorosis and the relationship between chlorophyll biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism.
   An allele of a tea magnesium chelatase subunit gene produces chlorosis, but enhances proteolysis and amino acid content, improving the quality of the tea.

AB  - Peri-implantitis is the main reason for dental implant failure. Optimizing electroactivity at the interface between dental implants and tissue is essential for enhancing integration and preventing bacterial invasion. Here, a bioinspired piezoelectric-conductive integrated peri-implant gingiva (PiG) with simultaneously enhanced antibacterial efficacy and soft-tissue integration, which is based on a flexible piezoelectric film and conductive polymer network, is presented. The piezoelectricity of PiG is achieved through the electrospinning of polyvinylidene fluoride/BaTiO3/MXene on a polydopamine-modified plasma-activated Ti surface, whereas the conductive property of PiG is achieved by the in situ polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomers. Under ultrasonic irradiation, PiG can promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and reactive oxygen species, thus achieving synergistic and efficient piezodynamic killing of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Additionally, piezoelectricity-enabled electrical stimulation endows PiG with enhanced fibroblasts adhesion, proliferation, and collagen secretion. As a demonstration, ultrasound irradiation of PiG-grafted Ti implanted in a subcutaneous implantation rat model efficiently eliminates the S. aureus infection and rescues the implant with increased soft-tissue integration. The concept of an artificial PiG is anticipated to open new avenues for the development of high-performance implant materials, potentially extending their lifespans.

AB  - While Bulgaria has a rich bat fauna, with large colonies found in caves, mines and other underground roosts, only a small proportion of bat nursery colony roosts have been documented in buildings. During recent field research in the Madzharovo region, however, we discovered the world's largest nursery colony of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and Geoffroy's bats (Myotis emarginatus). About 15 000 to 18 500 individuals of eight species use the complex of anthropogenic structures (an abandoned water reservoir and two buildings) as a summer roost, representing around half of all the bat species registered in the region. We strongly suggest that regular monitoring programmes and Species Action Plans are established in Bulgaria, which will ensure the conservation of nursery colonies, not only in Madzharovo, but also in the entire Eastern Rhodope mountains and help prevent future bat population declines.

AB  - Mosquitoes were collected in Lake County, CA, in 2014 and tested using standard polymerase chain reaction for filarial parasite DNA. Filarial parasites were detected in 23 out of 1,008 total pools. DNA from Dirofilaria immitis, the parasite causing dog heartworm, was detected in Aedes increpitus (MIR=4.62), Aedes sierrensis (MIR=6.72), Anopheles freeborni (MIR=1.08), and Culex tarsalis (MIR=0.10). Setaria yehi, deer body worm, was detected in Ae. sierrensis (MIR=13.42), Anopheles franciscanus (MIR=0.55), An. freeborni (MIR=2.69), and Culex stigmatosoma (MIR=0.41). The avian parasite Splendidofilaria could not be identified to species but was detected in Cx. tarsalis (MIR=0.20). DNA was also detected for three unidentified filarial parasites in Culex. Filarial-positive pools spanned May-August, with Splendidofilaria earlier in the season and S. yehi later. For D. immitis, MIR tended to be highest in June, when the 130 HDU development threshold was reached. Interestingly, D. immitis was also detected prior to the HDU threshold, and D. immitis was not detected August-September, though HDU remained high enough for development. This suggests that there are other factors influencing dog heartworm transmission in the area. Journal of Vector Ecology 47 (1): 61-68. 2022.

AB  - The role of diving respiratory air volume (DRAV) in deep-diving phocid seals remains poorly understood, largely because of the lack of methods for measuring DRAV in free-ranging divers that exhale before diving. We developed a method to estimate DRAV using a hydrodynamic glide model applied to descent glides recorded using multi-sensor data loggers. We estimated dive-by-dive DRAV for six negatively buoyant female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). During shallow descent glides, rapid compression of DRAV influenced net buoyancy and gliding speed, making this phase suitable for estimating DRAV. Our results revealed dive-by-dive variation in DRAV, which was positively correlated with root mean square (RMS) sway acceleration (a proxy for per-stroke effort) and the depth at which gliding began during the initial descent. DRAV increased with both tissue density and maximum dive depth, suggesting that seals adjusted their DRAV to stay closer to neutral buoyancy through their dives. However, the observed level of adjustment did not result in neutral buoyancy at half of the maximum dive depth, as predicted to minimise round-trip locomotion costs. Instead, the seals typically adjusted DRAV to reach neutral buoyancy at similar to 30 m depth, <10% of their mean maximum dive depth. This indicates that strong negative tissue density imposes transit costs that cannot be fully compensated for by DRAV adjustment alone. Future work should explore whether other breath-hold divers show similar patterns of DRAV adjustment and quantify the associated physiological and ecological benefits.

AB  - Temperate grasslands exhibit strong spatial and temporal variation in water regimes. Thus, grassland plants experience potentially stressful water regimes, which may influence their tissue silicon (Si) and nitrogen (N) concentrations. Plant Si and N concentrations play important ecological roles in temperate grasslands, for example, by influencing plant performance and herbivory, yet comparisons of species' responses to a broad range of water regimes, including drought, waterlogging and flooding, are lacking. We conducted a mesocosm experiment with 10 temperate grassland species of two life-forms (grasses and forbs) exposed to four different soil water regimes (drought, a benign control, waterlogged and flooded conditions), and analysed their Si and N concentrations. Grasses showed lower Si concentrations under drought and flooding compared to the benign control and the highest concentrations emerged under waterlogging. Overall, plant Si responses of grasses were more uniform, while in forbs, responses varied both in direction and magnitude across species. For N concentrations, all species and life-forms showed the highest concentrations under drought compared to the benign control, while half of the species exhibited decreasing concentrations under waterlogging and/or flooding. The water regimes, especially waterlogging and flooding, induced changes in species rankings of plant Si and N concentrations, with stronger shifts in forbs than in grasses. Our results indicate that spatial and temporal variation of water regimes may influence plant Si and N concentrations in temperate grassland species. Plant Si responses to water regimes might be highly species-specific in forbs but more similar in grasses, whereas plant N responses are likely to be relatively uniform across species and life-forms. The strong plasticity in plant Si and N concentrations we observed might have pervasive consequences for ecological processes, such as herbivory.

AB  - This study examined the abundance of micmplastics (MPs) in 106 fish from 22 species inhabiting three sites of the Han River, South Korea. In total, 1753 MPs from 106 fish samples were identified with an average abundance of 15.60 +/- 13.45 MPs per individual fish (MPs indiv(-1)) in the North Han River, 16.35 +/- 12.32 MPs indiv(-1) in the South Han River, and 20.14 +/- 10.01 MPs indiv(-1) in downstream of the Han River, indicating that the fish in the downstream of the Han River was the most contaminated by MPs. The dominant size of MPs detected in fish ranged between 0.1 and 0.2 mm, and the most common polymer types found in fish were polypropylene (PP) (>= 40%) and polyethylene (PE) (>= 23%), followed by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (>= 16%) at all sampling locations. A significant correlation was observed between the log-transformed number of MPs with logtransformed fish length (p < 0.01) and with log-transformed fish weight (p < 0.01). The Kruskal-Wallis test disclosed a significant difference in the number of MPs among the feeding habits (p < 0.01), indicating that omnivorous and insectivorous fish contained more MPs than carnivorous and herbivorous fish. In addition, fish habitat result showed that pelagic fish contained a higher level of MPs than demersal fish, but no significant differences in the number of MPs among fish habitats were observed (p > 0.05).

AB  - The effects of electron beam irradiation (EBI) at different doses (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 kGy) were investigated on the structural and functional properties of casein, including their interrelationship. A gradual reduction in the alpha-helix content of the secondary structure (as a stable structure) indicates that casein under EBI treatment mainly undergoes fragmentation and aggregation from a structural perspective. Furthermore, the hydrophobic group and tryptophan in the tertiary structure were exposed, which opened up the internal structure of the protein. In addition, a continuously increasing irradiation dose led to casein aggregation, as confirmed by electron microscopy. The structural changes affected its functional properties, such as solubility, emulsification, foaming, and rheological properties, all of which increased first and subsequently decreased. Finally, at irradiation doses of 4-6 kGy, casein was modified to exhibit optimal functional properties, which enhanced its food processing value and performance.

AB  - While plant anti-herbivore defenses of the annual species Arabidopsis thaliana were shown to be primable by Pieris brassicae eggs, the primability of the phylogenetically closely related perennial Arabidopsis lyrata has not yet been investigated. Previous studies revealed that closely related wild Brassicaceae plant species, the annual Brassica nigra and the perennial B. oleracea, , exhibit an egg-primable defense trait, even though they have different life spans. Here, we tested whether P. brassicae eggs prime anti-herbivore defenses of the perennial A. lyrata. . We exposed A. lyrata to P. brassicae eggs and larval feeding and assessed their primability by (i) determining the biomass of P. brassicae larvae after feeding on plants with and without prior P. brassicae egg deposition and (ii) investigating the plant transcriptomic response after egg deposition and/or larval feeding. For comparison, these studies were also conducted with A. thaliana. Consistent with previous findings, A. thaliana's 's response to prior P. brassicae egg deposition negatively affected conspecific larvae feeding upon A. thaliana. . However, this was not observed in A. lyrata. . Arabidopsis thaliana responded to P. brassicae eggs with strong transcriptional reprogramming, whereas A. lyrata responses to eggs were negligible. In response to larval feeding, A. lyrata exhibited a greater transcriptome change compared to A. thaliana. . Among the strongly feeding-induced A. lyrata genes were those that are egg-primed in feeding-induced A. thaliana, , i.e., CAX3, PR1, , PR5, and PDF1.4. These results suggest that A. lyrata has evolved a robust feeding response that is independent from prior egg exposure.

AB  - Germs associated with insect eggs can profoundly mediate interactions between host plants and herbivores, with the potential to coordinate plant physiological reactions with cascading effects on insect fitness. An experimental system was established including the oriental fruit fly (OFF, Bactrocera dorsalis) and tomato to examine the functions of egg-associated germs in mediating plant-herbivore interactions. OFF feeding resulted in significantly increased tannins, flavonoids, amino acids, and salicylic acid in the host tomato. These defensive responses of tomato were induced by the egg-associated germs, including Lactococcus sp., Brevundimonas sp., and Vagococcus sp. Tannins and flavonoids had no significant feedback effects on the pupal weight of OFF, while pupal biomass was significantly decreased by tannins and flavonoids in the germ-free treatment. Metabolome analysis showed that OFF mainly induced metabolic changes in carboxylic acid derivatives. Phenylalanine significantly induced downstream metabolic changes associated with phenylpropanoid accumulation. Finally, we conclude that the effects of egg-associated germs played an important role in facilitating OFF population adaptation and growth by mediating plant defenses, which provides a new paradigm for exploring the interaction of plant-pest and implementing effective pest biocontrol.

AB  - Simple Summary Sarcosaprophagous beetles are significant pests, but they are also key indicator insects for postmortem interval estimation. In this paper, the development of Necrobia ruficollis (Fabricius, 1775) at five constant temperatures between 22 degrees C and 34 degrees C was investigated. The developmental threshold temperature and thermal summation constant were estimated, the relationship between the larval body length with development time, and the widths of the head capsules and the distance between the urogomphi at different instars were studied. The results provide important basic developmental data for using N. ruficollis to estimate the minimum postmortem interval. Necrobia ruficollis (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) is an important cosmopolitan storage pest, and also frequently appears on highly decomposed and skeletonized corpses. It is a forensically important species expected to indicate a longer postmortem interval (PMI). Therefore, we investigated the development of N. ruficollis at five constant temperatures between 22 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Under temperatures of 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34 degrees C, the mean (+/- SD) developmental durations from eggs to adults were 93.00 +/- 1.63, 70.67 +/- 0.94, 65.33 +/- 3.40, 47.33 +/- 0.94, and 56.66 +/- 8.73 days, respectively. According to the developmental time and accumulated degree hours results, an isomorphen diagram and thermal summation model were generated. The calculated values of developmental threshold temperature and accumulated temperature constant were estimated by a linear model to be 14.51 +/- 0.52 degrees C and 684.12 +/- 33.85 degree days, respectively. Lower developmental thresholds, intrinsic optimum temperature, and upper lethal developmental threshold temperature were estimated by a nonlinear model to be 14.61, 25.90, and 34.94 degrees C. Morphological indexes of larvae were obtained by in vivo measurements. A growth curve and an equation of the relationship between development time and body length were simulated. In addition, the widths of the head capsules and the distance between the urogomphi of larvae at different instars were determined by cluster analysis. Classifiers were created and validated by linear discriminant analysis. These results provide important basic developmental data for using N. ruficollis to estimate the minimum postmortem interval (minimum PMI). However, this study was only conducted under constant temperature, and the applicability of these data to variable temperature conditions needs to be further confirmed.

AB  - Lablab purpureus subsp. bengalensis (Jacq.) Verdc. is an important legume of India and Africa. Both aphids, Aphis craccivora Koch and A. gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), are important herbivorous pests of this legume crop. These viviparous females lay nymphs on the leaf surface of this legume plant. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to study whether leaf surface wax chemicals (long-chain alkanes and free fatty acids) of this legume plant served as short-range attractants and oviposition stimulants in both females to lay nymphs. Twenty-one n-alkanes from n-C(12 )to n-C-35 and 11 free fatty acids from C12:0 to C22:0 were identified in leaf surface waxes. Nonacosane and nonadecanoic acid were the most abundant among n-alkanes and free fatty acids, respectively. Both females were attracted towards one leaf equivalent surface wax against the control solvent (petroleum ether) in short Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. A synthetic blend of tetradecane, pentadecane, tetracosane, tridecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, and heneicosanoic acid comparable to one leaf equivalent surface wax served as short-range attractants and oviposition stimulants in A. craccivora; whereas a synthetic blend of tetradecane, hexadecane, docosane, nonadecanoic acid, and arachidic acid comparable to one leaf equivalent surface wax acted as short-range attractants and oviposition stimulants in A. gossypii. These results can provide the basis for efficient pest management strategies of A. craccivora and A. gossypii against L. purpureus subsp. bengalensis using host plant leaf surface wax compounds. Further, SEM studies of antennae and forelegs of both aphids were conducted to observe sensilla structures, which help in chemoreception.

AB  - Cruciferous plants in the order Brassicales defend themselves from herbivory using glucosinolates: sulfur-containing pro-toxic metabolites that are activated by hydrolysis to form compounds, such as isothiocyanates, which are toxic to insects and other organisms. Some herbivores are known to circumvent glucosinolate activation with glucosinolate sulfatases (GSSs), enzymes that convert glucosinolates into inactive desulfoglucosinolates. This strategy is a major glucosinolate detoxification pathway in a phloem-feeding insect, the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a serious agricultural pest of cruciferous vegetables. In this study, we identified and characterized an enzyme responsible for glucosinolate desulfation in the globally distributed B. tabaci species MEAM1. In in vitro assays, this sulfatase showed a clear preference for indolic glucosinolates compared with aliphatic glucosinolates, consistent with the greater representation of desulfated indolic glucosinolates in honeydew. B. tabaci might use this detoxification strategy specifically against indolic glucosinolates since plants may preferentially deploy indolic glucosinolates against phloem-feeding insects. In vivo silencing of the expression of the B. tabaci GSS gene via RNA interference led to lower levels of desulfoglucosinolates in honeydew. Our findings expand the knowledge on the biochemistry of glucosinolate detoxification in phloem-feeding insects and suggest how detoxification pathways might facilitate plant colonization in a generalist herbivore.

AB  - In establishing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plans for understudied pests, it is crucial to understand the nature of their herbivory and resulting damage. European earwig (Forficula auricularia L.; Dermaptera: Forficulidae) densities are increasing in citrus orchards in Central California. Field observations suggest that earwigs feed on young, developing citrus fruit, but this hypothesis had not been examined with formal experimentation. Forktailed bush katydid nymphs (Scudderia furcata Brunner von Wattenwyl; Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) are well-known citrus herbivores that feed on young citrus fruit, and it is possible that earwig damage may be misdiagnosed as katydid damage. Here we report findings from two field experiments in navel oranges (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck; Sapindales: Rutaceae) that together tested: (1) whether earwigs damage young citrus fruit; (2) whether the amount of damage earwigs generate differs across developmental stage or sex of adult earwigs; (3) the window of time during which fruit are most sensitive to earwig damage; (4) whether damaged fruit are retained to harvest; and (5) the resulting damage morphology caused by earwigs relative to katydids. Earwigs, particularly nymphs, chewed deep holes in young citrus fruit from 0 to 3 wk after petal fall. Fruit damaged by earwigs were retained and exhibited scars at harvest. The morphology and distribution of scars on mature fruit only subtly differed between earwigs and katydids. This study establishes that earwigs can be direct pests in mature navel orange trees by generating scars on fruit and likely contribute to fruit quality downgrades.

AB  - PurposeSince the developmental competence of oocytes cultured after in vitro maturation (IVM) is low, it is necessary to improve the IVM method for efficient offspring production. In this study, we revealed that transferrin (TF)-Fe3+ was accumulated in follicular fluid with increasing the follicular diameter, and that TF receptor (TFR1) was localized in granulosa cells of pig. Thus, we hypothesized that TF-Fe3+ would be a factor in the induction of developmental competence of porcine oocytes. MethodsTo mimic the follicular development environment, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were cultured in pre-IVM medium (low dose of FSH) without or with Holo-TF (monoferric or diferric TF) or Apo-TF (non-iron bond TF). After pre-IVM without or with Holo-TF, COCs were cultured in IVM medium (high dose of FSH and EGF) without or with Holo-TF. ResultsCultivation with Holo-TF increased the expression of follicular development maker (Cyp19a1 and Ccnd2), E2 production, and proliferative activity of cumulus cells, whereas cultivation with Apo-TF did not show these positive effects. The treatment with Holo-TF during pre-IVM, but not during IVM, dramatically induced oocyte maturation with increasing the blastocyst rate. ConclusionWe succeeded in showing for the first time that the cultivation with Holo-TF in pre-IVM can produce embryos in pig with high efficiency.

AB  - Background: Posterior fossa irradiation with or without whole brain irradiation results in high doses of radiation to the thalamus, hippocampus, and putamen, structures critical to cognitive functioning. As a result, children with brain tumors treated with cranial irradiation (CRT) may experience significant cognitive late effects. We sought to determine the effect of radiation to those structures on neuropsychological outcome. Methods: Forty-seven children with a history of posterior fossa tumor (17 treated with surgery; 11 with surgery and chemotherapy; and 19 with surgery, chemotherapy, and CRT) underwent neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment at a mean of 4.8 years after treatment, along with 17 healthy sibling controls. The putamen, thalamus, and hippocampus were segmented on each participant's magnetic resonance imaging for diffusion indices and volumes, and in the radiation treatment group, radiation dose to each structure was calculated. Results: Performance on visuoconstruction and spatial learning and memory was lower in patient groups than controls. Volume of the thalamus, when controlling for age, was smaller in the patient group treated with CRT than other groups. Higher radiation doses to the putamen correlated with higher fractional anisotropy in that structure. Higher radiation dose to the hippocampus correlated with lower spatial learning, and higher dose to thalami and putamina to lower verbal and nonverbal reasoning. Conclusions: All children with posterior fossa tumors, regardless of treatment modality, had cognitive deficits compared to their sibling controls. Posterior fossa irradiation may affect thalamic volume and aspects of verbal and nonverbal cognitive functioning.

AB  - IntroductionEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases, while over one third of adults with epilepsy still have inadequate seizure control. Although mutations in salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) have been identified in epileptic encephalopathy, it is not known whether blocking SIKs can prevent pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures.MethodsWe first determined the time course of SIKs (including SIK 1, 2, and 3) in the hippocampus of PTZ treated mice. And then, we evaluated the effects of anti-epilepsy drug valproate acid (VPA) on the expression of SIK 1, 2, and 3 in the hippocampus of PTZ treated mice. Next, we investigated the effect of different dose of SIKs inhibitor YKL-06-061 on the epileptic seizures and neuronal activation by determining the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the PTZ treated mice.ResultsWe found that PTZ selectively induced enhanced expression of SIK1 in the hippocampus, which was blocked by VPA treatment. Notably, YKL-06-061 decreased seizure activity and prevented neuronal overactivity, as indicated by the reduced expression of IEGs in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.ConclusionOur findings provide the first evidence that SIK1 affects gene regulation in neuronal hyperactivity, which is involved in seizure behavior. Targeting SIK1 through the development of selective inhibitors may lead to disease-modifying therapies that reduce epilepsy progression.
   A schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism for YKL-06-061 prevents PTZ-induced seizures in mice. PTZ induces high expression of SIK1, leading IEGs overexpression and appearing seizure behavior in mice. SIKs inhibitors (YKL-06-061) reduce the expression of IEGs, thereby improving epilepsy of mice.image

AB  - In sheep, cervical artificial insemination (AI) of frozen-thawed semen is not practiced worldwide due to the unacceptably low pregnancy rates achieved (typically <30%). The exception to this is in Norway where farmers perform shot-in-the-dark vaginal AI with frozen-thawed semen and achieve pregnancy rates over 60%. Research in Ireland has shown that this is due to the breed of the ewe used in Norway and specifically the ability of sperm to traverse the cervix in some ewe breeds (such as those in Norway) but not others. This review summarizes the published studies performed over the last two decades, which have focused on characterizing the biological differences in the cervix of ewe breeds of divergent fertility. It not only discusses how this unique ewe breed effect can be used to develop our understanding of how frozen-thawed semen can cross the ovine cervix but also provides new in vivo opportunities through the addition of specific biomolecules that will protect sperm, thus improving the success of cervical AI using frozen-thawed semen in sheep.

AB  - Background: Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) confers clinical and mortality benefits in select 'high-risk' patients with renovascular disease (RVD). Intra-renal-delivered extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) protect the kidney in experimental RVD, but have not been compared side-by-side to clinically applied interventions, such as PTRA. We hypothesized that MSC-derived EVs can comparably protect the post-stenotic kidney via direct tissue effects. Methods: Five groups of pigs (n = 6 each) were studied after 16 weeks of RVD, RVD treated 4 weeks earlier with either PTRA or MSC-derived EVs, and normal controls. Single-kidney renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were assessed in vivo with multi-detector CT, and renal microvascular architecture (3D micro CT) and injury pathways ex vivo. Results: Despite sustained hypertension, EVs conferred greater improvement of intra-renal microvascular and peritubular capillary density compared to PTRA, associated with attenuation of renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. Nevertheless, stenotic kidney RBF and GFR similarly rose in both PTRA- and EV-treated pigs compared RVD + Sham. mRNA sequencing reveled that EVs were enriched with pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidants genes. Conclusion: MSC-derived EVs elicit a better preservation of the stenotic kidney microvasculature and greater attenuation of renal injury and fibrosis compared to PTRA, possibly partly attributed to their cargo of vasculo-protective genes. Yet, both strategies similarly improve renal hemodynamics and function. These observations shed light on diverse mechanisms implicated in improvement of post-stenotic kidney function and position EVs as a promising therapeutic intervention in RVD.

AB  - Gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 therapy counteracts multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in rats, which have permanent occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery close to the abdominal aorta. Previously, when confronted with major vessel occlusion, its effect would rapidly activate collateral vessel pathways and resolve major venous occlusion syndromes (Pringle maneuver ischemia, reperfusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome) in rats. This would overwhelm superior mesenteric artery permanent occlusion, and result in local, peripheral, and central disturbances. Methods: Assessments, for 30 min (gross recording, angiography, ECG, pressure, microscopy, biochemistry, and oxidative stress), included the portal hypertension, caval hypertension, and aortal hypotension, and centrally, the superior sagittal sinus hypertension; systemic arterial and venous thrombosis; ECG disturbances; MDA-tissue increase; and multiple organ lesions and disturbances, including the heart, lung, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain (cortex (cerebral, cerebellar), hypothalamus/thalamus, hippocampus). BPC 157 therapy (/kg, abdominal bath) (10 mu g, 10 ng) was given for a 1-min ligation time. Results: BPC 157 rapidly recruits collateral vessels (inferior anterior pancreaticoduodenal artery and inferior mesenteric artery) that circumvent occlusion and ascertains blood flow distant from the occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery. Portal and caval hypertension, aortal hypotension, and, centrally, superior sagittal sinus hypertension were attenuated or eliminated, and ECG disturbances markedly mitigated. BPC 157 therapy almost annihilated venous and arterial thrombosis. Multiple organ lesions and disturbances (i.e., heart, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, in particular, as well as brain) were largely attenuated. Conclusions: Rats with superior mesenteric artery occlusion may additionally undergo BPC 157 therapy as full counteraction of vascular occlusion-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

AB  - Recently, we investigated the spread of antimicrobial drug-resistant (AMR) microorganisms in five dairy sheep farms in Greece to identify indicators for improved field surveillance. The high percentage of samples of feeds and milk positive to Escherichia coli and Staphylococci, including AMR isolates, recorded in this previous study generated the interest to further investigate the parameters likely to affect positivity of these certain indicators in the same farms. For this reason, 76 samples were collected, comprising milk collected from the raw milk tank (n = 5), swabs from milking shells (n = 48), feeds (n = 6), and home-grown feeds (n = 17). Samples were processed for the detection of the pathogens mentioned above and the assessment of AMR using conventional microbiology and the polymerase chain reaction. The overall percentage of positive samples was 71.1%. The percentage of isolates that were characterised as AMR of those detected was 27.8% (30% Staphylococci, 21.4% E. coli). The results indicate that AMR testing in milking shell swabs is advisable for improving AMR stewardship and should be regarded as complimentary to testing samples from the raw milk tank, because these may not depict the microbial burden of milking shells. Furthermore, the spread and antimicrobial resistance of tested bacteria in feeds are characterised by considerable variability and should therefore be assessed longitudinally.

AB  - Many animal species have evolved extreme behaviors requiring them to engage in repeated high-impact collisions. These behaviors include mating displays like headbutting in sheep and drumming in woodpeckers. To our knowledge, these taxa do not experience any notable acute head trauma, even though the deceleration forces would cause traumatic brain injury in most animals. Previous research has focused on skeletomuscular morphology, biomechanics, and material properties in an attempt to explain how animals moderate these high-impact forces. However, many of these behaviors are understudied, and most morphological or computational studies make assumptions about the behavior without accounting for the physiology of an organism. Studying neurophysiological and immune adaptations that covary with these behaviors can highlight unique or synergistic solutions to seemingly deleterious behavioral displays. Here, we argue that selection for repeated, high-impact head collisions may rely on a suite of coadaptations in intracranial physiology as a cost-reducing mechanism. We propose that there are three physiological systems that could mitigate the effects of repeated head trauma: (1) the innate neuroimmune response; (2) the glymphatic system, and (3) the choroid plexus. These systems are interconnected yet can evolve in an independent manner. We then briefly describe the function of these systems, their role in head trauma, and research that has examined how these systems may evolve to help reduce the cost of repeated, forceful head impacts. Ultimately, we note that little is known about cost-reducing intracranial mechanisms making it a novel field of comparative study that is ripe for exploration.

AB  - Social isolation gained discussion momentum due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas many studies address the effects of long-term social isolation in post-weaning and adolescence and for periods ranging from 4 to 12 weeks, little is known about the repercussions of adult long-term social isolation in middle age. Thus, our aim was to investigate how long-term social isolation can influence metabolic, behavioural, and central nervous systemrelated areas in middle-aged mice. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice (4 months-old) were randomly divided into Social (2 cages, n = 5/cage) and Isolated (10 cages, n = 1/cage) housing groups, totalizing 30 weeks of social isolation, which ended concomitantly with the onset of middle age of mice. At the end of the trial, metabolic parameters, short-term memory, anxiety-like behaviour, and physical activity were assessed. Immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus (AFosB, BDNF, and 8OHDG) and hypothalamus (AFosB) was also performed. The Isolated group showed impaired memory along with a decrease in hippocampal AFosB at dentate gyrus and in BDNF at CA3. Food intake was also affected, but the direction depended on how it was measured in the Social group (individually or in the group) with no alteration in AFosB at the hypothalamus. Physical activity parameters increased with chronic isolation, but in the light cycle (inactive phase), with some evidence of anxietylike behaviour. Future studies should better explore the timepoint at which the alterations found begin. In conclusion, long-term social isolation in adult mice contributes to alterations in feeding, physical activity pattern, and anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, short-term memory deficit was associated with lower levels of hippocampal AFosB and BDNF in middle age.

AB  - Different non-invasive techniques have been used to determine herbivore diet composition from fecal samples, including micro-histological analysis of epidermal fragments. This method can provide reliable semi-quantitative data through the identification of plant cell structures visualized under an optical microscope. However, this method is highly time-consuming and it requires significant expertise in microscopic identification. Since micro-histological analysis is based on pattern recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to make this method more time efficient through automated identification and counting of epidermal fragments. We developed a software application based on an AI model that, appropriately trained, could identify and count epidermal fragments from photographed microscope slides. We compared the performance of this model to that of visual identification by a trained observer using in vitro mixtures of fragments from two plant species, Arbutus unedo and Rubia peregrina, with very different epidermal characteristics. Both the human observer and the AI model estimated proportions of plant fragments very close to those of the original mixtures. In addition, once trained, the AI model was over 350 times faster in identifying and counting fragments compared to a human observer. Our study highlights the potential of AI to be applied to the study of herbivore diets for labor-intensive pattern recognition tasks.

AB  - Reducing fat deposition in sheep (Ovis aries) tails is one of the most important ways to combat rising costs and control consumer preference. Our previous studies have shown that oar-miR-432 is differentially expressed in the tail adipose tissue of Hu (a fat-tailed sheep breed) and Tibetan (a thin-tailed sheep breed) sheep and is a key factor in the negative regulation of fat deposition through BMP2 in ovine preadipocytes. This study investigated the effect of oar-miR-432 and its target genes in ovine preadipocytes. A dual luciferase assay revealed that DDI1 is a direct target gene of oar-miR-432. We transfected an oar-miR-432 mimic and inhibitor into preadipocytes to analyze the expression of target genes. Overexpression of oar-miR-432 inhibits DDI1 expression, whereas inhibition showed the opposite results. Compared with thin-tailed sheep, DDI1 was highly expressed in the fat-tailed sheep at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we transfected the overexpression and knockdown target genes into preadipocytes to analyze their influence after inducing differentiation. Knockdown of DDI1 induced ovine preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes but suppressed oar-miR-432 expression. Conversely, the overexpression of DDI1 significantly inhibited differentiation but promoted oar-miR-432 expression. DDI1 overexpression also decreased the content of triglycerides. Additionally, DDI1 is a nested gene in intron 1 of PDGFD. When DDI1 was overexpressed, the PDGFD expression also increased, whereas DDI1 knockdown showed the opposite results. This is the first study to reveal the biological mechanisms by which oar-miR-432 inhibits preadipocytes through DDI1 and provides insight into the molecular regulatory mechanisms of DDI1 in ovine preadipocytes. These results have important applications in animal breeding and obesity-related human diseases.

AB  - Simple Summary The main aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of replacing soybean meal with lupins on carcass traits, meat characteristics, meat characteristics, and meat fatty acid profile in lambs. Two trials were conducted: In trial 1, the soybean meal was partially replaced by Lupinus albus or Lupinus luteus; in trial 2, lambs were fed four diets with graded levels of Lupinus luteus, ranging from 0 to 200 g/kg. The lambs were slaughtered to evaluate carcass characteristics, meat composition, and fatty acids profile. Carcass composition was not affected (p > 0.05) by diet in both trials. Meat quality attributes did not vary (p < 0.05) between trials 1 and 2. Overall, fatty acid content was not affected by diet (p > 0.05) in both trials. Soybean meal produced the same results as lupins in this study, indicating the latter as a potential alternative protein source, although research should focus on meat palatability. The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of partial replacement of soybean meal by lupins on lambs' diets, on the carcass traits, meat characteristics, and meat fatty acid profile. Two trials were conducted: In trial 1, the soybean meal (control; C) was partially replaced by Lupinus albus or Lupinus luteus (50 g/kg; LA5 and LL5, respectively); in trial 2, lambs were fed four diets with graded levels of Lupinus luteus (0, 100, 150 and 200 g/kg; C, LL10, LL15, LL20, respectively). At the end of the feeding trials, animals were slaughtered to evaluate carcass characteristics and meat composition, including fatty acids. Carcass composition in tissues was not affected (p > 0.05) by diet in both trials. Additionally, no significant (p < 0.05) differences were observed in meat quality attributes between diets in trials 1 and 2. Overall, the Longissimus muscle's fatty acid content was not affected by diet (p > 0.05) in both trials. Carcass and meat quality was overall comparable between lambs fed with soybean meal and lupins, indicating the latter as a potential alternative protein source. However, the lack of significant differences could also be attributed to the small sample size.

AB  - Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put some health systems under pressure, especially in low- and middle-income countries. We aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 emergency on the management of people with epilepsy (PWE) living in the rural communities of the Gran Chaco area of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.
   Materials and methods: We selected a sample of PWE living in the rural communities of the Bolivian Chaco. A standardized questionnaire was developed, consisting of six questions addressing drug availability, drug discontinuation, personnel responsible for drug retrieval during the lockdown, and the presence of seizures in the two months preceding the interview. Questionnaires were administered by community health workers of the rural health centers in September 2020.
   Results: Seventy PWE (38 men, 54.3%; mean age 26.9 +/- 16.7) were interviewed. During the lockdown the large majority of them (n = 51, 73.9%) reported an irregular medication intake mainly due to the lack of antiseizure medications in the local health posts, leading to an increase in seizure frequency.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked the frailty of the Bolivian health system, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as epilepsy in the rural communities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying important demographic drivers of population dynamics is fundamental for understanding life-history evolution and implementing effective conservation measures. Integrated population models (IPMs) coupled with transient life table response experiments (tLTREs) allow ecologists to quantify the contributions of demographic parameters to observed population change. While IPMs can estimate parameters that are not estimable using any data source alone, for example, immigration, the estimated contribution of such parameters to population change is prone to bias. Currently, it is unclear when robust conclusions can be drawn from them. We sought to understand the drivers of a rebounding southern elephant seal population on Marion Island using the IPM-tLTRE framework, applied to count and mark-recapture data on 9500 female seals over nearly 40 years. Given the uncertainty around IPM-tLTRE estimates of immigration, we also aimed to investigate the utility of simulation and sensitivity analyses as general tools for evaluating the robustness of conclusions obtained in this framework. Using a Bayesian IPM and tLTRE analysis, we quantified the contributions of survival, immigration and population structure to population growth. We assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to choice of multivariate priors on immigration and other vital rates. To do so we make a novel application of Gaussian process priors, in comparison with commonly used shrinkage priors. Using simulation, we assessed our model's ability to estimate the demographic contribution of immigration under different levels of temporal variance in immigration. The tLTRE analysis suggested that adult survival and immigration were the most important drivers of recent population growth. While the contribution of immigration was sensitive to prior choices, the estimate was consistently large. Furthermore, our simulation study validated the importance of immigration by showing that our estimate of its demographic contribution is unlikely to result as a biased overestimate. Our results highlight the connectivity between distant populations of southern elephant seals, illustrating that female dispersal can be important in regulating the abundance of local populations even when natal site fidelity is high. More generally, we demonstrate how robust ecological conclusions may be obtained about immigration from the IPM-tLTRE framework, by combining sensitivity analysis and simulation.
   This in-depth study considers the contribution of immigration to population growth, when immigration is estimated indirectly in an integrated population model. The authors demonstrate the importance of simulation and sensitivity analysis for obtaining robust conclusions, and introduce an elegant prior to the problem along the way.image

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) caused the destruction of tight junction and epithelial cells, resulting in the increased gut permeability of pathogenic E.coli, and the reduction of the growth performance. Stimbiotic (STB), while generating specific Xylo-oligosaccharides and a positive effect on gut health, has been introduced as an antibiotics alternative. This study evaluated the effect in weaned piglets of experimentally induced PWD. Our results showed that the pigs were challenged by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC). STB significantly increased the growth performance, immunity and intestinal health compared with the non-supplemented group. Therefore, STB can be used as an effective additive for weaned piglets. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of stimbiotic (STB), a xylanase and xylo-oligosaccharide complex. A total of 36 male weaned pigs with initial body weights of 8.49 +/- 0.10 kg were used in a 3-week experiment. The experiment was conducted in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement (six replicates/treatment) of treatments consisting of two levels of challenge (challenge and non-challenge) and three levels of STB (0, 0.5, and 1 g/kg diet). Supplementations STB 0.5 g/kg (STB5) and STB 1 g/kg (STB10) improved the G:F (p = 0.04) in piglets challenged with STEC. STB supplementation, which also decreased (p < 0.05) the white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Supplementations STB5 and STB10 improved (p < 0.01) the lymphocytes and neutrophils in piglets challenged with STEC on 14 dpi. Additionally, supplementations STB5 and STB10 improved (p < 0.01) the tumor necrosis factor-alpha in piglets challenged with STEC on 3 dpi. Supplementations STB5 and STB10 also improved the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (p < 0.01) in piglets challenged with STEC. Supplementation with STB reduced (p < 0.05) the expression levels of calprotectin. In conclusion, STB could alleviate a decrease of the performance, immune response, and inflammatory response induced by the STEC challenge.

AB  - The encounter of oocyte and sperm is the key event initiating embryonic development in mammals. Crucial functions of this existential interaction are determined by proteolytic enzymes, such as acrosin, carried in the sperm head acrosome, and ovastacin, stored in the oocyte cortical granules. Ovastacin is released upon fertilisation to cleave the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte. This limited proteolysis hardens the oocyte envelope, and thereby provides a definitive block against polyspermy and protects the developing embryo. On the other hand, acrosin, the renowned and most abundant acrosomal protease, has been thought to enable sperm to penetrate the oocyte envelope. Depending on the species, proteolytic cleavage of the zona pellucida by acrosin is either essential or conducive for fertilisation. However, the specific target cleavage sites and the resulting physiological consequences of this proteolysis remained obscure. Here, we treated native mouse zonae pellucidae with active acrosin and identified two cleavage sites in zona pellucida protein 1 (ZP1), five in ZP2 and one in ZP3 by mass spectrometry. Several of these sites are highly conserved in mammals. Remarkably, limited proteolysis by acrosin leads to zona pellucida remodelling rather than degradation. Thus, acrosin affects both sperm binding and mechanical resilience of the zona pellucida, as assessed by microscopy and nanoindentation measurements, respectively. Furthermore, we ascertained potential regulatory effects of acrosin, via activation of latent pro-ovastacin and inactivation of fetuin-B, a tight binding inhibitor of ovastacin. These results offer novel insights into the complex proteolytic network modifying the extracellular matrix of the mouse oocyte, which might apply also to other species.

AB  - Accurate and efficient weight estimation of pigs is crucial for optimizing production, ensuring animal welfare, and making informed decisions in swine farming. Despite technological advancements, obtaining precise individual pig weights remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of pig movement and the stress induced by traditional weighing methods, highlighting the need for innovative, non-invasive solutions. This study presents an automated walk-over scale system that leverages high-frequency load cell data, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to estimate pig weights in motion, addressing the limitations of traditional weighing methods. The system's effectiveness was validated in a real-world setting with 50 pigs across 944 walk-throughs, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.87 kg and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.65% on a 20% pig-wise holdout validation set, demonstrating its potential as a practical solution for non-invasive, accurate weight monitoring in commercial pig farming operations.

AB  - Targeted vector surveillance informed by data on mosquito biting patterns can help limit arboviral zoonotic diseases. To characterise host-biting networks in rural and urban equestrian facilities from temperate Argentina, adult resting mosquitoes were collected (December 2018-April 2019) with a battery-powered aspirator. Engorged females were sorted to species, and their blood source was identified using molecular techniques. Bipartite network analysis was performed for rural and urban matrices. A total of 177 bloodmeals from 11 mosquito species of Aedes and Culex were identified, with seven mammal and 17 bird species recognised as hosts. Mammals represented 61% of the total feeds, mainly horse, dog and sheep; the best represented avian hosts were Columbiformes. Aedes species and Culex maxi fed only on mammals, while most other Culex species presented a wide range of hosts. The rural network had more nodes and interactions than its urban counterpart, both with some degree of host selection and aggregated patterns according to network indices. Culex quinquefasciatus was the strongest species in both networks, whereas Culex apicinus and Culex dolosus had a prominent role in the rural network. Bipartite network analysis will contribute to understanding the effects of urbanisation in the dynamics of vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Fewer studies investigate the effects of underlying genetic factors related to semen characteristics, significantly affecting sheep farm profitability. This study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and genomic regions associated with fresh and frozen-thawed semen traits in rams with low (Hasak) and high (Hasmer) cryotolerance. Semen collected from 11 (5 Hasak with low and 6 Hasmer with high cryotolerance) rams cryopreserved in 0.25 ml straws in the breeding season. Quality characteristics were determined in fresh, equilibrated, and frozen-thawed semen. A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) was conducted to unveil the genetic structure that might be attributed to cryotolerance in low and high cryotoleranced rams. Fresh (regarding total and progressive motility) and equilibrated semen quality were similar in Hasak and Hasmer rams (p > 0.6). However, the freeze-thawing process had a more pronounced negative effect on ram semen traits in Hasak than in Hasmer (p < 0.05). GWAS revealed 27 SNPs correlated with post-thaw semen parameters. Moreover, network analyses revealed pathways related to sperm ion channels and their activities, providing insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying sperm physiology and emphasizing their role in potentially impacting sperm cryotolerance. The functional significance of detected SNPs and the associated pathways require further exploration.

AB  - In recent years, the research work of artificial intelligence technology has progressed rapidly, and various classic Few-Shot learning models have achieved unprecedented success in many artificial intelligence application fields. These include face recognition, object classification detection and tracking, speech recognition, and natural language processing, which greatly facilitate our lives. This paper aims to identify dance fitness movements based on contour image spatial frequency domain features and Few-Shot learning technology. This paper proposes a Few-Shot learning method based on contrastive average loss for Few-Shot learning. This method makes the learned model more representative by improving the loss function and performing a normalization process, and it proposes a feature extraction algorithm that combines improved LBP and HOG for action recognition technology. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the algorithm in this paper is 93.10%, 90.30%, and 92.70% for walking, opening hands, and running, respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the fusion feature algorithm.

AB  - In our previous study, circ_015343 was found to inhibit the viability and proliferation of ovine mammary epithelial cells (OMECs) and the expression levels of milk fat synthesis marker genes, but the regulatory mechanism underlying the processes is still unclear. Accordingly in this study, the target relationships between circ_015343 with miR-25 and between miR-25 with insulin induced gene 1 (INSIG1) were verified, and the functions of miR-25 and INSIG1 were investigated in OMECs. The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-25 mimic remarkably decreased the luciferase activity of circ_015343 in HEK293T cells cotransfected with a wild-type vector, while it did not change the activity of circ_015343 in HEK293T cells cotransfected with a mutant vector. These suggest that cic_015343 can adsorb and bind miR-25. The miR-25 increased the viability and proliferation of OMECs, and the content of triglycerides in OMECs. In addition, INSIG1 was found to be a target gene of miR-25 using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of INSIG1 decreased the viability, proliferation, and level of triglycerides of OMECs. In contrast, the inhibition of INSIG1 in expression had the opposite effect on activities and triglycerides of OMECs with overexpressed INSIG1. A rescue experiment revealed that circ_015343 alleviated the inhibitory effect of miR-25 on the mRNA and protein abundance of INSIG1. These results indicate that circ_015343 sponges miR-25 to inhibit the activities and content of triglycerides of OMECs by upregulating the expression of INSIG1 in OMECs. This study provided new insights for understanding the genetic molecular mechanism of lactation traits in sheep.

AB  - Plants employ sophisticated defense mechanisms, including releasing volatile organic compounds, to defend against biotic and abiotic stresses. These compounds play a crucial role in plant defense by attracting natural enemies and facilitating communication between plants to activate defense mechanisms. However, there has been no research on how exposure to these compounds activates defense mechanisms in citrus plants. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing citrus defensive activation, we conducted a molecular analysis of the rootstock Citrange carrizo [a hybrid of Citrus sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata] in response to defense activation by the volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate [(Z)-3-HP], utilizing a groundbreaking transcriptomic analysis involving the genomes of both parental species. Our results revealed significant gene expression changes, notably the overexpression of genes related to plant immunity, antioxidant activity, defense against herbivores, and tolerance to abiotic stress. Significantly, P. trifoliata contributed most notably to the hybrid's gene expression profile in response to (Z)-3-HP. Additionally, plants exposed to (Z)-3-HP repelled several citrus pests, attracted natural predators, and led to diminished performance of two key citrus pests. Our study emphasizes the complex molecular basis of volatile-triggered defenses in citrus and highlights the potential of plant volatiles in pest control strategies.

AB  - Introduction Since December 2019, a serious health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 affected all aspects of human lives. The available data about COVID-19-associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis (CA-ROCM) survival issues are based on studies on small populations with limited follow-up durations. Therefore, this multicenter cohort of a large population with CA-ROCM is aiming to report the one-year survival rate and investigate the potential responsible risk factors affecting the mortality.<br /> Materials and Methods This prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study included CA-ROCM patients from eight tertiary ophthalmology centers across Iran. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were collected and patients were followed for a year. Survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models to identify mortality-associated risk factors. The research protocol is also available on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05097664).<br /> Results Among the 246 patients, 183 (74.4%) survived within a year and 63 (25.6%) died. Significant mortality risk factors included need for orbital exenteration (HR = 3.01 vs. other treatments, p = 0.019), advanced disease stage (HR = 2.43 stage IV vs. II, p = 0.02), age (HR = 1.05, p < 0.001), and diabetes duration (HR = 1.05, p = 0.002). Paradoxically, steroid administration for COVID management was associated with improved survival (HR = 2.72 for no steroids, p = 0.018).<br /> Discussion COVID-19-associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis carries a substantial one-year survival rate of 74.4% in Iran. Age, diabetes, advanced disease stage, and need for orbital exenteration are the probable fatal risk factors. Interestingly, administration of steroids for COVID management was associated with a better survival.

AB  - The present study describes the isolation and characterization of Bacillus tropicus LS27 capable of keratinolytic protease production from Russell Market, Shivajinagar, Bangalore, Karnataka, with its diverse application. The ability of this strain to hydrolyze chicken feathers and skim milk was used to assess its keratinolytic and pro-teolytic properties. The strain identification was done using biochemical and molecular characterization using the 16S rRNA sequencing method. Further a sequential and systematic optimization of the factors affecting the keratinase production was done by initially sorting out the most influential factors (NaCl concentration, pH, inoculum level and incubation period in this study) through one factor at a time approach followed by central composite design based response surface methodology to enhance the keratinase production. Under optimized levels of NaCl (0.55 g/L), pH (7.35), inoculum level (5%) and incubation period (84 h), the keratinase production was enhanced from 41.62 U/mL to 401.67 & PLUSMN; 9.23 U/mL (9.65 fold increase) that corresponds to a feather degradation of 32.67 & PLUSMN; 1.36% was achieved. With regard to the cost effectiveness of application studies, the crude enzyme extracted from the optimized medium was tested for its potential dehairing, destaining and metal recovery properties. Complete dehairing was achieved within 48 h of treatment with crude enzyme without any visible damage to the collagen layer of goat skin. In destaining studies, combination of crude enzyme and detergent solution [1 mL detergent solution (5 mg/mL) and 1 mL crude enzyme] was found to be most effective in removing blood stains from cotton cloth. Silver recovery from used X-ray films was achieved within 6 min of treatment with crude enzyme maintained at 40 degrees C.

AB  - The European Commission's ban on routine tail docking has prompted this retrospective observational study to evaluate the short-term effects of transitioning to a fully undocked system. Twenty-two farms were assessed during three subsequent phases: total tail docking (step 1), subgroups of undocked pigs (step 2), and fully undocked pigs (step 3). Farmers received training in long-tail management and independently implemented it on their own farms. However, straw provision as environmental enrichment was mandatory, at least supplied during periods of pigs' restlessness. Overall, going through step 2 appears to be successful. However, transitioning to step 3 worsened mortality (p = 0.010) and the feed conversion ratio (p = 0.015) in weaners. Compared to step 1, the cost of producing 1 kg of meat in step 3 was 33.9% greater during weaning and 7.4% during fattening. Tail lesion prevalence at slaughter was greater in step 3 (41%), followed by step 2 (10%) and step 1 (1%). The hypothetical labour required to optimize straw management compared to the adopted system, ensuring its continuous availability, was estimated as 35 min/100 piglets/weaning cycle (EUR 4.37) and 10.5 h/100 pigs/fattening cycle (EUR 109). Under the conditions of this study, transitioning to a fully undocked system was not successful. Mandating only the non-continuous use of straw has proven insufficient, and greater efforts must be systematically implemented.

AB  - Experimental evidence suggests that chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a major hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), boosts carotid body (CB) responsiveness, thereby causing increased sympathetic activity, arterial and pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. An enhanced circulatory chemoreflex, oxidative stress, and NO signaling appear to play important roles in these responses to CIH in rodents. Since the guinea pig has a hypofunctional CB (i.e., it is a natural CB knockout), in this study we used it as a model to investigate the CB dependence of the effects of CIH on pulmonary vascular responses, including those mediated by NO, by comparing them with those previously described in the rat. We have analyzed pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response, endothelial function both in vivo and in vitro, and vascular remodeling (intima-media thickness, collagen fiber content, and vessel lumen area). We demonstrate that 30 days of the exposure of guinea pigs to CIH (FiO2, 5% for 40 s, 30 cycles/h) induces pulmonary artery remodeling but does not alter endothelial function or the contractile response to phenylephrine (PE) in these arteries. In contrast, CIH exposure increased the systemic arterial pressure and enhanced the contractile response to PE while decreasing endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to carbachol in the aorta without causing its remodeling. We conclude that since all of these effects are independent of CB sensitization, there must be other oxygen sensors, beyond the CB, with the capacity to alter the autonomic control of the heart and vascular function and structure in CIH.

AB  - Masticatory muscle features allow for an understanding of how dietary habits and masticatory functions have evolved across mammalian lineages. Herbivorous mammals were traditionally classified as pertaining to either 'ungulate-grinding' or 'rodent-gnawing' morphotypes, but those classes might not adequately encompass the diversity of past and present herbivores. We compiled data for 104 herbivorous (nine orders, including new data for 31 species) and ten non-herbivorous (five orders) extant species and for four extinct taxa, in order to construct a more comprehensive scheme of masticatory morphotypes. A myological phylomorphospace revealed 15 morphotypes, which were tested statistically and interpreted morphofunctionally. Extant herbivorous morphotypes diversified along two main pathways that did not reflect the traditional types. Additionally, some extinct herbivores adapted along alternative pathways to those of extant forms. Early mammaliaforms and mammals possessed muscle proportions almost identical to those of living carnivores. Several more plesiomorphic herbivorous morphotypes were recognized, with some of them retaining generalized myological proportions. The rodent disparity was remarkable and could not be encompassed by a single category or pathway. Features of some derived euungulates and diprotodonts resembled rodents, but only a few extinct euungulates and extant wombats converged closely with them. Criteria for selecting models for palaeobiological reconstructions are discussed.

AB  - Hydatid disease is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by cysts of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Canids, especially domestic dogs, are definitive hosts of the parasite and are the most pragmatic targets for control programs. A governmental dog deworming campaign was established in 1979 to control hydatidosis in southern Chile, which succeeded in reducing the prevalence of canine echinococcosis in Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4% (in 1978) to 1.2% (in 2002). In 2004, however, the program was dismantled to reduce costs, and since then, no follow-up echinococcosis monitoring has been conducted. We surveyed 356 domestic dogs and interviewed owners or workers at 45 ranches in Chilean Tierra del Fuego during the summer of 2015-2016. Faecal flotation was employed to detect Taeniidae eggs, and PCR was used to test faecal samples for Echinococcus granulosus. Taeniidae eggs and Echinococcus sp. DNA were detected in the faeces of 45.4% (147/324) and 6.9% (23/331) of dogs, respectively. Infrequent dog deworming and the presence of culpeo foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus) were significant predictors of the prevalence of Echinococcus sp. DNA and Taeniidae eggs. Furthermore, the presence of introduced chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus), the municipality, and several operational characteristics of ranches (number of sheep, frequency of sheep slaughter, number of dogs, frequency of removal of dog faeces, feeding of dogs with sheep viscera) were also predictive of the prevalence of Taeniidae eggs. Our findings reveal an ongoing risk of echinococcosis with pathogen maintenance in ranch dogs in Chilean Tierra del Fuego, and in the absence of adequate control programmes, there is a tangible risk of re-emergence of hydatid disease as a public health concern.

AB  - Milk and dairy products can have variable contents of antioxidant compounds that contribute to counteract the oxidation of lipids and proteins during processing and storage. The content of active antioxidant compounds is closely linked to their protection by oxidation. Freezing is one of the factors that can reduce antioxidant activity. Freezing of milk or curd is frequently used in case of the seasonality of milk production and/or seasonal increased demand for some products. In this paper, the effect of using frozen curd on the oxidative stability of buffalo Mozzarella cheese was evaluated. Samples of buffalo Mozzarella with different frozen curd content (0%, 5%, 20%, and 50%) were produced and analyzed at one and nine days. Mozzarella cheese with higher frozen curd content had a significant increase in redox potential parallel to the decrease in antioxidant activity, showing less protection from oxidation. Lipid and protein oxidation, expressed respectively by malondialdehyde and carbonyl content, increased significantly with increasing frozen curd. At nine days, carbonyls significantly increased while malondialdehyde content did not vary, showing that during storage, fat was more protected from oxidation than protein. The average carbonyl levels were comparable to those of some cooked cheeses, and the malondialdehyde levels were even lower. The results of this study stimulate the investigation of new strategies to decrease the oxidative damage in cheeses produced in the presence of factors decreasing oxidative stability.

AB  - Simple Summary: Alfalfa is the main fodder crop of the irrigated crop systems of northern Spain, as well as many Mediterranean countries. Alfalfa crops are damaged by some pest species but are also considered to be vast reservoirs of natural enemies of these pests. However, in Europe, the relationships between these pests and their natural enemies have been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to fill this gap in the knowledge. Therefore, we characterized the coccinellid species complex, identifying sixteen species, and the numerical relationships of the two that were most prevalent-Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia variegata-with the different aphid species, which are considered one of the alfalfa pests. The numerical relationships were separately studied in each of the alfalfa growing periods between cuttings (intercuts). Whereas the abundance of C. septempunctata was correlated with that of A. pisum in the second alfalfa intercut, H. variegata was mainly correlated with the abundance of T. trifolii in the fourth intercut as well as with the overall aphid abundance in the fifth intercut. This study helps to increase the knowledge on the predator-prey relationships, which is crucial for the proper pest management of alfalfa and the agricultural ecosystems in which it is included.
   Alfalfa is known to be an important reservoir harboring natural enemies. The reduction in insecticide sprayings in recent years has allowed us to study the coccinellid species complex in this crop and the relationship between these predators and aphids. Alfalfa was sampled by sweep-netting throughout its productive period in several commercial stands each year between 2010 and 2021. The numbers and species of aphids and coccinellids were recorded. Sixteen coccinellid species were found. Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia variegata were, by far, the most prevalent species, with the former dominating during the first and second intercuts, whereas the latter dominated from the third to the fifth intercut. Acyrthosiphon pisum and Therioaphis trifolii were the most abundant aphid species, peaking in the second and fourth intercuts, respectively. Positive correlations were found between the abundance of C. septempunctata and A. pisum at the second intercut, between H. variegata and T. trifolii at the fourth intercut, and between H. variegata and the total number of aphids in the fifth intercut. This study helps to increase the knowledge on the predator-prey relationships of this crop and allows for designing strategies of conservation biological control against aphids.

AB  - Clonal plants are interconnected to form clonal plant networks with physiological integration, enabling the reassignment as well as sharing of resources among the members. The systemic induction of antiherbivore resistance via clonal integration may frequently operate in the networks. Here, we used an important food crop rice (Oryza sativa), and its destructive pest rice leaffolder (LF; Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) as a model to examine defense communication between the main stem and clonal tillers. LF infestation and MeJA pretreatment on the main stem for two days reduced the weight gain of LF larvae fed on the corresponding primary tillers by 44.5% and 29.0%, respectively. LF infestation and MeJA pretreatment on the main stem also enhanced antiherbivore defense responses in primary tillers: increased levels of a trypsin protease inhibitor, putative defensive enzymes, and jasmonic acid (JA), a key signaling compound involved in antiherbivore induced defenses; strong induction of genes encoding JA biosynthesis and perception; and rapid activation of JA pathway. However, in a JA perception OsCOI RNAi line, LF infestation on main stem showed no or minor effects on antiherbivore defense responses in primary tillers. Our work demonstrates that systemic antiherbivore defense operate in the clonal network of rice plants and JA signaling plays a crucial role in mediating defense communication between main stem and tillers in rice plants. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the ecological control of pests by using the systemic resistance of cloned plants themselves.

AB  - Macaque reproductive patterns range from strictly seasonal breeding to non-seasonal breeding, but factors explaining this variation are not fully understood. Valid reproductive seasonality data are also still lacking for many wild macaque populations because the majority of birth data are from captive animals living outside of their geographic range. We evaluated whether the reproductive seasonality of wild northern pig-tailed macaques falls as expected by the ecological (latitude) or phylogenetic inertia hypotheses in comparison with other macaque species. We recorded monthly occurrences of births (N = 22), copulations (N = 563), and females exhibiting sex skin swellings (N = 18) in one group at Khao Yai National Park (KYNP), Thailand. Births, copulations, and females exhibiting sex skin swellings were significantly different from a random distribution. Using measures of circular statistics and the van Schaik and colleagues' (Schaik et al. Lee (ed), Comparative primate socioecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999) seasonality categorizations, the population at KYNP is best characterized as moderately seasonal breeding. Despite some inconsistency, macaque reproductive seasonality was significantly influenced by latitudinal location. We broadly found that: (1) non-seasonal breeding macaque populations (birth r-vector < 0.3) lived at latitudes close to the equator between 1 degrees S and 3 degrees N, (2) moderately seasonal breeding macaque populations (0.3 < birth r-vector < 0.7) were found between 3 degrees N and 14 degrees N and at 5 degrees S, and (3) strictly seasonal breeding macaque populations (birth r-vector > 0.7) ranged >= 12 degrees N. A strong phylogenetic signal in reproductive seasonality on the macaque phylogeny was also detected. However, further studies of wild macaque populations are still needed to better characterize reproductive seasonality in this taxon.

AB  - The mouse is a widely used animal model for studying human reproduction. However, the mice are eccentric implantation, and ovarian progesterone and estrogen are essential for implantation, which is different from human beings. Guinea pigs are unique from mice since, like humans, they are the inter-stitial implantation, and ovarian progesterone alone seems to be sufficient to allow for implantation. In this study, we firstly analyzed the gene expression profiles in the receptive uterus on day 5 of pregnancy compared to the pre-receptive uterus on day 3 of pregnancy in guinea pigs using the RNA-seq method. In total, 304 up-regulated and 475 down-regulated genes were identified. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses highlighted the importance of the inflammatory response in the receptive uterus. Through gene network analysis, we identified 24 hub genes, most of which were involved in regulating endometrial receptivity. In addition, we performed a cross-species comparison of differentially expressed genes associated with uterine receptivity. A total of 14 genes were shared among guinea pigs, humans, and mice. Furthermore, Fisher's exact test revealed that gene expression patterns of uterine receptivity were more similar between guinea pigs and humans than between mice and humans. Our study may contribute to increasing the knowledge of uterine receptivity in guinea pigs.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the role of these responses in plant-fungus-herbivore tripartite interactions has not been well elucidated. Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are plant specialized metabolites with bioactive properties against arthropod herbivores. Here, the effects of seed treatments by three EPF isolates, representing Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium brunneum, and M. robertsii, on population growth of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch) were evaluated on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The levels of two SGAs, alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine, were determined in tomato leaves by LC-MS with and without T. urticae infestations after EPF inoculations. Interestingly, the population growth of T. urticae was significantly highest with M. brunneum and lowest with M. robertsii and B. bassiana at 15 days after infestation. Overall there was a significant negative correlation between SGAs content and the number of T. urticae. The levels of SGAs were significantly induced by T. urticae presence in all treatments, while only M. robertsii showed significantly higher levels of SGAs than M. brunneum and control in one of two experiments. Contrastingly, the effects on SGAs accumulation and population growth of T. urticae did not directly correlate with EPF endophytic colonization patterns of the inoculated plants. This study suggests a link between ecological effects and physiological responses mediated by EPF inoculations and T. urticae infestation with potential implications for plant protection.

AB  - Herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are key components of plant-herbivorous-natural enemies communications. Indeed, plants respond to herbivores feeding by releasing HIPVs to attract natural enemies. The present study analyses the effect of HIPVs of Vitex negundo (Lamiaceae), an indigenous plant species in northern China, on the predatory ladybug species Harmonia axyridis. Y-tube olfactometer bioassay showed that H. axyridis adults were significantly attracted by V. negundo infested by the aphid Aphis gossypii. We analyzed and compared volatile profiles between healthy and A. gossypii infested V. negundo, screened out the candidate active HIPVs mediated by A. gossypii which could attract H. axyridis, and tested the olfactory behavior of the candidate active compounds on H. axyridis. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that five volatile compounds were significantly up-regulated after V. negundo infestation by A. gossypii, and five substances were significantly down-regulated in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. The olfactory behavior response showed that H. axyridis has significant preference for sclareol, eucalyptol, nonanal and alpha-terpineol, indicating that this chemical compounds are the important volatiles released by V. negundo to attract H. axyridis. This study preliminarily clarified that V. negundo release HIPVs to attract natural enemies when infected by herbivorous insects. The description of the volatile emission profile enriches the theoretical system of insect-induced volatile-mediated plant defense function of woody plants. Applications in crop protection would lie in designing original strategies to naturally control aphids in orchards.

AB  - Among air toxics, formaldehyde (HCHO) is an important contributor to urban cancer risk. Emissions of HCHO in the United States are systematically under-reported and may enhance atmospheric ozone and particulate matter, intensifying their impacts on human health. During the 2021 Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE), mobile real-time (similar to 1 s frequency) measurements of ozone, nitrogen oxides, and organic compounds were conducted in an industrialized area in metropolitan Detroit. The measured concentrations were used to infer ground-level and elevated emissions of HCHO, CO, and NO from multiple sources at a fine scale (400 m horizontal resolution) based on the 4D variational data assimilation technique and the MicroFACT air quality model. Cumulative exposure to HCHO from multiple sources of both primary (directly emitted) and secondary (atmospherically formed) HCHO was then simulated assuming emissions inferred from inverse modeling. Model-inferred HCHO emissions from larger industrial facilities were greater than 1 US ton per year while corresponding emission ratios of HCHO to CO in combustion sources were roughly 2 to 5%. Moreover, simulated ambient HCHO concentrations depended significantly on wind direction relative to the largest sources. The model helped to explain the observed HCHO concentration gradient between monitoring stations at Dearborn and River Rouge in 2021.

AB  - Little is known about the tolerances of mammalian herbivores to plant specialized metabolites across landscapes. We investigated the tolerances of two species of herbivorous woodrats, Neotoma lepida (desert woodrat) and Neotoma bryanti (Bryant's woodrat) to creosote bush Larrea tridentata, a widely distributed shrub with a highly toxic resin. Woodrats were sampled from 13 locations both with and without creosote bush across a 900 km transect in the US southwest. We tested whether these woodrat populations consume creosote bush using plant metabarcoding of faeces and quantified their tolerance to creosote bush through feeding trials using chow amended with creosote resin. Toxin tolerance was analysed in the context of population structure across collection sites with microsatellite analyses. Genetic differentiation among woodrats collected from different locations was minimal within either species. Tolerance differed substantially between the two species, with N. lepida persisting 20% longer than N. bryanti in feeding trials with creosote resin. Furthermore, in both species, tolerance to creosote resin was similar among woodrats near or within creosote bush habitat. In both species, woodrats collected >25 km from creosote had markedly lower tolerances to creosote resin compared to animals from within the range of creosote bush. The results imply that mammalian herbivores are adapted to the specialized metabolites of plants in their diet, and that this tolerance can extend several kilometres outside of the range of dietary items. That is, direct ecological exposure to the specialized chemistry of particular plant species is not a prerequisite for tolerance to these compounds. These findings lay the groundwork for additional studies to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying toxin tolerance and to identify how these mechanisms are maintained across landscape-level scales in mammalian herbivores.

AB  - BackgroundQuinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) exhibits a diverse and complex response to various organisms and environmental factors. The Spodoptera exigua elicits varying levels of damage in different crops. Secondary metabolites in quinoa induce defense mechanisms against S. exigua and play a key role in influencing its feeding preferences. Although the co-evolution of quinoa and S. exigua has been explored, the understanding of the interaction between these species remains limited. We aimed to evaluate the defense mechanisms of differently colored quinoa (red, white, yellow, and black) against S. exigua using metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Metabolomic analysis was used to identify insect-resistant metabolites in four differently colored quinoa cultivars, whereas transcriptome analysis was used to explore related pathways and gene associations.ResultsQuinoa resistant cultivars has higher levels of protective metabolites and mechanisms. Quinoa constitutive defense refers to the significant metabolism of ferulic compounds and lignin in plants to enhance their own resistance. Meanwhile, a significant expression of anthelmintic differential metabolites, including indole 3-acetic acid, choline, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and anthranilic acid, was observed. The structural genes regulated by kaempferol (3,5,7,4 '-tetrahydroxyflavone) and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, along with genes downstream of quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside and MYB/MYB-related transcription factor, exhibited high expression levels in all four colors of insect-resistant quinoa. Among all quinoa cultivars, the red quinoa cultivar showed the most distinct variation in metabolite species and contents, insect-resistance was also relatively high.ConclusionsThese findings reveal that the types of different metabolites and MYB/MYB related transcription factors play a crucial role in influencing the expression of genes related to quinoa color and regulation, as well as in distinguishing the insect resistance of quinoa with different colors. These findings provide a basis for selecting and identifying new insect-resistant differently colored quinoa cultivars.

AB  - Endometrial fibrosis leads to the destruction of endometrial function and affects reproductive performance. However, mechanisms underlying the development of endometrial fibrosis in sheep remain unclear. We use transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies to reveal the formation mechanisms of endometrial fibrosis. The results showed that the fibrotic endometrial tissue phenotype presented fewer glands, accompanied by collagen deposition. Transcriptomic results indicated alterations in genes associated with the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components, which alter metabolite homeostasis, especially in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, differentially expressed metabolites may play regulatory roles in key metabolic processes during fibrogenesis, including protein digestion and absorption, and amino acid synthesis. Affected by the aberrant genes, protein levels related to the extracellular matrix components were altered. In addition, based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of differentially expressed genes, metabolites and proteins, amino acid biosynthesis, glutathione, glycerophospholipid, arginine and proline metabolism, and cell adhesion are closely associated with fibrogenesis. Finally, we analyzed the dynamic changes in serum differential metabolites at different time points during fibrosis. Taken together, fibrosis development is related to metabolic obstacles in extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation triggered by disturbed gene and protein levels.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is a polyphagous herbivore with a worldwide distribution, and is a serious pest in tomato and other crops. As an alternative to chemical pesticides, biological control with the release of natural enemies such as predatory mites represent an efficient method to control T. urticae in many crops, but not in tomato. Other biological control agents, such as beneficial microbes, as well as chemical compounds, which can act as plant defense elicitors that confer plant resistance against pests and pathogens, may prove promising biological solutions for the suppression of spider mite populations in tomato. Here, we assessed this hypothesis by recording the effects of a series of fungal and bacterial strains and the plant strengthener acibenzolar-s-methyl for their plant-mediated effects on T. urticae performance in two tomato cultivars. We found significant negative effects on the survival, egg production and spider mite feeding damage on plants inoculated with microbes or treated with the plant strengthener as compared to the control plants. Our results highlight the potential of beneficial microbes and plant strengtheners in spider mite suppression in addition to plant disease control.

AB  - Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are chondroitin-sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) containing extracellular matrix structures that assemble around neurons involved in learning, memory, and cognition. Owing to the unique patterning of negative charges stemming from sulfate modifications to the attached CS-GAGs, these matrices play key roles in mediating glycan-protein binding, signaling interactions, and charged ion buffering of the underlying circuitry. Histochemical loss of PNN matrices has been reported for a range of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative diseases, implying that PNNs might be a key player in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. In this hypothesis and theory article, we begin by highlighting PNN changes observed in human postmortem brain tissue associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corresponding changes reported in rodent models of AD neuropathology. We then discuss the technical limitations surrounding traditional methods for PNN analyses and propose alternative explanations to these historical findings. Lastly, we embark on a global re-evaluation of the interpretations for PNN changes across brain regions, across species, and in relation to other neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - Metabolic scaling-the relationship between organismal metabolic rate (R) and body mass (M)-is an important property of life. In general, this relationship has been summarized by the scaling function, R = aMb. Both the scaling elevation (a) and the scaling exponent (b) have been shown to diverge among taxa and ecological groups. However, it is unclear whether this ecological divergence observed in unitary organisms also occurs at higher levels of biological organization, such as eusocial colonies. We used the published literature to assemble the estimates of the metabolic rate of active colonies and their mass for 51 species of ants, along with three ecologically important traits with available data: trophic level (herbivorous to predaceous), foraging coordination level (solitary to trunk trail) and caste polymorphism (polymorphic vs. monomorphic). Interspecific colony metabolic scaling was steeper (higher b) in species occupying higher trophic levels and in species with polymorphic versus monomorphic workers. Species occupying higher trophic levels also had a higher metabolic level (higher a). These findings are consistent with divergent selection on colony-level metabolic scaling. We conclude that the ecological dependence of metabolic scaling has evolved across levels of biological organization and should be explicitly considered by both metabolic and social evolution theories.

AB  - Seals (Phocidae) undergo an annual cycle of moulting that implies hair regeneration, and in the case of southern elephant seals, it also involves the superficial strata of the epidermis. Therefore, surviving the moulting period is crucial for their obligate and permanent ectoparasites. Throughout evolutionary time, sucking lice (Echinophtiriidae) have developed morphological, behavioural and ecological adaptations to cope with the amphibious lifestyle of their hosts. Lepidophthirus macrorhini, the Southern elephant seal louse species, faces the additional challenge of surviving attached to the host during the moulting period. Since lice live on the skin, L. macrorhini has developed a unique survival strategy by piercing the skin of their host, thus keeping them protected from moulting. During fieldwork in Patagonia and Antarctica, skin samples with lice within were collected for histological analysis to assess whether these parasites caused damage to the host. Lice generate an inflammatory process in the host's dermis, and these lesions could alter the normal chemical and mechanical protective properties of the skin facilitating secondary infections. Further studies that analyse the potential pathogens in those skin lesions are necessary to properly assess the real impact of ectoparasites on their host health.

AB  - In the skin-healing field, porcine models are regarded as a useful analogue for human skin due to their numerous anatomical and physiological similarities. Despite the widespread use of porcine models in skin healing studies, the initial origin, recruitment and transition of fibroblasts to matrix-secreting contractile myofibroblasts are not well defined for this model. In this review, we discuss the merit of the pig as an animal for studying myofibroblast origin, as well as the challenges associated with assessing their contributions to skin healing. Although a variety of wound types (incisional, partial thickness, full thickness, burns) have been investigated in pigs in attempts to mimic diverse injuries in humans, direct comparison of human healing profiles with regards to myofibroblasts shows evident differences. Following injury in porcine models, which often employ juvenile animals, myofibroblasts are described in the developing granulation tissue at 4 days, peaking at Days 7-14, and persisting at 60 days post-wounding, although variations are evident depending on the specific pig breed. In human wounds, the presence of myofibroblasts is variable and does not correlate with the age of the wound or clinical contraction. Our comparison of porcine myofibroblast-mediated healing processes with those in humans suggests that further validation of the pig model is essential. Moreover, we identify several limitations evident in experimental design that need to be better controlled, and standardisation of methodologies would be beneficial for the comparison and interpretation of results. In particular, we discuss anatomical location of the wounds, their size and depth, as well as the healing microenvironment (wet vs. moist vs. dry) in pigs and how this could influence myofibroblast recruitment. In summary, although a widespread model used in the skin healing field, further research is required to validate pigs as a useful analogue for human healing with regards to myofibroblasts.

AB  - Camelthorn, Alhagi maurorum Boiss, family Fabaceae has long been used in African folk medicine owing to its richness in pharmacologically active metabolites. The crude extract (CEAM), ethyl acetate fraction (EFAM) and n-butanol (BFAM) fraction of A. maurorum aerial parts were investigated for their total polyphenols and oral antiulcer activity using in-vitro and in-vivo models. The major phenolic compound was isolated from the polyphenol-rich EFAM fraction and identified by conventional and spectroscopic methods of analysis as isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside. Furthermore, standardization of EAFM using UPLC-PDA-UV quantified isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside as 262.91 0.57 g/mg of the fraction. Analysis of EFAM using UPLC-PDA-MS/MS revealed tentative identification of 25 polyphenolic compounds. EFAM exhibited the most potent free radical scavenging activity against DPPH, with an IC50 (27.73 +/- 1.85 mu g/mL) and an FRAP value of (176.60 +/- 5.21 mu M Trolox equivalent (TE)/mg fraction) in comparison with CEAM and BFAM. Acetic acid-induced oral ulcers in a rat model were used to evaluate the healing properties of A. maurorum aerial parts. EFAM significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) by 36.4% and 50.8%, respectively, in the ulcer tissues while, CEAM and BFAM exhibited lower activity at the same dose. In addition, EFAM led to a significant (p < 0.0001) rise in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell proliferation marker. A. maurorum exhibited a potent healing effect in acetic acid-induced oral ulcers in rats by mitigating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improving PCNA expression.

AB  - Increasingly, public discourse occurs on social media including about national parks, but how much of it is relevant to park management and what topics/events cause debate? Using a case study approach, we conducted a content and sentiment analysis of tweets about seven South African national parks (Table Mountain, Karoo, Addo Elephant, Pilanesberg, West Coast, Tsitsikamma and Golden Gate Highlands) posted over 14 months on Twitter to assess what topics were discussed for which parks, by whom, when, what emotions were expressed and how such information could be useful for management. Most of the discourse (70% of 10,292 tweets) related to management, including tweets about biodiversity (34%), tourism (27%), natural attractions (17%) as well as crime and safety (10%). Most Tweeters were South African (60%) with other Tweeters from other countries in Africa (4%), the USA (12%) or UK (7%). Although the 2% of accounts from news and conservation organisations had massive followings, most tweets were from individuals, were mainly positive and included emotions such as anticipation and trust. Peaks in tweets often related to specific events in the parks reported in the news. Our study revealed that despite issues with Twitter, such as geographic bias, shortcomings with search terms and short texts, park authorities could consider monitoring Twitter to better understand the interests and opinions of local and international communities. Managers could also use Twitter to monitor reactions to specific events in parks, disseminating information to stakeholders and responding to contentious issues.

AB  - Because the diet of many herbivorous insects is restricted to closely related taxa with similar chemistry, intercropping with diverse plant communities may reduce both pest populations and reliance on chemical pesticides in agroecosystems. We tested whether the effectiveness of intercropping against herbivorous insects depends on the phylogenetic relatedness of neighboring crops, using butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata) as a focal crop species in a series of different intercropping combinations. We found that increased phylogenetic divergence of neighboring plants could reduce abundance of herbivorous insects, but the effect was only detectable mid-season. In addition, we tested two hypothesized mechanisms for a negative association between phylogenetic distance of neighboring plants and reduced herbivore populations: one, we tested using Y-tube olfactometer and choice cage trials whether diverse volatile cues impede host-plant location by the dominant pest of butternut squash in our experiment, striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum. Two, we recorded predator and parasitoid abundance relative to crop phylodiversity to test whether diverse crops support larger natural-enemy populations that can better control pest species. Our results, however, did not support either hypothesis. Striped cucumber beetles preferentially oriented toward non-host-plant volatiles, and predator populations more often decreased with phylodiversity than increased. Thus, the mechanisms driving associations in the field between phylogenetic divergence and herbivore populations remain unclear.

AB  - Simple Summary Nowadays, there is great concern about the prevalence of multidrug resistant bacteria in food-producing animals since they are potential sources of transmission to humans. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of two antibiotics (oxytetracycline and enrofloxacin) treatments in pigs on resistant bacteria that are considered a threat to public health. This study highlights that the use of oxytetracycline or enrofloxacin in food-producing animals could select resistant bacteria in pig faeces. Special care should be taken to avoid faecal contamination of carcasses during slaughter. Nowadays, there is a great concern about the prevalence of multidrug resistant Enterococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae in food-producing animals. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of oxytetracycline or enrofloxacin treatment on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in pigs. A total of 26 piglets were received and distributed in three groups. Group 1 was treated with enrofloxacin (N = 12), group 2 with oxytetracycline (N = 10) and group 3 did not receive any treatment (control group) (N = 4). A higher number of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were recovered compared to E. faecalis. In the pigs treated with enrofloxacin, vancomycin resistant E. faecium was found in a higher percentage of animals than in the control group. ESBL-producing E. coli was not detected in rectal samples from control animals. However, it was detected in 17-20% of animals treated with oxytetracycline on days 6 to 17 and in 17-50% of the animals treated with enrofloxacin. Carbapenemase-producing E. coli was isolated in animals treated with oxytetracycline, but not in animals treated with enrofloxacin or in the control group. This study highlights that the use of oxytetracycline or enrofloxacin in food-producing animals could select ESBL and carbapenemase-producing E. coli. Further studies shall be needed to validate the results obtained, considering a more robust and extended experimental design.

AB  - During a scientific expedition including archaeologists, epigraphists and one zootechnician on the ancient caravan trail of the Nabataean period joining the site of Hegra to the oasis of Tayma' in Saudi Arabia, a systematic survey of the rock carvings was carried out in more than fifty sites, some never before described. In these engravings, the representation of the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius Linnaeus, 1758) has been widely preponderant. This contribution aims to achieve a zootechnical analysis of these representations, remarkable by the diversity of postures and the richness of what they tell us about the place of the dromedary in the ancient societies of the region, including Nabataean civilization. Notably, representations of gender, physiological state, management of animals, their use (packing, riding, wrestling), their individual condition (body condition, beauty criteria, coat colour) and their posture are discussed, particularly in "face-to-face" representations. In addition, the different names (zoonyms) of the dromedary present in the various inscriptions accompanying the engravings and written in different alphabetic scripts known as "North-Arabians" were listed. This is the crossed view between one zootechnician and epigraphists of today in front of representations elaborated by camel herders before they were artists.

AB  - With strict enforcement of the legal protection for Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in China, the elephant population has steadily increased from 146 elephants in 1976 to over 300 elephants in 2023. More elephants occur in highly fragmented and human-dominated landscapes, resulting in serious human-elephant conflicts (HEC). We investigated the temporal and spatial aspects of HEC in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, China, from 20112015 and 20162020. We analyzed the characteristics of crop raiding, property damage, and human injury and death by elephants. Then, we employed a multi-model ensemble forecasting framework to perform a risk assessment, and compared the changes in HEC hotspots to explore the factors influencing conflict. Our data revealed that 91,311 HEC compensations were recorded from 20112020 with a total compensation amount of 127.01 million yuan (17.40 million USD), 89.75% of which was crop compensation. Areas of risk in 20112015 and 20162020 were 2,505km(2) and 3,157km(2), respectively, with an increase in area of 26.01%. The HEC risk areas were mainly distributed in nature reserves and surrounding areas, and >65% of the risk areas were located in land-use types dominated by artificial planting. Distance to farmland, distance to sparse wood, and slope had the greatest relative importance in the risk model evaluation. The mitigation measures that we recommend include strengthening the monitoring system for Asian elephants in areas with current and potential HEC risks; improving compensation mechanisms, such as determining accurate annual premiums, establishing a shared loss compensation mechanism, and ensuring a fair, transparent, and timely compensation process; and proposing habitat conservation measures, such as restoring suitable habitats for Asian elephants, establishing ecological corridors between nature reserves, and creating a nature reserve system based on the Asian Elephant National Park to enhance the habitat of Asian elephants.

AB  - The response to prolonged mild stress is dichotomous, has been associated with depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment, and may be modulated by various factors such as sex or GABA-ergic transmission. We investigated in rats the sex-dependent effects of four doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in one week, followed by four weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), on behavioral parameters assessed in the weekly sucrose preference test and spontaneous locomotor activity, as well as in the behavioral battery (elevated-plus-maze test, resident-intruder test, three-chamber test and forced-swim test) conducted after 7 days of treatment with GL-II-73, a positive allosteric modulator selective for alpha 5 GABAA receptors (LPS/CUMS-GL-II-73), or with solvent (LPS/ CUMS-SOL), beginning after the third week of CUMS. At the end of stress, sucrose intake was significantly increased in LPS/CUMS-SOL compared to male controls (CRTL); in females, LPS/CUMS-GL-II-73 showed a significantly higher preference for sucrose than CTRL-SOL. In males, forced swimming time was significantly longer in LPS/CUMS-SOL compared to CTRL-SOL. Social play in the resident-intruder test was reduced in female LPS/CUMS-SOL, and GL-II-73 and GL-II-73 tended to reversed this stress effect. LPS/CUMS-GL-II-73 males showed no significant social recognition in the three-chamber test. Ex vivo tests showed an increase in Gabra5 gene expression in the ventral hippocampus in LPS/CUMS-GL-II-73 compared to CTRL-SOL. The subtle changes in the measured parameters suggest that the clinical benefit of positive modulation of alpha 5 GABAA receptors may result from focusing on the sex-specific niches of behavioral domains affected by prolonged stressors.

AB  - Leonotis leonurus (Lamiaceae) (Wild dagga/Lion's ear) is an important medicinal plant known for its psychoactive and medicinal properties and used to treat several ailments such as fever, influenza, asthma, epilepsy, snakebite, tapeworm, and skin diseases. Various biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anti-inflammatory effects, and modulation of immune cell functions, are exhibited by extracts and isolated compounds from L. leonurus. The purpose of this study was to examine the micromorphology, distribution, and chemical composition of the bioactive compounds in the trichomes of L. leonurus, using light and electron microscopy, along with histochemical analysis. Stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the presence of both glandular and non-glandular trichomes on the leaves and stems. The presence of peltate glandular trichomes, morphologically distinct glandular capitate trichome types (type I and II), and uniseriate, multicellular (two to five cells) pointed-shaped non-glandular trichomes were revealed using histochemistry and SEM. Trichomes on the stained leaves and stems revealed phenolics and alkaloids as the primary medicinal compounds. Secondary metabolites are essential for defense against herbivory, inhibiting and repelling microorganisms, and may also possess medicinal properties. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers updated insights into the key micromorphological characteristics of the secretory structures on the leaves and stems of L. leonurus, along with preliminary information on the composition of the secretions produced by these trichomes.

AB  - Genetically modified pigs are very useful thanks to their applications in basic research, biomedicine, and meat production. There are different methods for producing them, including cloning and the microinjection or electroporation of oocytes and zygotes. Easier techniques are being developed, such as lipofection, which involves the encapsulation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system into vesicles that are introduced into cells. We compared the embryo development and mutation rates associated with different conditions of lipofection treatment with the electroporation technique in zona-pellucida-intact porcine oocytes. We found that the lipofection treatment, once optimized, was as effective as the electroporation technique in terms of the embryo development and mutation rates. In addition, an increment in the concentration in the media of the liposomes-CRISPR/Cas9 system complexes had a detrimental effect on the embryo development parameters, which could indicate a possible toxic effect. The achievement of generating mutant embryos via lipofection without removing the zona pellucida could open up a new, easy, and cheap way of producing genetically modified pigs.
   The generation of genetically modified pigs has an important impact thanks its applications in basic research, biomedicine, and meat production. Cloning was the first technique used for this production, although easier and cheaper methods were developed, such as the microinjection, electroporation, or lipofection of oocytes and zygotes. In this study, we analyzed the production of genetically modified embryos via lipofection of zona-pellucida-intact oocytes using Lipofectamine (TM) CRISPRMAX (TM) Cas9 in comparison with the electroporation method. Two factors were evaluated: (i) the increment in the concentration of the lipofectamine-ribonucleoprotein complexes (LRNPC) (5% vs. 10%) and (ii) the concentration of ribonucleoprotein within the complexes (1xRNP vs. 2xRNP). We found that the increment in the concentration of the LRNPC had a detrimental effect on embryo development and a subsequent effect on the number of mutant embryos. The 5% group had a similar mutant blastocyst rate to the electroporation method (5.52% and 6.38%, respectively, p > 0.05). The increment in the concentration of the ribonucleoprotein inside the complexes had no effect on the blastocyst rate and mutation rate, with the mutant blastocyst rate being similar in both the 1xRNP and 2xRNP lipofection groups and the electroporation group (1.75%, 3.60%, and 3.57%, respectively, p > 0.05). Here, we showed that it is possible to produce knock-out embryos via lipofection of zona-pellucida-intact porcine oocytes with similar efficiencies as with electroporation, although more optimization is needed, mainly in terms of the use of more efficient vesicles for encapsulation with different compositions.

AB  - Regulation of fluid balance is pivotal during surgery and anesthesia and affects patient morbidity, mortality, and hospital length of stay. Retention of sodium and water is known to occur during surgery but the mechanisms are poorly defined. In this study, we explore how the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane influences renal function by affecting renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Our results demonstrate that sevoflurane induces renal sodium and water retention during pediatric anesthesia in association with elevated plasma concentration of renin but not arginine-vasopressin. The mechanisms are further explored in conscious and anesthetized ewes where we show that RSNA is increased by sevoflurane compared with when conscious. This is accompanied by renal sodium and water retention and decreased renal blood flow (RBF). Finally, we demonstrate that renal denervation normalizes renal excretory function and improves RBF during sevoflurane anesthesia in sheep. Taken together, this study describes a novel role of the renal sympathetic nerves in regulating renal function and blood flow during sevoflurane anesthesia.

AB  - The threats of infectious diseases such as African Swine Fever, Swine Erysipelas, and Blue Ear Disease to the pig farming industry have been increasing year by year. Producers often face difficulties in diagnosis, leading to the misuse of measures and the spread of epidemics. Addressing this, the proposed EVIT-YOLOv8 model integrates the EViT module to surpass ViT limitations and incorporates the CBAM module for enhanced image feature representation. Employing the GIOU loss function ensures better precision in capturing facial expression features, yielding an impressive Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 86.6% in differentiation tasks. Specifically, in African Swine Fever facial expression recognition, the model achieves a remarkable Precision of 85.2%, outperforming YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 models by 6%, 23.5%, and 7.3%, respectively. This provides pig producers with a precise diagnostic tool, mitigating the risk of epidemic spread due to misdiagnosis and facilitating effective prevention and control of infectious diseases.

AB  - Tissue engineering (TE) combines scaffolds, cells, and bioactive chemicals in order to create tissues. The objective is to restore or sustain tissue functionality and expedite the recovery of damaged tissues or organs in a controlled laboratory environment. This study aimed to evaluate the properties and biocompatibility of decellularized sheep kidney scaffolds (DKS) and to explore the differentiation potential of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) into renal cells. After decellularizing sheep kidneys using freeze-drying and detergent techniques, we conducted histological studies, DNA quantification, and ultrastructural evaluations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, to assay the feasibility and attachment of stem cells to the decellularized scaffolds, ADSCs were cultured on the scaffolds and subjected to the MTT assay. The expression of the pax2 gene was analyzed using real-time PCR to determine the differentiation of MSCs into kidney cells. DNA quantitation revealed a significant reduction in the quantity of DNA present in the scaffold tissue compared to the control kidney tissue. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the preservation of the decellularized scaffold's ultrastructure. Histological analysis demonstrated the complete removal of nuclear material from the scaffold. Additionally, Pax2 gene expression was significantly increased in ADSC cells cultured on the scaffold compared to the control group. The results demonstrate that the produced scaffolds are well-suited for regenerative medicine, exhibiting excellent biocompatibility and providing a conducive environment for the differentiation of ADSCs.

AB  - Aims Swine are a mixing vessel for the emergence of novel reassortant influenza A viruses (IAV). Interspecies transmission of swine-origin IAV poses a public health and pandemic risk. In the United States, the majority of zoonotic IAV transmission events have occurred in association with swine exposure at agricultural fairs. Accordingly, this human-animal interface necessitates mitigation strategies informed by understanding of interspecies transmission mechanisms in exhibition swine. Likewise, the diversity of IAV in swine can be a source for novel reassortant or mutated viruses that pose a risk to both swine and human health.Methods and Results In an effort to better understand those risks, here we investigated the epidemiology of IAV in exhibition swine and subsequent transmission to humans by performing phylogenetic analyses using full genome sequences from 272 IAV isolates collected from exhibition swine and 23 A(H3N2)v viruses from human hosts during 2013-2015. Sixty-seven fairs (24.2%) had at least one pig test positive for IAV with an overall estimated prevalence of 8.9% (95% CI: 8.3-9.6, Clopper-Pearson). Of the 19 genotypes found in swine, 5 were also identified in humans. There was a positive correlation between the number of human cases of a genotype and its prevalence in exhibition swine. Additionally, we demonstrated that A(H3N2)v viruses clustered tightly with exhibition swine viruses that were prevalent in the same year.Conclusions These data indicate that multiple genotypes of swine-lineage IAV have infected humans, and highly prevalent IAV genotypes in exhibition swine during a given year are also the strains detected most frequently in human cases of variant IAV. Continued surveillance and rapid characterization of IAVs in exhibition swine can facilitate timely phenotypic evaluation and matching of candidate vaccine strains to those viruses present at the human-animal interface which are most likely to spillover into humans.

AB  - Carcass and meat quality traits are critical in pig breeding and production. Estimating genetic parameters for these traits is a vital aspect of breeding engineering, as accurate genetic parameters are essential for estimating breeding values, predicting genetic progress, and optimizing breeding programs. This study was conducted on a population of 461 Yorkshire pigs from the same breeding farm, which were slaughtered to assess nine carcass traits and seven meat quality traits, followed by descriptive statistical analysis. Additionally, we estimated the genetic parameters of these traits using genomic information based on 50K chip data. The results indicated that sex significantly affected most carcass and meat quality traits. Carcass traits including carcass length indicators (h2 = mean 0.35), backfat thickness indicators (h2 = mean 0.36), eye muscle area (h2 = 0.28), and the number of rib pairs (h2 = 0.28) exhibited medium to high heritability. Carcass length indicators showed high genetic correlations with backfat thickness indicators (r = mean -0.49) and the number of rib pairs (r = mean 0.63), while high negative genetic correlation (r = -0.72) was noted between eye muscle area and the number of rib pairs. Meat quality traits also displayed medium to high heritability, expect for pH value measured within one hour post-slaughter (h2 = 0.12). Drip loss indicators had higher genetic correlations with pH (r = mean -0.73) than with meat color indicators (r = mean 0.22). These findings may provide a theoretical reference for genetic evaluation and breeding in the Yorkshire pig population.

AB  - Upon recognizing elicitors derived from herbivores, many plants activate specific defenses. Most of the elicitors identified thus far are from the oral secretions and egg-laying fluids of herbivores; in contrast, herbivore fecal excreta have been sparsely studied in this context. In this study, we identified elicitors in the frass of the striped stem borer (SSB; Chilo suppressalis) larvae using a combination of molecular and chemical analyses, bioactivity tests and insect performance bioassays. Treating rice plants with SSB frass or a solution composed of SSB frass and buffer elicited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades and the jasmonic acid (JA)-signaling pathway. Moreover, the treatment induced both the expression of defense-related genes and the production of defensive compounds, and enhanced the resistance of rice plants to SSB. Heating SSB frass solution did not affect its induction activity, but eliminating proteins and peptides from the solution by adding proteinase K impaired its activity. Additional chemical analyses and bioassays revealed that the rice phytocytokine, immune response peptide 1(IRP1), together with some of its derived peptides in SSB frass, induced the MPK cascades, JA biosynthesis, the expression of defense genes and the production of defensive compounds in rice. These results reveal an important role for the plant-derived fecal peptide phytocytokine IRP1 and some of its derived peptides in inducing defenses in rice against SSB.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of dried Salvia officinalis (SO) shrub leaves on nutrient degradability, ruminal in vitro fermentation, gas production (GP), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) productions. Dried and ground SO shrub leaves were included at 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% DM of a diet consisting of (per kg DM) 500 g concentrate feed mixture, 400 g berseem hay, and 100 g rice straw. The diet was incubated for 48 h. The asymptotic GP and the rate of GP changed linearly and quadratically (p < 0.01), with the highest GP observed at 1% inclusion of SO and then decreasing thereafter with greater inclusion (i.e., 1.5% and 2%), while CH4 production and its rate decreased linearly (p < 0.01) with all levels of SO inclusion. A linear increase in CO2 production and its rate was also found with an increasing level of SO inclusion in the diet (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the degradability of DM, NDF, and the concentration of total short-chain fatty acids and acetate changed linearly and quadratically, with the greatest being found at 1% SO inclusion and then steadily declining after (p < 0.01) with the 1.5% and 2% inclusion levels. Meanwhile, the propionate, NH3-N, and microbial crude protein levels showed similar trends, with the plateau found at 1% inclusion of SO, where there was no change in butyrate concentration. Moreover, the pH, metabolizable energy, and partitioning factor (PF24) also changed linearly and quadratically (p < 0.05), where the pH and PF24 were considerably reduced and ME increased with a 1% inclusion of SO (p < 0.05). In summary, SO at 1% inclusion in the diet showed the potential to improve gas production kinetics, nutrient degradability, and the ruminal fermentation profile, with a more significant reduction in ruminal CH4 production suggesting that SO at 1% could be included in the ruminant diet to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the production performance.

AB  - The trace element selenium (Se) plays a key role in development and various physiological processes, mainly through its transformation into selenoproteins. To investigate the developmental patterns of Se content and expression of selenoproteins, the liver and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of Duroc pigs were collected at 1, 21, 80, and 185 days of age (7 pigs each age) for the determination of Se content, mRNA expression of selenoproteins, and concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR or TXNRD), and selenoprotein P (SELP). The results showed that age significantly affected the expression of GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, TXNRD1, TXNRD2, TXNRD3, iodothyronine deiodinases 2 (DIO2), DIO3, SELF, SELH, SELM, SELP, SELS, SELW, and selenophosphate synthetase2 (SPS2) in the liver, as well as GPX3, GPX4, TXNRD1, TXNRD2, DIO2, DIO3, SELF, SELN, SELP, SELR, SELS, and SELW in the LD muscle of Duroc pigs. The concentrations of GPX, TrxR, and SELP showed an increasing trend with age, and they were positively correlated with Se content at 1, 21, and 185 days of age and negatively correlated at 80 days of age, both in the liver and LD muscle. The Se content decreased at the age of 80 days, especially in the LD muscle. In summary, our study revealed developmental changes in Se content and expression of selenoproteins in the liver and LD muscle of Duroc pigs at different growth stages, which provided a theoretical basis for further study of Se nutrition and functions of selenoproteins.

AB  - Simple Summary: Non-starch polysaccharides and phytate have been considered the most common antinutritional factors in feedstuffs, and there is no corresponding enzyme in animals. Our results showed that the multi-carbohydrase and phytase supplementation had a potent role in improving energy, amino acids, calcium, and phosphorus digestibility in fattening pigs regardless of dietary nutrient levels, thus increasing the deposition of calcium and phosphorus in bone and improving the growth rate and feed efficiency of fattening pigs. These findings have important implications for the application of multi-enzymes in fattening pigs to spare feed costs, reduce nutrient waste, and improve swine production efficiency.
   This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary multi-enzyme (multi-carbohydrase and phytase complex, MCPC) supplementation on digestibility, growth performance, bone mineralization, and carcass yield and traits in growing-finishing pigs fed diets with adequate or deficient net energy (NE), amino acids (AA), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels. A total of 576 crossbred [Duroc x (Landrace x Yorkshire)] barrows (similar to 25 kg) were fed one of the six diets till live weight approached 130 kg. Basal diets included a positive control (PC), negative control 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2), while another three diets were prepared by adding MCPC to the three basal diets. The final body weight was lower (p < 0.05) in NC2 than in NC1 and PC treatments, while overall feed intake and feed-gain ratio were higher (p < 0.05) in NC1 and NC2 than in PC treatment. The NC2 treatment showed lower (p < 0.05) carcass weight but higher (p < 0.05) lean meat percentage than the PC treatment. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of gross energy (GE), crude protein (CP) and AA was decreased (p < 0.05) or tended (p < 0.10) to decrease in NC1 and/or NC2 diets compared with a PC diet. MCPC supplementation improved (p < 0.05) AID of Ca, P and AA (Lys, Leu, Val, Phe, Gly, Tyr and Pro), apparent total-tract digestibility (ATTD) of GE, CP, bone strength, Ca, and P retention. In conclusion, MCPC supplementation improved nutrient digestibility, bone mineralization, and growth performance of fattening pigs, regardless of the nutritional level of the basal diet.

AB  - Ultraviolet filters (UV-filters) are specific chemicals that absorb and reflect UVA and UVB radiation from the sun. They are regularly used in sunscreens and in other personal care products (PCPs), and in products like plastics, adhesives, toys, or furniture finishes. This work develops and validates a new method to determine concentrations of UV- filters (BP-1, BP-2, BP-3, BP-6, BP-8, 4-OH-BP, THB, AVB) in human nail samples. Nails are easily available and are considered to be suitable indicators of cumulative and continued exposure to harmful chemicals. The treatment of nail samples includes microwave assisted digestion/extraction (MAE) in a methanolic solution of o-phosphoric acid (0.05 mol L-1) followed by analyte determination using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The analytes were separated in less than 10 min. The digestion procedure was optimized using multivariate techniques. Matrix-matched calibration with a pig hoof matrix was used for validating the method. A study of accuracy with spiked blank samples was also conducted. The calculated detection limits varied between 0.2 and 1.5 ng g(-1), and quantification limits between 1.0 and 5.0 ng g(-1). The trueness of the method was an estimation of the recovery, which was between 90.2% and 112.2%; with an estimated precision (relative standard deviation, % RSD) lower than 12.3% for all UV-filters.

AB  - The skin constitutes a protective barrier to external physical and chemical aggressions. Although it is constantly exposed to various xenobiotics, it is generally considered poorly permeable to them, as for example metal ions, becoming unfortunately an entry route of such substances. Metals may penetrate inside the skin inducing more or less local effects such as skin sensitization and potential metals diffusion into the bloodstream. The objective of the study was to investigate the percutaneous penetration of metals in vitro - ex vivo in Franz cell with intact as well damaged skin applying a road dust powder. Moreover, porcine and human skins were compared. This study demonstrated that, after the application of a road dust powder on the skin, metals can penetrate and permeate this cutaneous membrane. From this experimental analysis, in intact skin lead (Pb) achieved the highest skin absorption in both human and porcine skin, while skin absorption profile of cobalt (Co) was the lowest in human skin than the one in porcine model. The concentrations of Ni present in receiving solution were higher compared to other metals in all experiments performed. The present work, definitely shows that metals permeation through damaged skin is accelerated than intact skin, as a result of the weaker cutaneous barrier function. According to published data, pig skin appeared as a suitable model for human skin. Our results confirmed that skin absorption of metals can be relevant in environmental exposures.

AB  - Aging-induced neuroinflammation, also known as neuroinflammaging, plays a pivotal role in emotional disturbances, including depression and anxiety, in older individuals, thereby leading to cognitive dysfunction. Although numerous studies have focused on therapeutic strategies for cognitive impairment in older individuals, little research has been performed on treating its preceding emotional disturbances. Here, we examined whether Kampo formulas (kososan [KS], nobiletin-rich kososan [NKS], and hachimijiogan [HJG]) can ameliorate aging-induced emotional disturbances and neuroinflammation in mice. The depression-like behaviors observed in SAMP8 mice, relative to normally aging SAMR1 mice, were significantly prevented by treatment with Kampo formulas for 13 weeks. Western blot analysis revealed that hippocampal neuroinflammation was significantly abrogated by Kampo formulas. KS and NKS also significantly attenuated the hippocampal neuroinflammatory priming induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.33 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge in SAMP8 mice. Hippocampal 1L-1 beta, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly decreased in NKS-treated SAMP8 mice. KS and NKS showed significantly reduced tau accumulation in the brains of SAMP8 mice. RNA-sequencing revealed that each Kampo formula led to unique dynamics of hippocampal gene expression and appeared to abrogate hippocampal inflammatory responses. HJG significantly blocked the LPS-induced increase in serum IL-6 and MCP-1. These results suggest that Kampo formulas would be useful for treating aging-induced depression, in part by regulating neuroinflammatory pathways. This finding may pave the way for the development of therapeutic strategies for aging-related emotional disturbances, which may contribute to the prevention of cognitive dysfunction in older individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND Biological control plays a key role in reducing crop damage by Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), which cause huge yield losses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The mirid predator Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) preys heavily on these pests, with satisfying control levels in tomato greenhouses. Although N. tenuis is known to be attracted to volatiles of tomato plants infested by T. absoluta and whitefly, little is known about the specific attractive compounds and the effect of prey density on the predator response. RESULTS Y-tube olfactometer bioassays revealed that the attraction of N. tenuis to tomato volatiles was positively correlated with the density of T. absoluta infestation, unlike T. vaporariorum infestation. The predator was also attracted to volatiles of T. absoluta larval frass, but not to T. vaporariorum honeydew or T. absoluta sex pheromone. Among the herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that characterised the attractive plants infested with 20 T. absoluta larvae, olfactometer bioassays revealed that N. tenuis is attracted to the monoterpenes alpha-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, 3-carene, beta-phellandrene and beta-ocimene, whereas (E)-beta-caryophyllene was found to repel the predator. In dose-response bioassays, the five-component blend of the attractants elicited a relatively low attraction in the predator, and removal of beta-phellandrene from the blend enhanced the attraction of the predator to the resulting four-component blend, suggesting synergism among four monoterpenes. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that a four-component blend of alpha-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, 3-carene and beta-ocimene could be used as a kairomone-based lure to recruit the predator for the biological control of T. absoluta and T. vaporariorum.

AB  - This study took the case of the Jingshan pig farm and used a photobioreactor to test and screen the bacterial strains that could effectively promote the growth of microalgae. The algae-bacteria ratio, temperature and initial ammonia nitrogen concentration for wastewater treatment in the symbiotic algae-bacteria system were optimized and the efficacy of the system in the purification of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in the swine wastewater was determined. The optimal volume of swine wastewater dilution and the optimal fermentation time were investigated, providing theoretical and technical support for production practice. The main findings were as follows: In the symbiotic algae-bacteria system with nitrifying bacteria, the growth rate of Streptococcus subiculata was the fastest and the maximum biomass was 4.67 g.L-1; this was 2.43- and 5.36-fold greater than the combination of algae and COD-degrading bacteria, algae and composite bacteria and single microalgae, respectively. The optimized symbiotic algae-bacteria system was with an algae-bacteria ratio of 1:1, an initial ammonia nitrogen concentration of 350 mg.L-1 and a purification temperature of 30 degrees C; this combination achieved the highest efficiency for nitrogen and phosphorus removal from the pig wastewater and total biomass that was 5.13 times that obtained with the single microalgae system. During incubation, the sample with a dilution volume ratio of R = 0.5 had the best purification effect over three days of processing.

AB  - The production of plastic is still increasing globally, which has led to an increasing number of plastic particles in the environment. Nanoplastics (NPs) can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and induce neurotoxicity, but in-depth mechanism and effective protection strategies are lacking. Here, C57BL/6 J mice were treated with 60 & mu;g polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs, 80 nm) by intragastric administration for 42 days to establish NPs exposure model. We found that 80 nm PS-NPs could reach and cause neuronal damage in the hippocampus, and alter the expression of neuroplasticity-related molecules (5-HT, AChE, GABA, BDNF and CREB), and even affect the learning and memory ability of mice. Mechanistically, combined with the results of hippocampus transcriptome, gut microbiota 16 s ribosomal RNA and plasma metabolomics, we found that the gut-brain axis mediated circadian rhythm related pathways were involved in the neurotoxicity of NPs, especially Camk2g, Adcyap1 and Per1 may be the key genes. Both melatonin and probiotic can significantly reduce intestinal injury and restore the expression of circadian rhythm-related genes and neuroplasticity molecules, and the intervention effect of melatonin is more effective. Collectively, the results strongly suggest the gut-brain axis mediated hippocampal circadian rhythm changes involved in the neurotoxicity of PS-NPs. Melatonin or probiotics supplementation may have the application value in the prevention of neurotoxicity of PS-NPs.

AB  - The genus Xenanoetus Mahunka, 1969, only described by the hypopial stage, is characterised by an enlarged gnathosoma, the presence of double claws in legs I, II and III in addition to remarkably broadened femur and genu of legs I and II, particularly visible in lateral view. Only five species from this genus have been described and they are all from the northern hemisphere. Hypopi are generally found as phoretic on Sphaeroceridae flies and Hydrophilidae beetles. Until present, hypopi of the species Xenanoetus grandiceps have only been reported in Mongolia, described by Mahunka in 1973. Xenanoetus grandiceps is characterised by the presence of a pair of arches pointing anteriorly in the posterior part of the gnathosoma. Here we report for the first time X. grandiceps in Spain, and for the second time X. vestigialis. Both species were found in association with carcass remains, as phoretic on lesser dung flies (Sphaeroceridae), which were collected in a mixed deciduous forest near the Atlantic coast. Additional new information on morphological characteristics of these Xenanoetus species, as well as habitat requirements and biology are presented in this report.

AB  - Cadmium(Cd) is a toxic and carcinogenic heavy metal pollutant leading to serious damage in various organs. Ferroptosis and necrosis as inflammation-related cell death are involved in several diseases of nervous system. In the present study, 10 weaning piglets with similar weight for 6 weeks were randomly divided into two groups. The daily grain containing 0 mg and 20 mg/kg of Cd chloride was fed in 20-26 celcius environment, animals were sacrificed to collect cerebrum and cerebellum tissues after 40 days. Morphology and ultrastructure results were observed using HE and TEM. Moreover, molecular biological technologies western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression abundance of genes. Cerebrum and cerebellum injury was observed in Cd-exposed group, antioxidant capacity decreased significantly and oxidative stress increased; immunofluorescence, real-time quantification, and western blot results showed decreased necrosis genes and increased ferroptosis pathway genes abundance in cerebrum, whereas the results were reversed in cerebellum. These results indicated that Cd exposure can activated necrosis and ferroptosis pathways by increased oxidative stress, further resulting in cerebrum and cerebellum damage in pigs. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for early monitoring of Cd exposure in environment.

AB  - Milk foams are fragile objects, readily prepared for frothy cappuccinos and lattes using bovine milk. However, evolving consumer preferences driven by health, climate change, veganism, and sustainability have created a substantial demand for creating frothy beverages using plant-based milk alternatives or plant milks. In this contribution, we characterize maximum foam volume and half-lifetime as metrics for foamability and foam stability and drainage kinetics of two animal milks (cow and goat) and compared them to those of the six most popular, commercially available plant milks: almond, oat, soy, pea, coconut, and rice. We used three set-ups: an electric frother with cold (10 degrees C) and hot (65 degrees C) settings to emulate the real-life application of creating foam for cappuccinos, a commercial device called a dynamic foam analyzer or DFA and fizzics-scope, a bespoke device we built. Fizzics-scope visualizes foam creation, evolution, and destruction using an extended prism-based imaging system facilitating the capture of spatiotemporal variation in foam microstructure over a broader range of heights and liquid fractions. Among the chosen eight milks, oat produces the longest-lasting foams, and rice has the lowest amount and stability of foam. Using the hot settings, animal milks produce more foam volume using an electric frother than the top three plant milks in terms of foamability (oat, pea, and soy). Using the cold settings, oat, soy, and almond outperform cow milk in terms of foam volume and lifetime for foams made with the frother and sparging. Most plant milks have higher viscosity due to added polysaccharide thickeners, and in some, lecithin and saponin can supplement globular proteins as emulsifiers. Our studies combining foam creation by frothing or sparging with imaging protocols to track global foam volume and local bubble size changes present opportunities for contrasting the physicochemical properties and functional attributes of animal and plant-based milk and ingredients for engineering better alternatives.
   Maximum volume and half-life time measure foamability and foam stability. Soy outperforms cow among cold milk foams.

AB  - Simple Summary Improving reproductive traits, including increased fertility and prolificacy, is important for efficiency behind production, but difficult to achieve due to the low heritability for those traits, their dependence on the environment, as well as maintenance and nutrition. It is possible to achieve good results in reproduction using various methods of improving the characteristics of pig reproduction, such as breeding work, crossbreeding, selection programmes, optimisation of the rearing environment, and maternal effects. The litter of sow origin is one of the features worth using in practice, as it can have a significant impact on improving the fertility, prolificacy, and reproductive longevity of sows and is therefore a factor analysed in the work presented. Improvement of lowly heritable traits is difficult, efforts must be made to take full advantage of the available information sources to improve them. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the size of the litter in which the sow was born on her lifetime reproductive performance. Data on 22,683 litters were used to analyse the lifetime reproductive performance of 5623 Polish Large White sows. The sows from small litters (<= 9) were on average the oldest at first farrowing, had the shortest herd life, the smallest number of litters, and the smallest sized litters (p <= 0.01). A positive relationship was established between the mean number of offspring born per litter and size of the litter in which the sow was born (p <= 0.01). For a sow to produce at least seven piglets per 100 days of reproduction, gilts from litters of at least 12 piglets should be selected for breeding.

AB  - Evidence suggests that memory consolidation is facilitated by sleep, both through the strengthening of existing memories and by extracting regularities embedded in those memories. We previously observed that one sleep stage, Slow-Wave sleep (SWS), is particularly involved in the extraction of temporal regularities. We suggested that this attribute can naturally stem from the time-compressed memory replay known to occur in the hippocampus during SWS. A prediction coming out of this "temporal scaffolding" hypothesis is that sleep would be especially influential on extraction of temporal regularities when the time gap between the events constituting the regularities is shortish. In this study, we tested this prediction. Eighty-three participants performed a cognitive task in which hidden temporal regularities of varying time gaps were embedded. Detecting these regularities could significantly improve performance. Participants performed the task in two sessions with an interval filled with either wake or sleep in between. We found that sleep improved performance across all time gaps and that the longer the gap had been, the smaller was the improvement across both sleep and wake. No interaction between sleep and gap size was observed; however, unlike sleeping participants, awake participants did not exhibit any further performance improvement for the long gaps following the interval. In addition, across all participants, performance for the long gaps was associated with the development of conscious awareness to the regularities. We discuss these results in light of the temporal scaffolding hypothesis and suggest future directions to further elucidate the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Chronic intrauterine hypoxia is a significant pregnancy complication impacting fetal heart growth, metabolism, and mitochondrial function, contributing to cardiovascular programming of the offspring. PGC1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha) is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. We investigated the effects of hypoxia on PGC1 alpha expression following exposure at different gestational ages. Time-mated pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to normoxia (NMX, 21% O-2) or hypoxia (HPX, 10.5% O-2) at either 25-day (early-onset) or 50-day (late-onset) gestation, and all fetuses were extracted at term (term = similar to 65-day gestation). Expression of nuclear PGC1 alpha, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) was measured, along with SIRT3 activity and mitochondrial acetylation of heart ventricles of male and female fetuses. Early-onset hypoxia increased (P<0.05) fetal cardiac nuclear PGC1 alpha and had no effect on mitochondrial acetylation of either growth-restricted males or females. Late-onset hypoxia had either no effect or decreased (P<0.05) PCC1 alpha expression in males and females, respectively, but increased (P<0.05) mitochondrial acetylation in both sexes. Hypoxia had variable effects on expression of SIRT1, AMPK, SIRT3, and SIRT3 activity depending on the sex. The capacity of the fetal heart to respond to hypoxia differs depending on the gestational age of exposure and sex of the fetus. Further, the effects of late-onset hypoxia on fetal heart function impose a greater risk to male than female fetuses, which has implications toward cardiovascular programming effects of the offspring.

AB  - Object detection is a technique used to localize and classify objects in an image or a video sequence. It is an emerging topic of research in the field of computer vision. However, detections in a video are affected by sensor-specific challenges. A convolutional neural network-based You Only Look Once, version 3 (YOLOv3) object detection algorithm was used to get optimized computation time and accuracy. In the proposed methodology, the YOLOv3 architecture extracted significant features from both the visible and thermal imaging domains, and an adaptive fusion of both domains was performed to determine the dominant imaging domain and provide robust detections. The resulting YOLOv3 detections included the bounding box coordinates, confidence score, and class from each imaging domain, which were fused implicitly into a single plane. The sensor domain having the maximum number of object detections was chosen as the reference to be compared with the other domain for the adaptive fusion process. After fusion, the algorithm removed redundancy using adaptive intersection over union thresholding. The mean average precision result obtained from the fusion algorithm was 44.25%. A comparative study was also carried out between pre-trained common objects in context weights and custom CAMEL dataset weights; it showed the significance of using adaptive fusion in challenging situations such as nighttime, shadow, varying illumination, moving camera, and crowd.

AB  - Objective The objective of this work was to anatomically locate the urethral orifice in female minipigs and describe the use of video laryngoscopes in urethral catheterization. Methods Urethral catheterization guided by a video laryngoscope was attempted in 16 adult female Bama minipigs. The anatomical location of urethral orifices, operating time and complications (mucosal edema and bleeding in the vaginal vestibule, and the numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) in mid-stream urine samples) were recorded. Results The anatomical location of the urethral orifice: the depth of the urethral orifice in female Bama minipigs was 4.2 +/- 1.2 cm; all the urethral orifices were covered by mucosal folds of the vaginal vestibule. In the supine position, the orifice of the urethra at 9-12 and 1-3 o'clock accounted for 6.25%, 6.25%, 18.75%, 50%, 12.5%, 6.25% and 6.25%, respectively. All animals were successfully catheterized and the operating time was 9.0 (6.0-12.8) min. Complications: no bleeding in the vaginal vestibule was observed; the incidence of mucosal edema was 12.5%, all of which were mild; of urine samples collected 1 h after catheterization, 12.5% were found to contain RBCs and no RBCs were detected 6 h after catheterization; no WBCs were detected 1 h or 6 h after catheterization. Conclusions The urethral orifice of female minipigs was located deep in the vagina at variable clock directions and was unexceptionally covered by mucosal folds. Applying a video laryngoscope in urethral catheterization allowed quick and accurate exposure of the urethral orifice and minimal operational injury in female minipigs.

AB  - Both obesity and high fat diets (HFD) have been associated with an increase in inflammatory gene expression within the brain. Microglia play an important role in early cortical development and may be responsive to HFD, particularly during sensitive windows, such as adolescence. We hypothesized that HFD during adolescence would increase proinflammatory gene expression in microglia at baseline and potentiate the microglial stress response. Two stressors were examined, a physiological stressor [lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IP] and a psychological stressor [15 min restraint (RST)]. From 3 to 7 weeks of age, male and female mice were fed standard control diet (SC, 20% energy from fat) or HFD (60% energy from fat). On P49, 1 h before sacrifice, mice were randomly assigned to either stressor exposure or control conditions. Microglia from the frontal cortex were enriched using a Percoll density gradient and isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by RNA expression analysis of 30 genes (27 target genes, three housekeeping genes) using Fluidigm, a medium throughput qPCR platform. We found that adolescent HFD induced sex-specific transcriptional response in cortical microglia, both at baseline and in response to a stressor. Contrary to our hypothesis, adolescent HFD did not potentiate the transcriptional response to stressors in males, but rather in some cases, resulted in a blunted or absent response to the stressor. This was most apparent in males treated with LPS. However, in females, potentiation of the LPS response was observed for select proinflammatory genes, including Tnfa and Socs3. Further, HFD increased the expression of Itgam, Ikbkb, and Apoe in cortical microglia of both sexes, while adrenergic receptor expression (Adrb1 and Adra2a) was changed in response to stressor exposure with no effect of diet. These data identify classes of genes that are uniquely affected by adolescent exposure to HFD and different stressor modalities in males and females.

AB  - Emissions of ammonia and methane from agriculture caused by microbes in manure are an increasing challenge to sustainable agriculture. We screened several commercially available polyphenols, phenolic compounds, and polyphenol-rich extracts for their ability to inhibit the production of ammonia and mitigate methane emissions in pig manure in the absence and presence of sodium fluoride (NaF) using a short-term high-throughput set-up. Tested compounds were chlorogenic acid, lignosulfonic acid, lignin, chitosan, green tea extract, and chestnut tannins. Green tea extract, at a concentration of 8.5 mg/ml with 1 mM NaF, reduced total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in pig manure by 72%, while methane emissions were lowered by 95% at an extract concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The ability of four extracts of plant waste (spent coffee grounds, noble fir needles, shea meal, and rapeseed press cakes) to mitigate ammonia production and methanogenesis in pig manure was also investigated. Adding 7.0 +/- 0.7 mg/ml of extract from shea meal, noble fir, or rapeseed press cake, or 3.2 mg/ml of coffee ground extract reduced TAN production in manure by approximately 50%. Shea meal and noble fir had the largest effect on methane emissions, with reductions of approximately 60%. Gallocatechin-and epigallocatechin-rich extracts appeared to be especially potent for the inhibition of methane emissions, while ammonia production could be inhibited by a variety of tannins. Based on the current work, we conclude that extracts from certain plants have the potential for use in sustainable manure management to reduce ammonia and methane emissions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disease that affects the health of both the pregnant women and the fetus during pregnancy. Agonistic autoantibodies to the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1-AA) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of PE. This study aimed to determine the effects of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and its analogue AVE0991 on AT1-AA-induced PE model. Pregnant mice were divided into five groups: the normal pregnant group, AT1-AA- induced preeclampsia group, and AT1-AA-induced preeclampsia group treated with Losartan, Ang 1-7, and AVE0991, respectively. AT1-AA-induced PE model was established on gestational day 13 by tail intravenous injection of purified AT1-AA polyclonal antibody from serum of guinea pigs. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine albumin and urinary creatinine were measured on day 18 of pregnancy. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured from gestational day 13 to day 18. Renal structure changes were observed via light and electron microscopy. Compared with the normal pregnant group (NP group), AT1-AA-induced preeclampsia group (PE group) exhibited elevated blood pressure and proteinuria, consistent with the characteristics of PE. Ang 1-7 or AVE0991 treatment decreased blood pressure without showing renoprotective effects.

AB  - We present the characterisation and distribution of organic matter (OM) within the sea surface microlayer (SML) and underlying water (ULW) collected in October 2015 at nine stations in the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Gda nsk, encompassing the Vistula River plume. The salinity of > 7 throughout the transect indicated Vistula plume was possibly displaced westward by the preceding northerly and easterly winds between 5.7 and 10.7 ms-1 during the sampling cam-paign. Spectral analysis pointed to the highest contribution of aromatic and high molecular weight molecules (lowest spectral slope (SR) ratios and highest absorption coefficient at 254 nm (aCDOM(254)) at the first two stations near the river mouth, demonstrating a very limited influence of the river plume. Concentrations of surface-active organic substances (SAS) ranged from 0.28 to 0.60 mg L -1 in eq. Triton-X-100 in SML, and from 0.22 to 0.47 mg L -1 in eq. Triton -X-100 in the ULW, while POC concentrations ranged from 0.27 to 0.84 mg L -1 in SML and from 0.20 to 0.37 mg L -1 in ULW. Enrichment of SAS and POC detected at the highest wind speeds indicates rapid SML recovery by OM transported from the ULW. Low lipids to POC contribution, on average 5% and 7% in SML and ULW respectively, points to eutrophic conditions. Statistically significant negative correlation between SR and the Lipid:PIG ratio in SML and ULW suggests the production of lower molecular weight OM by phytoplankton living under favourable envi-ronmental conditions. Accumulation of lipid reserves triacylglycerols (TG) in the SML indicates more stressful plankton growth conditions compared to ULW.(c) 2022 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - To assess the effects of a time-restricted feeding (TRF) regimen on meat quality of pigs exposed to high ambient temperature, a two-month feeding and heat treatment (HT) trial was conducted using a 2 x 2 factorial design. A total of 24 growing pigs (11.0 +/- 1.9 kg) were randomly divided into four groups: thermal neutral group (NT, 24 +/- 3 degrees C), HT group (exposed to a high temperature at 35 +/- 2 degrees C from 11:00 to 15:00), TRF group and HT + TRF group (HT and TRF co-treatment group, n = 6 for each group). Pigs in TRF groups got access to feed within 5 h from 9:00 to14:00, while the others were fed at 6:00, 11:30, and 16:00. All pigs received the same diet during the trail. The results showed that HT increased the drip loss, shear force, lightness, and malondialdehyde production in Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle. TRF reversely reduced the shear force and drip loss, accompanied by decreased intramuscular fat and increased moisture content. Enhanced fiber transformation from type 1 to type 2b and down-regulated expression of muscle growth-related genes were observed by HT, while TRF suppressed the fiber transformation and expression of muscle atrophy-related genes. Furthermore, TRF restored the diminished protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 in LTL muscle by chronic HT. Accumulation of HSP70 in muscle of HT group was reduced by treatment of TRF. HT declined the expression of vital genes involved in fatty acids poly-desaturation and the proportion of (polyunsaturated fatty acids) PUFAs, mainly omega-6 in LTL muscle, while TRF group promoted the expression of poly-desaturation pathway and displayed the highest proportion of PUFAs. These results demonstrated that TRF relieved the chronic high temperature affected meat quality by the restored expression of Nrf2/HO-1 anti-oxidative cascade, modified muscle fiber composition, and enriched PUFAs in LTL muscle.

AB  - The recognition of pig cough sound is a prerequisite for early warning of respiratory diseases in pig houses, which is essential for detecting animal welfare and predicting productivity. With respect to pig cough recognition, it is a highly crucial step to create representative pig sound characteristics. To this end, this paper proposed a feature fusion method by combining acoustic and deep features from audio segments. First, a set of acoustic features from different domains were extracted from sound signals, and recursive feature elimination based on random forest (RF-RFE) was adopted to conduct feature selection. Second, time-frequency representations (TFRs) involving constant-Q transform (CQT) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) were employed to extract visual features from a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Finally, the ensemble of the two kinds of features was fed into support vector machine (SVM) by early fusion to identify pig cough sounds. This work investigated the performance of the proposed acoustic and deep features fusion, which achieved 97.35% accuracy for pig cough recognition. The results provide further evidence for the effectiveness of combining acoustic and deep spectrum features as a robust feature representation for pig cough recognition.

AB  - Here we present ICARUS, a web server to enable users without experience in R to undertake single cell RNA-seq analysis. The focal point of ICARUS is its intuitive tutorial-style user interface, designed to guide logical navigation through the multitude of pre-processing, analysis and visualization steps. ICARUS is easily accessible through a dedicated web server (https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq. cloud.edu.au/) and avoids installation of software on the user's computer. Notable features include the facility to apply quality control thresholds and adjust dimensionality reduction and cell clustering parameters. Data is visualized through 2D/3D UMAP and t-SNE plots and may be curated to remove potential confounders such as cell cycle heterogeneity. ICARUS offers flexible differential expression analysis with user-defined cell groups and gene set enrichment analysis to identify likely affected biological pathways. Eleven organisms including human, dog, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, yeast, cattle, chicken and pig are currently supported. Visualization of multimodal data including those generated by CITE-seq and the 10X Genomics Multiome kit is included. ICARUS incorporates a function to save the current state of analysis avoiding computationally intensive steps during repeat analysis. The complete analysis of a typical single cell RNA-seq dataset by inexperienced users may be achieved in 1-2 h.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the global pig industry. Host microRNAs directly target viral gene regions to exert their disease-fighting effects. PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection upregulates miR-361-3p expression; however, it is unclear whether it can exert inhibitory effects by directly targeting viral genes. Bioinformatic and experimental findings revealed that miR-361-3p inhibited PRRSV replication by directly targeting the PRRSV ORF1b and ORF1a loci. Intramuscular injection of pcDNA3.1-pri-miR-361 verified the expression of miR-361-3p in mammals. In summary, miR-361-3p plays an important role in infection and may be a promising therapeutic target for PRRS, providing insights into possible drug therapies.

AB  - It is urgent to design a low-cost electrocatalyst with high activity to enhance the efficiency of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is limited by the slow four-electron transfer kinetics process. Nevertheless, traditional synthetic methods, including calcination and solvothermal, of the electrocatalysts are high-cost, low-yield, and energy-hogging, which limits their industrial application. Herein, an ambient fast synthetic method is developed to prepare terrace-like Fe/Co bimetal-organic framework (TFC-MOF) electrocatalyst materials in gram scale in 1 h. The method in this paper is designable based on coordination chemistry. Fe and Co ions can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) to form a 2D-MOF structure. Structural characterizations, including SEM, TEM, and XRD are conducted to verify that the TFC-MOF is a terrace-like layered structure with uniform-sized mesoporous, which reduces the adsorption steric hindrance and facilitates the mass and electron transfer efficiency of OER. The TFC-MOF shows low overpotential, 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 49.9 mV dec(-1), in an alkaline solution. This work provides a planar coordination strategy to synthesize 2D-MOF OER electrocatalyst on a large scale with low cost and low energy consumption, which will promote its practical OER applications.

AB  - Background Cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.) can be severe pests of Brassica crops such as Chinese cabbage, Pak choi (Brassica rapa) or cabbages (B. oleracea). Eggs of Pieris spp. can induce a hypersensitive response-like (HR-like) cell death which reduces egg survival in the wild black mustard (B. nigra). Unravelling the genetic basis of this egg-killing trait in Brassica crops could improve crop resistance to herbivory, reducing major crop losses and pesticides use. Here we investigated the genetic architecture of a HR-like cell death induced by P. brassicae eggs in B. rapa. Results A germplasm screening of 56 B. rapa accessions, representing the genetic and geographical diversity of a B. rapa core collection, showed phenotypic variation for cell death. An image-based phenotyping protocol was developed to accurately measure size of HR-like cell death and was then used to identify two accessions that consistently showed weak (R-o-18) or strong cell death response (L58). Screening of 160 RILs derived from these two accessions resulted in three novel QTLs for Pieris brassicae-induced cell death on chromosomes A02 (Pbc1), A03 (Pbc2), and A06 (Pbc3). The three QTLs Pbc1-3 contain cell surface receptors, intracellular receptors and other genes involved in plant immunity processes, such as ROS accumulation and cell death formation. Synteny analysis with A. thaliana suggested that Pbc1 and Pbc2 are novel QTLs associated with this trait, while Pbc3 also contains an ortholog of LecRK-I.1, a gene of A. thaliana previously associated with cell death induced by a P. brassicae egg extract. Conclusions This study provides the first genomic regions associated with the Pieris egg-induced HR-like cell death in a Brassica crop species. It is a step closer towards unravelling the genetic basis of an egg-killing crop resistance trait, paving the way for breeders to further fine-map and validate candidate genes.

AB  - BackgroundDepression is a global health concern characterized by high incidence, disability, and disease burden. Neuroimmunity, through the secretion of inflammatory mediators and mediation of neuroinflammation, plays a significant role in depression's pathogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.MethodsIn this pioneering study, we employed a comprehensive multi-omics approach, integrating 2-DE proteomics, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, to investigate the hippocampal molecular profiles of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune inflammation-related depression. This innovative approach aimed to explore the potential pathogenesis of depression by systematically integrating data across multiple molecular layers.ResultsCompared to the control group, we identified 81 differential proteins, 44 differential metabolites, and 4 differential mRNAs in LPS-treated mice. Integrated analysis of these multidimensional data revealed that purine metabolism and glutamate metabolism are the most significantly altered molecular pathways in LPS-induced depression. Additionally, we constructed the corresponding compound-reaction-enzyme-gene regulatory network.ConclusionThis study suggests that purine metabolism and glutamate metabolism may be the underlying mechanisms by which neuroinflammation regulates depression-like behaviors. Our findings confirm the important role of immune inflammation in depression and provide a new clue for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder. Notably, the multi-omics approach employed in this study represents a pioneering effort in the field, providing unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying depression.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) leads to localized cardiac ischemia and can be fatal if untreated. Despite being treatable, the threat of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury remains high. Mitochondria are central to both propagation and mitigation of IR injury, and cardiac mitochondria are categorized into two major subtypes-subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria (SSM and IFM, respectively). We hypothesized that, in our pre-clinical porcine model of AMI, SSM and IFM are differentially affected by reperfusion. AMI was induced in female pigs by balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion, animals were euthanized. Cardiac SSM and IFM from the affected ischemic area and a nearby non-ischemic area were isolated to compare mitochondrial function using substrates targeting mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and II. Despite detecting overall significant differences in mitochondrial function including yield, mitochondrial S3 and S4 respirations, and calcium retention, consistent individual functional differences in the two mitochondrial subpopulations were not observed, both between the two mitochondrial subtypes, as well as between the ischemic and non-ischemic tissue. Nonetheless, this study describes the mitochondrial subtype response within the initial few hours of reperfusion in a clinically relevant model of AMI, which provides valuable information needed to develop novel mitochondrially targeted therapies for AMI.

AB  - Water scarcity is the most significant barrier to agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions. Deficit irrigation is an effective solution for managing agricultural water in these regions. The use of additives such as vermicompost (VC) to improve soil characteristics and increase yield is a popular practice. Despite this, there is still a lack of understanding of the interaction between irrigation water and VC on various crops. This study aimed to investigate the interaction effect of irrigation water and VC on greenhouse cucumber yield, yield components, quality, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). The trials were done in a split-plot design in three replicates in a semi-arid region of southeastern Iran in 2018 and 2019. Three levels of VC in the experiments, i.e., 10 (V-1), 15 (V-2), and 20 t/hm(2) (V-3), and three levels of irrigation water, i.e., 50% 75% (I-2), and 100% (I-3) of crop water requirement were used. The results showed that the amount of irrigation water, VC, and their interaction significantly affected cucumber yield, yield components, quality, and IWUE in both years. Reducing the amount of irrigation water and VC application rates reduced the weight, diameter, length, and cucumber yield. The maximum yield (175 t/hm(2)) was recorded in full irrigation using 20 t/hm(2) of VC, while the minimum yield (98 t/hm(2)) was found in I1V1 treatment. The maximum and minimum values of IWUE were recorded for I1V3 and I3V1 treatments as 36.07 and 19.93 kg/(m(3)center dot hm(2)), respectively. Moreover, reducing irrigation amount decreased chlorophyll a and b, but increased vitamin C. However, the maximum carbohydrate and protein contents were obtained in mild water-stressed conditions (I-2). Although adding VC positively influenced the value of quality traits, no significant difference was observed between V-2 and V-3 treatments. Based on the results, adding VC under full irrigation conditions leads to enhanced yield and IWUE. However, in the case of applying deficit irrigation, adding VC up to a certain level (15 t/hm(2)) increases yield and IWUE, after which the yield begins to decline. Because of the salinity of VC, using a suitable amount of it is a key point to maximize IWUE and yield when applying a deficit irrigation regime.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress imposes a high burden on domestic animals' productive and reproductive performance. Due to the long hot summer, drought, and shortage of green fodders, camels raised in the desert suffer a lot of reproductive inefficiencies. This animal represents one of the main wealth sources for the desert inhabitants. Several fertility disorders have been discovered, leading to frequent breeding without pregnancy. This study aimed at exploring blood metabolites such as metabolic and reproductive hormones, cytokines, and antioxidants to be monitored as bio-indictors for subfertility in female camels. The results confirmed that none of the tested metabolic hormones and glucose revealed differences among fertile and subfertile females. However, FSH, inhibin, IL-ss, nitrous oxide, and glutathione revealed remarkable differences between fertile and subfertile females, which would be reliable tools to predict subfertility statuses in this animal. IL-ss revealed higher levels in the cases with genital inflammations. The normal profiles in control females revealed the highest FSH, and the lowest inhibin were vice versa in all subfertile females. Nonetheless, nitrous oxide and glutathione would also be reliable bio-indicators for judging the fertility status. The prevailing hot climate imposes heavy burdens on the productivity of the camel, goat, and sheep herds raised in the Gulf desert. Due to the lack of a reliable indicator for the various subfertility statuses in camel females, this study aimed to investigate the expression of inhibin, TGF alpha, ILss, FSH, sex and metabolic hormones, and antioxidants for the fertility status in camel females. Eighty-two subfertile and five fertile females were admitted to the university clinic with the complaint of repeat breeding with failed conception. The animal's genital tracts were examined for reproductive soundness. Blood samples were withdrawn for hormonal, cytokines, and antioxidants determinations. Subfertile females were categorized into six groups; endometritis (EN, 28), inactive ovaries (IO, 20), ovarian hydrobursitis (BU, 19), vaginal adhesions (VA, 7), salpingitis (SA, 4), and cervicitis (CE, 4). Results revealed a significant increase in inhibin in all groups compared to control (68.2, 66.4, 61.8. 58.8, 58.3, 55.8, and 36 pg/mL, in CE, VA, IO, BU, EN, SA, and CON, respectively). TGF alpha, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and progesterone were not different among groups, whereas IL-ss differed among groups. FSH, estradiol, nitrous oxide, and glutathione were higher in CON compared with other groups. In conclusion, reproductive failures in camel females are reflected in the imbalances of endocrine, cytokines, and antioxidants bio-indicators.

AB  - Pork meat in Italy is one of the largest agri-food chains in Italy. In the swine production chain, slaughter plays an important role, because it has an impact on animal welfare, food safety and the sustainability of the agri-food chain. These companies also deal with pigs destined for typical Denomination of Origin products and therefore play an important role in the production chain of typical products and in the field of EU agricultural policy. In this context, the research aims to analyze the economic sustainability of the major pig slaughter firms in Italy, through data analysis of the annual account statement (AAS) on a sample of eight companies analyzed over a ten-year historical series. Financial ratios and margins (FRM) analysis is applied in the research. FRM analysis shows that firms have the largest absorption of financial resources in the net working capital cycle. The research highlights the high incidence of raw materials in companies in the sector. Consequently, the profit margins of the companies in the sample are modest and in some cases are lower than the cost of debt, suggesting a moderate capacity to attract capital. This result appears as a negative signal of the economic sustainability of the companies in the sector. The research, now limited to a small number of large companies, opens a line of research that can be developed by expanding the sample to small and medium-sized enterprises of the chain of Denomination of Origin hams in Italy to suggest improvement interventions, in particular for rural or marginal areas of production.

AB  - Nodule bacteria (rhizobia) represent a suitable model to address a range of fundamental genetic problems, including the impacts of natural selection on the evolution of symbiotic microorganisms. Rhizobia possess multipartite genomes in which symbiotically specialized (sym) genes differ from core genes in their natural histories. Diversification of sym genes is responsible for rhizobia microevolution, which depends on host-induced natural selection. By contrast, diversification of core genes is responsible for rhizobia speciation, which occurs under the impacts of still unknown selective factors. In this paper, we demonstrate that in goat's rue rhizobia (Neorhizobium galegae) populations collected at North Caucasus, representing two host-specific biovars orientalis and officianalis (N-2-fixing symbionts of Galega orientalis and G. officinalis), the evolutionary mechanisms are different for core and sym genes. In both N. galegae biovars, core genes are more polymorphic than sym genes. In bv. orientalis, the evolution of core genes occurs under the impacts of driving selection (dN/dS > 1), while the evolution of sym genes is close to neutral (dN/dS approximate to 1). In bv. officinalis, the evolution of core genes is neutral, while for sym genes, it is dependent on purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). A marked phylogenetic congruence of core and sym genes revealed using ANI analysis may be due to a low intensity of gene transfer within and between N. galegae biovars. Polymorphism in both gene groups and the impacts of driving selection on core gene evolution are more pronounced in bv. orientalis than in bv. officianalis, reflecting the diversities of their respective host plant species. In bv. orientalis, a highly significant (P-0 < 0.001) positive correlation is revealed between the p-distance and dN/dS values for core genes, while in bv. officinalis, this correlation is of low significance (0.05 < P-0 < 0.10). For sym genes, the correlation between p-distance and dN/dS values is negative in bv. officinalis but is not revealed in bv. orientalis. These data, along with the functional annotation of core genes implemented using Gene Ontology tools, suggest that the evolution of bv. officinalis is based mostly on adaptation for in planta niches while in bv. orientalis, evolution presumably depends on adaptation for soil niches. New insights into the tradeoff between natural selection and genetic diversity are presented, suggesting that gene nucleotide polymorphism may be extended by driving selection only in ecologically versatile organisms capable of supporting a broad spectrum of gene alleles in their gene pools.

AB  - As the aging population increases, cognitive impairment is emerging as a growing health issue worldwide. Low selenium status has been reported to correlate with cognitive decline in older adults. Nonetheless, the impact of prolonged selenium deficiency on cognitive function in adult mice and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this research, male C57BL/6 J mice were given either a normal diet (0.2 mg/kg Se) or a selenium-deficient diet (0.02 mg/kg Se) for 24 weeks to evaluate the impact of long-term selenium insufficiency on their cognitive abilities. We performed hippocampus transcriptome sequencing, real-time PCR, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, and untargeted brain metabolomics to uncover the underlying regulatory mechanism. We found that chronic selenium deficiency impaired the capabilities of object recognition, spatial memory, and self-caring in mice, and disrupted the expression of key genes related to cognitive behavior, dendrite morphogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, prolonged selenium deficiency compromised neurite integrity, decreased dendritic spine density, impaired synaptic ultrastructure, and reduced synaptic protein expression. Brain metabolomics revealed that differential metabolites (methylmalonic acid, N-acetyl-1-aspartylglutamic acid, and S-adenosylmethionine) may be involved in the process of cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that perturbation in cognition-related transcriptome profiles, lesions in neurites and synapses, and remodeling of the brain metabolic pattern are involved in the cognitive impairment induced by long-term selenium deficiency. Our study offers a new perspective on the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, highlighting the critical role of selenium supplementation in maintaining healthy cognitive function.

AB  - Arabidopsis Col-0 RPP2A and RPP2B confer recognition of Arabidopsis downy mildew (Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis [Hpa]) isolate Cala2, but the identity of the recognized ATR2(Cala2) effector was unknown.<br /> .To reveal ATR2(Cala2), an F-2 population was generated from a cross between Hpa-Cala2 and Hpa-Noks1. We identified ATR2(Cala2) as a non-canonical RxLR-type effector that carries a signal peptide, a dEER motif, and WY domains but no RxLR motif. Recognition of ATR2(Cala2) and its effector function were verified by biolistic bombardment, ectopic expression and Hpa infection. ATR2(Cala2) is recognized in accession Col-0 but not in Ler-0 in which RPP2A and RPP2B are absent. In ATR2(Emoy2) and ATR2(Noks1) alleles, a frameshift results in an early stop codon. RPP2A and RPP2B are essential for the recognition of ATR2(Cala2). Stable and transient expression of ATR2(Cala2) under 35S promoter in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana enhances disease susceptibility.<br /> Two additional Col-0 TIR-NLR (TNL) genes (RPP2C and RPP2D) adjacent to RPP2A and RPP2B are quantitatively required for full resistance to Hpa-Cala2. We compared RPP2 haplotypes in multiple Arabidopsis accessions and showed that all four genes are present in all ATR2(Cala2)-recognizing accessions.

AB  - Green propolis produced by Apis melifera bees, having Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae) as the primary botanical source, has been used in traditional medicine to treat numerous disorders. However, studies evaluating propolis' potential in treating cardiovascular diseases via its effects on cholesterol metabolism are lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of green propolis extracts on lipid metabolism in hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs. Chemical characterization of ethanolic extracts of green propolis samples was undertaken using HPLC. The in vitro characterization included an evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of the hydroalcoholic extract of green propolis (DPPH and FRAP assays) and its ability to act as an inhibitor of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. In vivo, we investigated the effect of the hydroalcoholic extract of green propolis on lipid metabolism in hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs. Results obtained validated previous reports of significant antioxidant activity. HPLC analysis confirmed that coumaric acid, artepillin C, and baccharin were the most common and abundant compounds in green propolis samples among the studied compounds. Furthermore, the compounds in these extracts acted as effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in vitro. In vivo assays demonstrated that a hypercholesterolemic diet significantly reduced serum levels of the HDL cholesterol fraction. Simvastatin and propolis hydroalcoholic extracts promoted a significant increase in HDL cholesterol, suggesting that these extracts can improve the serum lipid profile of hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs. Results obtained in this study provide a perspective on the possible hypocholesterolemic effect of green propolis, suggesting that it can improve the serum lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs.

The use of anxiolytic drugs for the correction of behavioral disorders in mammals. Regulatory Mechanisms in Biosystems, 15(1), 42-48. doi:10.15421/022406 The issue of stress and behavioral disorders are growing significantly in the contemporary word in humans and animals alike. Various drugs are used to modify affected behavior, including psychotropic, anticonvulsant, antihistamines, hormones, analgesics, and neuroleptics. Psychotropic drugs are prescribed for animals with behavioral disorders, signs of anxiety or hypersensitivity. Improving the methods of diagnosing and treating behavioral disorders in animals can enhance animal welfare and optimize animal husbandry technology. Future research should be aimed at improving and optimizing the use of psychotropic drugs for behavioral disorders of various animal species. The main indication for the use of anxiolytic drugs is behavioral disorders associated with anxiety in wild and domestic animals. When anxiolytic drugs are used in mammals their pharmacological properties, the dependence of their action on the route of administration, age and species of the animal, and the ability to selectively affect the central nervous system should be taken into account. The most commonly used drugs for the treatment of behavioral disorders in animals are fluoxetine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, haloperidol, zuclopentixol and azaperone. Fluoxetine is an effective drug for the treatment of dogs with behavioral disorders associated with psychological changes. An important component of escitalopram's pharmacological effect is the psychomotor influence, when the animal's behavior changes are due to improved motor activity. Zuclopentixol has a wide range of anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic effects when used in wild cloven-hoofed animals. Amitriptyline along with antidepressant properties, has a local analgesic impact. Azaperone has a pronounced anxiolytic and sedative effect on animals. It is widely used as an antistress agent to overcome anxiety caused by weaning, regrouping or veterinary manipulations. Azaperone is often used to control aggressive behavior in group housing, especially in the pig industry. The psychotropic drugs surveyed in this paper, along with direct anxiolytic action, are able to manifest additional physiological effects, which should be taken into account when developing treatment protocols for animals with behavioral problems. Further targeted studies are required to assess the pharmacological effects of anxiolytic drugs in animals.

AB  - Background: Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its specific constituents might exacerbate allergic rhinitis (AR) conditions. However, the evidence is still inconclusive.Method: We conducted a panel study of 49 patients diagnosed with AR > 1 year prior to the study in Taiyuan, China, to investigate associations of individual exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents with oxidative parameters, symptoms, and quality of life among AR patients. All participants underwent repeated assessments of health and PM exposure at 4 time points in both the heating and nonheating seasons from June 2017 to January 2018. AR patients' oxidative parameters were assessed using nasal lavage, and their subjective symptoms and quality of life were determined through in-person interviews using a structured questionnaire. Short-term personal exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents was estimated using the time-microenvironment-activity pattern and data from the nearest air sampler, respectively. We applied mixed-effects regression models to estimate the short-term effects of PM2.5 and its constituents.Results: The results showed that exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents, including BaP, PAHs, SO42-, NH4+, V, Cr, Cu, As, Se, Cd, and Pb, was significantly associated with increased oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) index. Exposure to PM2.5 and its components (V, Mn, Fe, Zn, As, and Se) was associated with decreased antioxidant activity, as indicated by a decrease in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) index. Additionally, increased visual analog scale (VAS) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) scores indicated that exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents exacerbated inflammatory symptoms and affected quality of life in AR patients.Conclusion: Exposure to PM2.5 and specific constituents, could exacerbate AR patients' inflammatory symptoms and adversely affect their quality of life in the heavily industrialized city of Taiyuan, China. These findings may have potential biological and policy implications.

AB  - Microbubbles (MBs), being gas bubbles encapsulated inside a solid shell, have been investigated extensively in the field of therapeutic ultrasound as acoustic cavitation enhancers. Hard-shell MBs have an advantage over soft-shell MBs due to their improved stability. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is one of the most attractive polymers for hard-shell MB synthesis; however, very little is known regarding the effect of synthesis parameters on the acoustic cavitation activity of PLGA MBs and the tunability of this activity. In this study, by manipulating the synthesis parameters, we were able to control the characteristics of the MBs, such as their internal structure, gas core, size distribution, and shell thickness, which significantly affect the total acoustic cavitation activity that they exhibit (i.e., their cavitation dose). We showed that single-core MBs filled with C3F8 gas can produce cavitation effects for extended periods under continuous circulation. These MBs exhibited high stability, and their cavitation activity was not affected by prior circulation in the system. Preliminary in vivo results demonstrated that intravenously injected MBs did not cause adverse effects and produced cavitation activity that increased the permeability of the pig blood-brain barrier. Although more tests should be performed to evaluate the MB long-term safety and activity in vivo, these encouraging results suggest that our PLGA MBs have potential for future therapeutic applications as cavitation enhancers.

AB  - Lichen secondary metabolites have been suggested to play a great diversity of roles in lichen biology by acting as UV screens, antimicrobials, herbivore deterrents or allelopathic compounds. However, evidence is also beginning to accumulate that in addition to these roles, even faintly pigmented or unpigmented lichen substances can reduce photoinhibition caused by high levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Here we used an acetone rinsing technique to remove lichen substances from four common epiphytic Afromontane macro lichens, Parmelia perlata, Ramalina celastri, Usnea dasaea, and Heterodermia leucomela. Results showed that lichen substances can increase the tolerance of lichens to the photoinhibition of PSII of their photobionts when hydrated, apparently by increasing reflectance. However, in the field, lichens may suffer more photoinhibition when fully or partially desiccated. Here we show for the first time that, except for the atranorin-containing Heterodermia, lichen substances can also protect desiccated lichens. Interestingly, removal of substances has no effect on reflectance when lichens are dry, suggesting that lichen substances protect photobionts in other ways.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis L.), as an evergreen plant, needs a humid environment. Water deficit would diminish tea yield and quality. We analyzed the dynamic changes in the metabolite and lipid profiling of tea leaves under various drought conditions and re-watering to determine the metabolic changes in tea leaves responding to drought challenges. In all, 119 metabolites showed substantial alterations in drought-stressed tea plants, including sugars and sugar alcohols, amino acids, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and lipids. We detected 29 lipids and they were classified into phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidic acid (PA), sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol (SQDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), and phosphatidylinositol (PI). The levels of sugar, sugar alcohol, and sugar precursors may change as a response to drought stress. Compared with these metabolites, the membrane lipids showed more dynamic changes in tea under drought stresses. Furthermore, metabolic recovery was only partial, with the majority of the examined metabolites exhibiting significantly different levels between samples from re-watered and well-watered tea plants. The findings also showed that comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were efficient in elucidating the impacts of drought stress on tea plant metabolism. Our findings are valuable for understanding the mechanisms behind drought tolerance in tea plants from the metabolism perspective and utilizing the compounds to improve the drought tolerance of tea plants.

In addition to this, the significant rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses an urgent need for alternative anti-infection therapies for the treatment of intestinal disorders. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potential therapies that have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity due to their (1) unique mode of action, (2) broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and (3) protective role in GI tract maintenance. Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is an AMP of pig origin that was previously shown to reduce the pathological effects of chemically induced digestive tract inflammation (colitis) and to modulate immune responses and tissue repair. This study aimed to extend these findings by investigating the protective effects of PG-1 on pathogen-induced colitis in an infection study over a 10-day experimental period. The oral administration of PG-1 reduced Citrobacter rodentium intestinal infection in mice as evidenced by reduced histopathologic change in the colon, prevention of body weight loss, milder clinical signs of disease, and more effective clearance of bacterial infection relative to challenged phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice. Additionally, PG-1 treatment altered the expression of various inflammatory mediators during infection, which may act to resolve inflammation and re-establish intestinal homeostasis. PG-1 administered in its mature form was more effective relative to the pro-form (ProPG-1). To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the protective effects of PG-1 on infectious colitis.

AB  - Simple Summary: Sheep farmers face increasing pressure to produce more in order to meet market demands, while consumers have more interest in animal welfare status and the environment. The aim of this paper was to categorize the on-farm welfare risks using the ClassyFarm protocol and to identify if welfare risk changed according to farm size. The critical issues we found were the low number of stockpersons, the small areas available for the animals, the lack of udder cleaning procedures during milking, and the lack of prevention plans for the most important infectious ovine diseases. As the number of animals within the farm increased, the management of the flock improved; on the other hand, the number of animal inspections decreased and the hygiene of the water worsened. The objective of the present work was to categorize the risks in the on-farm welfare of dairy sheep in semi-extensive systems in order to highlight if risks in welfare vary according to the farm size. To the best of our knowledge, this study constitutes one of the few categorizations of the risks in the welfare of dairy sheep reared semi-extensively. The survey was conducted on 12 semi-extensive dairy sheep farms in Tuscany (Central Italy), which were classified according to flock size: <500, from 500 to 1000, and >1000. The results showed an adequate rating for all the farms included in the study. The most critical issues concerned the ratio between the number of stockpersons and the number of animals within the farms, the small decubitus areas, the lack of udder cleaning procedures during milking operations, and, in terms of biosecurity, the lack of prevention, control, and eradication plans for the most important infectious ovine diseases. The results show that different items in the five areas evaluated, including the assessments of management of the flock, the number of daily inspections, and the hygiene of the water supplies are associated with the farm size. In large farms, the assessment of management of the flock was better, but the number of daily inspections and the hygiene of the water supplies were worse.

AB  - Simple Summary IACs assemble within the sheep myometrium during early-to-mid gestation in response to increased stretch of the uterine wall and continue to increase as pregnancy progresses. Fibronectin (FN1) is important in its ability to attach to IACs in myometrial cells to generate force to sustain powerful contractions during labor. After parturition, IACs are disassembled but the integrin subunits ITGA5 and ITGB1 remain expressed at the protein level at least two weeks postpartum. Cells respond to extracellular mechanical forces through the assembly of integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) that provide a scaffold through which cells sense and transduce responses to those forces. IACs are composed of transmembrane integrin receptors that bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins externally and connect with the actomyosin cytoskeleton internally. Myometrial smooth muscle cells respond to forces that arise due to increases in fetal growth/weight, placental fluid volumes, and blood flow. As a result, the uterus transforms into an organ that can forcefully expel the fetus and placental membranes during parturition. While earlier studies focused on IAC expression in the myometrial compartment of rodents and humans to explore pregnancy-associated responses, the present study examines IAC assembly in ovine myometrium where mechanical forces are expected to be amplified in a manner similar to humans. Results indicate that the ITGA5 and ITGB1 heterodimers associate with the ECM protein FN1 externally, and with VCL and TLN1 internally, to form IACs in myometrial cells during the first trimester of pregnancy. These IACs become increasingly ordered until parturition. This ordered structure is lost by one day postpartum; however, the abundance of the integrin proteins remains elevated for at least two weeks postpartum. Implications of the present study are that sheep are similar to humans regarding the assembly of IACs in the pregnant myometrium and suggest that IACs may form much earlier in human gestation than was previously implied by the rat model. Results highlight the continued value of the sheep model as a flagship gynecological model for understanding parturition in humans.

AB  - Shaping of prices of agricultural raw materials results from the impact of a wide range of factors that influence prices in different links in the marketing chain. Political changes, especially sudden ones, which abruptly changed farming conditions, were one of the reasons for the asymmetry in price transmission. The main purpose of the paper was to estimate the trends in changes in agricultural raw materials prices in comparison to the trends in food prices in Poland in two time frames, differing in political and economic conditions: before (1999-2004) and after Poland's accession (2005-2019) to the European Union. It was found that the accession to the EU improved the situation of farmers in agricultural markets. There was a reversal of downward price trends in agricultural raw materials and their stabilization. In the years 1995-2005, for most of the prices of agricultural raw materials and food under the analysis, the differences between the trends were not statistically significant. This situation was consistent with the model of market operating under perfect competition. The trends in the prices of wheat, rolls, and bread, as well as the prices of livestock for slaughter-pigs and roast beef were the only exceptions. In turn, in the years 2005-2019 statistically significant differences between the trends in the prices of agricultural raw materials and food were recorded for wheat, bread, and flour; milk, butter, and cottage cheese; eggs and egg retail prices; as well as livestock for slaughter, cattle, and sausages. No statistically significant differences were found for the remaining relationships of the analyzed prices of agricultural raw materials and food. These data indicate a different level of price transmission depending on the product group.

AB  - Phosphor-converted white laser lighting has been considered as a promising candidate in next-generation high-brightness lighting. However, the color converter confronts the inevitable roadblock of low light extraction efficiency and poor thermal stability in reflective white laser diodes (LDs). Herein, a high reflective converter of phosphor-in-glass film-BN layer-Al substrate (PiG-BN-Al) was prepared for high-brightness white laser lighting. The effects of laser power and excitation time on opto-thermal performances of PiGBN-Al-based converter were investigated and compared with the traditional PiG-Al-based converter. Attributing to the high reflectivity of BN glass composite and the high thermal conductivity of Al substrate, the PiG-BN-Al-based converter achieves a luminous flux of 458.6 lm at a laser power of 3.15 W, which is about 70 % higher than the PiG-Al-based converter. Furthermore, the PiG-BN-Al-based converter still remains low surface temperature of 46.4 degrees C under the continuous laser excitation. The PiG-BN-Al-based converter provides an effective strategy to enhance the opto-thermal performances of white laser lighting.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundA splice mutation that causes skipping of exon 17 in the KIT gene is a major reason for the dominant white phenotype of pigs. Exon 17 of the KIT gene may be related to differences in testis size and sperm quality among different pig breeds. Investigating the effects of exon 17 of the KIT gene on spermatogonia differentiation and testicular development is essential for understanding the genetic causes of reduced fertility and semen quality in pigs. To better understand the effects of the splice mutation of KIT on porcine spermatogenesis, we described an exon 17 deletion mouse model (KitD17/+) constructed by simulating splice mutations in KIT for functional verification.ResultsDeletion of exon 17 of Kit severely impaired the differentiation of spermatogonia and promoted the apoptosis of germ cells, resulting in testicular dysplasia and decreased sperm quality and male fertility. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed inhibited expression of genes involved in meiosis and spermatogenesis and attenuated MAPK-ERK signaling in the testicular tissues of KitD17/+ mice. The attenuated MAPK-ERK signaling caused by impaired Kit phosphorylation was confirmed by western blotting.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that deletion of exon 17 of Kit severely impaired spermatogenesis and testicular development, leading to decreased semen quality and male fertility. These findings verified the function of exon 17 in the Kit gene and provide a theoretical basis for improving the semen quality of dominant white pigs through correction of the splice mutation of KIT.

AB  - Noise pollution has become one of the important social hazards that endanger the auditory system of residents, causing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Oxidative stress has a significant role in the pathogenesis of NIHL, in which the silent information regulator 1(SIRT1)/proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) signaling pathway is closely engaged. Ginsenoside Rd (GSRd), a main monomer extract from ginseng plants, has been confirmed to suppress oxidative stress. Therefore, the hypothesis that GSRd may attenuate noise-induced cochlear hair cell loss seemed promising. Forty-eight male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups: control, noise exposure, GSRd treatment (30 mg/kg Rd for 10d + noise), and experimental control (30 mg/kg glycerol + noise). The experimental groups received military helicopter noise exposure at 115 dB (A) for 4 h daily for five consecutive days. Hair cell damage was evaluated by using inner ear basilar membrane preparation and scanning electron microscopy. Terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunofluorescence staining were conducted. Changes in the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway and other apoptosis-related markers in the cochleae, as well as oxidative stress parameters, were used as readouts. Loss of outer hair cells, more disordered cilia, prominent apoptosis, and elevated free radical levels were observed in the experimental groups. GSRd treatment markedly mitigated hearing threshold shifts, ameliorated outer hair cell loss and lodging or loss of cilia, and improved apoptosis through decreasing Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) expression and increasing Bcl-2 expression. In addition, GSRd alleviated the noise-induced cochlear redox injury by upregulating superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels, decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and enhancing the activity of SIRT1 and PGC-1 alpha messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression. In conclusion, GSRd can improve structural and oxidative damage to the cochleae caused by noise. The underlying mechanisms may be associated with the SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary This study examined the levels of certain pollutants, primarily ammonia and particulate matter (PM), emitted by a commercial pig farm in Korea. Understanding these levels is vital for reducing the environmental impact of pig farming and ensuring a sustainable future for this industry. Interestingly, the study found that previous guidelines in Korea might have overestimated these pollution levels, although the current findings are consistent with global research. Seasonal variations also impacted pollution levels: more ammonia was released in spring and autumn, while other pollutants increased in summer. Factors such as the number and age of the pigs significantly influenced these emission levels, as did airflow and ventilation. In essence, continued research in this area will help to improve pig farming practices in Korea, ensuring a balance between successful farming and environmental preservation.Abstract Quantifying emission factors of ammonia and particulate matter (PM) in livestock production systems is crucial for assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of animal production and for ensuring industry sustainability. This study aimed to determine emission factors of ammonia, total suspended particles (TSPs), PM10, and PM2.5 for piglets and growing-finishing pigs at a commercial pig farm in Korea. It also sought to identify factors influencing these emission factors. The research found that the emission factors measured were generally lower than those currently used in Korea, but were consistent with findings from individual research studies in the literature. Seasonal variations were observed, with ammonia emissions peaking in spring and autumn, and PM emissions rising in summer. Correlation analyses indicated that the number of animals and their average age correlated positively with both ammonia and PM emission factors. Ventilation rate was also positively correlated with PM emissions. Future extended field measurements across diverse pig farms will offer deeper insights into the emission factors of pig farms in Korea, guiding the development of sustainable livestock management practices.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.), a hexaploid member of the Brassicaceae family, is an emerging oilseed crop being developed to meet the increasing demand for plant oils as biofuel feedstocks. In other Brassicas, high oil content can be associated with a yellow seed phenotype, which is unknown for camelina. We sought to create yellow seed camelina using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to disrupt its Transparent Testa 8 (TT8) transcription factor genes and to evaluate the resulting seed phenotype. We identified three TT8 genes, one in each of the three camelina subgenomes, and obtained independent CsTT8 lines containing frameshift edits. Disruption of TT8 caused seed coat colour to change from brown to yellow reflecting their reduced flavonoid accumulation of up to 44%, and the loss of a well-organized seed coat mucilage layer. Transcriptomic analysis of CsTT8-edited seeds revealed significantly increased expression of the lipid-related transcription factors LEC1, LEC2, FUS3, and WRI1 and their downstream fatty acid synthesis-related targets. These changes caused metabolic remodelling with increased fatty acid synthesis rates and corresponding increases in total fatty acid (TFA) accumulation from 32.4% to as high as 38.0% of seed weight, and TAG yield by more than 21% without significant changes in starch or protein levels compared to parental line. These data highlight the effectiveness of CRISPR in creating novel enhanced-oil germplasm in camelina. The resulting lines may directly contribute to future net-zero carbon energy production or be combined with other traits to produce desired lipid-derived bioproducts at high yields.

AB  - Xylanase is a heteropolysaccharide found in the plant cell wall, which aids in the absorption and utilisation of nutrients. When embedded in animal feed, it enhances nutrient availability, leading to improved animal performance. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of xylanase supplementation in wheat-based feeds on the hepatic development, antioxidant capacity, and immune response in Tibetan sheep. Sixty healthy, weaned, non-neutered male lambs (19.35 +/- 2.18 kg) were randomly assigned to two equal groups (n = 30 per group). Dietary treatments were: basal diet (H group), and basal diet with 0.2% xylanase supplementation (E group). After a 10-day adaptation period, the feeding trial was carried out for 90 days. The live weight, morphology, antioxidant capacity and immune response were measured. The differential genes in liver were identified by RNA-sequencing. Our results showed that the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) were significantly higher in E group than in H group (p < 0.05). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG were significantly higher in E group than in H group (p < 0.05). The hepatocytes of sheep fed xylanase diet showed arranged radially into hepatic plates cantered around the central vein, and the plates linked with each other to form a lost-like structure. A total of 4,509 differential genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 4,427 were up-regulated and 82 down-regulated. Additionally, the expression of antioxidant-related genes in cluding catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), oxidation resistance 1 (OXR1) and glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2), and immunity-related gene including mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and jun proto-oncogene (JUN) were verified using the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Conclusion: In conclusion, dietary 0.2% xylanase supplementation promoted hepatic antioxidant capacity and immune response via modulating the expression of functional genes in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) regulate plant architecture and susceptibility to insects. We explored the mechanisms underpinning these responses in wild type (WT) peas and mutants defective in either strigolactone (SL) synthesis or signaling. All genotypes had increased shoot height and branching, dry weights and carbohydrate levels under eCO(2), demonstrating that SLs are not required for shoot acclimation to eCO(2). Since shoot levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) tended to be lower in SL signaling mutants than the WT under ambient conditions, we compared pea aphid performance on these lines under both CO2 conditions. Aphid fecundity was increased in the SL mutants compared to the WT under both ambient and eCO(2) conditions. Aphid infestation significantly decreased levels of JA, isopentenyladenine, trans-zeatin and gibberellin A4 and increased ethylene precursor ACC, gibberellin A1, gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and SA accumulation in all lines. However, GA(3) levels were increased less in the SL signaling mutants than the WT. These studies provide new insights into phytohormone responses in this specific aphid/host interaction and suggest that SLs and gibberellins are part of the network of phytohormones that participate in host susceptibility.

AB  - Fecal particle size provides important information on the feeding and digestion of herbivores. Understanding the effects of the potential proximate determinants on fecal particle size helps us interpret this widely used measurement. In folivores, previous studies found that diet composition, dietary toughness, and age-sex-related factors, such as body size and tooth wear, influenced fecal particle size. However, the role of these factors remains unknown in frugivorous and omnivorous primates. This study aims to clarify how age-sex class and diet influence fecal particle size in omnivorous Japanese macaques in Yakushima. We expected that their variable diet and differences among age-sex classes would cause variations in fecal particle size. We simultaneously documented Japanese macaques' diet, dietary toughness, and fecal particle size in the lowland area of Yakushima in the period from March 2018 to April 2019. Unexpectedly, fecal particle size showed limited differences across months and no difference among age-sex classes. Dietary toughness showed no effects on fecal particle size, while the consumption of fruits showed only a marginally significant negative effect. Our data indicate that the results of chewing were not affected by dietary toughness in our study subjects, while age-sex classes showed no difference in food comminution. This lack of variation might derive from a diet with low dietary toughness. We also found that the physical structure of preferred foods played an important role in fecal particle size variations. These results suggest that food comminution is less variable in frugivorous and omnivorous primates compared to highly specialized species (e.g., geladas). Factors other than what we examined in this study, such as food physical structure and chewing behavior, should also be taken into consideration.

AB  - The study aimed to identify the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) responsible for regulating muscle development in Tan sheep. RNA-seq analysis was conducted on longissimus dorsi samples from 1-day-old and 60-day-old Tan sheep to investigate the molecular processes involved in muscle development. A total of 5517 lncRNAs and 2885 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the 60-day-old Tan sheep. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were linked to pathways crucial for muscle development, such as MAPK, cAMP, and calcium-mediated signaling pathways. Key genes like CDKN1A, MAPK14, TGFB1, MEF2C, MYOD1, and CD53 were identified as significant players in muscle development. The study validated the RNA-seq results through RT-qPCR, confirming the consistency of expression levels of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. These findings indicate that lncRNA-mRNA networks produce a remarked effect on modulating muscle development in Tan sheep, such as lncRNAs (MSTRG.12808.1/MSTRG.22662.3/MSTRG.18310.1) and mRNAs (MSTRG.10027/ MSTRG.10029/MSTRG.10258/MSTRG.11011/MSTRG.10354), laying the groundwork for future research in this area.

AB  - Plants have evolved complex defense mechanisms against biotic stressors. Many plant defense-related genes that play crucial roles in regulating defense responses have been identified in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). However, the functional roles of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PvPAL), lipoxygenase (PvLOX), glutathione S-transferase (PvGST) and peroxidase (PvPOD) in response to herbivory and wounding remain unclear in common bean. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of PvPAL, PvLOX, PvGST and PvPOD genes in common bean under wounding and infestation by a major pest, Helicoverpa armigera, using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for the first time. The expression patterns of these genes in response to insect attack and wounding were compared. Moreover, the effects of wounding and H. armigera on the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm, PIABS, ABS/RC, TRo/RC, ETo/RC and DIo/RC) were also determined in common bean. Our results revealed that all genes were significantly upregulated in response to H. armigera, whereas PvPAL and PvPOD were downregulated in wounding. Notably, PvLOX and PvGST genes may play significant roles in the defense system of common bean against both wounding and H. armigera infestation. Furthermore, significant reductions in Fv/Fm, PIABS and ETo/RC were determined under both wounding and H. armigera infestation. These findings suggest that H. armigera is more severe than wounding, leading to distinct gene expression profiles and photosynthetic responses in common bean. The study provides valuable insights for both researchers and breeders in future studies associated with insect stress and resilience breeding efforts.

AB  - Plants of the Brassicaceae family exhibit a sophisticated defense mechanism against plant pathogens and insect herbivores, leading to the production of diverse hydrolytic derivatives such as thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, nitriles, and epithionitriles. These chemical transformations are catalyzed through the enzymatic action of myrosinase on glucosinolates (GSLs), which are otherwise inactive in the intact plant. The hydrolytic products of GSLs are incredibly effective at protecting plants from pests, weeds, herbivores, bacterial and fungal attack. The impact of GSLs on animal health is multifaceted, with nutritional attributes varying based on chemical structure and concentration. While certain GSLs and their derivatives in Brassica plants are associated with health benefits and cancer prevention, others have been linked to goitrogenic effects in ruminants, with concentrations ranging from 50 to 120 mu mol g-1. This variability has implications for the use of rapeseed-mustard meal in food and feed. Despite considerable efforts to modify the chemical profile of GSLs in Brassica species, a comprehensive understanding of their composition and metabolism is still essential for achieving effective and targeted manipulation. This review aims to consolidate both foundational and recent advancements in GSLs research, with a focus on their biological properties, role in plant-pathogen interactions, transport and strategies for managing their accumulation in Brassica seeds. Our goal is to enhance the utilization of this crop by maximizing its potential benefits. This information could be pivotal in developing new varieties with tailored GSLs content and profile, resulting in improved crop yields, enhanced nutritional quality, and greater biofumigation efficacy, thereby benefiting both agriculture and human health.

AB  - Background and Aims Plant reproductive traits are widely understood to be responsive to the selective pressures exerted by pollinators, but there is also increasing evidence for an important role for antagonists such as herbivores in shaping these traits. Many dioecious species show leaky sex expression, with males and females occasionally producing flowers of the opposite sex. Here, we asked to what extent leakiness in sex expression in Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) might also be plastically responsive to simulated herbivory. This is important because enhanced leakiness in dioecious populations could lead to a shift in both the mating system and in the conditions for transitions between combined and separate sexes.
   Methods We examined the effect of simulated herbivory on the sexual expression of males and females of M. annua in two experiments in which different levels of simulated herbivory led to enhanced leakiness in both sexes.
   Key Results We showed that leaky sex expression in both males and females of the wind-pollinated dioecious herb M. annua is enhanced in response to simulated herbivory, increasing the probability for and the degree of leakiness in both sexes. We also found that leakiness was greater in larger females but not in larger males.
   Conclusions We discuss hypotheses for a possible functional link between herbivory and leaky sex expression, and consider what simulated herbivory-induced leakiness might imply for the evolutionary ecology of plant reproductive systems, especially the breakdown of dioecy and the evolution of hermaphroditism.

AB  - Recent studies have reported the presence of adult neurogenesis in the arcuate nucleus periventricular space (pvARH) and in the median eminence (ME), two structures involved in reproductive function. In sheep, a seasonal mammal, decreasing daylight in autumn induces a higher neurogenic activity in these two structures. However, the different types of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) that populate the arcuate nucleus and median eminence, as well as their location, have not been evaluated. Here, using semi-automatic image analyzing processes, we identified and quantified the different populations of NSCs/NPCs, showing that, during short days, higher densities of [SOX2 +] cells are found in pvARH and ME. In the pvARH, higher densities of astrocytic and oligodendrocitic progenitors mainly contribute to these variations. The different populations of NSCs/NPCs were mapped according to their position relative to the third ventricle and their proximity to the vasculature. We showed that [SOX2 +] cells extended deeper into the hypothalamic parenchyma during short days. Similarly, [SOX2 +] cells were found further from the vasculature in the pvARH and the ME, at this time of year, indicating the existence of migratory signals. The expression levels of neuregulin transcripts (NRGs), whose proteins are known to stimulate proliferation and adult neurogenesis and to regulate progenitor migration, as well as the expression levels of ERBB mRNAs, cognate receptors for NRGs, were assessed. We showed that mRNA expression changed seasonally in pvARH and ME, suggesting that the ErbB-NRG system is potentially involved in the photoperiodic regulation of neurogenesis in seasonal adult mammals.

AB  - Contamination of paddy soils with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has become a severe environmental issue. Application of functionalized biochar for rice cultivation has been proposed as an effective means to reduce environmental risks of these PTEs in paddy soils. This work was undertaken to seek the positive effects of a rice husk-derived silicon (Si)-rich biochar (Si-BC) and a pig carcass-derived phosphorus (P)-rich biochar (P-BC), as well as their Fe-modified biochars (Fe-Si-BC and Fe-P-BC) on the enzyme activity and PTE availability in an As-Cd-Pb-contaminated soil. A rice cultivation pot trial was conducted using these functionalized biochars as soil amendments for the alleviation of PTE accumulation in rice plants. Results showed that Si-BC decreased the concentrations of As in rice grain and straw by 59.4 % and 61.4 %, respectively, while Fe-Si-BC significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced plant growth, increasing grain yield (by 38.6 %). Fe-Si-BC significantly (P < 0.05) elevated Cd and Pb accumulation in rice plants. P-BC enhanced the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, and urease, and reduced grain-Pb and straw-Pb by 49.3 % and 43.2 %, respectively. However, Fe-P-BC reduced plant-As in rice grain and straw by 12.2 % and 51.2 %, respectively, but increased plant-Cd and plant-Pb. Thus, Fe-modified Si -and P-rich biochars could remediate paddy soils contaminated with As, and enhance the yield and quality of rice. Application of pristine P-rich biochar could also be a promising strategy to remediate the Pb-contaminated paddy soils and limit Pb accumulation in rice.

AB  - Inulin is a typical kind of fermentable polysaccharide and has emerged as a promising dietary supplement due to its multiple health-promoting effects. This study aimed to unveil the dynamic change pattern of inulin utiliz-ability as a fermentation substrate during gut microbiota development and illuminate its potential association with gut microbiota in Chinese Jinhua native pig models via longitudinal analyses. Herein, fresh feces were collected at one week pre-and post-weaning as well as 3rd month post-weaning, respectively. Targeted metabolomics and in vitro simulated fermentation revealed increasing concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and elevating utilizability of inulin as a fermentation substrate. Microbiomic analyses demon-strated the conspicuous longitudinal alteration in gut microbial composition and a significant rise in microbial community diversity during gut microbiota development. Furthermore, gut microbial functional analyses showed a remarkable increase in the relative abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, including pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism pathway, butanoate metabolism pathway as well as fructose and mannose metabolism pathway. Notably, relative abundances of bacterial genera Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Enterococcus displayed significantly positive correlations with the production of microbial fermentation-derived SCFAs. Collectively, these findings offer novel insights into understanding inulin utiliz-ability variations from the perspective of gut microbiota development.

AB  - Simple Summary Piglets are susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia since they are born with low iron reserve and sow milk contains low content of iron. A single iron injection is a common practice in swine industry but may not be sufficient to meet iron requirement during the entire suckling period when pigs are weaned at the age over 21 d. A second iron injection in the suckling period could be a useful way to boost iron status and thereby help to improve oxygen carrying capacity of suckling pigs. However, it has not been demonstrated yet if there is a difference in the effectiveness of second iron injection to piglets weaned at a longer age (approximately 28 d of age) when injected at different doses and when having different hematocrit status at the time of administration. The current study aims at demonstrating the effect of an additional iron injection on hematocrit levels in suckling pigs when different levels of iron were administered to pigs at birth or in the suckling period. The result of current study suggested that the additional iron injection to suckling pigs could increase hematocrit levels. The amount of iron in the first (at birth) and second (before weaning) injections could affect the effectiveness of the second iron injection on blood hematocrit level. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of additional iron injection to suckling piglets on hematocrit level during the suckling period. In Experiment 1, a total of 24 piglets were allotted into 3 treatments within litter based on body weight and sex at d 1 of age. Treatments were: (1) Control: a 200 mg iron-dextran intramuscular injection only at d 0 of experiment (d 1 of age), (2) Iron100: intramuscular iron-dextran injections at d 0 (200 mg iron) and 15 (11 d before weaning) of experiment (100 mg iron), and (3) Iron200: intramuscular iron-dextran injections at d 0 (200 mg iron) and 15 of experiment (200 mg iron). In Experiment 2, a total of 20 piglets were allotted into 2 treatments within litter based on body weight and sex at d 1 to 2 of age. Treatments were: (1) Iron100b: 100 mg iron-dextran intramuscular injection at d 0 of experiment (d 1 to 2 of age), and (2) Iron200b: 200 mg iron-dextran intramuscular injection at d 0 of experiment. An additional 200 mg iron-dextran was injected to all piglets intramuscularly at d 14 of experiment (11 d before weaning). In Experiment 1, there was no difference in hematocrit levels among treatments at d 15 of experiment. Both iron treatments had greater hematocrit levels than the Control treatment at d 22 and 26 of experiment (p < 0.05). The Iron200 treatment had greater hematocrit level at d 26 of experiment (p < 0.05) and tended to have a greater increase of hematocrit levels in d 22 to 26 of experiment (p = 0.09) than the Iron100 treatment. In Experiment 2, the Iron200b treatment had greater hematocrit levels than the Iron100b treatment in d 14 and 25 (p < 0.05) of experiment. Hematocrit level changes tended to be greater in the Iron200b treatment in d 0 to 14 (p = 0.08) of experiment but lower in d 14 to 25 (p < 0.05) of experiment than the Iron100b treatment. The additional iron injection to suckling piglets increased hematocrit levels with greater values at weaning in the higher injection level whereas the increase was greater when the hematocrit level was low at the time of additional injection.

AB  - Handling of large litters in hyperprolific pig farms can only be done using a nurse sow system or artificial rearing system. Nurse sows are a group of sows used to nurse surplus piglets via extended lactation length. Understanding the husbandry aspects of the nurse sow system is required for improving pig farming practices. Furthermore, removal patterns focusing on nurse sows have not been carried out, and therefore, this research provides information that contributes to how culling decisions could be made in herds utilizing nurse sows. A high removal of young parity nurse sows affects herd structure. After weaning, nurse sows are highly removed due to failure to return to cycle and conceive. Return to estrus is considered the most important indicator of reproductive soundness of any weaned sow and therefore a crucial component in managing non-productive days in herds. Extended lactation length for nurse sows of two weeks appears to be the most appropriate period in which the nurse sow experiences a lesser chance of removal due to failure to express heat. This study aimed to characterize and quantify reasons for the removal of nurse sows and identify the removal associated with their extended lactation length (ELL). A total of 100,756 removed nurse sows within a period of 2016-2022 from 53 sow herds in the Midwest USA were analyzed. Reproductive failure was the most common removal reason (chi(2) = 8748.421, p < 0.001) affecting P1, P2, and P3 nurse sows. Failure to conceive and absence of estrus were the main causes of reproductive failure (chi(2) = 352.480, p < 0.001) affecting P1 and P2 nurse sows and P1 and P5 nurse sows, respectively. When P2 and P6 nurse sows had an ELL of 0-7 d, they faced a high chance (chi(2) = 13.312, p = 0.021) of removal due to conception failure and failure to return to heat, respectively. When P2 and P5 nurse sows had an ELL of 8-14 d, they were highly vulnerable (chi(2) = 59.847, p < 0.001) to removal due to failure to conceive and showing heat, respectively. Finally, when ELL was at 15-21 days, P4 and P5 nurse sows were more likely (chi(2) = 41.751, p < 0.001) to be removed due to failure to express heat, whereas at the same time, P2 and P3 nurse sows experienced the same removal threat due to failing to conceive. These results could help producers manage nurse sow systems.

AB  - The bean bug, Riptortus pedestris, is a polyphagous insect that feeds primarily on leguminous plants, especially soybean (Glycine max). Although the bean bug is an economically important pest of soybean, little is known about how the insect locates soybean fields. In this study, we examined the electroantennogram responses of R. pedestris to soybean volatiles and examined the behavioral responses of the adult bean bugs. R. pedestris adults were attracted more to their host-plant soybean, even when physical contact was absent, than to air or a non-host plant. Accordingly, we hypothesized that R. pedestris can recognize soybean through a plant's volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Five VOCs were identified from intact soybean plants at the vegetative stage: (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, 4-ethylbenzaldehyde, alpha-farnesene, and methyl salicylate. Response spectra of the antennae to these volatiles clearly showed that both male and female R. pedestris can detect soybean volatiles. The adult bean bugs did not show behavioral orientation to any individual compounds but showed significant orientation to a particular blend of synthetic soybean volatiles when tested under laboratory conditions. In the field, this soybean volatile blend did not significantly attract the bean bugs, but it did interact synergistically with the aggregation pheromone to attract the bean bugs. These results highlight the role of host plant volatiles in the sensory ecology of R. pedestris and help explain colonization pattern of the bean bugs in soybean fields.

AB  - Haemonchus contortus is a parasitic haematophagous nematode that primarily affects small ruminants and causes significant economic loss to the global livestock industry. Treatment of haemonchosis typically relies on broadspectrum anthelmintics, resistance to which is an important cause of treatment failure. Resistance to levamisole remains less widespread than to other major anthelmintic classes, prompting the need for more effective and accurate surveillance to maintain its efficacy. Loop-primer endonuclease cleavage loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LEC-LAMP) is a recently developed diagnostic method that facilitates multiplex target detection with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) specificity and portable onsite testing. In this study, we designed a new LEC-LAMP assay and applied it to detect the levamisole resistance marker S168T in H. contortus. We explored multiplexing probes for both the resistant S168T and the susceptible S168 alleles in a single-tube assay. We then included a generic probe to detect the acr-8 gene in the multiplex assay, which could facilitate the quantification of both resistance markers and overall genetic material from H. contortus in a single step. Our results showed promising application of these technologies, demonstrating a proof-of-concept assay which is amenable to detection of resistance alleles within the parasite population, with the potential for multiplex detection, and point-of-care application enabled by lateral flow end-point detection. However, further optimisation and validation is necessary.

AB  - Despite a recent increase in the number of taxonomic studies on the bryozoan fauna of northeastern Brazil, new discoveries and re-examination of museum specimens allow the continued recognition of new taxa. Here, we describe ten new cheilostome species from the northeastern continental shelf of Brazil based on different museum collections. The new species are: Thalamoporella tupinamba n. sp., Turbicellepora papula n. sp., Plesiocleidochasma brasiliensis n. sp., Plesiocleidochasma infundibulum n. sp., Rhynchozoon turgidum n. sp., Cribrilaria brasiliensis n. sp., Hippoporina titan n. sp., Crepidacantha fasciata n. sp., Crepidacantha browni n. sp., and Hippopodina inarmata n. sp. Some specimens previously reported from northeastern Brazil are here reassigned to the newly described taxa, and two new combinations, Cribrilaria caraguata (Winston & Vieira, 2013) n. comb. and Cribrilaria tuba (Winston & Vieira, 2013) n. comb., are proposed.

AB  - SET and MYND Domain-Containing 2 (Smyd-2), a specific protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT), influences both histones and non-histones. Its role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CIR), particularly in ferroptosis-a regulated form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation-remains poorly understood. This study identifies the expression of Smyd-2 in the brain and investigates its relationship with neuronal programmed cell death (PCD). We specifically investigated how Smyd-2 regulates ferroptosis in CIR through its interaction with the Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-related Factor-2 (Nrf-2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap-1) pathway. Smyd-2 knockout protects HT-22 cells from Erastin-induced ferroptosis but not TNF-alpha + Smac-mimetic-induced apoptosis/necroptosis. This neuroprotective effect of Smyd-2 knockout in HT-22 cells after Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reperfusion (OGD/R) was reversed by Erastin. Smyd-2 knockout in HT-22 cells shows neuroprotection primarily via the Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-related Factor-2 (Nrf-2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap-1) pathway, despite the concurrent upregulation of Smyd-2 and Nrf-2 observed in both the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and OGD/R models. Interestingly, vivo experiments demonstrated that Smyd-2 knockout significantly reduced ferroptosis and lipid peroxidation in hippocampal neurons following CIR. Moreover, the Nrf-2 inhibitor ML-385 abolished the neuroprotective effects of Smyd-2 knockout, confirming the pivotal role of Nrf-2 in ferroptosis regulation. Cycloheximide (CHX) fails to reduce Nrf-2 expression in Smyd-2 knockout HT-22 cells. Smyd-2 knockout suppresses Nrf-2 lysine methylation, thereby promoting the Nrf-2/Keap-1 pathway without affecting the PKC-delta/Nrf-2 pathway. Conversely, Smyd-2 overexpression disrupts Nrf-2 nuclear translocation, exacerbating ferroptosis and oxidative stress, highlighting its dual regulatory role. This study underscores Smyd-2's potential for ischemic stroke treatment by disrupting the Smyd-2/Nrf-2-driven antioxidant capacity, leading to hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis. By clarifying the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and oxidative stress via the Nrf-2/Keap-1 pathway, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of CIR and identify Smyd-2 as a promising therapeutic target.

AB  - Simple Summary Experimental trials designed to predict the microbial protein synthesis in the rumen via urinary purine derivatives require access to 24-h urinary volumes. This technique is non-invasive but requires access to 24-h urinary volumes, which is impracticable in grazing animals or a large number of feedlot sheep. The challenge is to provide the possibility of using the purine derivatives and creatinine concentrations in a spot urine sample and the daily creatinine excretion in urine as accurate estimators of purine derivatives' excretion per day. The objective was to evaluate the influence of diets on lambs using different levels of peach palm meal as a replacement for maize (0, 10, 40, 60, and 85% of diet dry matter) on the endogenous creatinine clearance (CC), urine concentration ratio of purine derivatives to creatinine (PDC index), and daily creatinine excretion (DCE) as a marker to estimate purine derivatives (PD) excretion from urinary spot samples collected at different time points (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 h after morning feeding) compared to 24-h total urine collection. The measured parameters were voluntary intake, urinary volume, CC, DCE, the concentration of plasma creatinine, and PD and purine derivatives' excretion (PDE). Five lambs were allocated to metabolic cages and distributed in a 5 x 5 Latin square. Urine collection was taken daily on days 16 to 19 of each experimental period. The inclusion of peach palm meal linearly reduced the intake of dry matter (g kg BW-0.75, p = 0.005), crude protein (g kg BW-0.75, p = 0.010), metabolizable energy (MJ kg BW-0.75, p = 0.010) and CC (p < 0.0001). It also quadratically affected the urinary volume (p = 0.008) and DCE (p = 0.004). There was a linear decrease for PDC index (p = 0.032) and PDE (p < 0.0001) measured in the 24-h total urine with peach palm meal levels. The different times of spot urine sampling did not affect (p > 0.05) the PDC index and PDE. Peach palm meal decreases the CC thereby compromising the use of a mean value of DCE as a PDE marker in spot urine samples. There is greater accuracy when using different values of DCE obtained for each diet as markers for the PDE in spot urine samples. Unconventional foodstuffs of low palatability affecting the voluntary intake of feed change the renal function.

AB  - Interventions such as kangaroo care (KC) and live-performed music therapy (LPMT), are increasingly used to facilitate stress reduction in neonates. This study aims to investigate the effect of combining the two on physiological responses and neurological functioning in very preterm infants. Infants received six sessions of LPMT. KC was added to one LPMT session. Physiological responses included heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. We videotaped infants for 30 min before and after two sessions to assess general movements (GMs). We included 17 infants, gestational age median 26.0 weeks (IQR 25.6-30.6 weeks), of whom six were males. Combined interventions showed a decrease in heart rate from mean 164 bpm before to 157 bpm during therapy, p = 0.001. Oxygen saturation levels increased during combination therapy from median 91.4% to 94.5%, p = 0.044. We found no effects of LPMT or combined interventions on GMs. Infants with a postnatal age (PNA) 7 days. In conclusion, combining interventions is equally beneficial for physiological stability and neurological functioning as LPMT alone. Future studies should focus on the effects of this combination on parent-infant bonding.

AB  - Previously, sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) was developed as a vector for transient expression of heterologous genes in Zea mays (maize). Here, we show that SCMV can also be applied for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of endogenous maize genes. Comparison of sense and antisense VIGS constructs targeting maize phytoene desaturase (PDS) showed that antisense constructs resulted in a greater reduction in gene expression. In a time course of gene expression after infection with VIGS constructs targeting PDS, lesion mimic 22 (Les22), and Iodent japonica 1 (Ij1), efficient expression silencing was observed 2, 3, and 4 weeks after infection with SCMV. However, at Week 5, expression of Les22 and Ij1 was no longer significantly reduced compared with control plants. The defense signaling molecule jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) can be inactivated by 12C-hydroxylation and hydrolysis, and knockout of these genes leads to herbivore resistance. JA-Ile hydroxylases and hydrolases have been investigated in Arabidopsis, rice, and Nicotiana attenuata. To determine whether the maize homologs of these genes function in plant defense, we silenced expression of ZmCYP94B1 (predicted JA-Ile hydroxylase) and ZmJIH1 (predicted JA-Ile hydrolase) by VIGS with SCMV, which resulted in elevated expression of two defense-related genes, Maize Proteinase Inhibitor (MPI) and Ribosome Inactivating Protein 2 (RIP2). Although ZmCYP94131 and ZmJIH1 gene expression silencing increased resistance to Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm), Schistocerca americana (American birdwing grasshopper), and Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid), there was no additive effect from silencing the expression of both genes. Further work will be required to determine the more precise functions of these enzymes in regulating maize defenses.

AB  - Key message This study describes biological functions of the bHLH transcription factor RERJ1 involved in the jasmonate response and the related defense-associated metabolic pathways in rice, with particular focus on deciphering the regulatory mechanisms underlying stress-induced volatile emission and herbivory resistance. RERJ1 is rapidly and drastically induced by wounding and jasmonate treatment but its biological function remains unknown as yet. Here we provide evidence of the biological function of RERJ1 in plant defense, specifically in response to herbivory and pathogen attack, and offer insights into the RERJ1-mediated regulation of metabolic pathways of specialized defense compounds, such as monoterpene linalool, in possible collaboration with OsMYC2-a well-known master regulator in jasmonate signaling. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family transcription factor RERJ1 is induced under environmental stresses, such as wounding and drought, which are closely linked to jasmonate (JA) accumulation. Here, we investigated the biological function of RERJ1 in response to biotic stresses, such as herbivory and pathogen infection, using an RERJ1-defective mutant. Transcriptome analysis of the rerj1-Tos17 mutant revealed that RERJ1 regulated the expression of a typical family of conserved JA-responsive genes (e.g., terpene synthases, proteinase inhibitors, and jasmonate ZIM domain proteins). Upon exposure to armyworm attack, the rerj1-Tos17 mutant exhibited more severe damage than the wildtype, and significant weight gain of the larvae fed on the mutant was observed. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae infection, the rerj1-Tos17 mutant developed more severe symptoms than the wildtype. Among RERJ1-regulated terpene synthases, linalool synthase expression was markedly disrupted and linalool emission after wounding was significantly decreased in the rerj1-Tos17 mutant. RERJ1 appears to interact with OsMYC2-a master regulator of JA signaling-and many OsJAZ proteins, although no obvious epistatic interaction was detected between them at the transcriptional level. These results indicate that RERJ1 is involved in the transcriptional induction of JA-mediated stress-responsive genes via physical association with OsMYC2 and mediates defense against herbivory and bacterial infection through JA signaling.

AB  - Background Enrofloxacin (ENR) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic approved for use in sheep of all ages. The body composition and metabolic capability change with age. These changes may alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs and thus their effect. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of drugs need to be established in target-age animals. Objective To determine the pharmacokinetics of ENR and its active metabolite, ciprofloxacin (CIP), following a single intravenous administration of ENR at a dose of 10 mg/kg in different ages of sheep. Methods The study was carried out in the one-, six- and twelve-month age period of the sheep. A single dose of 10 mg/kg ENR was administered intravenously through the jugular vein to sheep in all age periods. ENR and CIP plasma concentrations were determined using HPLC-UV and analyzed using a non-compartmental method. Results ENR was detected in the plasma until 36 h in one-month-old and up to 24 h in other ages. CIP was detected in the plasma up to 24 h in all age groups. The t(1/2 lambda z) and V-dss were significantly higher in one-month-old sheep than in six and twelve-months old sheep. There was no difference in ClT and AUC values in different age groups. AUC(0-infinity CIP)/AUC(0-infinity ENR) ratios were higher in one-month-old than in six- and twelve-months sheep. Conclusion The most important pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging in sheep are decreased V-dss and t(1/2 lambda z) of ENR and the low ratio metabolizing of ENR to CIP. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data showed that ENR after IV administration of 10 mg/kg dose provided the optimal AUC(0-24)/MIC90 ratios for E. coli, P. multocida and Mycoplasma spp. (>125) with MIC of 0.37 mu g/mL and for S. aureus (>30) with MIC of 0.5 mu g/mL in all ages of sheep.

AB  - Temporal order memory refers to the ability to remember the order of occurrence of items across time. It is a critical feature of episodic memory that is often tested in rodents using spontaneous object recognition para-digms. However, impact of aging over performances of temporal order memory decline is barely known. Herein, we characterized here the effect of normal aging on the temporal order memory performances in NMRI mice between 3 and 19months of age, with an inter-session interval of 24h.We found that temporal order memory was impaired as soon as7 months of age. These results provide strong evidence that temporal order memory is particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effect of normal aging.

AB  - Tomato produces a number of terpenes in their glandular trichomes that contribute to host plant resistance against pests. While glandular trichomes of cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum primarily accumulate a blend of monoterpenes, those of the wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites produce various sesquiterpenes. Recently, we have identified two groups of sesquiterpenes in S. habrochaites accessions that negatively affect the performance and choice behavior of the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae). Aphids are piercing-sucking herbivores that use their mouthpart to penetrate and probe plant tissues in order to ultimately access vascular tissue and ingest phloem sap. Because secondary metabolites produced in glandular trichomes can affect the initial steps of the aphid feeding behavior, introducing the formation of defensive terpenes into additional plant tissues via metabolic engineering has the potential to reduce tissue penetration by aphids and in consequence virus transmission. Here, we have developed two multicistronic expression constructs based on the two sesquiterpene traits with activity toward M. euphorbiae previously identified in S. habrochaites. Both constructs are composed of sequences encoding a prenyl transferase and a respective S. habrochaites terpene synthase, as well as enhanced green fluorescent protein as a visible marker. All three coding sequences were linked by short nucleotide sequences encoding the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A self-processing oligopeptide which allows their co-expression under the control of one promoter. Transient expression of both constructs under the epidermis-specific Arabidopsis CER5-promoter in tomato leaves demonstrated that formation of the two sets of defensive sesquiterpenes, beta-caryophyllene/alpha-humulene and (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene/(+)-alpha-santalene/(+)-endo-beta-bergamotene, can be introduced into new tissues in tomato. The epidermis-specific transgene expression and terpene formation were verified by fluorescence microscopy and tissue fractionation with subsequent analysis of terpene profiles, respectively. In addition, the longevity and fecundity of M. euphorbiae feeding on these engineered tomato leaves were significantly reduced, demonstrating the efficacy of this novel aphid control strategy.

AB  - Acute respiratory infections (ARI) with multiple types of viruses are common in infants and children. This study was conducted to assess the difference of oropharyngeal microbiome during acute respiratory viral infection using whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The overall taxonomic alpha diversity did not differ by the types of infected virus. The beta diversity differed by disease severity, disease-related symptoms, and types of infected virus. Nine species had significantly higher abundance in outpatients than in inpatients, with five of them in the genus Achromobacter. Three microbial community types were identified. The prevalence of community type (CT) 1 was higher among patients with influenza virus, enterovirus, and human adenvirus; CT2 was higher among patients with human metapneumovirus; and CT3 was higher among patients with respiratory syncytial virus and human adenvirus infections. Our results suggest that the oropharyngeal microbiome is associated with ARI disease severity, disease-related symptoms, and the types of infected virus.

AB  - Changes in climate may cause changes in the ranges, phenology and interactions of insects with other species and lead parasites to switch host species. A study of louse (flat) flies in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Isle of Man, in which licensed bird ringers acting as citizen scientists collected ectoparasites that left birds during ringing, showed recent range shifts of several species. The Common or Bird Louse Fly Ornithomya avicularia (Linnaeus, 1758), a vector of Haemoproteus sp. and trypanosomes, has undergone a major northwards range expansion of over 300 km in the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1960s. The Finch Louse Fly Ornithomya fringillina (Curtis, 1836) has also expanded its range over 300 km northwards and 400 km westwards into the Island of Ireland, and the Swallow Louse Fly Ornithomya biloba (Dufour, 1827) is now established in Wales and Southern England. The Grouse Louse Fly Ornithomya chloropus (Bergroth, 1901) has undergone a range contraction at lower altitudes and on the southern edge of its range. Other species of louse fly were detected: Crataerina pallida (Latreille, 1812), Stenepteryx hirundinis (Linnaeus, 1758), Pseudolynchia garzettae (Rondani, 1879) and Icosta minor (Bigot, 1858). Some generalist species have shifted their phenology, whereas the more specialist nest parasites of migrant birds have not, as the arrival and breeding dates of their hosts have not changed. The range changes of the generalist species of these ectoparasites may have implications for bird health, especially if they switch to new host species as their ranges shift.

AB  - Plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions are both well-studied, but largely independent of each other. It has become increasingly recognized, however, that pollination and herbivory interact extensively in nature, with consequences for plant fitness. Here, we explore the idea that trade-offs in investment in insect flight and reproduction may be a mechanistic link between pollination and herbivory. We first provide a general background on trade-offs between flight and fecundity in insects. We then focus on Lepidoptera; larvae are generally herbivores while most adults are pollinators, making them ideal to study these links. Increased allocation of resources to flight, we argue, potentially increases a Lepidopteran insect pollinator's efficiency, resulting in higher plant fitness. In contrast, allocation of resources to reproduction in the same insect species reduces plant fitness, because it leads to an increase in herbivore population size. We examine the sequence of resource pools available to herbivorous Lepidopteran larvae (maternally provided nutrients to the eggs, as well as leaf tissue), and to adults (nectar and nuptial gifts provided by the males to the females), which potentially are pollinators. Last, we discuss how subsequent acquisition and allocation of resources from these pools may alter flight-fecundity trade-offs, with concomitant effects both on pollinator performance and the performance of larval herbivores in the next generation. Allocation decisions at different times during ontogeny translate into costs of herbivory and/or benefits of pollination for plants, mechanistically linking herbivory and pollination.

AB  - Dental rehabilitation with titanium implants may requires the optimization of techniques and materials when oral conditions affect the successful treatment result. Thus, this study aims to customize the surface of titanium implants with bioactive vitamin D3 molecules to increase the performance of bone repair. The surfaces were functionalized following the "dip-coating" incorporation method with vitamin D3 in a solution of 1000 I.U./goat. The work was carried out in two stages: (I) physicochemical and biological tests (in vivo) in order to characterize and validate the vitamin D3 surface as well as its ability to affect peri-implant bone biomechanics; and (II) in vitro experiments to characterize viability responses, interaction and cell mineralization capacity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the creation of vitamin D3 films is stable and homogeneous, while the in vivo results showed an increase in the biomechanical and microarchitectural capacity of the bone when vitamin D3 implants were used. Furthermore, the application of functionalized surfaces proved effective in promoting cell interaction and bone mineralization processes while preserving cell viability and capacity. In conclusion, the delivery of bioactive molecules based on vitamin D3 promotes changes in the surface microstructure of titanium, enabling an increase in the structural characteristics of bone tissue that result in an improvement in bone repair and peri-implant biomechanics.

AB  - Simple Summary Tannins are known as water-soluble polyphenols with the ability to form complexes with macromolecules of dietary and endogenous origin. Thus, they are becoming increasingly popular among scientists as an invaluable "tool" for targeted modification of digestive processes in the rumen. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of tannins of various origin-oak bark extract (natural) vs. tannic acid (synthetic) on the fatty acid composition in the ruminal fluid of sheep. It was shown that both sampling time and animal diet had a significant effect on tested parameters, but this effect was varied. The addition of tannic acid to sheep diet had a greater influence on the fatty acid profile in the rumen than oak bark extract. Differences in the effects of tested additives may arise from the presence of various types of tannins in oak bark extract. Increased concentrations of C18:2 c9c12 and C18:3 c9c12c15 in sheep fed diet with tannic acid addition may suggest inhibition of the initial stage of fatty acid biohydrogenation. These promising results may increase knowledge about the action of such compounds on lipid metabolism in the rumen, and provide the basis for further research on health-promoting properties of ruminant products. The aim of the study was to compare two sources of tannins on fatty acids (FA) composition in rumen. Treatments were (g tannins/kg diet as-feed-basis) as follows: (1) no supplemental tannin addition (CON), (2) addition of 13 g of oak bark extract (OAK), and (3) 4 g of tannic acid (TAN). The basal diet contained 55:45 forage to concentrate ratio. Net consumption of tannins (g/d) was 4 g for both tannins sources. The study was performed on three Polish Mountain ewes fitted with rumen cannulas, and was divided into three experimental periods (I, II, and III). Both sampling time and animal diet had a significant effect on FA profile in the rumen fluid. In general, FA concentrations were higher before feeding in comparison to samples collected 2 and 4 h after feeding. In terms of dietary effect, it was shown that TAN addition had a greater influence on FA profile in the ruminal fluid than the OAK diet. Briefly, in the TAN group significantly increased concentrations of C18:2 c9c12 (linoleic acid, LA) 8 h after feeding (vs. control, CON and OAK), C18:3 c9c12c15 (alpha-linolenic acid, LNA) 4 h after feeding (vs. OAK), C20:3 n-6 before feeding (vs. CON), C20:4 before feeding (vs. CON and OAK) and 8 h after feeding (vs. OAK) were recorded. In contrast, OAK addition significantly reduced C20:3 n-6 concentration 2 h after feeding (vs. CON). In conclusion, increased concentrations of both LA and LNA in the rumen indicated that supplemental tannic acid may inhibit the initial stage of FA biohydrogenation in the rumen.

AB  - Human and animal milk contain a rich variety of milk proteins that meet the needs of their newborns. In total, 1263 skim milk proteins and 1754 MFGM proteins were identified in human milk and six types of animal milk, respectively. Both similarities and differences were observed among the species. Human milk contained more immunoglobulins involved in the adaptive immune response, playing a crucial role in mucosal defense in newborn babies. In contrast, ruminant milk contained higher amounts of antimicrobial proteins, which protect newborns from bacterial infections. The most dominant difference in MFGM proteins between human and animal milk was related to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Goat milk and camel milk were more similar to human milk in terms of skim milk and MFGM proteins compared to the other five types of animal milk. Moreover, immunoglobulins and complement and coagulation cascade proteins in goat milk were most similar to those in human milk. A higher content of immunoglobulin A was observed in donkey milk, which could be considered as a source of IgA in infant formula. These results provide more comprehensive and novel insights into protein variation among animal milk, which may support improving dairy products such as infant formula.

AB  - Herbivorous insects and their host plants comprise most known species on Earth. Illuminating how herbivory repeatedly evolved in insects from nonherbivorous lineages is critical to understanding how this biodiversity is created and maintained. We characterized the trophic niche of Scaptomyza flava, a representative of a lineage nested within the Drosophila that transitioned to herbivory similar to 10-15 million years ago. We used natural history studies to determine whether S. flava is a true herbivore or a cryptic microbe-feeder, given that the ancestral character state for the family Drosophilidae is likely microbe-feeding. Specifically, we quantified oviposition substrate choice and larval viability across food types, trophic-related morphological traits, and nitrogen isotope and sterol profiles across putatively herbivorous and nonherbivorous drosophilids. The results of these studies show that S. flava is an obligate herbivore of living plants. Paired with its genetic model host, Arabidopsis thaliana, S. flava is a novel and powerful system for exploring mechanisms underlying the evolution of herbivory, a complex trait that enabled the exceptional diversification of insects.

AB  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are predominantly daytime-feeding mosquito species that breed in urban settlements and transmit viral and nematode diseases. Females can feed on a broad range of vertebrate hosts for oogenesis. Research on host-feeding behavior and patterns is important to better understand the transmission cycles of most mosquito-borne diseases and to develop better protection measures. This study investigated the host feeding patterns of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus through both artificial blood feeding and natural feeding techniques and assessed the effect of these methods on mosquito fecundity. Laboratory colonies of both mosquitoes fed on blood from five different hosts (bird, mouse, human, sheep and cow). The artificial blood feeding system consisted of a glass condenser with blood attached to a water bath with warm water circulation and insects fed through a stretched Parafilm membrane over the bottom of the condenser. Natural feeding experiments were performed with paper cups that contained the mosquitoes and were placed over the host's skin for one hour. In the natural feeding method, Ae. aegypti females mostly fed on humans, while in the artificial blood feeding method, they fed on birds. Both human and bird blood sources yielded the highest number of eggs, larvae and pupae for Ae. aegypti. Aedes albopictus preferred humans in the natural feeding method and mice in the artificial blood feeding method. Similarly, egg, larvae and pupae productivity from humans and mice were also high for Ae. albopictus. Both species preferred the artificial feeding method. Our findings show that different blood meal sources and methods affect mosquito fecundity. Such laboratory studies on mosquito feeding patterns can reveal the feeding preference of important vectors and provide vital information for understanding vector and host interactions.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed compounds with two or more fused aromatic ring, being some of them classified as carcinogenic. In the present study, the concentrations of 16 PAHs and the sum of them (Sigma PAHs) were determined in samples of food, feed, plant and soil collected in six different heavily polluted areas (Choba, Khana, Trans Amadi, Eleme, Uyo and Yenagoa) of the Niger Delta Region (Nigeria). Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to identify groups of variables (PAHs) and groups of samples that were the best in rendering the environmental pollution in that Region of Nigeria. In addition, PAHs food consumption and the derived carcinogenic risks were assessed in a probabilistic way. The highest Sigma PAHs (mg/kg) were: 16.7 in cow meat, 8.06 in goat meat, 25.4 in chicken meat, 7.72 in fish, 28.70 in fish feed, 15.3 in chicken feed, 8.42 in plant, and 8.80 in soil. In most of the Nigerian areas, cooked cow meat, chicken and chicken feed presented the highest impact regarding PAHs contamination. The highest intake of PAHs was through meat consumption, with a very high and unassumable carcinogenic risk, which is quite above 10(-5) for some PAHs, including benzo [a]pyrene. The results of the present survey highlight the importance of reducing PAHs content in food, specially in meat, in the Niger Delta region.

AB  - Osteomyelitis is a significant cause of economic losses in swine production. The present study analysed the data collected in a Portuguese abattoir for finishing pigs. Total carcass condemnations, tail-biting lesions, husbandry invasive procedures, and several other factors were considered. The main cause of total carcass condemnation was osteomyelitis, with most cases being present in the skull and posterior region. Osteomyelitis in the skull was mainly located in the mandibular bone. Pigs with clipped teeth were associated with a higher occurrence of osteomyelitis. Tail-biting lesions and pleurisies were also linked to a higher occurrence of osteomyelitis. Improvements in veterinary inspection should be made to better correlate welfare and management factors with osteomyelitis in pig carcasses. Osteomyelitis is the leading cause of total carcass condemnation in finishing pigs in Portugal, causing significant economic losses in swine production. The present study sought to determine a possible link between osteomyelitis in pig carcasses, pre-slaughter factors, and concomitant post-mortem inspection findings. For this purpose, meat inspection data were collected from 100,489 finishing pigs slaughtered in a northern Portuguese abattoir. Information regarding total carcass condemnation, slaughter season, origin, sex, tail-biting lesions, and husbandry invasive procedures (tail docking and teeth resection) was collected. The main cause of total carcass condemnation was osteomyelitis (61.03%). A total of 36.16% of osteomyelitis cases were present in the anterior region and 52.20% in the posterior region. In the anterior region, 94.78% of osteomyelitis cases were in the mandibular bone. Pigs with clipped teeth and carcasses with pleurisies were associated with a higher occurrence of osteomyelitis (p = 0.00262 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Second- and third-grade tail-biting lesions were also linked to a higher occurrence of osteomyelitis (p = 0.00128 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Slaughter inspection and monitoring procedures should be revised to better assess welfare factors and correlate management practices with the occurrence of osteomyelitis in pig carcasses.

AB  - This study investigates the protective effects of melatonin against heat exposure during PGF-induced luteal regression in rats. Seventy-five PMSG and hCG primed rats were divided into three groups: nonheat-exposure (NHE), heat-exposure (HE), and melatonin plus heat-exposure (M+HE). The HE group underwent daily heat exposure (41 degrees C for 2 h) for 7 days, while the M+HE group received intraperitoneal injection of melatonin (10 mg/kg body weight) before each heat session. On Day 7, PGF was administered, and ovarian samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 8, and 24 h post-PGF. One set of ovaries was processed for histological analysis, including H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy and the other set was processed for Western blot for apoptotic protein expression. Results showed that heat exposure increased ovarian weight, disrupted follicular development, and elevated ovarian apoptotic markers (Caspase-3 and Bax), leading to luteal cell damage. Melatonin preserved ovarian weight, improved follicular and luteal structure, reduced atretic follicles, and mitigated luteal cell degeneration. In addition, melatonin decreased apoptotic marker expression and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, particularly at 16 and 24 h. These findings suggest melatonin protects luteal cells from heat-induced apoptosis during PGF-triggered regression, supporting reproductive function.

AB  - Culicoides Latreille (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges are vectors of important animal pathogens including bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). While some Culicoides species present in the southern California desert are implicated in the transmission of these viruses to ruminant animals, these species have not been extensively studied due in part to the challenge of identifying Culicoides to species and to the lack of published gene sequences for these species to support their molecular identification. In this study, Culicoides were captured using suction traps baited with either carbon dioxide or UV light from transitional habitat between the southern California peninsular mountain ranges and the Colorado desert of southeastern California. Captured midges were initially identified using traditional morphological methods, with species identification subsequently confirmed by sequence analysis of COI and 28S rDNA genes. Phylogenetic analyses support that some Culicoides subgenera are not monophyletic. Two recognized species (C. sitiens Wirth and Hubert and C. bakeri Vargas) shared the same COI and 28S sequences. An additional cryptic species may be present within C. sitiens. Two additional recognized species (C. cacticola Wirth and Hubert and C. torridus Wirth and Hubert) may be conspecific or cryptic to each other. In total, 19 Culicoides species (or species aggregate) were collected in this study, with genetic sequences published for the first time for 16 of them. Published genetic sequences will support future research on these species, including studies on the ecology and habits of their immature stages which are often tedious to identify using morphology.

AB  - Improvement in vitro maturation culture conditions has been achieved by mimicking in vivo culture environments such as the follicular fluid. Acetic acid is an energy substrate that is abundantly present in the follicular fluid but has not been considered in vitro maturation. This study examined the effects of acetic acid on oocyte quality during nuclear maturation. Cumulus cells and oocyte complexes were collected from the porcine antral follicles of gilt ovaries and matured with 0, 0.1 or 1 mmol/L of acetic acid. After 44 h of in vitro maturation, the energy status, mitochondrial quality and function and embryonic developmental rate following parthenogenetic activation were determined. RNA-sequencing and protein expression analyses were conducted to predict the effects of acetic acid. Supplementation of the in vitro maturation medium with acetic acid (1 mmol/L) improved embryonic development. Oocytes matured with acetic acid had low adenosine triphosphate and lipid contents, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species levels. RNA-sequencing revealed differential expression of genes associated with the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signalling pathway. Immunostaining revealed that acetic acid increased the levels of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, phospho-acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, and sirtuin 1 and decreased those of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 1. In summary, the use of acetic acid during oocyte maturation improved oocyte developmental ability and metabolism by altering mitochondrial activity and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Light is an important environmental factor which affects plant growth, through changes of intensity and quality. In this study, monochromatic white (control), red (660 nm), and blue (430 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used to treat tea short cuttings. The results showed the most adventitious roots in blue light treated tea cuttings, but the lowest roots in that treated by red light. In order to explore the molecular mechanism of light quality affecting adventitious root formation, we performed full-length transcriptome and metabolome analyses of mature leaves under three light qualities, and then conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Phytohormone analysis showed that Indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA), Abscisic acid (ABA), ABA-glucosyl ester (ABA-GE), trans-Zeatin (tZ), and Jasmonic acid (JA) contents in mature leaves under blue light were significantly higher than those under white and red light. A crosstalk regulatory network comprising 23 co-expression modules was successfully constructed. Among them, the "MEblue" module which had a highly positive correlation with ICA (R = 0.92, P = 4e-04). KEGG analysis showed that related genes were significantly enriched in the "Plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075)" pathway. YUC (a flavin-containing monooxygenase), AUX1, AUX/IAA, and ARF were identified as hub genes, and gene expression analysis showed that the expression levels of these hub genes under blue light were higher than those under white and red light. In addition, we also identified 6 auxin transport-related genes, including PIN1, PIN3, PIN4, PILS5, PILS6, and PILS7. Except PILS5, all of these genes showed the highest expression level under blue light. In conclusion, this study elucidated the molecular mechanism of light quality regulating adventitious root formation of tea short cutting through WGCNA analysis, which provided an innovation for "rapid seedling" of tea plants.

AB  - Brown blight, a destructive foliar disease of tea, has become a highly limiting factor for tea cultivation in Taiwan. To understand the population composition of the causal agents (Colletotrichum spp.), the fungal diversity in the main tea-growing regions all over Taiwan was surveyed from 2017 to 2019. A collection of 139 Colletotrichum isolates was obtained from 14 tea cultivars in 86 tea plantations. Phylogenic analysis using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, glutamine synthetase gene, Apn2-Mat1-2 intergenic spacer, beta-tubulin, actin, calmodulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes together with morphological characterization revealed three species associated with brown blight of tea; namely, Colletotrichum camelliae (95.6% of all isolates), C. fructicola (3.7%), and C. aenigma (0.7%). This is the first report of C. aenigma in Taiwan. The optimal growth temperatures were 25 degrees C for C. camelliae and 25 and 30 degrees C for C. fructicola and C. aenigma. Although C. fructicola and C. aenigma were more adapted to high temperature, C. camelliae was the most pathogenic across different temperatures. Regardless of whether spore suspensions or mycelial discs were used, significantly larger lesions and higher disease incidences were observed for wounded than for nonwounded inoculation and for the third and fourth leaves than for the fifth leaves. Wounded inoculation of detached third and fourth tea leaves with mycelial discs was found to be a reliable and efficient method for assessing the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. within 4 days. Preventive application of fungicides or biocontrol agents immediately after tea pruning and at a young leaf stage would help control the disease.

AB  - Purpose of review: This review evaluates the current modes of allergen-specific immunotherapy for cockroach allergens, in terms of clinical outcomes and explores future trends in the research and development needed for a more targeted cockroach immunotherapy approach with the best efficacy and minimum adverse effects.Summary: Cockroach allergy is an important risk factor for allergic rhinitis in the tropics, that disproportionately affects children and young adults and those living in poor socio-economic environments. Immunotherapy would provide long-lasting improvement in quality of life, with reduced medication intake. However, the present treatment regime is long and has a risk of adverse effects. In addition, cockroach does not seem to have an immuno-dominant allergen, that has been traditionally used to treat allergies from other sources. Future trends of cockroach immunotherapy involve precision diagnosis, to correctly identify the offending allergen. Next, precision immunotherapy with standardized allergens, which have been processed in a way that maintains an immunological response without allergic reactions. This approach can be coupled with modern adjuvants and delivery systems that promote a Th1/Treg environment, thereby modulating the immune response away from the allergenic response.

AB  - Some plants have great resistance against herbivores, invertebrates, insects, bacteria, and fungi. This resistance is mostly present in plants containing alkaloids, which are the substances responsible for giving them defensive properties. The genus Datura contains tropane alkaloids and all plants from this genus have defensive properties. In this work, we report the toxic effect against fungi of Datura stramonium extracts, obtained by the Petri dish method. The extraction solvents were water, ethanol, 2-propanol, n-butanol, propanone, butanone, 3-methyl-2-pentanone, dichloromethane, xylene, and toluene. The test fungi were Trametes versicolor (L. ex. Fr) Pilat and Rhodonia placenta (Fr.) Niemela, K.H.Larss. & Schigel. It was found that water, butanone, and toluene extracts promoted mycelial growth, xylene extracts neither inhibited nor promoted mycelial growth, while the other extracts slightly inhibited the growth of these fungi.

AB  - Taiwan rhinoceros beetle (Trypoxylus dichotomus tsunobosonis) forewings, covered with micrometer-scale sandwich structures, can dissipate impact energies to protect the membranous hindwings underneath. Bioinspired by the forewings, monolayer silica colloidal crystals are self-assembled and utilized as structural templates to engineer sandwich structures, which are supported by nonclose-packed shape memory polymer-based structure arrays. These sandwich structures provide sufficient space for the structural supports to be contorted under external stresses, facilitating the dissipating of impact energies. Importantly, the deformed structures, accompanied by diminished impact resistances, can restore their original states through manipulating the corresponding stimuli-responsive structural transitions under ambient conditions.

AB  - Although artisanal fisheries is a source of livelihood for millions of people worldwide, the lack of monitoring makes it difficult to assess under which contexts this practice is sustainable. This is critical when it comes to endangered species, such as seahorses, which are commonly caught by small-scale fisheries. Over a period of four years the illegal seahorse fisheries were monitored via participatory actions. Hippocampus reidi is an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) protected species and legally protected in Brazil. This species is nonetheless widely captured in the study region (Todos os Santos bay - Brazil), the targets mainly being mature and brooding individuals. This study tallied a total of 5763 seahorses that were caught in artisanal fisheries. Through participatory monitoring, seahorse habitat preference was shown as followed: seagrass-49.3% of the catches, and mangroves-29.7%. Likewise, the main gear selected for capturing these fish was seine nets, with 68.7% of all capture. Size and sex of captured individuals varied over spatial and temporal scales, despite consistent catch per unit effort (CPUE) over the years at the different fishing sites. Using maximum likelihood of occurrence, these results revealed that the skills required by fishers to catch seahorses involved spatial acuity. This illegal practice appears to persist because of several factors, including the absence of surveillance by governmental agencies, low fisher awareness, and high trade value of seahorses in parallel markets. The findings of this study may facilitate the inclusion of local stakeholders in monitoring, managing, and protecting these endangered species that remain the focus of an active fishery sector.

AB  - Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders in addition to cardiovascular associated diseases. This risk is elevated when the cumulative burden of ACEs is increased. Laboratory animals can be used to model the changes (as well as the underlying mechanisms) that result in response to adverse events. In this study, using male and female Sprague Dawley rats, we examined the impact of increasing stress burden, utilizing both two adverse early life experiences (parental/offspring high fat diet + limited bedding exposure) and three adverse early life experiences (parental/offspring high fat diet + limited bedding exposure + neonatal inflammation), on maternal care quality and offspring behavior. Additionally, we measured hormones and hippocampal gene expression related to stress. We found that the adverse perinatal environment led to a compensatory increase in maternal care. Moreover, these dams had reduced maternal expression of oxytocin receptor, compared to standard housed dams, in response to acute stress on postnatal day (P)22. In offspring, the two-hit and three-hit models resulted in a hyperlocomotor phenotype and increased body weights. Plasma leptin and hippocampal gene expression of corticotropin releasing hormone (Chrh)1 and Crhr2 were elevated (males) while expression of oxytocin was reduced (females) following acute stress. On some measures (e.g., hyperlocomotion, leptin), the magnitude of change was lower in the three-hit compared to the two-hit model. This suggests that multiple early adverse events can have interactive, and often unpredictable, impacts, highlighting the importance of modeling complex interactions amongst stressors during development.

AB  - The long-term feeding of the high-concentrate diet (HC) reduced rumen pH and induced subacute rumen acidosis (SARA), leading to mammary gland tissue damage among ruminants. Disodium fumarate enhanced rumen bufferation and alleviated a decrease in rumen pH induced by the HC diet. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether disodium fumarate could alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial damage, and oxidative stress induced by the high-concentrate diet in the mammary gland tissue of Hu sheep. In this study, 18 Hu sheep in mid-lactation were randomly divided into three groups: one fed with a low-concentrate diet (LC) diet, one fed with a HC diet, and one fed with a HC diet with disodium fumarate (AHC). Each sheep was given an additional 10 g of disodium fumarate/day. The experiment lasted for eight weeks. After the experiment, rumen fluid, blood, and mammary gland tissue were collected. The results show that, compared with the LC diet, the HC diet could reduce rumen pH, and the pH below 5.6 was more than 3 h, and the LPS content of blood and rumen fluid in HC the diet was significantly higher than in the LC diet. This indicates that the HC diet induced SARA in Hu sheep. However, the supplementation of disodium fumarate in the HC diet increased the rumen pH and decreased the content of LPS in blood and rumen fluid. Compared with the LC diet, the HC diet increased Ca2+ content in mammary gland tissue. However, the AHC diet decreased Ca2+ content. The HC diet induced ER stress in mammary gland tissue by increasing the mRNA and protein expressions of GRP78, CHOP, PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 alpha. The HC diet also activated the IP3R-VDAC1-MCU channel and lead to mitochondrial damage by inhibiting mitochondrial fusion and promoting mitochondrial division, while disodium fumarate could alleviate these changes. In addition, disodium fumarate alleviated oxidative stress induced by the HC diet by activating Nrf2 signaling and reducing ROS production in mammary gland tissue. In conclusion, the supplementation of disodium fumarate at a daily dose of 10 g/sheep enhanced rumen bufferation by maintaining the ruminal pH above 6 and reduced LPS concentration in ruminal fluid and blood. This reaction avoided the negative effect observed by non-supplemented sheep that were fed with a high-concentrate diet involving endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage in the mammary gland tissue of Hu sheep.

AB  - This study was conducted to examine the effects of varying selenium (Se) inclusion levels, in the form of Se-enriched mushroom powder (SeMP) and selenite, on post-weaning growth performance (Period 1; day 1-21), intestinal health and antioxidant capacity (Period 2; day 21-39). Weaned pigs were blocked according to live weight, sex and litter of origin and randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: basal (basal + selenite (0.3 ppm Se)); ZnO (basal + ZnO + selenite (0.3 ppm Se)); 0.15 SeMP (basal + SeMP (0.15 ppm Se)); 0.3 SeMP (basal + SeMP (0.3 ppm Se)) and 0.6 SeMP/Sel (basal + SeMP (0.3 ppm Se) + selenite (Sel) (0.3 ppm Se)) with eight replicates/experimental group. After 21 days, the ZnO experimental group was removed from the experiment and the remaining pigs continued on their respective diet until day 39 post-weaning (Period 2). In Period 1, 0.15 SeMP supplementation reduced (p < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and day 21 body weight, and increased (p < 0.05) faecal scores compared to the ZnO group. Supplementation with 0.3 SeMP and 0.6 SeMP/Sel during Period 1 resulted in similar (p > 0.05) ADG, ADFI, gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) and body weight compared to the ZnO group. However, 0.6 SeMP/Sel supplementation increased (p < 0.05) faecal scores compared to the ZnO group. In Period 2, 0.6 SeMP/Sel increased (p < 0.05) ADG, feed efficiency and day 39 body weight compared to the basal group. Supplementation with Se-enriched mushroom powder, at all inclusion levels, increased (p < 0.05) the abundance of Prevotellaceae and Prevotella, decreased (p < 0.05) the abundance of Sporobacter and increased (p < 0.05) the expression of SELENOP in the jejunum compared to the basal group. Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus was increased (p < 0.05) in 0.15 SeMP and 0.3 SeMP pigs compared to the basal group. Selenium deposition in muscle and liver tissue increased (p < 0.001) as a function of inclusion level while pigs supplemented with 0.3 ppm organic Se (0.3 SeMP) had an increase (p < 0.05) in total Se in the muscle compared to pigs supplemented with 0.3 ppm inorganic Se (basal). In conclusion, 0.3 SeMP supplementation led to positive effects on faecal scores and had similar pig performance compared to ZnO in Period 1, while the addition of 0.3 ppm selenite to 0.3 SeMP (0.6 SeMP/Sel) in Period 2 led to enhanced pig performance and aspects of gastrointestinal health.

AB  - As invasive species spread, the ability of local communities to resist invasion depends on the strength of biotic interactions. Evolutionarily unused to the invader, native predators or herbivores may be initially wary of consuming newcomers, allowing them to proliferate. However, these relationships may be highly dynamic, and novel consumer-resource interactions could form as familiarity grows. Here, we explore the development of effective biotic resistance towards a highly invasive alga using multiple space-for-time approaches. We show that the principal native Mediterranean herbivore learns to consume the invader within less than a decade. At recently invaded sites, the herbivore actively avoided the alga, shifting to distinct preference and high consumptions at older sites. This rapid strengthening of the interaction contributed to the eventual collapse of the alga after an initial dominance. Therefore, our results stress the importance of conserving key native populations to allow communities to develop effective resistance mechanisms against invaders.

AB  - Plasmids enable the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in common Enterobacterales pathogens, representing a major public health challenge. However, the extent of plasmid sharing and evolution between Enterobacterales causing human infections and other niches remains unclear, including the emergence of resistance plasmids. Dense, unselected sampling is essential to developing our understanding of plasmid epidemiology and designing appropriate interventions to limit the emergence and dissemination of plasmid-associated AMR. We established a geographically and temporally restricted collection of human bloodstream infection (BSI)-associated, livestock-associated (cattle, pig, poultry, and sheep faeces, farm soils) and wastewater treatment work (WwTW)-associated (influent, effluent, waterways upstream/downstream of effluent outlets) Enterobacterales. Isolates were collected between 2008 and 2020 from sites <60 km apart in Oxfordshire, UK. Pangenome analysis of plasmid clusters revealed shared 'backbones', with phylogenies suggesting an intertwined ecology where well-conserved plasmid backbones carry diverse accessory functions, including AMR genes. Many plasmid 'backbones' were seen across species and niches, raising the possibility that plasmid movement between these followed by rapid accessory gene change could be relatively common. Overall, the signature of identical plasmid sharing is likely to be a highly transient one, implying that plasmid movement might be occurring at greater rates than previously estimated, raising a challenge for future genomic One Health studies.

AB  - Ocean antibiotics pose substantial risks to the adaptation and lifespan of marine organisms. Seahorses are unique owing to the occurrence of brood pouches, male pregnancy, and loss of gut-associated lymphatic tissues and spleen, which lead to increased sensitivity to environmental changes. This study evaluated the changes in mi-crobial diversity and immune responses within the gut and brood pouch in the lined seahorse Hippocampus erectus under chronic exposure to environmental levels of triclosan (TCS) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which are common antibiotics in coastal regions. The results showed that microbial abundance and diversity within the gut and brood pouch of seahorses were significantly changed following antibiotics treatment, with the expression of core genes involved in immunity, metabolism, and circadian rhythm processes evidently regulated. Notably, the abundance of potential pathogens in brood pouches was considerably increased upon treatment with SMX. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of toll-like receptors, c-type lectins, and inflammatory cytokine genes in brood pouches was significantly upregulated. Notably, some essential genes related to male pregnancy significantly varied after antibiotic treatment, implying potential effects on seahorse reproduction. This study provides insights into the physiological adaptation of marine animals to environmental changes resulting from human activity.

AB  - Melatonin plays an important role in mammalian reproductive activities, to further understand the effects of endogenous melatonin on functions of ovary, the transgenic sheep with overexpression of melatonin synthetic enzyme gene ASMT in ovary were generated. The results showed that total melatonin content in follicular fluid of transgenic sheep was significantly greater than that in the wild type. Accordingly, the follicle numbers of transgenic sheep were also significantly greater than those in the WT. The results of follicular fluid metabolites sequencing showed that compared with WT, the differential metabolites of the transgenic sheep were significantly enriched in several signaling pathways, the largest number of metabolites was lipid metabolism pathway and the main differential metabolites were lipids and lipoid molecules. SMART-seq2 were used to analyze the oocytes and granulosa cells of transgenic sheep and WT sheep. The main differential enrichment pathway was metabolic pathway, in which lipid metabolism genes accounted for the majority. In conclusion, this is the first report to show that ovary overexpression of ASMT increased local melatonin production and follicle numbers. These results may imply that ASMT plays an important role in follicle development and formation, and melatonin intervention may be a potential method to promote this process.

AB  - Although there are more than 270,000 protected areas worldwide, there is currently little data on their protection and management effectiveness. As a kind of protected area, natural world heritage (WH) sites are small but represent some of the most important natural landscapes, covering a very large area. But natural WH is threatened by climate change, natural disasters and human activities. Therefore, to achieve the sustainable development of WH sites, it is very important to analyze the management status of WH sites. Based on this, the study extracts inspiration from Enhancing our Heritage Toolkit: Assessing management effectiveness of natural World Heritage sites. An assessment system of the management effectiveness (ME) of natural WH sites has been established, which has three dimensions (including management foundation, management measures, and management performances) and 21 indexes. The reliability and validity of the index system are tested using the exploratory factor analysis method, and the results show that the index system has good reliability and validity. Then principal component analysis and comprehensive assessment methods are used to analyze the ME of the Fanjingshan WH site. The results show that the management effectiveness of the Fanjingshan WH Site is relatively excellent, but it still faces challenges from tourism development and community participation.

AB  - Simple Summary: The European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) is a non-domesticated and highly adaptable species. It is a descendant of the primitive domestic sheep (Ovis aries), with native populations inhabiting Sardinia and Corsica since the Neolithic age. In the 1950s, as a consequence of intense hunting and poaching, some animals were relocated to nearby islands (Giglio Island and others) as a conservation strategy to avoid extinction risks. Since then, this isolated way of life has served as a "time capsule" in which the Ovis aries musimon has maintained ancestral genetic traits no longer detectable in the current native Sardinian population. Our study findings report the application, in field conditions, of short- and long-term storage techniques of immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) which were then transported to the laboratory for in vitro maturation (IVM) and assessment of nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Both techniques mentioned above can be used for oocyte storage and in vitro culture. However, it is still necessary to optimize them, particularly when used in taxonomically related and endangered wild species for the preservation of ancestral genetic traits and to address the risk of extinction of native populations. Reproductive biotechnologies can be used as a supporting tool, through gamete conservation and in vitro embryo production, in the preservation of invaluable and irreplaceable animal genetic resources. In the present study, immature mouflon cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) collected from ovariectomized female ovaries underwent short- or long-term conservation (24 h maintained in Earle's/Hank's (EH) medium or vitrification) under field conditions and afterwards transported to the laboratory where they were cultured for in vitro maturation (IVM) and assessed for oocyte meiotic competence and bioenergetic-oxidative status. Utilization of both storage techniques led to COC morphology preservation, as well as cumulus expansion and oocyte meiotic resumption after the IVM procedure. Quantitative bioenergetic-oxidative parameters were reduced in vitrified oocytes compared with EH ones. Immature COC storage needs to be optimized in both domesticated and non-domesticated sheep as a part of the strategy to avoid the loss of valuable genotypes of these animal species.

AB  - This study evaluated chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) contamination in raw milk from industrial areas in China, identified the possible pathways of heavy metals from the environment to raw milk, and made a risk assessment of the consumption of heavy metals from milk consumption. The Cr, As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in raw milk, water and silage were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The Cr and As in soil were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry, respectively. Cd and Pb in soil were determined by a Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The Cr and As concentrations in milk from industrial areas were 2.41 +/- 2.12 and 0.44 +/- 0.31 mu g/kg, respectively, which were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those from non-industrial areas, which had levels of 1.10 +/- 0.15 and 0.25 +/- 0.09 mu g/kg, respectively. Chromium was mainly transferred through the soil-silage-milk pathway, As was transferred through the water-silage-milk pathway, while Cd was mainly transferred through the soil (water)-silage-milk pathway. The contributions of each metal to the overall hazard index (HI) followed a descending order of As, Cr, Pb, and Cd, with values of 46.64%, 25.54%, 24.30%, and 3.52%, respectively. Children were at higher risk than adults.

AB  - Goatfishes (Family: Mullidae) are commercially important fishery resource along the Chennai coast, south-eastern India. Species-level identification of goatfishes is a challenge, particularly in the 'vittatus' group, as there is severe overlap of taxonomic characteristics. In 2010, Uiblein and Heemstra revised the Family Mullidae and reported the occurrence of Upeneus supravittatus along the Indian coast. They also remarked that U. supravittatus has been misidentified as U. taeniopterus in earlier reports from India. To resolve this and verify the occurrence of U. supravittatus, 15 morphometric characteristics and 13 meristic characteristics of goatfish samples collected at Chennai were analysed and compared with the corresponding data reported by Uiblein and Heemstra for U. taeniopterus and four other 'vittatus' group goat fishes. The analysis, as well as DNA bar coding and area of distribution of species confirmed the samples as Upeneus supravittatus. The gill raker count on the upper and lower limbs of first gill arch was an important key in identifying the species. Though the number of gill rakers was almost similar for U. supravittatus, U. vittatus and U. taeniopterus, the size and position of the gill rakers confirmed that the collected samples were all U. supravittatus. The study also indicates the possibility that U. supravittatus has been hitherto wrongly reported as U. taeniopterus. A detailed taxonomic study on the Family Mullidae needs to be undertaken along the Indian coast using morphometric and meristic characteristics and DNA barcoding to resolve these taxonomic issues.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury on neonatal neuroplasticity using the following approaches: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging to analyze dynamic changes in tau protein levels, immunofluorescence staining to evaluate synaptophysin (SYP), neurocan (Neu), and tau protein, and utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine synaptic ultrastructure at multiple time points. A total of 59 healthy neonatal pigs were included, with 10 in the control group and 43 in the HI model group. The results demonstrated that SYP immunostaining intensity peaked at 6-12 h after HI before declining. Neu expression exhibited an initial decrease, followed by a transient increase and subsequent reduction, reaching its lowest level at 6-12 h after HI. Tau protein levels increased initially after HI, peaked at 24-48 h after HI, and subsequently decreased. SYP was negatively correlated with Neu with a correlation coefficient of -0.877. SYP was not correlated with Tau, neither was Neu with Tau. Compared with the control group, the number of synaptic vesicles decreased, and Post-Synaptic Density (PSD) thickness increased 6-12 h after HI. At 12-24 h after HI, the number of synaptic vesicles increased, and PSD thickness slightly decreased. At 24-48 h after HI, the vesicle number decreased, PSD became thinner, interrupting continuity, mitochondria swelled, and mitochondrial cristae blurred and disappeared. The findings suggest that the expression of Tau, SYP, and Neu is linked to alterations in synaptic and myelin structures, reflecting varying aspects of neural plasticity following HI injury.

AB  - A phytocapping experience with elephant grass, P. purpureum, was carried out in a closed landfill in Buenos Aires province, Argentina, to evaluate survival, growth and biomass production. In spring of 2015 (November), 240 plants were planted in three lines of 80 plants, the distance between plants and lines was 1 m in both cases. The planting was done directly in the topsoil layer of the landfill capping system. The average height of the planted plants was 80.3 +/- 24.5 cm. In the next 6 months after planting, elephant grass showed exponential growth with 33.3% of the plants exceeding 260 cm in height. Four harvests were made in winter, the first one, 10 months after planting, August 2016 and the remaining ones in September 2017, August 2018 and August 2019. In each one of them the plants survival and biomass production were evaluated. Survival was 100%, 100%, 87.1% and 82.9%, while the dry biomass production was 9.27, 16.96, 13.24 and 18.15 t / ha for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The elephant grass adapted to the conditions of the final cover of the sanitary landfill, showed high survival rates, good development of the specimens and a biomass production within the ranges observed in other works on natural soil.

AB  - The objective of the study was to analyse the fatty acid profile (FA) and amino acid profile (AA) in the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis (MLLT) in two contrast pig populations. The study was carried out on a total of 39 pigs (19 barrows and 20 gilts) of the indigenous Prestice Black-Pied Pig (PB) and 37 pigs (17 barrows and 20 gilts) of the three-breed commercial hybrid of Large White x Landrace x Large White(sireline) (CH). The pigs were kept in the same conditions of diet and management. The slaughter was carried out at the average weight of 95 kg. Sex of the evaluated pigs was also taken into account. The CH pigs showed lower contents of saturated FA (p < 0.01), monounsaturated FA (MUFA; p < 0.05) and a higher content of n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; p < 0.05), more favourable health indexes, expressed as lower values of atherogenic (p < 0.001), thrombogenic (p < 0.001) and saturation (saturated/unsaturated FA) index (p < 0.001) and positively higher values of hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic FA ratio (p < 0.01). The gilts showed lower content of MUFA (p < 0.05). Significant (p < 0.05) interaction effects between genotype and sex were recorded for the caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, alpha-linolenic and gamma-linolenic acid (p < 0.01), with the highest content found in PB barrows. Differences in the AA profiles in the MLLT muscle were only minimal. The PB pigs showed higher proportion (p < 0.05) of threonine, isoleucine and aspartic acid. Higher proportions of threonine and valine were observed in barrows (p < 0.05). The results indicate that the evaluated populations of pigs are characterised by significantly different composition of FA. The health indexes suggest more favourable values in the meat of CH pigs.

AB  - The challenging and highly demanding life rhythm nowadays subjects people to unavoidable chronic stress. Chronic stress is associated with a wide array of serious health complications including neuroendocrine dysregulations. Women are more prone to chronic stress-related hormonal disturbances and their physical and psychological consequences, especially reproductive impairment. Eugenol is a natural phenolic anti-oxidant that has several beneficial biological activities. The current study intended to scrutinize the potential protective effect of eugenol in female Wistar rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups; group 1 received olive oil, group 2 received eugenol in olive oil, groups 3 and 4 were subjected to CUMS protocol for 8 weeks, with pre-and concomitant treatment with eugenol (50 mg/kg/day; p.o.) in group 4. The results showed that CUMS exposure led to weight loss and depressive-like behaviours. CUMS induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation with subsequent elevation of serum corticosterone level which, in turn, caused decline in ovarian release of estradiol and antimullerian hormones together with an increased production of follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones by the anterior pituitary, leading to reproductive disturbances. In ovaries, CUMS imposed oxidative stress, insulin resistance and molecular damage. Intriguingly, all these adverse effects were significantly mitigated by the administration of eugenol that improved animals' behaviours, corrected corticosterone upsurge, tempered hormonal disturbances, and amended ovarian damage. All biochemical results were further confirmed by hippocampal and ovarian histopathological examinations. In conclusion, the current study highlights the prophylactic role of eugenol against reproductive disturbances induced by chronic stress in female rats.

AB  - Phytoestrogens are plant-produced bioactive secondary metabolites known to play an integral role in plant defense that frequently accumulate in times of stress and/or microbial infection. Phytoestrogens typically belong to two distinct chemical classes; flavonoids (isoflavones) and non-flavonoids (lignans and coumestans). Upon consumption by livestock, high concentrations of phytoestrogens can cause long-term disruption in reproduction due to structural similarities with mammalian estrogens and their tendency to bind estrogen receptors. Wide variation in phytoestrogen concentration has been reported in pasture legumes and corresponding silage or hay. Lucerne is a common perennial pasture legume in temperate climates, but information on phytoestrogen production or accumulation in grazing livestock is currently limited. Therefore, metabolic profiling using UHPLC-MS-QToF was performed to identify and quantitate key phytoestrogens in both fresh and dried lucerne fodder from replicated field or controlled glasshouse environments. Phytoestrogens were also profiled in the blood plasma of Angus cattle grazing field-grown lucerne. Results revealed that phytoestrogens varied quantitatively and qualitatively among selected lucerne cultivars grown under glasshouse conditions. Fresh lucerne samples contained higher concentrations of coumestans and other phytoestrogenic isoflavones than did dried samples for all cultivars profiled, with several exceeding desirable threshold levels for grazing cattle. Coumestans and isoflavones profiled in plasma of Angus heifers grazing lucerne increased significantly over a 21-day sampling period following experimental initiation. Currently, threshold concentrations for phytoestrogens in plasma are unreported. However, total phytoestrogen concentration exceeded 300 mg.kg(-1) in fresh and 180 mg.kg(-1) in dried samples of selected cultivars, suggesting that certain genotypes may upregulate phytoestrogen production, while others may prove suitable sources of fodder for grazing livestock.

KW  - LEAF STRIPE
AB  - Barley leaf stripe, caused by Pyrenophora graminea, is an essential systemic seed-borne disease in barley worldwide. Barley is a major cereal crop in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and barley production has been threatened by leaf stripe in this region, particularly in organic farming regions. Detecting the pathogen in infected barley seeds is crucial for managing barley leaf stripe. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to detect the pathogen based on primers designed based on the sequence of the pig 14 gene (GenBank: AJ277800) of P. graminea. The optimal concentrations of MgSO4, dNTPs, and enzymes in the LAMP reaction system were established as 10.0 mM, 1.0 mM, and 8 U in a 25 mu L reaction volume, respectively. The established LAMP methods for detecting P. graminea were optimally performed at 63 degrees C for 70 min with high reliability. The minimum detection limit was 1 x 10(-2) ng center dot mu L-1 in the 25 mu L reaction system. The specificity of LAMP for P. graminea was validated with eight fungal species. All DNA extracts from P. graminea-infected barley seeds with incubation, intact, and smashed treatments were applied in LAMP and confirmed to enable the detection of the pathogen. The LAMP assay in this study could facilitate the detection of P. graminea in barley seeds onsite, provide information for seed health certificates, and help decide on seed treatment in leaf stripe management.

AB  - Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is a classical laboratory task that tests associative memory formation and recall. Techniques such as multi-photon microscopy and holographic stimulation offer tremendous opportunities to understand the neural underpinnings of these memories. However, these techniques generally require animals to be head-fixed. Few paradigms examine contextual fear in head-fixed mice, and none use freezing-the most common measure of fear in freely moving animals-as the behavioral readout. To address this gap, we developed a CFC paradigm for head-fixed mice using virtual reality (VR). We designed an apparatus to deliver tail shocks while mice navigated a VR environment. We tested three versions of this paradigm and, in all of them, observed increased freezing, particularly on the first trial, in the shock-paired VR compared to a neutral one. These results demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be fear-conditioned in VR and exhibit context-specific freezing behavior. Additionally, using two-photon calcium imaging, we tracked large populations of hippocampal CA1 neurons before, during, and following CFC. As in freely moving mice, CA1 place cells remapped and developed narrower fields following fear conditioning. Thus, our approach enables new opportunities to study the neural mechanisms underlying the formation, recall, and extinction of contextual fear memories.

AB  - Colletotrichum nymphaeae is the dominant species causing anthracnose disease of peach in China. In this study, 140 isolates of C. nymphaeae were assessed for their sensitivity to six fungicides. It was found that C. nymphaeae was highly resistant to carbendazim, procymidone, and boscalid but sensitive to pyraclostrobin and prochloraz. For fludioxonil, the fungus exhibited differential sensitivities (i.e., approximately 14% of isolates were resistant to fludioxonil and the resistance was stable). Fludioxonil-resistant isolates had a mean EC 50 value of 2.2380 mu g/ml whereas the mean EC50 value was 0.0194 mu g/ml in fludioxonil-sensitive isolates. The mean EC50 values of C. nymphaeae for pyraclostrobin and prochloraz were 0.0083 mu g/ml and 0.002 mu g/ml, respectively. No cross-resistance was observed between fungicides from different groups. Mycelial growth rate, control efficacy, and osmotic stress responses were significantly different (P < 0.05) between fludioxonil-sensitive (Flu(S)) and -resistant (Flu(R)) isolates, but no significant difference was observed (P > 0.05) in virulence and sporulation between Flu(S) and Flu(R) isolates. No mutation was detected in coding regions of the CnOs-1, Cal, Hk1, Hog], TPI, and Mrr1 genes. Interestingly, with fludioxonil treatment, the expression of ABC transporter gene atrB was significantly overexpressed in some resistant isolates. However, overexpression of the atrB gene was not detected in one moderately and one highly resistant isolate, indicating that other unknown mechanisms may be involved. Current findings uncovered several effective chemicals and provided the foundation for designing management strategies to practically control peach anthracnose with the most effective demethylation inhibitor fungicides and quinone outside inhibitor fungicides.

AB  - Leukemia can be a result of genetic changes associated with protein tyrosine kinase activity such as in MPL W515L and BCR/ABL genes. However, the current conventional treatment of leukemia produces severe side effects that urge the approach to use natural products. A medicinal mushroom, Lignosus rhinocerus shows potential as an anti-cancer treatment. To investigate the effi cacy and mechanism of action of the L. rhinocerus cultivar (TM02 (R)) extract on leukemogenic tyrosine kinase cell lines, a cold-water extract (CWE) was produced by using TM02 (R) sclerotia powder at 4 degrees C. The carbohydrate and protein contents were found to be 77.24% and 1.75% respectively. In comparison to the normal Ba/F3 cell, the CWE TM02 (R) shows significant effects on exhibiting proliferation of Ba/F3 expressed MPL W515L and BCR/ABL, possibly due to the presence of phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of TM02 (R), which contribute to act on various signaling pathways, and the reported apoptotic activity of CWE TM02 (R). In contrast, CWE TM02 (R) significantly exhibited high scavenging activity of both Ba/F3 expressed MPL W515L and BCR/ABL. At concentrations of 125 mu g/mL and 500 mu g/mL of CWE TM02 (R) decreased 49.5% and 67.5% of cell migration activity of Ba/F3 expressed MPL W515L and BCR/ABL respectively. Therefore, we postulate that CWE TM02 (R) has the capability to mediate the migration route of the leukemogenic tyrosine kinase cell lines.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the antifatigue effects of deer-hide gelatin (DHG) and its mechanism in mice through a weight-loaded swimming experiment.Methods: The subjects were assigned to the blank group (BC), positive group (PC), model group (MC), and high, medium, and low doses of DHG groups (HP, MP, and LP). After 4 weeks of treatment, the subjects were sacrificed to detect fatigue-related biochemical indicators and the protein and mRNA expressions of Nrf2/Keap1 and AMPK/PGC1 alpha pathways. The morphological changes of skeletal muscle were detected. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to detect the changes in the relative abundance of intestinal flora and the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in tired subjects.Results: Compared with MC, DHG could prolong the exhaustion time of weight-loaded swimming mice; reduce the CK, BUN, lactic acid, MDA, 5-HT, and GABA levels; and increase the LDH, SOD, CAT, Glycogen, MG, BG, ACH, and Glu levels. Moreover, DHG increased the protein and mRNA expression of Nrf2, HO-1, AMPK, PGC1 alpha, and P-AMPK and reduced the protein and mRNA expression of Keap1. The 16S rDNA sequencing analysis also showed that DHG regulated the abundance of intestinal microbiota and the content of SCFAs and increased the growth of beneficial bacteria.Conclusions: DHG exhibited antifatigue effects on mice by activating Nrf2/Keap1 and AMPK/PGC1 alpha pathways, reducing oxidative stress damage, and enhancing mitochondrial energy supply. The study's findings confirmed the considerable antioxidant and antifatigue activities of DHG, providing a preliminary foundation and practical theory for the further development of DHG as a nutritional supplement.

AB  - Thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) feed on leaf and flower tissue and some of them can be facultative predators. Caliothrips phaseoli Hood causes severe damage to different species of the Fabaceae family, mainly to Phaseolus vulgaris L. crops. The purpose of this research is to assess the change in feeding damage due to predation on Tetranychus merganser (Acari: Tetranychidae) eggs by the first and second larval stages of C. phaseoli on bean leaf discs, under laboratory conditions. Predation and damage were assessed through functional response and ordinal scale, respectively. The first and second larval stages of C. phaseoli exhibited a type II functional response. The second larval stage of C. phaseoli displayed shorter handling time and higher attack rate in comparison to the first instar. The first and second larval stages of C. phaseoli consumed 3.8 and 4.9 eggs of T. merganser per day, respectively. The second larval stage caused the highest damage (median = 3). The feeding damage of C. phaseoli was negatively associated to the number of eggs offered. The C. phaseoli larvae became more predatory than herbivorous when the number of eggs offered increased; therefore, C. phaseoli can be considered a facultative predator.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the short-term effect of dietary chitosan nanoparticles (CNP) on immune response and disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila infection in tropical herbivore fish (rohu, Labeo rohita). In the study, fish were fed with a diet containing different concentrations of CNP (0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 2 g/kg diet) for 20 days. After feeding trials, experimental fish were subjected to immunological and antioxidant parameters analysis; it is found that respiratory burst, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, and catalase activity were highest in the T3 group (1 g/kg diet) and CNP-fed groups were significantly different (P < 0.05) from that of control. Also, CNP showed antibacterial activity against different geographical isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, in the challenge study, it revealed that fishes fed at 1 g of CNP/kg diets were recorded the highest relative percentage survival than that of other treatment groups and control group. Finally, it can be concluded that dietary CNP at a 1 g/kg diet will have a beneficial effect with respect to improved health status and disease resistance against the Aeromonas hydrophila in tropical rohu fish.

AB  - The Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) thrives in its extreme Antarctic environment. We generated the Weddell seal genome assembly and a high-quality annotation to investigate genome-wide evolutionary pressures that underlie its phenotype and to study genes implicated in hypoxia tolerance and a lipid-based metabolism. Genome-wide analyses included gene family expansion/contraction, positive selection, and diverged sequence (acceleration) compared to other placental mammals, identifying selection in coding and non-coding sequence in five pathways that may shape cardiovascular phenotype. Lipid metabolism as well as hypoxia genes contained more accelerated regions in the Weddell seal compared to genomic background. Top-significant genes were SUMO2 and EP300; both regulate hypoxia inducible factor signaling. Liver expression of four genes with the strongest acceleration signals differ between Weddell seals and a terrestrial mammal, sheep. We also report a high-density lipoprotein-like particle in Weddell seal serum not present in other mammals, including the shallow-diving harbor seal.
   The Antarctic Weddell inhabits one of the most extreme environments on Earth. Comparative genomics with close relatives reveals the specific genetic adaptations for cardiovascular and fat metabolism that enable it to thrive.

AB  - Field application of digestate from liquid animal manure (slurry) poses an environmental risk due to emission of ammonia (NH3). Various application techniques can reduce NH3 losses. Three experiments were conducted in Denmark where NH3 emission after field application of anaerobically digested separated cattle slurry was measured using dynamic flux chambers with online measurements. The results showed that acidifying the digestate at a low level equal to the crop sulphur requirement reduced the average NH3 emission by 13% compared to non-acidified trailing shoe application of digestate. Disc injection reduced average emissions even more by 38% compared to trailing shoe application. There was a large variation in mitigation effect between experiments.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a highly prevalent and comorbid anxiety disorder with rather unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we aimed to characterize neurobiological changes occurring in mice expressing symptoms of social fear and to identify possible therapeutic targets for SAD. Social fear was induced via social fear conditioning (SFC), a validated animal model of SAD. We assessed the expression levels of the immediate early genes (IEGs) cFos, Fosl2 and Arc as markers of neuronal activity and the expression levels of several genes of the GABAergic, serotoninergic, oxytocinergic, vasopressinergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-ergic systems in brain regions involved in social behavior or fear-related behavior in SFC+ and SFC- mice 2 h after exposure to a conspecific. SFC+ mice showed a decreased number and density of cFos-positive cells and decreased expression levels of IEGs in the dorsal hippocampus. SFC+ mice also showed alterations in the expression of NPY and serotonin system-related genes in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, basolateral amygdala, septum and dorsal raphe nucleus, but not in the dorsal hippocampus. Our results describe neuronal alterations occurring during the expression of social fear and identify the NPY and serotonergic systems as possible targets in the treatment of SAD.

AB  - Ochratoxin A (OTA), frequently existing in the food and feeds, could induce immunotoxicity. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), as a primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease, also could induce immunosuppression. However, it is still unknown whether PCV2 infection impacts OTA-induced immunotoxicity. The pigs and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were used as the model in the present experiment. The results in vivo indicated that PCV2 infection exacerbated OTA-induced immunotoxicity, NF-kappa B p65 phosphorylation, and TLR4 and MyD88 mRNA and protein expression in spleen. The results in vitro showed that OTA at 7.0 and 9.0 mu M decreased cell viability and increased LDH release of PAMs without PCV2 infection. However, with PCV2 infection, OTA at 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 mu M significantly decreased cell viability and increased LDH release compared with absence of PCV2 infection. In addition, OTA at 5.0 and 7.0 mu M significantly increased Annexin V/PI-positive rate, apoptosis of nuclear, gamma-H2AX foci, IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha expression in PAMs with PCV2 infection compared with absence of PCV2 infection. In addition, PCV2 infection enhanced OTA-induced TLR4 and MyD88 mRNA and protein expression and NF-kappa B p65 phosphorylation. Knockdown of TLR4 alleviated the exacerbating effects of PCV2 infection on OTA-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and DNA damage in PAMs. These results indicated that PCV2 infection aggravated OTA-induced immunotoxicity and reduced the dose of OTA-induced immunotoxicity via TLR4/NF-kappa B p65 signaling pathway, which could provide basis for establishing limits for OTA.

AB  - This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of the residual concentrations of eight classes of antimicrobial agents (AMs, 20 compounds) in 13 swine wastewater treatment facilities in Japan. These facilities implemented the aerobic activated sludge (AS) or its alternative methods. The maximum concentrations before treatment were found at the level of 7100, 6900, 6000, 3600, 3400, and 1400 mu g/L for tilmicosin, oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline, lincomycin , sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, respectively. The highest detection rate (96.3%) in influents was noted for the morantel, which was a feed additive. The seasonal difference in residual concentration was much greater for tetracyclines (TCs) and macrolides (MLs) when their residual concentrations were high, especially in the cold season. There was a positive correlation between the purchased quantity of TCs and fluoroquinolones (FQs) and their residue levels detected in the effluents (p < 0.01). The estimated removal rate of AMs was greater than 80%. In contrast, on a few occasions, it was diminished due to failing operating conditions, such as water temperature and AS rate in the aeration tank. The estimated ecological risks of AMs in effluents based on risk quotients (RQs) considered to enhance the selection pressure for drug resistance (RQs-AMR) were high for TCs and FQs, whereas ecotoxicological effects (RQs-ENV) to aquatic organisms were higher for sulfonamides and MLs. When OTC usage ceased, its concentration in wastewater decreased rapidly; however, it remained longer period in the effluents, probably due to OTC desorption from the AS. The concentrations (and respective RQs) of TCs were decreased by >99.8% and >92% in the influents and effluents, respectively. This data suggested that it is essential to reduce the amount used and introduce more efficient methods and operating conditions to constantly remove AMs during the treatment to reduce the risk of AM discharge from swine farms.

AB  - The dreaded weed ipomea (Ipomea carnea), has shown promise as a versatile phytoremediator. But I. carnea plants exude several alkaloids and phenols which are harmful to plants as well as animals. Due to this, the weed imparts as much or more toxicity to the soil as it remediates. These authors have earlier found that upon being vermicomposted by Eisenia fetida ipomea loses its toxicity and becomes a benign organic fertilizer with pest repellant attributes. These findings open up the possibility of using earthworms in those segments of land which are sought to be phytoremediated by ipomea so that the earthworms can keep converting the dead ipomea plants and the debris of live plants to fertilizer. The present work has aimed to determine whether the extent and nature of earthworm impact differs from species to species or is similar across different species. It has revealed that the action of each of the four different earthworm species deployed by the authors caused the C:N ratio of ipomea to change drastically from 28.20 to 15.95 +/- 0.75, bringing the vermicomposts to the category of fertilizers fit for horticulture. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed that all the species caused a breakdown of the alkaloids and the phenolic compounds present in ipomea, resulting in the weed's detoxification. The earthworms also effected partial degradation of the lignocellulosic content of ipomea to simpler and more soil-friendly constituents like humic acids. Thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy corroborated these findings. The influence exerted by the four species of earthworms was similarly beneficial in nature and extent.
   NOVELTY STATEMENT First-ever study which establishes the general applicability of earthworms in nullifying the toxic impacts caused by ipomea during its use in phytoremediation, thereby greatly enhancing ipomea's value as a phytoremediator. The studies also provide an avenue for the utilization of the otherwise worthless ipomea harvested after phytoremediation or from natural stands.

AB  - The strength of a fear memory significantly influences whether it drives adaptive or maladaptive behavior in the future. Yet, how mild and strong fear memories differ in underlying biology is not well understood. We hypothesized that this distinction may not be exclusively the result of changes within specific brain regions, but rather the outcome of collective changes in connectivity across multiple regions within the neural network. To test this, rats were fear conditioned in protocols of varying intensities to generate mild or strong memories. Neuronal activation driven by recall was measured using c-fos immunohistochemistry in 12 brain regions implicated in fear learning and memory. The interregional coordinated brain activity was computed and graph-based functional networks were generated to compare how mild and strong fear memories differ at the systems level. Our results show that mild fear recall is supported by a well-connected brain network with small-world properties in which the amygdala is well-positioned to be modulated by other regions. In contrast, this connectivity is disrupted in strong fear memories and the amygdala is isolated from other regions. These findings indicate that the neural systems underlying mild and strong fear memories differ, with implications for understanding and treating disorders of fear dysregulation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is one of the most intensively used fertilizers in cropping system and could exert a variety of bottom up effects on the ecological fitness of herbivores. However, the effects of increased N inputs on insect pesticide tolerance have not been comprehensively understood. Bioassays showed that high N (HN) applied to maize plants significantly increased larval tolerance of Spodoptera litura to multiple insecticides. Activities of detoxification enzymes were significantly higher in the larvae fed on maize plants supplied with HN. RNA-seq analysis showed that numerous GST and cuticle-related genes were induced in the larvae fed on HN maize. RT-qPCR analysis further confirmed four GST genes and larval-specific cuticle gene LCP167 . Furthermore, when injected with dsRNA specific to GSTe1 , GSTs5 , and LCP167 , the mortality of larvae treated with methomyl was about 3-fold higher than that of dsGFP-injected larvae. Electron microscope observation showed that cuticle of the larvae fed on HN maize was thicker than the medium level of N. These findings suggest that increased application of N fertilizer enhances insecticide tolerance of lepidopteran pests via induction of detoxification enzymes and intensification of cuticle. Thus, overuse of N fertilizer may increase pest insecticide tolerance and usage of chemical insecticides.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that extracts derived from animal spleens have anti-tumor effects, but the biological activity of ethanol extract obtained from pig spleen has not been tested. Therefore, in the present study, we used ethanol as the extraction solvent to obtain the pig spleen ethanol extract (PSE) with immune activity, which provided a theoretical basis for further development and utilization of pig spleen as an anti-tumor drug. Then the structure characteristics and immune activity of PSE were investigated. According to the characterization analysis results, PSE was a high-purity protein complex mainly composed of hydrophobic amino acids, with an average molecular weight of 2.66 x 106 Da. The secondary structure was mainly alpha-helix and beta-sheet. In vivo, PSE inhibited the growth of the S180 tumor, and immune organ toxicity was not detected. PSE induced S180 tumor cells to block and apoptosis in the S phase through the ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Meanwhile, PSE improved the immunity of the body, such as promoting the proliferation activity of lymphocytes and increasing the level of IgG. In conclusion, PSE had significant cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects on S180 sarcoma cells.

AB  - Glutamate is an essential excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, playing a vital role in regulating synaptic activity and maintaining the homeostasis of the cerebral environment but also serves as a central hub for neuronal injury and inflammatory responses. In various pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke, glutamate is released and accumulates excessively in the brain, leading to heightened stimulation of neurons and excitotoxicity. This phenomenon positions glutamate as a primary inducing factor for neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia. Glutamate exerts its effects primarily through two types of receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, both of which are extensively distributed throughout the hippocampus and cortical regions of the brain. Ionotropic receptors mediate rapid excitatory neurotransmission upon activation by glutamate; these are mainly categorized (AMPARs), and kainate receptors (KARs). Conversely, metabotropic receptors function as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) facilitating glutamatergic cellular effects via intracellular second messenger. With the comprehensive investigation of glutamate receptors and their structural characteristics, our understanding of the nerve damage and protective mechanisms associated with glutamate receptors in ischemic stroke is progressively advancing. Consequently, exploring the role of glutamate receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in cerebral ischemia can provide a robust theoretical foundation for targeted therapies aimed at treating cerebral ischemia, stroke, and related disorders. This article reviews the function of glutamate receptors and their mediated downstream signal transduction pathways in the context of ischemic brain injury.

AB  - Free amino acids are one of the main chemical components in tea, and they contribute to the pleasant flavor, function, and quality of tea, notably the level of theanine. Here, a high-density genetic map was constructed to characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for free amino acid content. A total of 2688 polymorphic SNP markers were obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) based on 198 individuals derived from a pseudotestcross population of "Longjing 43" x "Baijiguan", which are elite and albino tea cultivars, respectively. The 1846.32 cM high-density map with an average interval of 0.69 cM was successfully divided into 15 linkage groups (LGs) ranging from 93.41 cM to 171.28 cM. Furthermore, a total of 4 QTLs related to free amino acid content (theanine, glutamate, glutamine, aspartic acid and arginine) identified over two years were mapped to LG03, LG06, LG11 and LG14. The phenotypic variation explained by these QTLs ranged from 11.8% to 23.7%, with an LOD score from 3.56 to 7.7. Furthermore, several important amino acid metabolic pathways were enriched based on the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the offspring. These results will be essential for fine mapping genes involved in amino acid pathways and diversity, thereby providing a promising avenue for the genetic improvement of tea plants.

AB  - Protoplasts preparation and purification have been frequently used in plant genetics and breeding studies, whereas application of protoplasts in woody plants is still in its infancy. Although transient gene expression using purified protoplasts is well-documented and widely used in model plants and agriculture crops, no instance of either stable transformation or transient gene expression in the woody plant Camellia Oleifera has as of yet been reported. Here, we developed a protoplast preparation and purification method using C. oleifera petals by optimizing osmotic condition with D-mannitol and polysaccharide-degrading enzyme concentrations for petal cell wall digestion, to reach a high efficiency of protoplast productivity and viability. The achieved protoplasts yield was approximately 1.42 x 107 cells per gram of petal material and the viability of protoplasts was up to 89%. In addition, we explored influencing factors of protoplast transformation, including concentrations of PEG4000 and plasmid DNA. The transformation efficiency of 81% could be reached under the optimized con-dition. This protoplast isolation and transient expression system were deployed to further identify the functional regulation of C. oleifera related genes and the subcellular distribution of their encoded products. In summary, the protoplast isolation and transient expression system we established using oil-tea tree petals is an efficient, ver-satile and time-saving system, being suitable for gene function characterization and molecular mechanism analysis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the differences in rectal and body surface temperatures and their extent of conformity using digital and infrared thermometers, respectively, in piglets during the hot-dry season in a tropical guinea savannah of Nigeria. Thirty Large White piglets of both sexes, aged 10-14 days, served as the experimental subjects. The rectal and surface body temperatures were recorded concurrently with those of the ambient dry- and wet-bulbs, during the day at 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 18:00 h (GMT +1). There were significant (P < 0.05) diurnal variations in all body and ambient temperature readings, with the highest values obtained in the afternoon (at 15:00 h GMT + 1). The mean diurnal rectal and body surface temperatures in the piglets at 09:00-18:00 h were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the corresponding values at 06:00 h. The overall mean rectal temperature (39.00 +/- 0.04 degrees C) was higher (P < 0.01) than body surface temperature recorded for the eye (38.05 +/- 0.04 degrees C), ear (38.10 +/- 0.07 degrees C), head (37.97 +/- 0.05 degrees C), nose (35.68 +/- 0.13 degrees C), scapula (38.16 +/- 0.06 degrees C), thigh (38.00 +/- 0.06 degrees C), back (38.02 +/- 0.06 degrees C) and hoof (36.83 +/- 0.07 degrees C). The largest and smallest mean difference between rectal and body surface temperatures was -3.32 +/- 0.12 degrees C and -0.84 +/- 0.06 degrees C for the temperature of the nose and scapula, respectively. The positive correlation (P < 0.05) between body temperatures (rectal and surface) of the piglets with ambient temperature implied that the later had a tremendous effect on the former. Body surface temperatures at the region of eye, ear, head, nose, scapula, thigh, back and hoof had significantly (P < 0.0001) linear and positive relationships with rectal temperature. In conclusion, the similar diurnal trends, highly significant correlation coefficients and linear relationships between the rectal and body surface temperatures suggest that the later may serve as valid and reliable estimates of the former in piglets.

AB  - Plants adapt to environmental challenges through complex mechanisms. They rapidly activate metabolic pathways in response to stress, relying on signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) for cell-to-cell communication. Peroxisomes, key subcellular organelles that regulate ROS metabolism and signaling, house a wide enzymatic antioxidant system including catalases (CAT) and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes. This study identifies a set of catalase-dependent transcription factors (TFs) transcriptionally regulated during abiotic and biotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. Additionally, it examines whether their regulation is conserved in an important crop like tomato, aiming to deepen our understanding on the functions of peroxisomes in plant stress responses. The orthologues of these Arabidopsis TFs in tomato were all regulated under stress, responding to different adverse conditions, including salt and heat stress, and pathogen and/or herbivore attack, supporting their conserved functionality in stress responses. The results pinpoint these selected TFs, regulated in response to multiple stresses in Arabidopsis and tomato, as targets for biotechnological applications to enhance crop resilience to cope with climate change challenges.

AB  - Gestational exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Rodents exposed to VPA in utero display common features of ASD, including volumetric dysregulation in higher-order cognitive regions like the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the hippocampus. Exercise has been shown in elderly populations to boost cognition and to buffer against brain volume losses with age. This study employed an adolescent treadmill exercise intervention to facilitate cognitive flexibility and regional brain volume regulation in rats exposed to VPA during gestation. It was found that exercise improved performance on extra-dimensional shifts of attention on a set-shifting task, which is indicative of improved cognitive flexibility. Exercise decreased frontal cortex volume in females, whereas in males exercise increased the ventral hippocampus. These findings suggest that aerobic exercise may be an effective intervention to counteract the altered development of prefrontal and hippocampal regions often observed in ASD.

AB  - Although gibberellic acid (GA) is widely used in agriculture, it is unclear whether exogenous GA makes aphid-infested, mycorrhizal plants more susceptible to herbivory. This study investigates the role of GA in modulating defenses in barrel medic plants (Medicago truncatula) that are infested with pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and colonized by the beneficial symbiont Rhizophagus intraradices. Mock- and R. intraradices-inoculated potted plants were grown in a topsoil: sand mix for 42 days and were treated with GA or solvent. Subsequently, plants were exposed to herbivory or no aphid herbivory for 36 h and 7 days. Afterwards, plant growth parameters, aphid fitness, and foliar phytohormone concentrations were measured. The results revealed that GA regulates plant defenses during arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus-plant-aphid interactions as aphids that fed for 7 days on mycorrhizal, GA-untreated plants weighed more than those that fed on mycorrhizal, GA-treated plants. No major differences were detected in phytohormone levels at 36 h. Overall, mycorrhizal plants showed more shoot biomass compared to non-mycorrhizal controls. The arbuscule density and fungal biomass of R. intraradices were not altered by exogenous GA and aphid herbivory based on molecular markers. This study indicates that exogenous GA may help reduce aphid fitness when feeding on mycorrhizal plants.

AB  - Seasonal migrations are a widespread and broadly successful strategy for animals to exploit periodic and localized resources over large spatial scales. It remains an open and largely case-specific question whether long-distance migrations are resilient to environmental disruptions. High levels of mobility suggest an ability to shift ranges that can confer resilience. On the other hand, a conservative, hard-wired commitment to a risky behavior can be costly if conditions change. Mechanisms that contribute to migration include identification and responsiveness to resources, sociality, and cognitive processes such as spatial memory and learning. Our goal was to explore the extent to which these factors interact not only to maintain a migratory behavior but also to provide resilience against environmental changes. We develop a diffusion-advection model of animal movement in which an endogenous migratory behavior is modified by recent experiences via a memory process, and animals have a social swarming-like behavior over a range of spatial scales. We found that this relatively simple framework was able to adapt to a stable, seasonal resource dynamic under a broad range of parameter values. Furthermore, the model was able to acquire an adaptive migration behavior with time. However, the resilience of the process depended on all the parameters under consideration, with many complex trade-offs. For example, the spatial scale of sociality needed to be large enough to capture changes in the resource, but not so large that the acquired collective information was overly diluted. A long-term reference memory was important for hedging against a highly stochastic process, but a higher weighting of more recent memory was needed for adapting to directional changes in resource phenology. Our model provides a general and versatile framework for exploring the interaction of memory, movement, social and resource dynamics, even as environmental conditions globally are undergoing rapid change.

AB  - The rising popularity of ecotourism on the Tibetan Plateau has intensified the tension between wildlife conservation and economic development. Conventional wildlife displays often fail to achieve high-fidelity, non-invasive representations of animal morphology and typically lack immersive, interactive features, limiting public engagement in ecological protection. To address these limitations, this study presents a fur simulation algorithm based on the Texture Procedural Overlay Technique (TPOT), integrated with Augmented Reality (AR) technology, focusing on the endangered white-lipped deer in the Sanjiangyuan region. The proposed TPOT-based algorithm enhances the visual realism of fur through multi-layered procedural texturing and physical property fusion. Combined with an AR-driven interactive framework, it seamlessly integrates high-resolution 3D models into real-world environments, significantly improving user immersion and engagement. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the approach surpasses traditional static display fidelity and animation rendering efficiency methods. User feedback further validates its effectiveness for scientific research and environmental education. This work introduces an innovative technological solution for wildlife conservation on the Tibetan Plateau and provides a practical reference for applying digital technologies in ecotourism.

AB  - In previous studies using isolated, paced guinea pig left atria, we observed that FSCPX, known as a selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist, paradoxically increased the direct negative inotropic response to A(1) adenosine receptor agonists (determined using concentration/effect (E/c) curves) if NBTI, a nucleoside transport inhibitor, was present. Based on mathematical modeling, we hypothesized that FSCPX blunted the cardiac interstitial adenosine accumulation in response to nucleoside transport blockade, probably by inhibiting CD39 and/or CD73, which are the two main enzymes of the interstitial adenosine production in the heart. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis. In vitro CD39 and CD73 inhibitor assays were carried out; furthermore, E/c curves were constructed in isolated, paced rat and guinea pig left atria using adenosine, CHA and CPA (two A(1) adenosine receptor agonists), FSCPX, NBTI and NBMPR (two nucleoside transport inhibitors), and PSB-12379 (a CD73 inhibitor), measuring the contractile force. We found that FSCPX did not show any inhibitory effect during the in vitro enzyme assays. However, we successfully reproduced the paradox effect of FSCPX in the rat model, mimicked the "paradox" effect of FSCPX with PSB-12379, and demonstrated the lipophilia of FSCPX, which could explain the negative outcome of inhibitor assays with CD39 and CD73 dissolved in a water-based solution. Taken together, these three pieces of indirect evidence are strong enough to indicate that FSCPX possesses an additional action besides the A(1) adenosine receptor antagonism, which action may be the inhibition of an ectonucleotidase. Incidentally, we found that POM-1 inhibited CD73, in addition to CD39.

AB  - Low temperature stress is the main constraint for the stable yield and production of many crops. The differences of the short- and long-term- cold responses remains unclear. In this study, in vitro VS in vivo transcriptome analysis was used to reveal the shared and specific responsive pathways under cold stress. The core responsive pathways were downregulation of photosynthesis, plant-pathogen interaction, DNA replication and repair, pyruvate metabolism; upregulation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; secondary metabolism and sugar metabolism and were enriched during the whole experiment. The significant differences between the short- and long-term cold responses were also observed. The circadian clock, MAPK- and hormonal signaling pathways were upregulated, while fatty acid biosynthesis was downregulated under the short-term cold. Under the long-term cold, response to high light, endocytosis and spliceosome were upregulated, while MAPK- and hormonal signaling were downregulated; amino acids biosynthesis was also enriched. The key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and crosstalk between the secondary metabolism and the other core pathways were revealed in this study. Particularly, several DEGs (polygalacturonase inhibitor, chitinases, disease resistance proteins, uridine 5 ' monophosphate synthase, F-box protein CPR1-like, fatty acid amide hydrolase et al.) which connect plantpathogen interaction, signaling and secondary metabolism were revealed. The obtained results further clarify the key molecular responses to short- and long-term- cold and highlights the possible role of the roots in the coldtolerance of evergreen tree crops.

AB  - The present study investigated the role of neuroinflammation and brain oxidative stress induced by neonatal treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors and disruptive hippocampal neurogenesis in rats by exploring the chemopreventive effects of alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ) as an antioxidant. AGIQ was dietary administered to dams at 0.25% or 0.5% (w/w) from gestational day 18 until postnatal day (PND) 21 on weaning and then to pups until the adult stage on PND 77. The pups were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (1 mg/kg body weight) on PND 3. At PND 6, LPS alone increased Iba1(+) and CD68(+) cell numbers without changing the CD163(+) cell number and strongly upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Nfkb1, and Tnf) in the hippocampus, and increased brain malondialdehyde levels. At PND 10, pups decreased ultrasonic vocalization (USV), suggesting the induction of pro-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress to trigger communicative deficits. By contrast, LPS alone upregulated Nfe2l2 expression at PND 6, increased Iba1(+), CD68(+), and CD163(+) cell numbers, and upregulated Tgfb1 at PND 21, suggesting anti-inflammatory responses until the weaning period. However, LPS alone disrupted hippocampal neurogenesis at weaning and suppressed social interaction parameters and rate of freezing time at fear acquisition and extinction during the adolescent stage. On PND 77, neuroinflammatory responses had mostly disappeared; however, disruptive neurogenesis and fear memory deficits were sustained. AGIQ ameliorated most changes on acute pro-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress at PND 6, and the effects on USVs at PND 10 and neurogenesis and behavioral parameters throughout the adult stage. These results suggested that neonatal LPS treatment induced acute but transient neuroinflammation, triggering the progressive disruption of hippocampal neurogenesis leading to abnormal behaviors in later life. AGIQ treatment was effective for ameliorating LPS-induced progressive changes by critically suppressing initial pro-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.

AB  - The intestinal immune barrier is a developed and complex immune system, and there is a fine synergy between it and the induced immune response. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main metabolites of intestinal microbial fermentation. In the cecum of pigs, SCFAs not only provide energy for the host but also participate in regulating the function of the intestinal immune system. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of SCFAs in the regulation of immune gene expression in porcine cecum. SCFAs content and mRNA expression levels of immune genes in cecum were detected, and Gene Ontology (GO) function annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPI) network construction, key gene identification, and correlation analysis were performed. The results showed that the content of SCFAs in the cecum of Dahe black pigs (DHB) was lower than that of Dahe pigs (DH). There were significant differences in mRNA expression of some immune genes between the two groups. GO functional annotation found terms related to cytokine activity and protein heterodimerization activity; the KEGG pathway was enriched in several pathways related to intestinal immunity. The PPI network identified Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) as key proteins. The correlation analysis showed that acetic acid and valerate were closely related to the immune response. In this study, the differences in cecal short-chain fatty acids and the immune barrier between Dahe pigs and Dahe black pigs were compared, which provided a theoretical basis for improving the intestinal immunity of pigs.

AB  - Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), the hallmark protein responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis in adipose tissue (especially brown adipose tissue) has regained researchers' attention in the context of metabolic disorders following the realization that UCP1 can be activated in adult humans and reconstituted in pigs. Both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are highly dynamic tissues that interact at the metabolic and hormonal level in response to internal and external stress, and they coordinate in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Here, we utilized lipidomics and transcriptomics to identify the altered lipid profiles and regulatory pathways in skeletal muscles from adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (KI) pigs. UCP1 KI changed the contents of glycerophospholipids and acyl carnitines of skeletal muscles. Several metabolic regulatory pathways were more enriched in the UCP1 KI skeletal muscle. Comparison of the transcriptomes of adipose and skeletal muscle suggested that nervous system or chemokine signaling might account for the crosstalk between these two tissues in UCP1 KI pigs. Comparison of the lipid biomarkers from UCP1 KI pigs and other mammals suggested associations between UCP1 KI-induced metabolic alternations and metabolic and muscle dysfunction. Our study reveals the lipid dynamics and transcriptional programs in the skeletal muscle of UCP1 KI pigs and suggests that a network regulates metabolic homeostasis between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

AB  - The nucleus reuniens (RE) of the ventral midline thalamus is strongly reciprocally connected with the hippocampus (HF) and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), serving a critical role in affective and cognitive functioning. While midline thalamic nuclei have been implicated in the modulation of states of arousal and consciousness, few studies have addressed RE's role in behavioral state control. Accordingly, as a first line of investigation, we examined the discharge properties of RE neurons in behaving rats throughout the sleep-wake cycle. We analyzed 153 units in RE which demonstrated heterogeneity in discharge rates and pattern of activity across sleep wake states. Using a rate ratio of activity in wake vs. REM, we found that the majority of cells displayed state-related changes and were classified into distinct cell types, exhibiting their highest discharge rates during active waking (AW), REM sleep, or maintaining equivalent activity across AW/REM. We further distinguished cells as either slow firing (SF = < 10 Hz) or fast firing (FF = > 10 Hz) cells. The majority of cells, independent of state-related preference, were SF. FF RE cells were primarily wake active and wake/REM cell types. This diverse set of RE neurons are likely modulated by key brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei, which in turn, drive RE to exert strong effects on its cortical targets during waking and REM sleep. RE may not only act as a node in HF-PFC circuitry, but also as a critical thalamic link in ascending arousal and attentional networks.

AB  - In an established hepatocyte lipid deposition heat stress model, the expression levels of METTL3 and FTO were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), indicating that METTL3 and FTO play important roles in the process of lipid deposition heat stress in hepatocytes. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that lipid deposition heat stress had significant effects on the linoleic acid, linolenic acid, glycerophospholipid, and arachidonic acid metabolic pathways in hepatocytes. After METTL3 knockdown, the m6A methylation level decreased, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05), the FABP4 and Acc alpha expression levels increased, and the HSP60, HSP70, and HSP110 expression levels decreased significantly. After METTL3 overexpression, the m6A methylation level increased significantly and the expression levels of FABP4, ATGL, Acc alpha, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 decreased significantly, indicating that the overexpression of METTL3 reduced the expression of heat shock genes by inhibiting the lipid-deposition-related gene expression in an m6A-dependent manner. The m6A methylation level increased significantly after FTO knockdown, while HSP60, HSP110, FABP4, ATGL, and Acc alpha expression levels were significantly reduced. Following FTO overexpression, the m6A methylation level and HSP60, HSP90, and HSP110 expression levels significantly decreased, while the ATGL and Acc alpha expression levels significantly increased. This indicates that the overexpression of FTO promoted the expression of lipid-deposition-related genes in an m6A-dependent manner to reduce the expression of heat shock genes. Transcriptome and metabolome sequencing screened a large number of differential genes and metabolites, and a KEGG enrichment analysis showed that m6A methylation mainly regulated heat stress by affecting the TNF, cAMP, MAPK, lipolysis, and synthesis pathways in hepatocytes. In the lipid deposition heat stress model of preadipocytes, the regulation of gene expression was similar to that in hepatocytes.

AB  - Transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCP) are part of long noncoding RNAs, which include short open reading frames and could be translated into small peptides. In recent years, a growing number of TUCPs has been implicated in multiple biological activities, such as embryogenesis and transcriptional regulation. However, the abundance of TUCPs and their roles in goat endometrium during pregnancy recognition (day 16) remain undocumented. In this study, bioinformatics analyses were conducted to identify the differentially expressed (DE) TUCPs between pregnant animals and corresponding nonpregnant controls. A total of 5551 TUCPs were identified; 114 TUCPs were DE in goat endometrium, of which 74 TUCPs were upregulated in pregnant endometrium, whereas 40 TUCPs were downregulated. The related genes of TUCP were predicted by using coexpression and colocalization methods. In summary, 419 genes were predicted by colocalization, and 9464 genes were predicted by coexpression. The kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that TUCPs, which are highly expressed in pregnant endometrium, were mainly associated with endometrial remodeling, nutrient synthesis, and transportation. However, TUCPs that were lowly expressed in pregnant endometrium were mainly associated with immune tolerance, which is necessary for the protection and development of the embryo in the uterus. These findings may be used for the comparative analysis of TUCP transcripts in endometrium and assist in the selection of applicable candidate genes associated with embryo implantation for further functional analyses.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are the most common neuropsychiatric manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Growing evidence have shown that the dorsal hippocampus (dHIPP) and astrocytes (AS) may be involved in regulating depression and anxiety, but the role and mechanism are still unclear, especially in PD-related depression and anxiety. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were used to establish the rat model of PD. Behavioral tests and measurement of monoamine levels in the depression and anxiety related brain regions were performed to investigate the effects of chemogenetic activation or inhibition of dHIPP AS on PD-related anxiety and depression. The present results showed that unilateral lesions of the SNc induced anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, decreased dopamine (DA) levels in some related brain regions, but did not change the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive AS in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus in rats. Chemogenetic inhibition of dHIPP AS significantly improved anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors only in the lesioned rats, while chemogenetic activation of dHIPP AS had no effects on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in sham-operated and the lesioned rats. Chemogenetic activation of dHIPP AS only decreased DA level in the ventral hippocampus (vHIPP) in sham-operated rats, while inhibition of dHIPP AS increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and vHIPP in sham-operated rats and also in the amygdala, mPFC, lateral habenula, dHIPP and vHIPP in the lesioned rats. These results indicate that chemogenetic inhibition of dHIPP AS improves the anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in the lesioned rats through the changes in monoamine in some brain regions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Bovine tuberculosis is a disease that affects cattle and other animal species worldwide and represents a risk to public health. Even though there is a vaccine that has been used to control tuberculosis in humans for almost 100 years, up to now, it has not been used in animals. The reason is that vaccination interferes with the tuberculin test, the current test to diagnose tuberculosis in the field, and shows an inconsistent efficacy in animals. Recent studies report that prime vaccinating with BCG and boosting with proteins vaccinations perform better. In addition, there are reports that some polymers increase the immune response against various infectious diseases; therefore, testing a vaccine formula with polymers sounds like a wise thing to do. In this study, we showed that priming with BCG and boosting with a culture filtrate protein, alone or in combination with a polymer, the number of animals with lesions, the number of lesions per animal, and the size of the lesions in vaccinated animals, compared with those not vaccinated or those vaccinated with BCG alone, are significantly reduced. Our results mean that a vaccination used as a complement of actual tuberculosis control programs in animal populations can be useful to reduce tuberculosis dissemination.
   Attempts to improve the immune response and efficacy of vaccines against tuberculosis in cattle, goats, and other animal species have been the focus of research in this field during the last two decades. Improving the vaccine efficacy is essential prior to running long-lasting and expensive field trials. Studies have shown that vaccine protocols utilizing boosting with proteins improve the vaccine efficacy. The use of polymers such as chitosan and PolyLactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) improves the immune response against different diseases by improving the interaction of antigens with the cellular immune system and modulating the host immune response. This study shows that the prime BCG vaccination, boosted with a culture filtrate protein (CFP), alone or in combination with chitosan and PolyLactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA), have the potential to reduce tuberculosis (TB) dissemination by reducing the number of animals with lesions, the number of lesions per animal, and the size of the lesions in vaccinated animals, compared with those not vaccinated or those vaccinated with BCG alone. The vaccinated groups showed significantly higher Interferon-gamma levels in the blood compared to the control, nonvaccinated group after vaccination, after boosting, and after the challenge with the wild-type Mycobacterium bovis strain.

AB  - The assimilation, retention, and release of nutrients by animals fundamentally shapes their physiology and contributions to ecological processes (e.g., zoogeochemistry). Yet, information on the transit of nutrients through the bodies of large mammals remains scarce. Here, we examined how sodium (Na), a key element for animal health and ecosystem functioning, travels differently through fecal and urinary systems of cows (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus ferus caballus). We provided a large dose of Na and compared its timing of release in feces and urine to that of nonabsorbable markers. Na excretion by urine occurred approximately twice as fast as excretion by feces, yet both were shorter than indigestible particle markers. These differences correspond to rapid absorption of Na in the upper gastrointestinal tract and transport by blood to the kidneys (urine Na excretion) or resecretion of Na into the lower intestinal tract (fecal Na excretion). Interestingly, for cows, we found a second peak of Na excretion in urine and feces > 96 h after dosage. This result may indicate that surplus Na can be rapidly absorbed and stored in specific body cells (e.g., skin), from which it is later released. Using a propagule dispersal model, we found that the distance of cattle- and horse-driven nutrient dispersal by urine was 31% and 36% less than the fecal pathway and 60% and 41% less than the particle marker pathway, which is commonly used to estimate nutrient dispersal. Future physiological and zoogeochemical studies should resolve different pathways of nutrient retention and release from large mammals.

AB  - Anthracnose of oak (Quercus) caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of the most common diseases in oak forests. To investigate the species diversity of Colletotrichum associated with oak anthracnose, symptomatic leaf samples of three oak species (Q. acutissima, Q. mongolica and Q. variabilis) were collected from Anhui, Hainan, Henan, Shaanxi and Shandong Provinces, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Beijing City in China from 2019 to 2022. A total of 219 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained and identified by morphological and phylogenetic analyses of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), chitin synthase 1 (chs-1), actin (act) and & beta;-tubulin (tub2) sequences. Nine species were identified: C. fioriniae (two isolates, 0.9%), C. camellia-japonicae (two isolates, 0.9%), C. karstii (three isolates, 1.4%), C. quercicola (two isolates, 0.9%), C. aenigma (three isolates, 1.4%), C. endophyticum (two isolates, 0.9%), C. fructicola (68 isolates, 31.1%), C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto (74 isolates, 33.8%) and C. siamense (63 isolates, 28.8%). Pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's postulates, which showed that five species (C. camellia-japonicae, C. endophyticum, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s. s. and C. siamense) caused Q. acutissima anthracnose, four species (C. karstii, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s. s. and C. siamense) caused Q. mongolica anthracnose and six species (C. fioriniae, C. quercicola, C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s. s. and C. siamense) caused Q. variabilis anthracnose. This study demonstrates the pathogenic species diversity of Colletotrichum on Q. acutissima, Q. mongolica and Q. variabilis.

AB  - Little is known about Cryptosporidium and Giardia in biogas waste and humans in Vietnam. There is a potential risk of infections during or after using the biogas system. The detected protozoan genotypes are zoonotic pathogens, and con-tamination of vegetables may relay through runoff to the surface waters and soil. The objective of this study was to understand the role of the environment in the epidemiology of human infections in Bac Giang province, Vietnam, with a focus on investigating the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. genotypes and Giardia assemblages among 239 en-vironmental samples and 94 faecal samples of biogas users. PCR and sequencing analysis were used to identify the oc-currence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in these samples. Results showed that 13/333 (3.9 %) and 9/ 333 (2.7 %) samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cysts, respectively. Characterization revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium scrofarum, C. suis, C. meleagridis, C. bailey and Giardia intestinalis assemblage A and E. C. scrofarum and Giardia assemblage E were identified for the first time in humans in Bac Giang. The current informa-tion from the above investigations will be valuable for protozoan source tracking and control interventions against Cryptosporidium and Giardia infection associated with biogas wastes in Vietnam.

AB  - The ever-increasing human population, the problem associated with climate change and recent crises-COVID-19 disease and trade conflicts-all impacted on the availability and cost of animal feed raw materials. This is clearly visible in realities which heavily rely on importation such as islands and small states, where producers involved in the agricultural sector were strongly affected by the sharp increase in prices. To deal with these global issues, alternative resources are perceived to replace conventional ingredients. This work aimed at assessing the nutritive value of different resources (sheep feed, mature carob, Maltese bread, wild asparagus, prickly lettuce, and loquat) for small ruminants present in the Maltese Islands, analyzing their chemical composition, gas production kinetics and antioxidant properties. In general, the variation in chemical composition resulted in different rumen fermentation kinetics (p < 0.007). The ratio between GP-24 h and GP-48 h was higher in Maltese bread than other substrates; loquat, prickly lettuce and wild asparagus showed lower fermentation kinetics in accordance with their high NDF and ADF contents. The antioxidant activity may be partially related to the polyphenolic content that was higher in wild asparagus, prickly lettuce and loquat. All feed characteristic confirmed their potential to be included as ingredients in ruminant diets and as a source of fiber.

AB  - Research into the impact of sociality on stress has largely focused on social factors as stressors, but it is now wellknown that the mere presence of a conspecific can reduce an animal's stress - a phenomenon termed 'social buffering'. Stress, in terms of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, is in itself a versatile mechanism appearing to optimise fitness. Reduction of the stress response would thus also be expected to serve some evolutionary end. Buffering requires that the focal animal registers its conspecific's presence, and transduces that to a physiological result - the former can be via many sensory modalities, whilst the latter largely works through the oxytocin pathway. Simultaneously, many intrinsic and extrinsic variables may modulate the buffering process or block it completely. By examining the mechanisms of buffering, as well as how the effect is mediated by various factors, this paper discusses the nature of the process as well as its possible adaptive functions. Studying the mechanisms and functions underlying social buffering will not only deepen our understanding of both stress and sociality, but also inform our attempts to improve animal health, fitness and welfare.

AB  - To promote sustainable development in urban environments, minimising the reflected light pollution from glass curtain walls is critical. This study investigates numerical evaluation methods for assessing the impact of curtain wall-reflected light on road traffic light pollution. While existing research focuses on indoor glare and static target pollution, limited attention has been given to the dynamic impacts on moving traffic participants. This research evaluates light pollution (discomfort glare) induced by triple-layer hollow glass curtain walls in green buildings. A mathematical model predicting the solar reflection characteristics (reflectivity and brightness) was established using optical equations, with the accuracy verified through field experiments and numerical simulations. Subsequently, a driver discomfort glare (DDG) evaluation model was developed, incorporating the dynamic relationships between reflected light sources and drivers, including relative position variations, vertical eye illumination, and correlations between sightlines, driving speed, and road terrain. A numerical simulation system was implemented using Rhino's Ladybug + Honeybee tools, demonstrated through a case analysis of high-rise buildings in Dalian. The system simulated glare effects under sunny/snowy conditions while examining thickness-related variations. The results revealed significant correlations between the glass thickness, weather conditions, and discomfort glare intensity. The proposed DDG model and simulation approach offer practical tools for assessing dynamic light pollution impacts, supporting the theoretical evaluation of outdoor light environments in green buildings. This methodology provides an effective framework for analysing the moving-target light pollution from architectural reflections, advancing sustainable urban design strategies.

AB  - Muscle growth is essential for the economic sustainability of the swine industry. Gaining a deeper understanding of pig muscle development is crucial for improving both the quantity and quality of pork production. This study employed RNA-seq technology to conduct a transcriptomic analysis of the longissimus dorsi muscle (LD) in three different pig breeds with varying body sizes and growth rates: Tibetan pigs (TP), Wujin pigs (WJ), and large white pigs (LW). Significant differences in gene expression were observed among the different breeds. We identified that myosin light chain 4 (MYL4) plays a role in influencing muscle growth. Experimental validation confirmed that MYL4 promotes skeletal muscle cell proliferation and inhibits degradation. These findings reveal the molecular mechanisms that control muscle growth and provide valuable insights for improving pig breeding practices, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and quality of meat production. Muscle growth stands as a pivotal economic trait within pig production, governed by a complex interplay of multiple genes, each playing a role in its quantitative manifestation. Understanding the intricate regulatory mechanisms of porcine muscle development is crucial for enhancing both pork yield and quality. This study used the GSE99749 dataset downloaded from the GEO database, conducting a detailed analysis of the RNA-seq results from the longissimus dorsi muscle (LD) of Tibetan pigs (TP), Wujin pigs (WJ) and large white pigs (LW) at 60 days of gestation, representing diverse body sizes and growth rates. Comparative analyses between TPvsWJ and TPvsLW, along with differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, revealed 1048 and 1157 significantly differentially expressed genes (p < 0.001) in TPvsWJ and TPvsLW, respectively. With stricter screening criteria, 37 DEGs were found to overlap between the 2 groups. PPI analysis identified MYL5, MYL4, and ACTC1 as the three core genes. This article focuses on exploring the MYL4 gene. Molecular-level experimental validation, through overexpression and interference of the MYL4 gene combined with EDU staining experiments, demonstrated that overexpression of MYL4 significantly promoted the proliferation of porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSMSC), while interference with MYL4 inhibited their proliferation. Furthermore, by examining the effects of overexpressing and interfering with the MYL4 gene on the muscle hypertrophy marker Fst gene and the muscle degradation marker FOXO3 gene, the pivotal role of the MYL4 gene in promoting muscle growth and preventing muscle degradation was further confirmed. These findings offer a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms behind porcine muscle growth and development, furnishing valuable data and insights for muscle biology research.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;In Europe, tail docking in swine is prohibited as a routine measure, but the risk of tail biting outbreaks is increased in pigs with intact tails. An important measure to minimise this risk is the provision of enrichment material, which is challenging in conventional confinement buildings with fully slatted floors. In this study, the effect of an interactive straw-filled rooting tower was tested under field conditions with respect to the prevalence of tail lesions and behaviour. Although tail biting could not be prevented in pigs with intact tails, tail lesions were less frequent and less severe compared to pigs which had no access to straw but were only exposed to the stationary tower as a placeholder (control group). Increased manipulation of the rooting tower around feeding times reflected the typical porcine ambition for simultaneous feed uptake in a group. In addition, tail manipulation was less common than head manipulation in pigs with access to the interactive tower. The rooting tower can be used in addition to other measures as a preventive and intervening tool to deal with tail biting in pigs with intact tails, and on farms with fully slatted floors.<br>Eight pens (25 pigs/pen; n = 200) provided with an interactive straw-filled rooting tower (experimental group) and five pens (25 pigs/pen; n = 125) with a stationary (fixed) tower without straw (control group) were compared within three fattening periods on a conventional farm with fully slatted flooring. The effectiveness of the tower to trigger favourable behaviour in feeding and outside feeding periods was assessed. The incidence of deep tail injuries was lower in the experimental group (experimental group: Odds Ratio 0.3, p < 0.001) and was influenced by the batch (Odds Ratio: 2.38, p < 0.001) but not by pen and sex. In spring, most pens were excluded due to severe tail biting. Tail injury scores were more severe in the control group in weeks 5, 6 and 7 compared to the experimental group (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Tower manipulation was more frequent during feeding compared to outside feeding time (p = 0.002). More head than tail manipulation occurred in the experimental group (p = 0.03). The interactive tower as the only measure was not appropriate to reduce tail biting sufficiently in pigs with intact tails on a conventional fattening farm.

AB  - Plant structural traits can act as barriers for herbivore attachment, feeding, and oviposition. In particular, epicuticular waxes (EWs) on the aerial surfaces of many land plants offer protection from biotic and abiotic stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), mutations that reduce EWs have been previously reported. However, whether such mutations affect rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith) performance has not been investigated yet. These pests cause significant economic problems in important rice-producing areas of the United States. The aim of our study was to characterize the EWs of EW mutants and wild-type rice plants by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compare the resistance of mutant and wild-type plants against rice water weevil and fall armyworm. We hypothesized that mutants with reduced EWs would have weaker resistance to pests than wild-type plants. Three mutant lines (6-1A, 7-17A, and 11-39A) and their wild-type parent (cv. 'Sabine') were used to test this hypothesis. Levels of EWs were significantly lower in mutant lines than in the wild-type, and qualitative differences in EW composition were also observed. Reduction in EWs significantly affected performance of insects in experiments conducted under greenhouse conditions. Experiments with rice water weevils were conducted in arenas in which females were given a choice of the mutants and the wild-type for oviposition. Number of first instars emerging from the three EW mutants (an indication of oviposition preference) was higher on the three EW mutants than on wild-type plants with normal wax levels. Similarly, in no-choice experiments using whole plants or detached leaves, weight gains of armyworms on leaves were higher on the mutant lines than on the wild-type. These results indicate that EW traits are involved in rice resistance to weevils and armyworms. Understanding the plant traits that contribute to resistance to rice pests will be helpful for the development of resistant varieties for reducing pest insect damage.

AB  - An outstanding issue in the study of insect host races concerns the idea of 'recursive adaptive divergence', whereby adaptation can occur repeatedly across space and/or time, and the most recent adaptive episode is defined by one or more previously similar cases. The host plant shift of the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh) (Diptera: Tephritidae, Carpomyini), from ancestral downy hawthorn [Crataegus mollis (Torr. & A. Gray) Scheele] to introduced, domesticated apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in the eastern USA has long served as a model system for investigating ecologically driven host race formation in phytophagous insect specialists. Here, we report results from an annual geography survey of eclosion time demonstrating a similar ecological pattern among nascent host-associated populations of the fly recently introduced ca. 40 years ago from its native range in the east into the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA. Specifically, using data collected from 25 locations across 5 years, we show that apple-infesting fly populations in the PNW have rapidly and repeatedly shifted (and maintained differences in) their adult eclosion life-history timing to infest two novel hawthorn hosts with different fruiting phenologies - a native species (Crataegus douglasii Lindl.) and an introduced species (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) - generating partial allochronic reproductive isolation in the process. The shifts in the PNW parallel the classic case of host race formation in the eastern USA, but have occurred bi-directionally to two hawthorn species with phenologies slightly earlier (black hawthorn) and significantly later (ornamental hawthorn) than apple. Our results imply that R. pomonella can both possess and retain extensive-standing variation (i.e., 'adaptive memory') in diapause traits, even following introductions, to rapidly and temporally track novel phenological host opportunities when they arise. Thus, 'specialized' host races may not constitute evolutionary dead ends. Rather, adaptive phenotypic and genetic memory may carry over from one host shift to the next, recursively facilitating host race formation in phytophagous insects.

AB  - Phenolics, like tannins, are plant-specialized metabolites that play a protective role against herbivory. Tannins can reduce palatability and bind with proteins to reduce digestibility, acting as deterrents to feeding and impacting nutrient extraction by herbivores. Some assays measure tannin and total phenolics content in plants but lack determination of their biological effects, hindering the interpretation of tannin function in herbivory and its impacts on animal behavior and ecology. In this study, we successfully applied the radial diffusion assay to assess tannin protein precipitation (PP) capacity and evaluate the anti-nutritional effects of tannins in food plants (n = 24) consumed by free-ranging black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) in Tabasco, Mexico. We found PP rings in five plant species consumed by the monkeys. The mature fruit of Inga edulis was the most consumed food plant, despite having a high tannin PP capacity (56.66 mg tannic acid equivalent/g dry matter). These findings highlight the presence of tannins in the black howler diet and provide insight into the primates' resilience and potential strategies for coping with anti-nutritional aspects of the diet.

AB  - Physical exercise not only helps to improve physical health but can also enhance brain development and cognition. Recent reports on parental (both maternal and paternal) effects raise the possibility that parental exercise may provide benefits to offspring through intergenerational inheritance. However, the general magnitude and consistency of parental exercise effects on offspring is still controversial. Additionally, empirical research has long overlooked an important aspect of exercise: its effects on variability in neurodevelopmental and cognitive traits. Here, we compiled data from 52 studies involving 4786 rodents (412 effect sizes) to quantify the intergenerational transmission of exercise effects on brain and cognition. Using a multilevel meta-analytic approach, we found that, overall, parental exercise showed a tendency for increasing their offspring's brain structure by 12.7% (albeit statistically non-significant) probably via significantly facilitating neurogenesis (16.5%). Such changes in neural anatomy go in hand with a significant 20.8% improvement in neurobehaviour (improved learning and memory, and reduced anxiety). Moreover, we found parental exercise significantly reduces inter-individual differences (i.e. reduced variance in the treatment group) in progeny's neurobehaviour by 10.2% (coefficient of variation ratio, lnCVR), suggesting the existence of an individual by intervention interaction. The positive effects of exercise are modulated by several covariates (i.e. moderators), such as the exercised parent's sex, offspring's sex, and age, mode of exercise, and exercise timing. In particular, parental forced exercise is more efficient than voluntary exercise at significantly improving offspring neurobehaviour (26.0%) and reducing its variability (14.2%). We observed larger effects when parental exercise started before pregnancy. However, exercising only during pregnancy also had positive effects. Mechanistically, exercise significantly upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by 28.9%, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by 35.8%, and significantly decreased hippocampal DNA methylation by 3.5%, suggesting that brain growth factor cascades and epigenetic modifications can moderate the transmission of parental exercise effects. Collectively, by coupling mean with variance effects, our analyses draw a more integrated picture of the benefits that parental exercise has on offspring: not only does it improve offspring brain development and cognitive performance, but it also reduces inter-individual differences in cognition-related traits. We advocate that meta-analysis of variation together with the mean of a trait provides novel insights for old controversies as well as emerging new questions, opening up a new era for generating variance-based hypotheses.

AB  - Climate change is a current concern that directly and indirectly affects agriculture, especially the livestock sector. Neonatal piglets have a limited thermoregulatory capacity and are particularly stressed by ambient temperatures outside their optimal physiological range, which has a major impact on their survival rate. In this study, we focused on the effects of thermal stress (35 degrees C, 39 degrees C, and 41 degrees C compared to 37 degrees C) on differentiating myotubes derived from the satellite cells of Musculus rhomboideus, isolated from two different developmental stages of thermolabile 5-day-old (p5) and thermostable 20-day-old piglets (p20). Analysis revealed statistically significant differential expression genes (DEGs) between the different cultivation temperatures, with a higher number of genes responding to cold treatment. These DEGs were involved in the macromolecule degradation and actin kinase cytoskeleton categories and were observed at lower temperatures (35 degrees C), whereas at higher temperatures (39 degrees C and 41 degrees C), the protein transport system, endoplasmic reticulum system, and ATP activity were more pronounced. Gene expression profiling of HSP and RBM gene families, which are commonly associated with cold and heat responses, exhibited a pattern dependent on temperature variability. Moreover, thermal stress exhibited an inhibitory effect on cell cycle, with a more pronounced downregulation during cold stress driven by ADGR genes. Additionally, our analysis revealed DEGs from donors with an undeveloped thermoregulation capacity (p5) and those with a fully developed thermoregulation capacity (p20) under various cultivation temperature. The highest number of DEGs and significant GO terms was observed under temperatures of 35 degrees C and 37 degrees C. In particular, under 35 degrees C, the DEGs were enriched in insulin, thyroid hormone, and calcium signaling pathways. This result suggests that the different thermoregulatory capacities of the donor piglets determined the ability of the primary muscle cell culture to differentiate into myotubes at different temperatures. This work sheds new light on the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern piglet differentiating myotube response to thermal stress and can be leveraged to develop effective thermal management strategies to enhance skeletal muscle growth.

AB  - Olfactory receptors (ORs) are members of the transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, playing a crucial role in odor recognition, which further mediates crucial biological processes in mammals. In sows, androstenone can trigger sexual behaviors through olfaction, but the underlying mechanism remains to be explored. To efficiently and accurately screen pig olfactory receptors responding to androstenone and the key structure determinant, we adapted the high-throughput RNA-seq strategy to screen the altered genes upon androstenone treatment in the olfactory epithelium of pigs, yielding 1397 downregulated genes. Of which, 15 OR genes and 49 OR-like genes were candidate androstenone-responsive genes, and 5 ORs (OR2D2, OR8D1, OR8D2, OR10Z1 and OR7D4) were proven as responsible for androstenone-mediated olfaction in vitro. Among the five ORs, pig OR7D4 has the highest level of androstenone response. To further find the structural determinant, we performed ligand-binding cavity analysis on pig OR7D4 with androstenone, predicted seven potential structural sites and further confirmed that F178 and T203 are the key sites for recognizing androstenone. Nevertheless, the natural non-synonymous mutation M133V (rs696400829) of pig OR7D4 was proven to significantly impair the respondence to androstenone. This is the first time the ORs responding to androstenone in pigs and the key structural determinant of pig OR7D4 were identified, which highlights the significance of investigating the role of OR7D4 in pig reproduction performance in the future.

AB  - Although essential for life, copper is also potentially toxic in concentrations that surpass physiological thresholds. The high-osmolarity glycerol pathway of yeast is the main regulator of adaptive responses and is known to play crucial roles in the responses to various stressors. The objective of this research is to determine whether the HOG pathway could be activated and to investigate the possible interplay of the HOG pathway and oxidative stress due to copper exposure. In this research, we demonstrate that copper could induce oxidative stress, including the elevated concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Increased combination with GSH, increased intracellular SOD activity, and the up-regulation of relevant genes can help cells defend themselves against oxidative toxicity. The results show that copper treatment triggers marked and prolonged Hog1 phosphorylation. Significantly, oxidative stress generated by copper toxicity is essential for the activation of Hog1. Activated Hog1 is translocated to the nucleus to regulate the expressions of genes such as CTT1, GPD1, and HSP12, among others. Furthermore, copper exposure induced significant G1-phase cell cycle arrest, while Hog1 partially participated in the regulation of cell cycle progression. These novel findings reveal another role for Hog1 in the regulation of copper-induced cellular stress.

AB  - Camphor, Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl, is used for mothproofing material due to its content of secondary metabolites. However, the phloem-feeding weevil, Pagiophloeus tsushimanus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been observed to feed exclusively on this plant without incurring apparent fitness costs. This phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of essential oil extracted from the phloem of camphor tree was performed. The top three components, all monoterpenoids, were eucalyptol (31.9%), D-camphor (19.2%) and linalool (10.2%), respectively. In headspace bioassays, both eggs and larvae showed the greatest sensitivity to eucalyptol, and there was a bell-shaped relationship between the concentrations used and developmental time for eggs when exposed to D-camphor volatile. Exposure to essential oil mixture and D-camphor notably increased the activity of glutathione S-transferase in the weevil. A corresponding short-term induction of gene expression was also observed according to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. In general, P. tsushimanus possessed various levels of tolerance to different host monoterpenoids. Over-expression of glutathione S-transferase in vivo probably relates to detoxification metabolism of these monoterpenoids. Our findings provide a valuable clue to understanding the mechanism underlying resistance to host-specific chemical defences in this weevil pest.

AB  - We here re-evaluate the skeletal anatomy and the systematic position of the two Eocene guitarfish species represented by almost complete and articulated material from the Konservat-Lagerstatten of Bolca in Italy. The analyses of morphometric, skeletal and dental features of Whinobatos' dezignii and 'R.' primaevus allow them to be excluded from the living guitarfish genus Rhinobatos and assigned to the new genera Pseudorhinobatos gen. nov. and Eorhinobatos gen. nov., respectively. The placement of these new genera within the rhinopristiform family Rhinobatidae is based on the possession of a series of morphological features (e.g. pectoral fins fused to head forming a wedge-shaped pectoral disc; rostral cartilage extending to the tip of the snout; nuchal cartilages and hornlike processes of nasal capsules absent; teeth with Rhinobatos-like morphology displaying smooth enameloid, central uvula and two lateral uvulae) that unambiguously exclude their assignment to any other rhinopristiform family. A new morphology-based phylogenetic analysis that includes the two new fossil genera, described herein, provides novel insights into the relationships of the Batoidea and recovers the Rhinopristiformes as a paraphyletic group. This indicates that the monophyly of extant taxa could be the result of the extinction of crucial taxa.

AB  - In arid regions with summer rainfall, herbivorous reptiles are able to acquire water and fresh food in the presence of high environmental temperatures that can promote ectotherm activity. However, extremely high temperatures and below average rainfall may also limit foraging opportunities due to risks of overheating and predation while gathering scarce food. Karoo Dwarf Tortoises (Chersobius boulengeri) inhabit an arid region in South Africa where most rains fall around austral summer (October-May). We used focal-animal observations and instantaneous recording to assess their behavioral patterns. Despite relatively high rainfall and available plant growth, Karoo Dwarf Tortoises spent approximately 80-90% of their time in retreats. Whereas activity (behavior outside retreats) in the spring was unrelated to time of the day, possibly due to moderate ambient temperatures, activity in the summer was restricted to the afternoon and evening, when tortoises walked and scanned for food and retreats, and fed only 11 min/d on average. In summer, body temperature of tortoises within retreats was positively associated with retreat temperatures, but tortoises appeared to thermoregulate using bodily postures and possibly other means. We suggest that Karoo Dwarf Tortoises mitigate predation risks by maintaining a low level of activity and thermoregulating within retreats. The short feeding time of Karoo Dwarf Tortoises compared to other tortoise taxa may result in slow growth and reproductive rates, which might in turn affect population resilience and conservation needs of this endangered species.

AB  - The KIX domain, conserved among various nuclear and co-activator factors, acts as a binding site that interacts with other transcriptional activators and co-activators, playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. In plants, the KIX domain is involved in plant hormone signaling, stress response regulation, cell cycle control, and differentiation, indicating its potential relevance to crop productivity. This study aims to identify and characterize KIX domains within the soybean (Glycine max L.) genome to predict their potential role in improving crop productivity. The conservation and evolutionary history of the KIX domains were explored in 59 plant species, confirming the presence of the KIX domains in diverse plants. Specifically, 13 KIX domains were identified within the soybean genome and classified into four main groups, namely GmKIX8/9, GmMED15, GmHAC, and GmRECQL, through sequence alignment, structural analysis, and phylogenetic tree construction. Association analysis was performed between KIX domain haplotypes and soybean seed-related agronomic traits using re-sequencing data from a core collection of 422 accessions. The results revealed correlations between SNP variations observed in GmKIX8-3 and GmMED15-4 and soybean seed phenotypic traits. Additionally, transcriptome analysis confirmed significant expression of the KIX domains during the early stages of soybean seed development. This study provides the first characterization of the structural, expression, genomic haplotype, and molecular features of the KIX domain in soybean, offering a foundation for functional analysis of the KIX domain in soybean and other plants.

AB  - Counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions-those that directly protect target wildlife from illegal harvest/persecution, detect and sanction rule-breakers, and interdict and control illegal wildlife commodities-are widely applied to address biodiversity loss. This systematic map provides an overview of the literature on the effectiveness of CWC interventions for conserving African, Asian and Latin American wildlife directly threatened by exploitation, including human-wildlife conflicts that trigger poaching. Following our systematic map protocol (Rytwinski, ockerman, et al., 2021), we compiled peer-reviewed and grey literature and screened articles using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Included studies were coded for key variables of interest, from which we produced a searchable database, interactive map and structured heatmaps. A total of 530 studies from 477 articles were included in the systematic map. Most studies were from Africa and Asia (81% of studies) and focused on African and Asian elephants (16%), felids (14%) and turtles and tortoises (11%). Most evaluations of CWC interventions targeted wildlife products (rather than species) and the transfer of those products along the wildlife crime continuum (40% of cases). Population/species outcomes were most commonly measured via indicators of threat reduction (65% of cases) and intermediate outcomes (25%). We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between (1) patrols and other preventative actions to increase detection and population abundance and (2) information analysis and sharing and wildlife crime/trade levels. However, the effectiveness of most interventions was not rigorously evaluated. Most investigations used post-implementation monitoring only (e.g. lacking a comparator), and no experimental designs were found. We identified several key knowledge gaps including a paucity of studies by geography (Latin America), taxonomy (plants, birds and reptiles), interventions (non-patrol-based CWC interventions) and outcomes (biological and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes). Our map reveals an opportunity to improve the rigour and documentation of CWC intervention evaluations, which would enable the evidence-based selection of effective approaches to improve wildlife conservation and national security.
   Results of our systematic map indicate that despite a relatively large evidence base on the effectiveness of counter-wildlife crime (CWC) interventions for conserving wildlife, most interventions have not been rigorously evaluated. Studies often lacked comparators and experimental designs. We also identify several knowledge gaps that deserve further study, including further investigations in Latin America, on plants, birds and reptiles, for non-patrol-based CWC interventions, and in relation to biological, and the combination of biological and human well-being outcomes. Our assessment of the evidence base provides important first steps towards improving our understanding of CWC intervention effectiveness and making evidence-informed management and funding decisions.image

AB  - Resolving the genomic basis underlying phenotypic variations is a question of great importance in evolutionary biology. However, understanding how genotypes determine the phenotypes is still challenging. Centuries of artificial selective breeding for beauty and aggression resulted in a plethora of colors, long-fin varieties, and hyper-aggressive behavior in the air-breathing Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), supplying an excellent system for studying the genomic basis of phenotypic variations. Combining whole-genome sequencing, quantitative trait loci mapping, genome-wide association studies, and genome editing, we investigated the genomic basis of huge morphological variation in fins and striking differences in coloration in the fighting fish. Results revealed that the double tail, elephant ear, albino, and fin spot mutants each were determined by single major-effect loci. The elephant ear phenotype was likely related to differential expression of a potassium ion channel gene, kcnh8. The albinotic phenotype was likely linked to a cis-regulatory element acting on the mitfa gene and the double-tail mutant was suggested to be caused by a deletion in a zic1/zic4 coenhancer. Our data highlight that major loci and cis-regulatory elements play important roles in bringing about phenotypic innovations and establish Bettas as new powerful model to study the genomic basis of evolved changes.

AB  - Camellia contains tea, oil camellia, and camellias which benefit people globally. Its infrageneric classification is, however, controversial and unstable, and former phylogenetic analyses failed to yield robust and consistent trees. Here, we aimed to reconstruct a robust phylogenetic tree, date all clades and discuss the evolutionary history of Camellia. Emphasizing the taxonomically comprehensive sampling rather than more DNA data, orthologous nuclear RPB2 introns 11-15 and 23, and waxy were sequenced for 99 taxa of Camellia to reconstruct its phylogenetic history. Ten clades are identified in Camellia: Camellia II, Camelliopsis, Corallina, Furfuracea, Heterogenea, Paracamellia, Piquetia, Stereocarpus, Thea and Yellow camellias II. Camellia grijsii and C. shensiensis are not closely related with other oil camellias that form the clade Paracamellia. Sections Camelliopsis and Theopsis together form the clade Camelliopsis, while clade Furfuracea consists of sect. Furfuracea and C. hongkongensis. Camellia connata is separated from C. lanceolata but nested in the clade Heterogenea, and C. longissima is nested in the clade Thea, suggesting a new germplasm for tea breeding. Molecular dating using four fossil calibration points suggests that the crown age of Camellia is 39.5 Ma with clade Corallina probably the earliest infrageneric clade to diversify and the most widespread clade, Paracamellia, the latest. Our findings provide new insights into the phylogenetic relationships, systematics and evolutionary history of Camellia.

AB  - Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles with a proven intercellular signaling role in inflammation processes and immune response. Due to their natural origin and liposome-like structure, these nanometer-scale vesicles have emerged as novel platforms for therapy and diagnosis. In this work, goat milk exosomes are isolated and fully characterized in terms of their physicochemical properties, proteomics, and biochemical profile in healthy mice, and used to detect inflammatory processes by optical imaging. For the in vitro and in vivo experiments, the exosomes are covalently labeled with the commercial fluorophores sulfo-Cyanine 5 and BODIPY-FL to create nanoprobes. In vitro studies using confocal imaging, flow cytometry, and colorimetric assays confirm the internalization of the nanoprobes as well their lack of cytotoxicity in macrophage populations RAW 264.7. Optical imaging in the mouse peritoneal region confirms the in vivo ability of one of the nanoprobes to localize inflammatory processes. In vivo imaging shows exosome uptake in the inflamed peritoneal region, and flow-cytometric analysis of peritonitis exudates confirms the uptake by macrophage and neutrophil populations. These results support the promising use of goat milk exosomes as natural probes in the detection of inflammatory processes.

KW  - SIZE
AB  - The appropriate sizes of scale-breeding industries are causing increasing attention in that rational scale-breeding industries may both meet the meat demand of the market and avoid serious environmental problems. In this paper, the appropriate scales of breeding-type family farms were studied from the perspective of quantifying resource losses. The mathematical models about quantifying resource losses were built, and then the evaluation index system of resource losses was established. More than one hundred family farms in Sichuan province and Chongqing city of China located in the subtropics were selected as research cases and were classified as small-, medium- and large-scale family farms, whose unit resource losses and resource loss rates were both evaluated by the index system. Results show that the unit resource losses and the resource loss rate of medium-scale family farms are the lowest among these three kinds of family farms. Therefore, medium-scale farms are moderate, and then are recommended for scale-breeding industries. Implications: Appropriate sizes are essential for the green development of scale-breeding industries. The external environment factors and internal resource effect should be considered. The unit resource losses and the resource loss rate of medium-scale family farms are the lowest among these three kinds of family farms. Therefore, medium-scale farms are optimistic, and then are recommended for scale-breeding industries. For medium-scale family farms, the scale of 800-999 pigs is optimistic. Furthermore, it is very necessary to adopt green cycle.

AB  - Doxycycline is an antibiotic that has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant-like effects. Low doses of doxycycline revert the behavioral and neuroinflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide treatment in a mice model of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the antidepressant action of doxycycline are not yet understood. Doxycycline inhibits the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), which increases after stress exposure. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibition also causes antidepressant-like effects in animal models sensitive to antidepressant-like effects such as the forced swimming test (FST). However, no direct study has yet investigated if the antidepressant-like effects of doxycycline could involve changes in NO-mediated neurotransmission. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating: i) the behavioral effects induced by doxycycline alone or in association with ineffective doses of a NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) or an iNOS inhibitor (1400 W) in mice subjected to the FST; and ii) doxycycline effects in NO metabolite levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus these animals. Male mice (8 weeks) received i.p. injection of saline or doxycycline (10, 30, and 50 mg/kg), alone or combined with SNP (0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) or 1400 W (1, 3, and 10 mu g/kg), and 30 min later were submitted to the FST. Animals were sacrificed immediately after, and NO metabolites nitrate/nitrite (NOx) were measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Doxycycline (50 mg/kg) reduced both the immobility time in the FST and NOx levels in the prefrontal cortex of mice compared to the saline group. The antidepressant-like effect of doxycycline in the FST was prevented by SNP (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. Additionally, sub-effective doses of doxycycline (30 mg/kg) associated with 1400 W (1 mu g/kg) induced an antidepressant-like effect in the FST. Altogether, our data suggest that the reducing NO levels in the prefrontal cortex through inhibition of iNOS could be related to acute doxycycline treatment resulting in rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice.

AB  - The study examined the kin-recognition ability in the third and fourth instars of two predatory ladybirds, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius), by investigating the impact of relatedness, food quality and hunger on the avoidance of kin-cannibalism. Higher instars of both species cannibalized more non-relative first instars than the relative ones, suggesting that they can distinguish kin and abstain from cannibalizing them. The frequency of cannibalism among these larvae increased when victims were fed on dissimilar and unsuitable diets compared to those fed on the same diet as the cannibals. Cannibalistic tendencies were delayed when victims were fed on the same and appropriate diet. Fourth instars of both species had greater encounters with victims whose diets differed. Hungrier larvae of both species had more encounters and incidences of cannibalism with a shorter latency period than their satiated counterparts. It is inferred that hunger, lack of access to natural food, and challenges during molting or pupation instigate ladybird instars to engage in cannibalism. Nevertheless, when relatives are presented as food, the frequency of larval cannibalism decreases. The rate of cannibalism was higher in M. sexmaculatus compared to H. variegata, as the former is a more aggressive predator.

AB  - (1) Objectives: Understanding the genetic basis of muscle development and meat quality traits in divergent pig breeds is crucial for advancing precision breeding strategies. (2) Methods: This study investigated transcriptome differences in the longissimus dorsi muscle between Chinese Congjiang Xiang (CX) and Landrace (LAN) pigs. RNA sequencing was performed on muscle tissues from ten individuals of each breed, generating 874.5 million raw reads with an average mapping rate of 89.3% to the pig reference genome. (3) Results: Transcriptional profiling revealed distinct expression patterns with 785 genes exclusively expressed in CX pigs and 457 genes unique to LAN pigs, while 7099 co-expressed genes were shared by both breeds. Differential expression analysis identified 2459 significantly different genes (|log2FC| >= 1, adjusted p-value < 0.05), with 1745 up-regulated and 714 down-regulated in CX pigs. Among the most significantly up-regulated genes in CX pigs were flavor-associated genes (ELOVL5/6, FASN, DGAT2, ALDH1A3, PPAR-gamma) with log2FC values ranging from 1.21 to 3.88. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that up-regulated genes in CX pigs were significantly enriched in immune response pathways (adjusted p-value < 0.01), while down-regulated genes were primarily associated with myosin complex formation and PPAR signaling pathway. PPI network analysis identified PPAR-gamma as a central hub gene with 16 direct interactions to other flavor-related genes. (4) Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the superior meat flavor characteristics of indigenous Chinese pigs are driven by enhanced expression of lipid metabolism genes and distinctive immune-related pathways, providing specific molecular targets for breeding programs aimed at improving meat quality while maintaining production efficiency in commercial breeds.

AB  - Lead is a common environmental pollutant. It can affect several body systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Lead can disrupt the nervous system by different mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, disruption of neurotransmission, and aberrant autophagy. Apiaceous species have been used traditionally as food flavoring and medicine, representing a rich source of bioactive compounds. In the current study, the antioxidant power of four Apiaceous extracts (Foeniculum vulgare L., Pimpinella anisum L., Coriandrum sativum L., and Cuminum cyminum L.) was evaluated. Additionally, the metabolite profiles of the selected species were comprehensively investigated by untargeted liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) coupled to chemometry. Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) extract showed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Coriander was further subjected to in vivo evaluation of its protective effect against Lead (Pb)-induced neurotoxicity. Administration of coriander extracts improved the short- and long-term memory performance and decreased hippocampal Pb content in Pb-intoxicated rats. Moreover, it attenuated hippocampal oxidative stress, neurochemical changes, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effect in the hippocampal tissue. Further, coriander extracts attenuated Pb inhibitory effect on the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTORC1) pathway resulting in upregulation of Phospho-p70 S6 Kinase (P-P70S6K) and Phospho-S6 Ribosomal Protein (PS6) and downregulation of Beclin-1. Additionally, some selected coriander ingredients were subjected to molecular docking to examine their regulatory effect on mTORC-1 and I kappa B kinase complex (Ikk-beta). The present findings highlight the future pharmaceutical utilization of coriander extract as valuable source of phenolic compounds that can be used as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective agents against Pb-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - This experiment aimed to explore the effects of flavonoids in Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (FFAI) on carcass traits, meat quality, and the antioxidant capacity of finishing pigs. The results indicated that the addition of an appropriate amount of FFAI into their diet could significantly reduce the backfat thickness and perirenal fat percentage of finishing pigs, as well as the drip loss, water-holding capacity, shear force, and the levels of lactate, glucose-6-phosphate, glucose, ATP, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. It also elevated the levels of flavor amino acids such as glutamate, serine, and threonine, and enriched the composition of flavor substances, including benzene and octanal, which significantly contributed to the enhancement of pork flavor. Furthermore, it enhanced the expression levels of MyHC I and MyHC IIa. In summary, the appropriate addition of FFAI to the diet could improve the carcass traits, meat quality, and antioxidant capacity of finishing pigs. The optimal level of FFAI supplementation is 0.12%.

AB  - Inflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of Subacute Ruminal Acidosis (SARA). The experiment was designed to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin on goats ruminal epithelial cells (GREC) which were induced SARA by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. The GREC were induced SARA by adding LPS at the concentration of 5 & mu;m and glycyrrhizin was added at different concentration of 0, 60, 90, 120, 150 & mu;m. The structural integrity of LPS-induced GREC with the treatment of glycyrrhizin were observed by electron microscope; The levels of inflammatory factors TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 were measured by ELISA; The number of Zo-1 and Occludin were measured, the expression of tight junction protein Occludin were measured by Western blot, and the mRNA expression of NF-& kappa;B, TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 were measured in vitro. The results showed that higher concentration treatment of glycyrrhizin led to better morphology in LPS-induced GREC. Glycyrrhizin inhibited the growth of inflammatory factors TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner. The number of ZO-1 and Occludin increased with the increase of adding of glycyrrhizin. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of tight junction protein Occludin in LPS-induced GREC increased with the adding of glycyrrhizin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of NF-& kappa;B, TNF-& alpha;, IL-1 & beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 decreased significantly with the increase treatment of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin significantly inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory mediators in GREC and the effects are better with the increase treatment of glycyrrhizin in vitro.

AB  - Amblyomma sculptum is a species of tick in the family Ixodidae, with equids and capybaras among its preferred hosts. In this study, the acaricidal activity of the essential oil (EO) from Piper aduncum and its main component, Dillapiole, were evaluated against larvae of A. sculptum to establish lethal concentration values and assess the effects of these compounds on tick enzymes. Dillapiole exhibited slightly greater activity (LC50 = 3.38 mg/mL; 95% CI = 3.24 to 3.54) than P. aduncum EO (LC50 = 3.49 mg/mL; 95% CI = 3.36 to 3.62) against ticks. The activities of alpha-esterase (alpha-EST), beta-esterase (beta-EST), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymes in A. sculptum larvae treated with Dillapiole showed a significant increase compared to the control at all concentrations (LC5, LC25, LC50 and LC75), similar results were obtained with P. aduncum EO, except for alpha-EST, which did not differ from the control at the highest concentration (LC75). The results of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity show an increase in enzyme activity at the two lower concentrations (LC5 and LC25) and a reduction in activity at the two higher, lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC75) compared to the control. These results suggest potential mechanisms of action for these natural acaricides and can provide guidance for the future development of potential plant-derived formulations.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of 4 weeks of periodic hypoxia stress on hemogram, oxidative stress markers, immune markers, gene expression of hypoxia-responsive proteins, heat shock proteins, and inflammation-related genes, as well as the structural integrity of spleen tissue in Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia). To further investigate immune competence, fish were challenged with Aeromonas sobria to assess their ability to combat bacterial infections after hypoxia exposure. Additionally, the potential modulatory effects of dietary replacement with camel whey protein hydrolysate (HPCW) at a 75-g/kg diet were scrutinized. Fish were divided into four groups, each with four replicates (10 fish per replicate), and fed either a basal diet or an HPCW-supplemented diet. The groups are control, HPCW, hypoxia group, and hypoxia + HPCW. The study demonstrated that periodic hypoxia triggered pronounced immune and oxidative stress responses in Oreochromis niloticus, as evidenced by significantly (P < 0.001) increased nitric oxide levels, lysozyme activity, complement-3, and oxidative stress markers, along with decreased antioxidant enzyme activity compared to the control. Molecular analysis revealed the upregulation of stress- and inflammation-related genes (il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, hif1-alpha, HSP70, HSP60, and HSP90) in the spleen tissue of hypoxia-exposed fish by 4.5-fold, 2.51-fold, 7.8-fold, 7.46-fold, 5.18-fold, and 7.5-fold, respectively, compared to the control group. Histopathological assessment confirmed tissue damage, including vascular congestion, hemorrhages, erythroid and lymphoid hyperplasia, endothelial changes, and increased melano-macrophage centers. Importantly, dietary supplementation with hydrolyzed camel whey protein (HPCW) significantly mitigated these effects. HPCW-supplemented fish during hypoxic conditions exhibited improved immune function, enhanced antioxidant capacity, reduced gene expression of inflammatory markers, and less splenic tissue damage compared. Moreover, HPCW-fed fish showed higher survival rates following Aeromonas sobria challenge. These findings highlight the novel role of HPCW as a functional feed additive that enhances fish survival and immunity under periodic hypoxia stress.

AB  - Purpose: For understanding the neurochemical mechanism of neuropsychiatric conditions associated with cognitive deficits it is of major relevance to elucidate the influence of serotonin (5-HT) agonists and antagonists on memory function as well dopamine (DA) and 5-HT release and metabolism. In the present study, we assessed the effects of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and the 5-HT2A receptor altanserin (ALT) on object and place recognition memory and cerebral neurotransmitters and metabolites in the rat. Methods: Rats underwent a 5-min exploration trial in an open field with two identical objects. After systemic injection of a single dose of either DOI (0.1 mg/kg), ALT (1 mg/kg) or the respectice vehicle (0.9 % NaCl, 50 % DMSO), rats underwent a 5-min test trial with one of the objects replaced by a novel one and the other object transferred to a novel place. Upon the assessment of object exploration and motor/exploratory behaviors, rats were sacrificed. DA, 5-HT and metabolite levels were analyzed in cingulate (CING), caudateputamen (CP), nucleus accumbens (NAC), thalamus (THAL), dorsal (dHIPP) and ventral hippocampus (vHIPP), brainstem and cerebellum with high performance liquid chromatography. Results: DOI decreased rearing but increased head-shoulder motility relative to vehicle. Memory for object and place after both DOI and ALT was not different from vehicle. Network analyses indicated that DOI inhibited DA metabolization in CING, CP, NAC, and THAL, but facilitated it in dHIPP. Likewise, DOI inhibited 5-HT metabolization in CING, NAC, and THAL. ALT facilitated DA metabolization in the CING, NAC, dHIPP, vHIPP, and CER, but inhibited it in the THAL. Additionally, ALT facilitated 5-HT metabolization in NAC and dHIPP. Conclusions: DOI and ALT differentially altered the quantitative relations between the neurotransmitter/ metabolite levels in the individual brain regions, by inducing region-specific shifts in the metabolization pathways. Findings are relevant for understanding the neurochemistry underlying DAergic and/or 5-HTergic dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric conditions.

AB  - BackgroundAs a common postsurgery complication, sleep deprivation (SD) can severely deteriorate the cognitive function of patients. Enriched environment (EE) exposure can increase children's cognitive ability, and whether EE exposure could be utilized to alleviate postsurgery SD-induced cognitive impairments is investigated in this study. MethodsOpen inguinal hernia repair surgery without skin/muscle retraction was performed on Sprague-Dawley male rats (9-week-old), which were further exposed to EE or standard environment (SE). Elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR), object location memory (OLM), and Morris Water Maze assays were utilized to monitor cognitive functions. Cresyl violet acetate staining in the Cornusammonis 3 (CA3) region of rat hippocampus was used to detect neuron loss. The relative expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptic glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) subunits in the hippocampus were detected with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence. ResultsEE restored normal levels of time spent in the center, time in distal open arms, open/total arms ratio, and total distance traveled in the EPM test; EE restored normal levels of recognition index in the NOR and OLM test; EE restored normal levels of time in the target quadrant, escape latencies, and platform site crossings in the Morris Water Maze test. EE exposure decreased neuron loss in the CA3 region of the hippocampus with increased BDNF and phosphorylated (p)-GluA1 (ser845) expression. ConclusionEE ameliorates postsurgery SD-induced cognitive impairments, which may be mediated by the axis of BDNF/GluA1. EE exposure could be considered as an aid in promoting cognitive function in postsurgery SD.

AB  - Skeletal muscle growth and development in livestock and poultry play a pivotal role in determining the quality and yield of meat production. However, the mechanisms of myogenesis are remained unclear due to it finely regulated by a complex network of biological macromolecules. In this study, leveraging previous sequencing data, we investigated a differentially expressed circular RNA (circSGCB) present in fetal and adult muscle tissues among various ruminant species, including cattle, goat, and sheep. Our analysis revealed that circSGCB is a single exon circRNA, potentially regulated by an adjacent bovine enhancer. Functional analysis through loss -offunction tests demonstrated that circSGCB exerts inhibitory effects on bovine myoblast proliferation while promoting myocytes generation. Furthermore, we discovered that circSGCB primarily localizes to the cytoplasm, where it functions as a molecular sponge by binding to bta-miR-27a-3p. This interaction releases the mRNAs of KLF3 gene and further activates downstream functional pathways. In vivo, studies provided evidence that upregulation of KLF3 contributes to muscle regeneration. These findings collectively suggest that circSGCB operates via a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism to regulate KLF3, thereby influencing myogenesis in ruminants and highlights it may as potential molecular targets for enhancing meat production in livestock and poultry industries.

AB  - The expression of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) from the plastid genome has been proven to be an effective method for controlling herbivorous pests by targeting essential insect genes. However, there are limitations to the efficiency of plastid-mediated RNA interference (PM-RNAi) due to the initial damage caused by the insects and their slow response to RNA interference. In this study, we developed transplastomic poplar plants that express dsRNAs targeting the beta-Actin (dsACT) and Srp54k (dsSRP54K) genes of Plagiodera versicolora. Feeding experiments showed that transplastomic poplar plants can cause significantly higher mortality in P. versicolora larvae compared with nuclear trans- genic or wild-type poplar plants. The efficient killing effect of PM-RNAi on P. versicolora larvae was found to be dependent on the presence of gut bacteria. Importantly, foliar application of a gut bacterial strain, Pseudomonas putida, will induce dysbiosis in the gut bacteria of P. versicolora larvae, leading to a significant acceleration in the speed of killing by PM-RNAi. Overall, our findings suggest that interfering with gut bacteria could be a promising strategy to enhance the effectiveness of PM-RNAi for insect pest control, offering a novel and effective approach for crop protection based on RNAi technology.

AB  - The concentration of ammonia (NH3) and the temperature of the air surrounding the rabbit habitat in the farm condition basic health processes such as breathing and feeding. The indoor climate in a rabbit farm is largely conditioned by the ventilation system (air conditioning). The objective of this study was to build a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in order to evaluate, by numerical simulations, the air dynamics of a rustic farm. After the validation of the computational model, the thermal gradient and ammonia concentration were analyzed under three wind incidence angles (0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal Z axis of the facility). The results of the simulations showed that, in the area occupied by the rabbits (AOR), the concentration of ammonia with respect to the source was reduced by 37.3% in the most favorable case (wind direction at 45 degrees), and 21.2% in the least favorable case (wind direction at 0 degrees), and the indoor temperature presented a maximum difference of 2 degrees C with respect to the outside temperature. Climate control is a more expensive cost in rabbit farm exploitation; dynamics modulation can serve as an auxiliary tool for reducing health risks in rabbits. The use of models based on fluid dynamics allowed us to understand the efficiency of the ventilation system, which must be increased to reduce the found temperature gradient. Through numerical simulation it will be possible to find alternatives to increase the ventilation rate.

AB  - Fumaria officinalis which belong to the Papaveraceae family is used to treat stomach-related ailments in Iraqi folk medicine. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities of a 70% ethanol extract of F. officinalis. Extracts of the aerial parts F. officinalis at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight and the standard drug, esomeprazole at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight were orally administered daily for 21 days after ulcer induction. The rats were sacrificed, and their stomachs were subjected to macroscopic and microscopic studies. The ethanolic extract showed a significant curative effect on ethanol-induced ulcer compared to the effects observed in the control and esomeprazole groups, especially at 400 mg/kg. Haematoxylin-eosin staining revealed remarkable improvement in gastric mucosal alteration, especially in rats treated with 400 mg/kg F. officinalis compared to the control. F. officinalis had high DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC50: 189.2 +/- 0.31 mg/mL) compared to ascorbic acid (215.5 +/- 2.41 mg/mL). Further, HPLC analysis of the ethanolic extract revealed the presence of rutin, quercetin, ferulic, and p-coumaric acid in various quantities. In silico, rutin and quercetin were found to have the highest affinities of -9.4 and -7.6 kcal/mol, respectively with human H+/K+-ATPase a chain active sites, and the highest binding site energy values with Na+/K+-ATPase and pig gastric H+/K+- ATPase, respectively. Altogether, F. officinalis may be a potential candidate for the treatment of gastric ulcers.

AB  - Whether advanced biological waste treatment technologies, such as hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) integrated anaerobic digestion (AD), could enhance the removal of different antibiotics remains unclear. This study investigated the outcome of antibiotics and methane productivity during pig manure treatment via HTP, AD, and HTP + AD. Results showed improved removal efficiency of sulfadiazine (SDZ), oxytetracycline (OTC), and enrofloxacin (ENR) with increased HTP temperatures (70, 90, 120, 150, and 170 degrees C). OTC achieved the highest removal efficiency of 86.8% at 170 degrees C because of its high sensitivity to heat treatment. For AD, SDZ exhibited resistance with a removal efficiency of 52.8%. However, OTC and ENR could be removed completely within 30 days. When HTP was used prior to AD, OTC and ENR could achieve complete removal. However, residual SDZ levels reduced to 20% and 16% at 150 and 170 degrees C, respectively. The methanogenic potential showed an overall upward trend as the HTP temperature increased. Microbial analysis revealed the antibiotics-induced enrichment of specific microorganisms during AD. Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phylum, with their abundance positively correlated with the addition of antibiotics. Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina emerged as the dominant archaea that drove methane production during AD. Thus, HTP can be a potential pretreatment before AD to reduce antibiotic-related risks in manure waste handling.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for up to 80% of all demential. Characterised by deteriorations of memory and cognitive function, the key neuropathological features are accumulations of beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, as 'plaques' and 'tangles', respectively. Despite extensive study, however, the exact mechanism underlying aggregate formation in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, as does the contribution of these aggregates to disease progression. Importantly, a recent evaluation of current Alzheimer's disease animal models suggested that rodent models are not able to fully recapitulate the pathological intricacies of the disease as it occurs in humans. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to species that might make good alternatives to rodents for studying the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The sheep (Ovis aries) is one such species, although to date, there have been few molecular studies relating to Alzheimer's disease in sheep. Here, we investigated the Alzheimer's disease relevant histopathological characteristics of 22 sheep, using anti-p-amyloid (Abeam 12267 and mOC64) and phosphorylation specific anti-tau (AT8 and S396) antibodies. We identified numerous intraneuronal aggregates of both beta-amyloid and tau that are consistent with early Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. We confirmed the expression of two 3-repeat (1N3R, 2N3R) and two 4-repeat (1N4R, 2N4R) tau isoforms in the ovine brain, which result from the alternative splicing of two tau exons. Finally, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the serine396 residue in 30 sheep, and report that the phosphorylation of this residue begins in sheep aged as young as 2 years. Together, these data show that sheep exhibit naturally occurring beta-amyloid and tau pathologies, that reflect those that occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This is an important step towards the validation of the sheep as a feasible large animal species in which to model Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Omentin-1, also known as intelectin-1 (ITLN1), is an adipokine produced by visceral adipose tissue and effect on improve insulin sensitivity, regulate energy metabolism and reproduction. Our previously data has shown that ITLN1 expression in porcine ovarian follicles is influenced by both the level of adiposity and the phase of the estrous cycle. Additionally, recent studies have indicated variations in the serum levels of adipokines in pigs with higher fat content, suggest their common interaction. It was therefore hypothesized that ITLN1 regulates the levels of other adipokines and their receptors in the ovary of pigs with different fat content. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effect of ITLN1 (10-100 ng/mL) on the levels of other adipokines, namely adiponectin, apelin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, visfatin, and vaspin in the culture medium, assessed by ELISA. In addition, the effect of ITLN1 on the mRNA expression of the above- mentioned adipokines with their receptors was investigated using RT-qPCR in granulosa cells (Gc) from normal weight Large White (LW) and fat Meishan (MS) pigs on days 10-12 of the estrous cycle. The results showed that ITLN1 reduced apelin levels, increased leptin, and had no effect on vaspin in the culture medium. ITLN1 was found to have a modulating effect on the mRNA expression of the other adipokines with their receptors in porcine Gc. It can, therefore, be proposed that ITLN1 represents a previously unidentified auto- and paracrine regulator of the functions of ovarian microenvironmental compartments in different types of pig breeds.

AB  - We report the clinical case of AB, a right-handed 19-year-old woman who presents severe developmental topographical disorientation, a relatively rare syndrome, leading to difficulties in navigating in familiar (and novel) environments. This symptomatology appears without acquired cerebral damage (MRI described as normal) nor more global cognitive disability (high degree of education achieved).An extensive assessment of spatial cognition with different aspects of underlying cognitive processes is first presented. Second, the patient's preserved cognitive abilities and her major difficulties in calculation, as well as her attention deficit, as seen in a detailed neuropsychological assessment, are reported.For the first time to our knowledge, we show that developmental topographical disorientation can be asso-ciated with other developmental cognitive disorders affecting number processing (dyscalculia) and attention (Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)). We discuss the links between these different cognitive pro-cesses in relation to visuo-spatial working memory and magnitude representation, which could represent com-mon denominators for all these syndromes.This case report highlights the importance of thoroughly assessing potentially associated neurocognitive disorders in developmental topographical disorientation. In addition, it highlights the necessity to keep in mind the prevalence of spatial difficulties in the assessment of children and adolescents with other neuro-developmental syndromes. Finally, this case study raises a new question about the nosology of developmental disorders affecting the visuo-spatial and spatial domains.

AB  - Cannabis legalization prompted the dilemma if plant-derived recreational drugs can have therapeutic potential and, consequently, how to address their regulation and safe distribution. In parallel, the steady worldwide decriminalization of cannabis and the enhanced content of its main psychoactive compound & UDelta;(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exposes populations to increasing amounts of cannabis and THC across all ages. While adverse effects of cannabis during critical stages of fetal neurodevelopment are investigated, these studies center on neurons alone. Thus, a gap of knowledge exists on how intercellular interactions between neighboring cell types, particularly astrocytes and neurons, could modify THC action. Here, we combine transcriptome analysis, transgenic models, high resolution microscopy and live cell imaging to demonstrate that hippocampal astrocytes accumulate in the strata radiatum and lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 subfield, containing particularly sensitive neurons to stressors, upon long term postnatal THC exposure in vivo. As this altered distribution is not dependent on cell proliferation, we propose that resident astrocytes accumulate in select areas to protect pyramidal neurons and their neurite extensions from pathological damage. Indeed, we could recapitulate the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes in vitro, as their physical presence significantly reduced the death of primary hippocampal neurons upon THC exposure (> 5 mu M). Even so, astrocytes are also affected by a reduced metabolic readiness to stressors, as reflected by a downregulation of mitochondrial proteins. Thus, we find that astrocytes exert protective functions on local neurons during THC exposure, even though their mitochondrial electron transport chain is disrupted.

AB  - Theobromine is a caffeine metabolite most abundant in dark chocolate, of which consumption is linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms through which theobromine affects neuronal function remain ill-defined. Using electrophysiological recordings in mouse hippocampal synapses, we now characterized the impact of a realistic concentration of theobromine on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Theobromine (30 mu M) facilitated synaptic transmission while decreasing the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP), with both effects being blunted by adenosine deaminase (2 U/mL). The pharmacological blockade of A(1)R with DPCPX (100 nM) eliminated the theobromine-dependent facilitation of synaptic transmission, whereas the A(2A)R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nM), as well as the genetic deletion of A(2A)R, abrogated the theobromine-induced impairment of LTP. Furthermore, theobromine prevented LTP deficits and neuronal loss, respectively, in mouse hippocampal slices and neuronal cultures exposed to A beta(1-42) peptides, considered a culprit of Alzheimer's disease. Overall, these results indicate that theobromine affects information flow via the antagonism of adenosine receptors, normalizing synaptic plasticity and affording neuroprotection in dementia-related conditions in a manner similar to caffeine.

AB  - Vermiculite is a hydrous clay mineral that occasionally occurs in raw materials for brickmaking. The presence of vermiculite affects the drying and firing processes of brick production; thus, the functions of this clay mineral should be clarified. In this study, vermiculite from 0 wt% to 30 wt% have been added to clay mixtures for brick button firing. Through effective integration of in-situ XRD, thermogravimetric and dilatometric analyses, the realtime thermal behaviours have been interpreted, and the microstructure, physical and compressive characteristics of brick buttons have been investigated. The incorporation of vermiculite has changed the temperatures of kaolinite dehydroxylation and rutile formation. Enstatite, cordierite and amorphous contents increased in fired brick buttons, while mullite, quartz and cristobalite decreased. Vermiculite retained a partial sheet-like morphology at 1150 degrees C firing. From 25 to 1150 degrees C, five weight loss steps have been defined with six shrinkage/expansion processes observed. Cracks appeared on brick button surfaces when 30 wt% of vermiculite was added. The colour of fired brick buttons changed from "light camel" to "black olive". Drying shrinkage, firing shrinkage and bulk density increased with an increased proportion of vermiculite. The maximum compressive strength reached 150.94 MPa (a rise of 21.6% towards the control sample) when 5 wt% of vermiculite was added.

AB  - Oviposition in a generalist parasitoid is a complex process that involves interactions among its host, host plant, and spatiotemporal environment. Our study was aimed at exploring the ability of a generalist parasitic wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), in perceiving odor cues from its host insect [Oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel, Diptera: Tephritidae)] in infested mango fruits. A series of experiments involving behavioral and electrophysiological studies suggest that D. longicaudata is able to distinguish host infested fruit volatiles from uninfested. Additionally, we found that D. longicaudata can distinguish between high and low-level infestations using specific cues emanating from fruits. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of infested mango fruit head space volatiles identified compounds such as ethyl butanoate, ethyl 3-hydroxybutyrate, beta-myrcene, trans-beta-ocimene, allo-ocimene, ethyl octanoate, ethyl-alpha-toulate, beta-elemene, beta-caryophyllene, humulene, caryophyllene oxide, ethyl dodecanoate, ethyl hexadecanoate, 2-furancarboxylic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone, and phenethyl alcohol emanated from three different host treatments with different levels of larval infestation which elicited antennal responses in D. longicaudata. We suggest that these cues might play a significant role in attracting D. longicaudata in the field.

KW  - BIM information retrieval
KW  - large language model
KW  - natural language based BIM operation
AB  - Building Information Modeling (BIM) has excellent potential to enhance building operation and maintenance. However, as a standardized data format in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the retrieval of BIM information generally requires specialized software. Cumbersome software operations prevent its effective application in the actual operation and management of buildings. This paper presents BIMCoder, a model designed to translate natural language queries into structured query statements compatible with professional BIM software (e.g., BIMserver v1.5). It serves as an intermediary component between users and various BIM platforms, facilitating access for users without specialized BIM knowledge. A dedicated BIM information query dataset was constructed, comprising 1680 natural language query and structured BIM query string pairs, categorized into 12 groups. Three classical pre-trained large language models (LLMs) (ERNIE 3.0, Llama-13B, and SQLCoder) were evaluated on this dataset. A fine-tuned model based on SQLCoder was then trained. Subsequently, a fusion model (BIMCoder) integrating ERNIE and SQLCoder was designed. Test results demonstrate that the proposed BIMCoder model achieves an outstanding accurate matching rate of 87.16% and an Execution Accuracy rate of 88.75% for natural language-based BIM information retrieval. This study confirms the feasibility of natural language-based BIM information retrieval and offers a novel solution to reduce the complexity of BIM system interaction.

AB  - Animals seeking survival needs must be able to assess different locations of threats in their habitat. However, the neural integration of spatial and risk information essential for guiding goal-directed behavior remains poorly understood. Thus, we investigated simultaneous activities of fear-responsive basal amygdala (BA) and place-responsive dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) neurons as rats left the safe nest to search for food in an exposed space and encountered a simulated 'predator.' In this realistic situation, BA cells increased their firing rates and dHPC place cells decreased their spatial stability near the threat. Importantly, only those dHPC cells synchronized with the predator-responsive BA cells remapped significantly as a function of escalating risk location. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of BA neurons was sufficient to cause spatial avoidance behavior and disrupt place fields. These results suggest a dynamic interaction of BA's fear signalling cells and dHPC's spatial coding cells as animals traverse safe-danger areas of their environment.

AB  - Herbivorous arthropods can induce their host to form structures where they shelter during unfavourable periods. The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), can spend the off-season inside cotton plant structures, known as dry bolls, protected from pesticides, natural enemies and heat and desiccation on the soil surface, thereby increasing its survival and preserving its reproductive capacity. However, the relationship between the boll weevil and dry boll formation is not fully understood and requires further study. The formation and external and internal characteristics of dry bolls on cotton plants infested with different densities of boll weevils, and the emergence and survival of this insect from these structures, were evaluated. Compared with non-infested control plants, plants infested with boll weevil formed almost twice as many dry bolls, which were 2.3 times heavier and with a diameter 1.7 times larger than those on non-infested plants. Boll weevil infestation reduces the number of bolls and commercial mass of fibre + seeds, reducing productivity and increasing cotton harvest contaminants. However, dry bolls on non-infested plants demonstrate that other factors are involved in their formation.

AB  - Over a decade ago, three independent studies reported that pathogen- and herbivore-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana produces primed progeny with increased resistance. Since then, heritable induced resistance (h-IR) has been reported across numerous plant-biotic interactions, revealing a regulatory function of DNA (de)methylation dynamics. However, the identity of the epi-alleles controlling h-IR and the mechanisms by which they prime defense genes remain unknown, while the evolutionary significance of the response requires confirmation. Progress has been hampered by the relatively high variability, low effect size, and sometimes poor reproducibility of h-IR, as is exemplified by a recent study that failed to reproduce h-IR in A. thaliana by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). This study aimed to improve h-IR effect size and reproducibility in the A. thaliana-Pst interaction. We show that recurrent Pst inoculations of seedlings result in stronger h-IR than repeated inoculations of older plants and that disease-related growth repression in the parents is a reliable marker for h-IR effect size in F1 progeny. Furthermore, RT-qPCR-based expression profiling of genes controlling DNA methylation maintenance revealed that the elicitation of strong h-IR upon seedling inoculations is marked by reduced expression of the chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) gene, which is maintained in the apical meristem and transmitted to F1 progeny. Two additional genes, MET1 and CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3), displayed similar transcriptional repression in progeny from seedling-inoculated plants. Thus, reduced expression of DDM1, MET1, and CMT3 can serve as a marker of robust h-IR in F1 progeny. Our report offers valuable information and markers to improve the effect size and reproducibility of h-IR in the A. thaliana-Pst model interaction.

AB  - Thyroid hormones regulate adult metabolism partly through actions on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). They also affect neurological development of the brain, but their role in cerebral OXPHOS before birth remains largely unknown, despite the increase in cerebral energy demand during the neonatal period. Thus, this study examined prepartum development of cerebral OXPHOS in hypothyroid fetal sheep. Using respirometry, Complex I (CI), Complex II (CII), and combined CI&CII OXPHOS capacity were measured in the fetal cerebellum and cortex at 128 and 142 days of gestational age (dGA) after surgical thyroidectomy or sham operation at 105 dGA (term similar to 145 dGA). Mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) complexes, mRNA transcripts related to mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production, and mitochondrial density were quantified using molecular techniques. Cerebral morphology was assessed by immunohistochemistry and stereology. In the cortex, hypothyroidism reduced CI-linked respiration and CI abundance at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively, and caused upregulation of PGC1 alpha (regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis) and thyroid hormone receptor beta at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively. In contrast, in the cerebellum, hypothyroidism reduced CI&II-and CII-linked respiration at 128 dGA, with no significant effect on the ETS complexes. In addition, cerebellar glucocorticoid hormone receptor and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) were downregulated at 128 dGA and 142 dGA, respectively. These alterations in mitochondrial function were accompanied by reduced myelination. The findings demonstrate the importance of thyroid hormones in the prepartum maturation of cerebral mitochondria and have implications for the etiology and treatment of the neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with human prematurity and congenital hypothyroidism.

AB  - Lilioceris egena (Weise) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is an approved classical biological control agent that feeds on the aerial reproductive structures (i.e., bulbils) of the invasive air potato vine in Florida. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, has mass-produced and released over 100,000 beetles since 2021. Mass rearing can be challenging for highly specialized herbivores like L. egena. Therefore, we present a detailed protocol to mass rear L. egena under laboratory settings. This protocol ensures consistent production of approximately 675 beetles per month/colony for research and field applications while maintaining efficiency and affordability. Additionally, we determined how the number of mating pairs and the condition of air potato bulbils (whole or bisected) used in the mass rearing system influenced the number of adults produced. Results showed that 17 mating pairs per bulbil (of approximately 150 g) was an optimal beetle density to maximize beetle production and maintain a healthy colony. The condition of bulbils utilized did not influence the number of adults produced. This protocol can be adopted by integrated pest management (IPM) and master gardener programs, universities, and regulatory agencies in other southeastern states currently facing air potato infestations.

Los resultados muestran que 17 parejas reproductivas por "bulbillo" (similar to 150 g) es una densidad & oacute;ptima para maximizar la producci & oacute;n de escarabajos y mantener colonias saludables. Utilizar "bulbillos" enteros o cortados por la mitad no afect & oacute; el n & uacute;mero de escarabajos producidos. Este protocolo puede ser utilizado por programas de manejo integrado de plagas (MIP), universidades y agencias reguladoras en otros estados en el sureste de los Estados Unidos que actualmente tienen problemas con la papa trepadora.

AB  - In September 2017, two category-5 hurricanes Irma and Maria swept through the Caribbean Sea in what is now known as the region's most active hurricane season on record, leaving disastrous effects on infrastructure and people's lives. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, rain cisterns are commonly used for harvesting roof-top rainwater for household water needs. High prevalence of Legionella spp. was found in the cistern water after the hurricanes. This study carried out a quantitative microbial risk assessment to estimate the health risks associated with Legionella through inhalation of aerosols from showering using water from cisterns after the hurricanes. Legionella concentrations were modeled based on the Legionella detected in post-hurricane water samples and reported total viable heterotrophic bacterial counts in cistern water. The inhalation dose was modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation of shower water aerosol concentrations according to shower water temperature, shower duration, inhalation rates, and shower flow rates. The risk of infection was calculated based on a previously established dose-response model from Legionella infection of guinea pigs. The results indicated median daily risk of 2.5 x 10(-6) to 2.5 x 10(-4) depending on shower temperature, and median annual risk of 9.1 x 10(-4) to 1.4 x 10(-2). Results were discussed and compared with household survey results for a better understanding of local perceived risk versus objective risk surrounding local water supplies.

AB  - The gas-cooled micro modular reactor (MMR) is a novel concept with a compact fuel form consisting of thousands of tri-isotropic fuel (TRISO) particles dispersed in a silicon carbide matrix. The MMR fuel has a high volume packing fraction and is horizontally placed within graphite channels. This study demonstrates that the horizontal arrangement of MMR fuel within graphite channels resulted in a non-uniform gap between the fuel and graphite brick, leading to an "off-center" temperature distribution within the fuel, and resulting in differences in TRISO performance even within sub-zones positioned symmetrically in the radial direction. Given the complexity of the fuel structure and the challenges involved in simulation, a multi-scale and multi-physics coupled analysis method of MMR fuel was realized in this work by implementing physical models into the open-source finite element platform MOOSE. Thermal-mechanical analysis and failure analysis within sub-zones of the typical design MMR fuel during normal operation were conducted through simulation. The results indicate that higher-temperature sub-zones exhibit increased internal pressure within TRISO and show greater tensile stress in the Chemical Vapor Deposited Silicon Carbide (CVD-SiC) layer. Regarding fuel failure analysis, this work found limited impact from Pd penetration and kernel migration. Pressure-induced particle failure, closely associated with stress in CVD-SiC, emerges as the primary failure criterion. The probability of fuel failure is relatively low, and interfacial cohesive parameters have an impact on the SiC stress and the fuel failure probability at the highest level.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a series of complex neurodevelopmental disorders, which can affect children's social, behavioral and communication abilities. A member of the Sirtuins family of NAD + dependent deacetylases called SIRT2 could regulate the inflammation progress during stress, but the relevant mechanism has not been clearly defined. In the present study, the ASD model of wild type and SIRT2 knock out mice was established to evaluate the impact on the homeostasis of neurons in the hippocampus using western blotting, immunofluorescence and Nissl staining. The results showed that the amplification of neuronal richness was significantly decreased and neuroinflammation increased in the hippocampus following ASD due to autophagy, caused by enhancing the acetylation of FoxO1 using SIRT2 gene deletion and indicating this should be the target for ASD or other psychological stress treatment.

AB  - Xylariomycetidae (Ascomycota) is a highly diversified group with variable stromatic characters. Our research focused on inconspicuous stromatic xylarialean taxa from China, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Detailed morphological descriptions, illustrations and combined ITS-LSU-rpb2-tub2-tef1 phylogenies revealed 39 taxa from our collections belonging to Amphisphaeriales and Xylariales. A new family (Appendicosporaceae), five new genera (Magnostiolata, Melanostictus, Neoamphisphaeria, Nigropunctata and Paravamsapriya), 27 new species (Acrocordiella photiniicola, Allocryptovalsa sichuanensis, Amphisphaeria parvispora, Anthostomella lamiacearum, Apiospora guiyangensis, A. sichuanensis, Biscogniauxia magna, Eutypa camelliae, Helicogermslita clypeata, Hypocopra zeae, Magnostiolata mucida, Melanostictus longiostiolatus, M. thailandicus, Nemania longipedicellata, N. delonicis, N. paraphysata, N. thailandensis, Neoamphisphaeria hyalinospora, Neoanthostomella bambusicola, Nigropunctata bambusicola, N. nigrocircularis, N. thailandica, Occultitheca rosae, Paravamsapriya ostiolata, Peroneutypa leucaenae, Seiridium italicum and Vamsapriya mucosa) and seven new host/geographical records are introduced and reported. Divergence time estimates indicate that Delonicicolales diverged from Amphisphaeriales + Xylariales at 161 (123-197) MYA. Amphisphaeriales and Xylariales diverged 154 (117-190) MYA with a crown age of 127 (92-165) MYA and 147 (111-184) MYA, respectively. Appendicosporaceae (Amphisphaeriales) has a stem age of 89 (65-117) MYA. Ancestral character state reconstruction indicates that astromatic, clypeate ascomata with aseptate, hyaline ascospores that lack germ slits may probably be ancestral Xylariomycetidae having plant-fungal endophytic associations. The Amphisphaeriales remained mostly astromatic with common septate, hyaline ascospores. Stromatic variations may have developed mostly during the Cretaceous period. Brown ascospores are common in Xylariales, but they first appeared in Amphisphaeriaceae, Melogrammataceae and Sporocadaceae during the early Cretaceous. The ascospore germ slits appeared only in Xylariales during the Cretaceous after the divergence of Lopadostomataceae. Hyaline, filiform and apiospores may have appeared as separate lineages, providing the basis for Xylariaceae, which may have diverged independently. The future classification of polyphyletic xylarialean taxa will not be based on stromatic variations, but the type of ring, the colour of the ascospores, and the presence or absence or the type of germ slit.

TI  - African swine fever virus pS273R antagonizes stress granule formation by cleaving the nucleating protein G3BP1 to facilitate viral replication

KW  - ASSEMBLE
AB  - Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are generally triggered by stress-induced translation arrest for storing mRNAs. Recently, it has been shown that SGs are regulated by different stimulators including viral infection, which is involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. To survive, several viruses have been reported to execute various strategies, such as modulating SG formation, to create optimal surroundings for viral replication. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is one of the most notorious pathogens in the global pig industry. However, the interplay between ASFV infection and SG formation remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that ASFV infection inhibited SG formation. Through SG inhibitory screening, we found that several ASFV-encoded proteins are involved in inhibition of SG formation. Among them, an ASFV S273R protein (pS273R), the only cysteine protease encoded by the ASFV genome, significantly affected SG formation. ASFV pS273R interacted with G3BP1 (RasGTPase-activating protein [SH3 domain] binding protein 1), a vital nucleating protein of SG formation. Furthermore, we found that ASFV pS273R cleaved G3BP1 at the G140-F141 to produce two fragments (G3BP1-N1-140 and G3BP1-C141-456). Interestingly, both the pS273R-cleaved fragments of G3BP1 lost the ability to induce SG formation and antiviral activity. Taken together, our finding reveals that the proteolytic cleavage of G3BP1 by ASFV pS273R is a novel mechanism by which ASFV counteracts host stress and innate antiviral responses.

AB  - Social withdrawal is one of the most relevant negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Animal models that mimic schizophrenia's symptoms, in general, and negative symptoms, in particular, are difficult to develop because of the high complexity of symptoms and neurochemical disturbances that schizophrenia patients display throughout their lives. In recent years we have shown that Roman High-Avoidance (RHA) rats exhibit some phenotypes that are thought to represent positive symptoms, cognitive/attentional symptoms, as well as some negative symptoms of the disease. In the present study, we aimed at elucidating whether the social interaction (SI) deficits exhibited by adult male RHA rats, compared to their Roman Low-Avoidance (RLA) counterparts, are also present during adolescence, as well as whether there are between-strain differences in adolescent and adult female rats. The results of the present study show that adult male RHA rats exhibited a deficit in social preference compared to their RLA counterparts. Such a deficit was not observed in adolescent RHA rats or female rats of any age. The results also show that the adult male rats of both strains had significant decreases in social preference compared to the adolescent male rats. Additionally, we also show that female adult RHA rats have greater social preference than their male counterparts. These results seem to be in line with previous rodent and human studies and add face validity to the RHA rats as a model of schizophrenia.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) typically contain high-flavonoid phytochemicals like catechins. Recently, new tea cultivars with unique purple-colored leaves have gained attention. These purple tea cultivars are enriched with anthocyanin, which provides an interesting perspective for studying the metabolic flux of the flavonoid pathway. An increasing number of studies are focusing on the leaf color formation of purple tea and this review aims to summarize the latest progress made on the composition and accumulation of anthocyanins in tea plants. In addition, the regulation mechanism in its synthesis will be discussed and a hypothetical regulation model for leaf color transformation during growth will be proposed. Some novel insights are presented to facilitate future in-depth studies of purple tea to provide a theoretical basis for targeted breeding programs in leaf color.

AB  - Harvestmen are generally considered to be omnivores. In contrast to most other arachnids that are fluid feeders, harvestmen are capable of ingesting solid food particles and may consume invertebrates, small vertebrates, plant tissues, fungi, and detritus. However, for most species, quantitative diet data are lacking. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis provides a means to measure the contribution of these materials to the diet over the time scale of tissue turnover, and thus quantify trophic position. Examination of fecal material can provide additional evidence of recent feeding, which can further complement field observations and isotopic analyses. We investigated the diet of Erginulus clavotibialis (F.O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1905) (Arachnida, Opiliones, Cosmetidae) in western Belize, using stable isotope analysis and scanning electron microscopy of fecal samples. We also examined nitrogen isotopic ratios for carnivores (scorpions and spiders), herbivores (grasshoppers and katydids), and preliminary measures for two other harvestmen species, ants, and termites. Erginulus clavotibialis had delta 15N signatures similar to scorpions and spiders, indicating carnivory. Nymphs and adults (females and males) of E. clavotibialis did not differ significantly in their trophic level despite possessing chelicerae and pedipalps that differ substantially in relative size and morphology. Fecal samples contained considerable evidence of arthropod consumption, as fragments of legs and exoskeleton were evident. Our study provides an initial quantification of harvestman diet and documents that E. clavotibialis is primarily carnivorous.

AB  - Plants defend themselves against herbivores by recognizing herbivore-derived elicitors and activating intracellular signaling. In Arabidopsis, the receptor-like kinase HAK1 recognizes the poly-saccharide elicitor (FrA) from Spodoptera litura larvae, leading to the expression of defense-related genes such as PDF1.2. During this process, the cytoplasmic kinase CRK2 phosphorylates PBL27, triggers the ERF13 expression via ethylene signaling and subsequently leads to PDF1.2 expression. Herein, we investigated four cytoplasmic kinases from the same receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) VII family as PBL27 that interacts with CRK2. Among them, PBL11, like PBL27, is phosphorylated by CRK2 and induces PDF1.2 expression but does not affect ERF13 expression. The weight gain of S. litura larvae on PBL11-deficient mutant plants was only slightly higher than that of wild-type plants, suggesting that PBL11 may function as a minor RLCK that supports the defense response.

AB  - Semen preservation at 17 degrees C plays a pivotal role in the porcine breeding industry, though it presents challenges; not all ejaculates retain their quality during storage. Colloidal centrifugation has been developed to improve it since this method eliminates seminal plasma and microorganisms while simultaneously allowing the selection of spermatozoa based on gradient density centrifugation. This study aimed to evaluate whether two different colloid densities (1.026 g/ml - 20 %Porcicoll (R) and 1.104 g/ml - 80 % Porcicoll (R)) improve sperm bioenergetics, assessed using Agilent seahorse, along with key semen quality parameters such as viability, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress and motility analyzed through flow cytometry and the CASA system over time. Fifteen ejaculates were divided into three groups: Control (CTR), 20 % Porcicoll (R) (P20), and 80 % Porcicoll (R) (P80). Sperm parameters were analyzed at days 0, 3, and 7 of storage. Results revealed a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis during storage, with a 15 % decrease in ATP production by day 3. P80-treated sperm showed higher ATP production on day 0 compared to P20. Sperm quality parameters such as viability and mitochondrial activity decreased after colloidal centrifugation, possibly because of early capacitation; we also hypothesize that SLC could increase sensitivity to the high glucose levels in the medium. Although Porcicoll (R) effectively selected metabolically active sperm, the lack of seminal plasma and limitations in media composition negatively affected long-term sperm quality. Further research is necessary to optimize media formulations and assess fertility outcomes of selected sperm for enhanced sperm preservation techniques.

AB  - Castration is commonly used to reduce stink during boar production. In porcine adipose tissue, castration reduces androgen levels resulting in metabolic disorders and excessive fat deposition. However, the underlying detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we constructed porcine preadipocyte models with and without androgen by adding testosterone exogenously. The fluorescence intensity of lipid droplet (LD) staining and the fatty acid synthetase (FASN) mRNA levels were lower in the testosterone-treated cells than in the untreated control cells. In contrast, the mRNA levels of adipose triglycerides lipase (ATGL) and androgen receptor (AR) were higher than in the testosterone-treated cells than in the control cells. Subsequently, transcriptomic sequencing of porcine preadipocytes incubated with and without testosterone showed that the mRNA expression levels of very long-chain fatty acid elongase 3 (ELOVL3), a key enzyme involved in fatty acids synthesis and metabolism, were high in control cells. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of ELOVL3 reduced LD accumulation and the mRNA levels of FASN and increased the mRNA levels of ATGL. Next, we conducted dual-luciferase reporter assays using wild-type and mutant ELOVL3 promoter reporters, which showed that the ELOVL3 promoter contained an androgen response element (ARE); furthermore, its transcription was negatively regulated by AR overexpression. In conclusion, our study reveals that testosterone inhibits fat deposition in porcine preadipocytes by suppressing ELOVL3 expression. Moreover, our study provides a theoretical basis for further studies on the mechanisms of fat deposition caused by castration.

AB  - DP96R of African swine fever virus (ASFV), also known as uridine kinase (UK), encodes a virulence-associated protein. Previous studies have examined DP96R along with other genes in an effort to create live attenuated vaccines. While experiments in pigs have explored the impact of DP96R on the pathogenicity of ASFV, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown. Here, we describe a novel molecular mechanism by which DP96R suppresses interferon regulator factor-3 (IRF3)-mediated antiviral immune responses. DP96R interacts with a crucial karyopherin (KPNA) binding site within IRF3, disrupting the KPNA-IRF3 interaction and consequently impeding the translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus. Under this mechanistic basis, the ectopic expression of DP96R enhances the replication of DNA and RNA viruses by inhibiting the production of IFNs, whereas DP96R knock-down resulted in higher IFNs and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription during ASFV infection. Collectively, these findings underscore the pivotal role of DP96R in inhibiting IFN responses and increase our understanding of the relationship between DP96R and the virulence of ASFV.

AB  - Purpose This study evaluates the potential of ramie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud) and mango seed kernel (Mangifera indica L.) and their combination in reducing methane emission, modifying rumen fermentation, and influencing ruminal enzymes activity under in-vitro conditions. Methods A total mixed ration (TMR) consisting of 40% berseem, 20% wheat straw, and 40% concentrate was used as the control. In the treatment groups, berseem was replaced with ramie at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. In another trial, mango seed kernel (MSK) was incorporated into the TMR at 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10% levels. Based on dry matter degradability and methane reduction, the two most effective levels of ramie (40% and 50%) were selected and combined with MSK at different inclusion rates (1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%) for further evaluation. Results The combination of 50% ramie with 5% MSK reduced methane emissions by 36.02% without significantly (P > 0.05) affecting in vitro dry matter and organic matter degradability. Higher levels of MSK significantly (P < 0.05) reduced ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration and acetic acid production while significantly (P < 0.05) increasing propionic acid levels. However, a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in fiber digestion was observed at higher inclusion levels. Conclusion The inclusion of ramie and MSK in the diet effectively mitigates methane emissions while maintaining fermentation efficiency at moderate levels of supplementation (50% ramie + 5% MSK). Further in-vivo research is needed to validate its impact on animal performance and productivity.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) have recently emerged in the context of global plastic pollution. They may be more toxic than macroplastics litter and microplastic fragments due to its abundances, tiny sizes, and cellular accessibility. The female reproductive toxicity of NPs has been widely documented for aquatic animals, but their effects and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood in mammals. This study aimed to explore the effects of NPs on female reproduction using human ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) and female mice. The accumulation of polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs) in human granulosa-like tumor cells (KGN cells) and the ovaries of female Balb/c mice were evaluated by exposure to fluorescent PS-NPs. Proliferation and apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and Hippo signaling pathway-related factors were analyzed in KGN cells. In addition, fertility rate, litter size, ovarian weight and microstructure, follicle development, serum level of anti-Mullerian hormone, and apoptosis in ovaries were examined in female mice. Here, the PS-NPs can penetrate the KGN cells and accumulate in the ovaries. In vitro, 100 mu g/ml PS-NPs inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, accumulated ROS, activated three key regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway (MST1, LATS1, and YAP1), and downregulated the mRNA levels of CTGF and Cyr61 in KGN cells. Furthermore, salidroside, an antioxidative compound extracted from Rhodiola rosea, alleviated the damage of PS-NPs to KGN and inhibited the activation of the Hippo signal pathway. In vivo, exposure to 1 mg/day PS-NPs resulted in decreased fertility, abnormal ovarian function, and increased ovarian apoptosis in female mice. Overall, our data suggest that PS-NPs cause granulosa cell apoptosis and affect ovarian functions, leading to reduced fertility in female mice, by inducing oxidative stress and dysregulating the Hippo pathway.

AB  - Depression is the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity seen in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Moreover, the HS is the most frequent pathological hallmark in MTLE-HS. Although there is a well-documented hippocampal volumetric reduction in imaging studies of patients with major depressive disorder, in epilepsy with comorbid depression, the true role of the hippocampus is not entirely understood. This study aimed to verify if patients with unilateral MTLE-HS and the co-occurrence of depression have differences in neuronal density of the hippocampal sectors CA1-CA4. For this purpose, we used a histopathological approach. This was a pioneering study with patients having both clinical disorders. However, we found no difference in hippocampal neuronal density when depression co-occurs in patients with epilepsy. In this series, CA1 had the lowest counting in both groups, and HS ILAE Type 1 was the most prevalent. More studies using histological assessments are needed to clarify the physiopathology of depression in MTLE-HS.

AB  - 170-Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) influence place and response memory in female rats in spatial navigation tasks. Use of these memory systems is associated with the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum, respectively. Injections of E2 result in a well-established bias to use place memory, while much less is understood about the role of P. A total of 120 ovariectomized female rats were tested within a dual-solution T-maze task and treated with either low E2 (n = 24), high E2 (10 mu g/kg; n = 24), or high E2 in combination with P (500 mu g/kg) at three time points before testing: 15 min (n = 24), 1 h (n = 24), and 4 h (n = 24). Given alone, high E2 biases rats to the use of place memory, but this effect is reversed when P is given 1 h or 4 h before testing. This indicates that P may be playing an inhibitory role in the hippocampus during spatial tasks, which is consistent with past findings. Our findings show that P acts rapidly (within an hour) to affect performance during spatial tasks.

AB  - Air pollutants seriously affect global health. Among these, particulate matter (PM10) can enter the respiratory tract, attract immune cells and cause inflammatory and cytotoxic phenomena that alter lung function and increase susceptibility to respiratory virus infections. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response induced by PM10 in neutrophils exposed to rhinovirus by evaluating its cytotoxic potential via the MTT technique and quantifying the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha and their mRNAs of the ICAM-1 molecule using ELISA and qPCR, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of PM10 exposure on the RV load in A549 cells. Exposure to PM10 at concentrations less than 10 mu g/mL did not cause significant cytotoxicity in neutrophils, but when neutrophils were exposed to PM10 and Rhinovirus, increases in the levels of the IL-1 beta and ICAM-1 mRNA and the number of copies of the Rhinovirus genome, especially in neutrophils and cells exposed to higher concentrations of PM10. In conclusion, exposure to PM10 and rhinovirus may promote the occurrence of complications during viral infection related to the development of proinflammatory states.

AB  - In this conclusive chapter, we review findings giving support to the hypothesis that TI represents an adaptive, survival response to threatening situations. In models of prey-predator interactions, in vertebrates and invertebrates, there are evidence that immobility per se contributes to survival, as the predator loses interest for a prey in which TI is experimentally induced. TI duration is also reciprocally modulated by the evaluation of the risk factors in the environment, and by the opportunity to reach a safe refuge. This supports the adaptive value of TI and suggests that, during TI, the animal may be transiently aware of the environmental situation. As for the adaptive value of TI, genetic correlations with other behavioral systems contributing to fitness (e.g., mating) are taken into account. Moreover, neurophysiological and endocrine findings in mammals support our hypothesis that TI activates the mechanisms responsible for recovery from disruptive experiences and body lesions.

AB  - Industrial wastes represent a huge issue for the environment and precious materials for microbial growth. Utilizing these wastes in different fermentation process decrease the costs of production, materials, energy, and represent an eco-friendly way of waste recycling. Aspergillus niger (ASU49) is promising isolate produce several hydrolytic enzymes as lipases, amylases, cellulases and pectinases. Lipase enzyme was optimized by Box-Behnken experiential design using coconut, jojoba and cooking oil wastes. Extracted crude lipase enzyme and lypholized one were compared and utilizing in biodiesel production. Coconut and jojoba wastes were promising in lipase production and maximum experimental values of lipase enzyme from both wastes were 4.32, 2.33 U/gds (predicted values were 4.29, 2.36 U/gds for jojoba and coconut wastes, respectively) obtained in run number (3) using Oil waste (2, (0) g/l) (A), Waste cooking oil (0, (-1) %) (B), and Temperature (30, (-1) degrees C) (C). The design was considerable, and efficacious to clear the interaction between factors; R2 values of lipase activity 0.998, 0.999 and adjusted R2 values 0.993, 0.998 for jojoba and coconut wastes, respectively. Extracted crud lipase (81.95% of total FAMEs) was more efficient than lyophilized lipases (56.14% of total FAMEs) in biodiesel production. Different oil wastes represent excellent sheep, nutritional, and effective sources for enzyme production using solid state fermentation especially with high producing microbial isolates and good optimizing designs.

AB  - Livestock keepers in southwestern Burkina Faso hold the local Lobi taurine breed, local Zebu cattle, and their crosses. Some communities in the region have begun to implement community-based cattle breeding programs (CBBPs), which involve animal tagging and recording and, potentially, also bull sharing. Based on the hypothesis that the participation of livestock keepers in CBBPs depends on their attitudes towards these programs, we used questionnaires to survey the attitudes of 125 farmers towards cattle breeding strategies and tools. Results were analyzed using principal component analysis. Farmers showed a highly positive attitude towards maintaining the features of their preferred cattle breed, but their attitudes varied substantially towards crossbreeding for breed improvement. Farmers generally agreed that performance was more important than animal appearance, and most of them were willing to cooperate with breeders' associations but were skeptical about sharing their bulls with other farmers. The majority was reluctant to record performance data, which may be due to a capacity deficit and their confidence in being able to select the best animals based purely on phenotype. Our analysis suggests that breeders' associations, as a key component of CBBPs, should lay down clear rules and obligations for their members from the outset. Timely consideration of farmers' attitudes towards different breeding tools may improve their uptake and guarantee the sustainability of CBBPs.

AB  - Simple Summary Pigs in Ireland are reared in intensive indoor systems, with sows normally confined in farrowing crates for a period of five weeks each time they farrow. This practice presents major animal welfare problems, with permeant confinement being banned at all other stages of production due to the negative impact on welfare. This study identified positive effects on sow behaviour and welfare when housed in free lactation pens compared with conventional farrowing crates. Such pens allow sows greater freedom of movement throughout farrowing and lactation, and this resulted in decreased locomotion score impact for sows housed in the free lactation treatment. This could be beneficial with regard to both sow longevity and sow welfare. Farrowing crates present a major animal welfare problem. This study investigated the effects of temporary confinement at farrowing on sow welfare and aimed to determine whether this type of system could improve sow welfare through increased freedom of movement. Sows were housed in one of two farrowing accommodation treatments: conventional farrowing crates (Control) or free lactation pens (Free). Sows in the Control treatment were confined from entry to weaning, a period of five weeks. Sows in the Free treatment were temporarily confined from before farrowing (approximately 24 h) until day 4 post-partum, after which time the crate was opened, and they had increased freedom of movement. Sow physical measures (weight, back-fat thickness, hoof score, locomotion score and tear stain score) were measured at entry to farrowing accommodation and at weaning. Salivary cortisol concentration was measured throughout lactation. Farrowing duration and sow posture (Days 1, 3, 7 and 34 after entry) were recorded. Between entry and weaning, locomotion scores significantly increased for sows housed in the Control treatment compared with those housed in Free lactation pens (p < 0.01). Sows in the Free treatment were observed to use all orientations in the pen, showing that when more space is made available to them, they will choose to utilise the space. Tear staining under the left eye was found to be less in Free sows at weaning (p = 0.05), indicating reduced stress. However, salivary cortisol concentration was higher in Free sows overall; cortisol is affected by both positive and negative stimuli, and so, this may be due to factors other than stress, such as higher levels of activity and mental stimulation. These results suggest that free lactation pens can benefit sow welfare; increased freedom of movement throughout lactation can improve sow locomotory health, and as suggested by improved tear stain scores, sow stress levels may be reduced in this type of system compared with conventional farrowing crates.

AB  - Over a decade ago, three independent studies reported that pathogen- and herbivore-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana produces primed progeny with increased resistance. Since then, heritable induced resistance (h-IR) has been reported across numerous plant-biotic interactions, revealing a regulatory function of DNA (de)methylation dynamics. However, the identity of the epi-alleles controlling h-IR and the mechanisms by which they prime defense genes remain unknown, while the evolutionary significance of the response requires confirmation. Progress has been hampered by the relatively high variability, low effect size, and sometimes poor reproducibility of h-IR, as is exemplified by a recent study that failed to reproduce h-IR in A. thaliana by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). This study aimed to improve h-IR effect size and reproducibility in the A. thaliana-Pst interaction. We show that recurrent Pst inoculations of seedlings result in stronger h-IR than repeated inoculations of older plants and that disease-related growth repression in the parents is a reliable marker for h-IR effect size in F1 progeny. Furthermore, RT-qPCR-based expression profiling of genes controlling DNA methylation maintenance revealed that the elicitation of strong h-IR upon seedling inoculations is marked by reduced expression of the chromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) gene, which is maintained in the apical meristem and transmitted to F1 progeny. Two additional genes, MET1 and CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3), displayed similar transcriptional repression in progeny from seedling-inoculated plants. Thus, reduced expression of DDM1, MET1, and CMT3 can serve as a marker of robust h-IR in F1 progeny. Our report offers valuable information and markers to improve the effect size and reproducibility of h-IR in the A. thaliana-Pst model interaction.

AB  - Co-occurring herbivorous pests may have shared or divergent responses to plant- and insect- derived cues, creating challenges for effective pest management in agroecosystems. We examined how behaviors of two endemic specialist herbivores of Cucurbitaceae crops, squash bugs (Anasa tristis, Hemiptera: Coreidae) and striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are affected by cues in the Cucurbita pepo agroecosystem. We evaluated plant resistance to squash bugs and beetles using cultivars that typify the two domesticated subspecies C. p. pepo (e.g., zucchini) and C. p. ovifera (e.g., straightneck summer squash), and tested how squash bugs respond to beetle aggregation and feeding. Across several field experiments, we demonstrated that squash bugs prefer to oviposit on C. p. ovifera over C. p. pepo, while beetles had the opposing preference. Nonetheless, there was no link between preference and squash bug nymphal survival or development. While squash bugs and beetles diverge in preference, we found that squash bugs positively respond to beetle-derived cues. More squash bug oviposition was observed on plants with greater beetle damage and, using both actively feeding beetles and synthetic lures, we demonstrate that bugs eavesdrop on and respond to vittatalactone, the male-produced beetle aggregation pheromone. Thus, squash bugs appear to exploit the cue of a co-occurring specialist beetle for host choice and this has implications for management: while there are trade-offs in varietal preference, synergistic trapping of both pests may be possible. By evaluating the behavior of co-occurring pests, management strategies with multi-species efficacy can be identified and applied in agroecologically-based pest management.

AB  - The yellow mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks (Acari: Tarsonemidae) is a destructive pest, affecting fiberproducing jute plants in Bangladesh. Development, survivorship and adult reproduction of this pest on five common jute cultivars (Corchorus capsularis: CVL-1, BJC-7370, BJC-2197, C. olitorius: O-795, O-9897) were investigated under laboratory conditions and life-table parameters were estimated. Developmental periods from egg to adult emergence ranged from 2.7 to 3.9 days with the sex ratio (proportion of females) being 0.71 to 0.78. Adult longevity varied from 8.8 to 5.4 days for both females and males. Immature survivorship ranged from 84.4 to 97.9 % with the lowest on CVL-1. Daily fecundity was highest (4.2) on BJC-7370 while lifetime fecundity was greatest on O-795 cultivar. The jute cultivars did not show any significant effects on the lifespan of male adults, but did on female adult performance such as reproduction, longevity and life table parameters. Based on developmental period, doubling time and rm value, BJC-7370 supported the fastest population growth, and O9897 and CVL-1 cultivars the slowest population growth. These results could be possibly related to the resistance potential to this important herbivore pest. Additional investigations should explore the nutritional and digestioninhibition mechanisms that account for the differences in performance of the phytophagous mites on jute cultivars.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) is an increasingly widespread tool for research as it allows the creation of experiments taking place in multimodal and daily-life-like environments, while keeping a strong experimental control. Adding neuroimaging to VR leads to a better understanding of the underlying brain networks activated during a natu-ralistic task, whether for research purposes or rehabilitation. The present paper focuses on the specific use concurrent VR and fMRI and its technical challenges and feasibility, with a brief examination of the general existing solutions. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review investigates the particular case of how VR-fMRI has explored episodic memory so far, with a comparison of object-and place-based episodic memory. This review confirms the involvement of cerebral regions well-known to be implicated in episodic memory and unravels other regions devoted to bodily and narrative aspects of the self, promoting new avenues of research in the domain of naturalistic episodic memory. Future studies should develop more immersive and interactive virtual neuroimaging features to increase ecological and embodied neurocognition aspects.

AB  - As a day animal with sensitivity to inflammation similar to that of humans, the sheep may highly outperform the rodent model in inflammation studies. Additionally, seasonality makes sheep an interesting model in endocrinology research. Although there are studies concerning inflammation's influence on leptin secretion and vice versa, a ewe model, with its possible 'long-day leptin resistance', is still not examined enough. The present study aimed to examine whether leptin may modulate an acute inflammation influence on plasma hormones in two photoperiodical conditions. The experiment was conducted on 48 ewes divided into four groups (control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leptin, LPS + leptin) during short and long days. Blood sampling started 1 hour before and continued 3 h after LPS/saline administration for further hormonal analysis. The results showed that the photoperiod is one of the main factors influencing the basal concentrations of several hormones with higher values of leptin, insulin and thyroid hormones during long days. Additionally, the acute inflammation effect on cortisol, insulin and thyroid hormones was photoperiod-dependent. The endotoxemia may also exert an influence on leptin concentration regardless of season. The effects of leptin alone on hormone blood concentrations are rather limited; however, leptin can modulate the LPS influence on insulin or thyroxine in a photoperiod-dependent way.

AB  - The effect of programmed assistance at parturition on the behaviour of the mother and its offspring in primiparous ewes under extensive rearing was evaluated. Programmed parturition assistance was defined as the manoeuvres performed immediately after the beginning of the expulsion phase to shorten it. Twenty-eight 2-year old Corriedale primiparous ewes (body condition score (BCS): 3.4 & PLUSMN; 0.1; body weight (BW): 35.5 & PLUSMN; 0.7 kg) with a single foetus were used. Before lambing and considering BW, BCS and sire, the ewes were randomly assigned to (i) Programmed-parturition-assisted (PPA; n = 14): ewes whose lambing was programmed to be assisted or (ii) Not-assisted (NA; n = 14): ewes that were not assisted and their lambs were born through natural labour. The duration of the foetus expulsion phase, maternal behaviour score (MBS, 1-5), onset of grooming, lamb/ewe BW ratio and lamb desertion were determined in the ewes. Birth weight, Apgar test (score 0-10), O2 saturation, meconium-stained coat, latency to first bleat, success to stand and suck, were registered in the lambs. PPA ewes registered shorter duration of labour (19.2 & PLUSMN; 4.2 vs. 42.6 & PLUSMN; 7.8 min), earlier onset of grooming (1.2 & PLUSMN; 0.4 vs. 3.0 & PLUSMN; 0.6 min), higher MBS (4.5 & PLUSMN; 0.1 vs. 3.1 & PLUSMN; 0.4) and did not desert any lamb during the first 72 h from birth. The lambs born to PPA mothers registered higher O2 saturation (97.6 & PLUSMN; 1.0 % vs. 93.4 & PLUSMN; 1.3 %), bleated earlier (2.4 & PLUSMN; 0.5 vs. 4.6 & PLUSMN; 0.8 min), stood up earlier (24.1 & PLUSMN; 4.2 vs. 36.8 & PLUSMN; 8.0 min) and recorded shorter time to suck (36.5 & PLUSMN; 6.7 vs. 71.0 & PLUSMN; 12.9 min). No effect of treatment on Apgar test or meconium-stained coat was observed, but regardless of treatment, meconium-stained lambs had a higher lamb/ewe BW ratio than unstained ones. The reduction of the duration of foetal expulsion phase, through programmed parturition assistance, positively affected the vigour of the lambs as well as the maternal behaviour of primiparous ewes, which in turn would increase the chances of lamb survival and ultimately, improve the welfare of the ewe-lamb unit.

AB  - High-quality semen is an essential factor for the success of artificial insemination, and revealing the genetic structure of pig semen traits helps improve semen quality. This study aimed to identify candidate genes associated with semen traits in three pig breeds (Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire) through weighted GWAS and multi-tissue transcriptome analysis. In this study, to identify candidate genes associated with semen traits in Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire, we performed weighted GWAS in four traits (sperm motility, sperm progressive motility, sperm abnormality rate, and total sperm count) using 936 pigs and multi-tissue transcriptome analysis using 34 tissues RNA-seq data of 5457 pigs from FarmGTEx. It was found that 16, 9, and 12 significant SNPs associated with semen traits were identified in Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire, with corresponding 7, 5, and 7 candidate genes in these three breeds, respectively, which may be involved in mammal spermatogenesis, testicular function, and male fertility. Moreover, we not only found the same candidate gene DNAI2 as in previous studies but also found two new candidate genes PNLDC1 and RSPH3, which were identified simultaneously in both Landrace and Yorkshire. By integrating the GWAS and multi-tissue transcriptome analysis results, we found that candidate genes associated with semen traits of three pig breeds were highly expressed in the testis tissue. The three genotypes of rs320928244 had significant effects on the expression of the DYNLT1 gene in the testis tissue of Landrace. These results together showed that these candidate genes were mainly related to sperm motility defects. This study helps deepen the understanding of the genetic basis of semen traits and provides a theoretical foundation for improving the semen quality of Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire breeds.

AB  - Nesidiocoris tenuis (Reuter) (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophagous bug that can derive nutrients from 3 trophic levels: plants, herbivorous arthropods, and other predators. On tomato, besides damaging the plants as they feed, might the mirid also forage on pest species and repel pests. In greenhouse and laboratory experiments, we investigated the functional response of the bug, its prey preference, and its influence on the oviposition potentials of 2 major pest species Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Phthorimaea absoluta Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) on tomato Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanaceae). Nesidiocoris tenuis showed a Type II functional response to both prey species. The estimated handling time was higher for H. armigera eggs than for P. absoluta yet N. tenuis attack rates did not differ between the 2 prey species. Nesidiocoris tenuis did not show a preference for 1 species when prey eggs were provided in equal proportions. The feeding on tomato plants by N. tenuis did not affect oviposition by the 2 moth species, as neither species showed a preference for clean or N. tenuis-adult-damaged plants and clean or N. tenuis-nymph-damaged plants. This study shows that N. tenuis can prey upon eggs of both moth species as the 3 species co-occur in tomato fields. However, because of the shorter handling time of P. absoluta eggs by the predator and the higher number of eggs laid by H. armigera, the co-occurrence might be less detrimental to the H. armigera populations compared to P. absoluta.

AB  - Simple Summary Colostrum is the first product produced by mammals in the mammary gland immediately after parturition. It contains immunoglobulins, which are essential for the survival of the newborn. Because some evidence exists of a positive effect of melatonin on colostrum quality in sheep, we studied the effect of implanting melatonin 6 weeks before lambing in five dairy farms, and simultaneously on milk yield and quality during the first three monthly milk samplings after lambing. We compared one vs. two implants, and a control, nonimplanted group. Ewes that received a melatonin implant 40 d before lambing produced colostrum that had a higher IgG concentration than the colostrum from nonimplanted ewes, and produced more milk which, had a lower somatic cell count (SCC). The effect on SCC was prolonged if the sheep received a second melatonin implant. The effects of exogenous melatonin implanted before lambing on the quality of colostrum and milk yield were quantified in 715 ewes. Forty days before lambing, 246 ewes (1M) received a melatonin implant; another 137 ewes (2M) received two implants, and the remaining 332 ewes (C) did not receive an implant (control). Milk analysis was based on individual monthly milk samplings (June, July, and August) after lambing. A colostrum sample was collected from 303 ewes (118 1M; 73 2M; and 112 C), and IgG concentrations were measured. Ewes implanted with melatonin had higher (p < 0.01) daily milk yield (DMY) in the three samplings than the C ewes. On average, 1M ewes produced more milk (p < 0.05) than ewes in the other two groups, and 2M ewes produced significantly (p < 0.05) more milk than C ewes. In the first and third controls, ewes that received two melatonin implants had a lower (p < 0.05) SCC than C and 1M ewes, and in the second sampling, 1M and 2M ewes had a lower (p < 0.01) SCC than C ewes. Ewes that received melatonin implants had a higher (p < 0.01) IgG concentration (21.61 +/- 1.03 mg/mL) than non-implanted ewes (16.99 +/- 1.13 mg/mL); 2M ewes had the highest IgG levels. In conclusion, ewes that received a melatonin implant 40 d before lambing produced colostrum that had a higher IgG concentration than the colostrum from nonimplanted ewes, and produced more milk, which had a lower SCC. The effect on SCC was prolonged if the sheep received a second melatonin implant.

AB  - Glandular trichomes (GTs) are epidermal structures that provide the first line of chemical defense against arthropod herbivores and other biotic threats. The most conspicuous structure on leaves of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the type-VI GT (tVI-GT), which accumulates both flavonoids and volatile terpenoids. Although these classes of specialized metabolites are derived from distinct metabolic pathways, previous studies with a chalcone isomerase 1 (CHI1)-deficient mutant called anthocyanin free (af) showed that flavonoids are required for terpenoid accumulation in tVI-GTs. Here, we combined global transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of isolated trichomes as a starting point to show that the lack of CHI1 is associated with reduced levels of terpenoid biosynthetic transcripts and enzymes. The flavonoid deficiency in af trichomes also resulted in the upregulation of abiotic stress-responsive genes associated with DNA damage and repair. Several lines of biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that the terpenoid defect in af mutants is specific for the tVI-GT and is associated with the absence of bulk flavonoids rather than loss of CHI1 per se. A newly developed genome-scale model of metabolism in tomato tVI-GTs helped identify metabolic imbalances caused by the loss of flavonoid production. We provide evidence that flavonoid deficiency in this cell type leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may impair terpenoid biosynthesis. Collectively, our findings support a role for flavonoids as ROS-scavenging antioxidants in GTs.
   Flavonoid deficiency in glandular trichomes of tomato leads to a cell type-specific increase in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and downregulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.

AB  - Simple Summary Whether a pig should be placed on its back or sternum to facilitate endotracheal intubation is currently not known and a subject of debate. Enrolling participants with different clinical anaesthesia backgrounds, we aimed at assessing which recumbency (dorsal versus sternal) is advantageous, and if operator experience can influence the results. Using objective and subjective outcomes, we found that sternal recumbency is advantageous if compared to dorsal, but that this is true only for operators lacking experience in anaesthetising animals. Experts' confidence in intubating various animal species with different techniques probably minimized the influence of recumbency. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is challenging in pigs. We compared the number of attempts and time to perform ETI, and the subjective perception of ease, while the animal was positioned in dorsal (DR) or sternal (SR) recumbency, as well as assessed whether operator experience influences the outcome. Participants were divided into three groups: undergraduates (ST; veterinary students), graduates (GR; veterinarians without specific anaesthesia training) and experts (EX; veterinary anaesthesia intern/resident and diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia). Each participant intubated one freshly euthanised pig in DR and ST. Number of attempts and time to correctly perform ETI, number of oesophageal intubations and answers to Likert-scale questions on larynx visualization and ease of endotracheal tube introduction and advancement were recorded. Thirty-three participants were enrolled (15 ST, 10 GR and 8 EX). Less attempts (p = 0.002) and time (p = 0.002) to correctly perform ETI were needed in SR for the ST group. In 21/119 and 5/48 ETI attempts, oesophageal intubation was performed in DR and SR, respectively. Larynx visualization (p < 0.001) and endotracheal tube introduction (p < 0.001) were perceived as easier in SR for the ST group. No difference between recumbencies was found in perceived ease to advance the endotracheal tube. For inexperienced operators, intubation in SR can be recommended.

AB  - Nucleic acids are enabling a new generation of therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent a range of diseases. While these therapies have typically been limited to parenteral dosing, patients and clinicians prefer oral dosage forms. Furthermore, oral delivery enables local transfection of cells in the gastrointestinal tract not easily targeted via parenteral administration. To address these challenges, we synthesized and screened a library of branched hybrid poly(beta-a-mino ester) mRNA nanoparticles for transfection efficiency; then we combined the highest performing formulations with ingestible milli injector capsules capable of delivering formulations directly into gastric tissue. We validated the performance of formulations and devices in rodents and pigs, demonstrating protein translation in the delta, gastric, and parietal cells of the gastric mucosa, in addition to systemic uptake. We anticipate oral delivery of mRNA could facilitate rapid deployment of episodic interventions, such as vaccines, and support long-term therapies.

AB  - The thrip (Megalurothrips usitatus) damages the flowers and pods of the cowpea, causing "black-heads and black-tails" (BHBT) symptoms and negatively affecting its economic value. However, the mechanism by which BHBT symptoms develop is still unknown. Our results showed that the microstructure of the pod epidermis was altered and the content of the plant's resistance-related compounds increased after a thrip infestation. However, the contents of protein and free amino acids did not change significantly, suggesting that the nutritional value was not altered. Pathogens were found not to be involved in the formation of BHBT symptoms, as fungi and pathogenic bacteria were not enriched in damaged pods. Two herbivory-induced flavonoids-7,4 '-dihydroxyflavone and coumestrol-were found to exert insecticidal activity. Our study clarified that BHBT symptoms are directly caused by the thrip. Thresholds for pest control need to be reconsidered as thrip herbivory did not degrade cowpea nutrition.

AB  - Apex predators structure ecosystems by hunting mesopredators and herbivores. Their ecological influence is determined not only by the number of animals they kill, but also by how prey alter their behaviours to reduce risk. Predation risk is variable in space and time creating a landscape of fear. In Australia, dingoes hunt red foxes and suppress their populations. As both predators are commonly subjected to eradication programs, the question arises whether humans alter the risk dingoes pose to foxes and in turn alter the foxes' avoidance behaviours. We studied the spatio-temporal activity patterns and wariness behaviours of foxes and dingoes at sites where they were protected (predator friendly), where they were persecuted (predator persecuted), and at sites where foxes were persecuted, and dingoes had been eradicated (dingo eradicated). The landscape of fear hypothesis predicts that foxes will be the most spatiotemporally restricted and most fearful at predator friendly sites, and least restricted and fearful at dingo eradicated sites. We found that fox occupancy was highest at dingo eradicated sites; and that they avoided times of heightened dingo activity at predator friendly sites more than at predator persecuted sites. Contrary to predictions, foxes were the least fearful (lowest frequency of cautious and vigilant behaviour) and most social (highest frequency of social interactions) at predator friendly sites. Our findings suggest that in the absence of persecution, mesopredators living with socially-stable apex predators can anticipate and avoid risk, reducing the need for constant vigilance (i.e. fear). Where predators are protected, predator avoidance may be driven by knowledge rather than fear alone.

AB  - Among burrowing rodents, forelimb morphology frequently shares an intricate relationship with soil substrates. Soils vary widely in texture and density, leading to differences in friability (e.g., the relative ability of particles to be broken apart), which often requires forelimb specializations in digging animals. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) dig and occupy burrows, a trait that is essential to their survival. Some Dipodomys species are restricted to particular substrates that presumably require species-specific forelimb traits. Here we examined the forelimb morphology and soil substrates inhabited by range-restricted and widely ranging Dipodomys species to explore the variation in soil usage, forelimb specializations, and the relationship between these traits. We assessed size and shape traits of preserved specimen forelimb bones using traditional and geometric morphometric techniques and extracted soil data associated with the collecting locality of each specimen. We expected species that inhabit dense soil substrates to display specialized forelimb morphology typified by an elongated scapula and robust humerus, radius, and ulna. The species differed substantially in their soil associations and forelimb morphologies. In particular, forelimb traits that enhance mechanical digging ability were detected in D. elator, a range-restricted species that inhabits dense clay-rich soils. These findings suggest that Dipodomys species that inhabit dense substrates may require correspondingly specialized forelimb morphology and that these traits may limit the desirable geographic ranges inhabited by these species. This may provide important information when making conservation decisions given that unlike other habitat features, soil substrates cannot be easily modified to suit the needs of the organism.
   Kangaroo rat species display morphological variation associated with their forelimbs. Species that construct burrows in dense soils have correspondingly robust forelimb features, which suggests that these animals are morphologically specialized to their substrate and may help to explain their limited geographic range. Appreciating the role of soil specialization in habitat occupancy may provide important information as conservation decisions are made on behalf of these animals.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global healthcare concern affecting millions, with wide-ranging symptoms including sensory and behavioral changes that can persist long-term. Due to similarities with human brain cytoarchitecture and inflammation, minipig models are advantageous for translational TBI research. However, gaps in knowledge exist regarding their behavioral and sensory sequelae following injury. Methods: Therefore, in this study, we assessed changes in approachability using a forced human approach task (FHAT) and mechanical nociception using the von Frey test in adult male and female Yucatan minipigs for up to one week following a sham or central fluid percussion injury (cFPI). Specifically, the FHAT assessed each animal's response to a forced interaction with either a known or unknown experimenter. To evaluate changes in nociceptive sensory sensitivity, von Frey monofilaments ranging from 0.008 to 300 g of force were applied to the pinna of the ear or base of the tail. Results: We found that forced approachability was affected by experimenter familiarity as well as cFPI in a sex-specific manner at subacute timepoints. We also found reductions in sensitivity following cFPI on the ear in male minipigs and on the tail in female minipigs. Conclusion: Overall, the current study demonstrates that cFPI produces both behavioral and sensory changes in minipigs up to one-week post-injury.

AB  - The origin and evolutionary relationships of ornithischian dinosaurs are topics that have undergone a series of substantial revisions. At present there are several competing hypotheses concerning the relationship between Ornithischia and the other principal clades of Dinosauria. Some hypotheses have posited a tree topology within Dinosauria that imply a 'ghost-lineage' for Ornithischia (whose representatives make their first unambiguous appearance in the Hettangian) that extends through a substantial portion of Triassic time. In contrast, other hypotheses have placed conventionally Triassic dinosauromorph (stem-lineage Dinosauria) taxa within the clade Ornithischia. Recently, a large-scale phylogenetic analysis recovered an array of taxa, known as 'silesaurids', as a paraphyletic assemblage of taxa (referred to in this article using the informal terms silesaurs or silesaurians) on the branch leading to the clade Ornithischia. This latter hypothesis of relationships would account for the apparent absence of Triassic ornithischians, because stem-lineage ornithischians (silesaurs in this article) are exclusively Triassic. However, the analysis that produced this novel topology used a dataset that, in its original form, did not include all early representatives of Ornithischia (sensu lato), and did not incorporate all the anatomical characters that have been suggested to unite Ornithischia with other dinosaurian clades (Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha). Nor did the initial study go on to expand upon some important taxonomic, palaeobiological and evolutionary implications of a topology that links a paraphyletic array of silesaurs to the clade Ornithischia. The present article addresses these latter issues by expansion and re-analysis of the original dataset. The results find further support for the hypothesis that silesaurs comprise a paraphyletic grouping of taxa on the stem of Ornithischia and that successive silesaur taxa acquire anatomical characters anagenetically in a process that culminates in the assembly of what may be described as a 'traditional' ornithischian. The overall topology of the consensus tree remains but little changed from the original analysis, despite the addition of new taxa and characters. To provide stability to this area of the tree and to preserve the most important of the relevant taxonomic names, we suggest a revised taxonomic framework for ornithischians that is consistent with this new topology. We retain the name Ornithischia for the total-group (traditional Ornithischia and its stem-lineage), while we resuscitate a name originally proposed by Richard Owen, Prionodontia (= 'coarse edged teeth') for the clade containing only the so-called traditional ornithischian (= 'bird-hipped') dinosaurs. We also erect Parapredentata as a more exclusive subclade in Ornithischia. This novel taxonomic framework is intended to provide phylogenetic clarity and a degree of stability in Ornithischia and Dinosauria as further analyses and new data continue to refine and re-shape the tree. The data presented in this study represent a stage in our attempt to establish an early dinosaur dataset in which character definitions and character scores are agreed upon and used consistently.

AB  - The leaffooted bug, Leptoglossus phyllopus (L.) (Hemiptera: Coreidae), probes and feeds on tissues of many plant species, including developing cotton bolls, causing seed damage and abscission. Insecticides are the primary tool for managing leaffooted bugs, but concerns about resistance and environmental harm highlight the need for alternative management strategies. One promising approach is using semiochemicals, such as plant- and insect-produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to trap or repel pests. Insect herbivores often use plant-produced VOCs to select suitable host plants for feeding and oviposition. Field observations of abundant adult leaffooted bugs on cotton bolls suggest that bugs aggregate at feeding sites. The goal of this study was to characterize VOCs from developing cotton bolls with and without leaffooted bug herbivory and evaluate how these VOCs affect adult bug foraging behavior. A portable dynamic headspace sampling method was used to collect VOCs from developing cotton bolls in the field, and VOC samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Leaffooted bug herbivory induced volatile emissions from cotton bolls, with significant increases in the emissions of six compounds (benzaldehyde, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, beta-myrcene, p-xylene, and (E)-beta-caryophyllene). Dual-choice olfactometer assays revealed that adult leaffooted bugs were attracted to VOCs from damaged cotton bolls, as well as being attracted to synthetic benzaldehyde or alpha-pinene individually. In contrast, leaffooted bugs were repelled by the combination of synthetic benzaldehyde and alpha-pinene. These findings suggest that VOCs from cotton bolls are attractive to leaffooted bugs and could contribute to the development of attractive lures for integrated pest management.

AB  - Following its recent invasion of African countries, fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), now co-exists with resident stemborers such as Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) causing severe damage to maize crops. Due to niche overlap, interspecific interactions occur among the three species, but the mechanisms and degree remain unclear. In this study, we assessed plant-mediated intraspecific and interspecific interactions, predation in laboratory and semi-field settings, and larval field occurrence of S. frugiperda and the two stemborer species. Larval feeding assays to evaluate competitive plantmediated interactions demonstrated that initial S. frugiperda feeding negatively affected subsequent stemborer larval feeding and survival, suggesting induction of herbivore-induced mechanisms by S. frugiperda, which deters establishment and survival of competing species. Predation assays showed that, at different developmental larval stages, second-sixth instars of S. frugiperda preyed on larvae of both B. fusca and C. partellus. Predation rates of S. frugiperda on stemborers was significantly higher than cannibalism of S. frugiperda and its conspecifics (p < 0.001). Cannibalism of S. frugiperda in the presence of stemborers was significantly lower than in the presence of conspecifics (p = 0.04). Field surveys showed a significantly higher number of S. frugiperda larvae than stemborers across three altitudinally different agroecological zones (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this study showed that the invasive S. frugiperda exhibited a clear competitive advantage over resident stemborers within maize cropping systems in Kenya. Our findings reveal some of the possible mechanisms employed by S. frugiperda to outcompete resident stemborers and provide crucial information for developing pest management strategies for these lepidopteran pests.

AB  - In porcine placenta, abnormal development of the placental vasculature leads to placental insufficiency. The aim of this study was to determine the mRNA expression of angiogenic growth factors and to determine the vascular characteristics in placenta at day 40 of pig gestation. Samples were collected from maternal-chorioallantoic interface (n = 21) for the measurement of mRNA expression of VEGFA, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, FGF2 and its receptors KDR, TEK, FGFR1IIIc, FGFR2IIIb respectively, and for immunohistochemistry analysis of CD31 and VEGFA. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 and VEGFA, morphometric measurement of blood vessels, high-resolution light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were performed. Capillary area density, number of blood vessels and capillary area were significantly higher on the maternal side than on the fetal side (p < .05). The ultrastructural finding of blood vessels demonstrates close contact with the trophoblastic epithelium. The relative mRNA expression of VEGFA and its receptor KDR was higher compared with the other angiogenic genes. In conclusion, a high mRNA expression of VEGFA and its receptor KDR added to the immunohistochemical results suggest a potential role of these genes in this pathway associated with an increase in the density of the capillary area on the maternal side and a reduction in the hemotrophic diffusion distance at the interface for nutrient exchange.

AB  - Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Acari: Tarsonemidae) is a common polyphagous mite in tropical and subtropical areas and is considered as an important citrus pest.
   To understand the response of citrus to P. latus infestation, we have characterized the volatile profile and the molecular defence mechanisms of two citrus genotypes, namely sour orange (Citrus aurantium) and Cleopatra mandarin (Citrus reshni), to P. latus infestation. These two species are important rootstocks for the citrus industry and display differential resistance to Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), with sour orange showing elevated levels of constitutive and induced resistance associated with the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway compared with Cleopatra mandarin.
   P. latus infestation activated both the JA- and the salicylic acid-dependent pathways in sour orange but not in Cleopatra mandarin. However, this differential activation resulted in the production of similar volatile blends (a mixture of green leaf volatiles and aromatic compounds).
   Contrary to T. urticae infestation, sour orange supported larger densities of P. latus than Cleopatra mandarin with similar injury levels.
   Therefore, sour orange may be more tolerant to P. latus than Cleopatra mandarin.

AB  - The isoflavone formononetin (F) impacts livestock fertility and cultivars of the pasture legume Trifolium subterraneum L. (subclover) have been selected for F levels =0.2% of leaf dry weight. However, the impact of waterlogging (WL) on isoflavones is little studied. We investigated the response of isoflavones, biochanin A (BA), genistein (G) and F, to WL for: (1) Yarloop (high F) and eight low F cultivars each from subspecies subterraneum, brachycalycinum and yanninicum (Experiment 1); and (2) four cultivars and 12 ecotypes of ssp. yanninicum (Experiment 2). WL impacted F: estimated means increased from 0.19% (control) to 0.31% (WL) in Experiment 1 and from 0.61% to 0.97% in Experiment 2. Isoflavones under WL were highly heritable, particularly F (H-2 = 95%). The proportions of BA, G and F were little changed by WL, with strong positive correlations between free-drained and waterlogged treatments. Isoflavone contents were not related to WL tolerance, as assessed by shoot relative growth rate. In conclusion, isoflavones varied among genotypes and increased with WL, but the proportion of individual isoflavones in each genotype was stable. High F under WL was unrelated with genotype tolerance to WL. Instead, it was a consequence of inherently high F for that particular genotype.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of manure amendments in abating ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) emissions during storage. Two experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 was conducted using 20 L of slurry for 98 days. Treatments were: aluminium sulphate (alum), lactogypsum, zeolite, actiglene, ammonium thiosulphate, biochar, dairy processing waste, Digest-IT and control (without amendment). Experiment 2 was conducted using 660 L of slurry in underground storage tanks for 77 days. Treatments were: sulphuric acid, gypsum, biochar and control (without amendment). NH3 measurements for experiment 1 and experiment 2 were conducted using the photoacoustic gas monitor and dynamic chamber techniques, respectively. CH4 was measured using the static chamber technique in both experiments. The effect of amendments on slurry composition was determined at the end of the experiments. Experiment 1 showed a significant reduction in NH3 emissions in the alum (82%), lactogypsum (46%) and zeolite (32%) treatments relative to the control (100.3% total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN)). CH4 was reduced significantly in the alum (87%), ammonium thiosulphate (64%) and lactogypsum (67%) relative to the control (291.9 g m-2). Experiment 2 showed a significant reduction (32%) in NH3 emissions in the sulphuric acid relative to the control (4.4% TAN). CH4 was reduced significantly in the sulphuric acid (46%), gypsum (39%) and biochar (15%) treatments relative to the control (291.9 g m-2). In general, amendments altered slurry composition such as dry matter, volatile solids, carbon and nitrogen contents at the end of storage. Lactogypsum, alum and sulphuric acid were effective in abating both NH3 and CH4 emissions and can contribute to improving air quality.

AB  - Industrial hog operation (IHO) workers can be occupationally exposed to Staphylococcus aureus and may carry the bacteria in their nares. Workers may persistently carry S. aureus or transition between different states of nasal carriage over time: no nasal carriage, nasal carriage of a human-associated strain, and nasal carriage of a livestock-associated strain. We developed a mathematical model to predict the proportion of IHO workers in each nasal carriage state over time, accounting for IHO worker mask use. We also examined data sufficiency requirements to inform development of models that produce reliable predictions. We used nasal carriage data from a cohort of 101 IHO workers in North Carolina, sampled every 2 weeks for 4 months, to develop a three-state Markov model that describes the transition dynamics of IHO worker nasal carriage status over the study period and at steady state. We also stratified models by mask use to examine their impact on worker transition dynamics. If conditions remain the same, our models predicted that 49.1% of workers will have no nasal carriage of S. aureus, 28.2% will carry livestock-associated S. aureus, and 22.7% will carry human-associated S. aureus at steady state. In stratified models, at steady state, workers who reported only occasional mask (<80% of the time) use had a higher predicted proportion of individuals with livestock-associated S. aureus nasal carriage (39.2%) compared to workers who consistently (>= 80% of the time) wore a mask (15.5%). We evaluated the amount of longitudinal data that is sufficient to create a Markov model that accurately predicts future nasal carriage states by creating multiple models that withheld portions of the collected data and compared the model predictions to observed data. Our data sufficiency analysis indicated that models created with a small subset of the dataset (approximately 1/3 of observed data) perform similarly to models created using all observed data points. Markov models may have utility in predicting worker health status over time, even when limited longitudinal data are available.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The miR-148a has been shown to play an important role in preadipocyte differentiation. Herein, we explored the role of miR-148a in ovine adipocyte development, using Oil Red O staining, CCK-8, EdU, flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. The results showed that miR-148a suppressed proliferation and facilitated the differentiation of preadipocytes. The dual fluorescent reporter vector experiments showed that miR-148a directly targeted PTEN. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that PTEN significantly inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes. In conclusion, our research provides new insights that miR-148a inhibits ovine preadipocyte proliferation and accelerates differentiation by the negative regulation of PTEN.
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be involved in lipid deposition and metabolism. However, there have been no reports on the roles of miR-148a in the proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes in sheep. In this study, the expression of miR-148a was profiled in the eight tissues of Tibetan ewes and differentiated preadipocytes, and the role of miR-148a in differentiation and proliferation of ovine preadipocytes was investigated using Oil Red O staining, CCK-8, EdU staining, cell cycle detection, and RT-qPCR. The effect of PTEN on the differentiation of ovine preadipocytes was also investigated. The miR-148a was widely expressed in the eight tissues investigated and had significantly increased expression in liver, spleen and subcutaneous adipose tissues, and the heart. The expression of miR-148a continued to increase with the differentiation of ovine preadipocytes. The over-expression of miR-148a significantly promoted differentiation but inhibited the proliferation of ovine preadipocytes. The inhibition of miR-148a had the opposite effect on the differentiation and proliferation of ovine preadipocytes with over-expressed miR-148a. The results from the dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-148a mimic significantly decreased the luciferase activity of PTEN-3 ' UTR dual luciferase reporter vector, suggesting that PTEN is a target gene of miR-148a. In over-expressed-PTEN preadipocytes, the number of lipid droplets remarkably decreased, and the expression levels of adipogenesis marker genes PPAR gamma, FASN, FATP4, GLUT4, C/EBP beta and LPL were also significantly down-regulated. These results suggest that miR-148a accelerated the adipogenic differentiation of ovine preadipocytes by inhibiting PTEN expression, and also inhibited the proliferation of ovine preadipocytes.

AB  - Although the cerebellum contributes to higher-order cognitive and emotional functions relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), prior research on cerebellar volume in PTSD is scant, particularly when considering subregions that differentially map on to motor, cognitive, and affective functions. In a sample of 4215 adults (PTSD n = 1642; Control n = 2573) across 40 sites from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group, we employed a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar parcellation to obtain volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum volumes in PTSD compared to healthy controls (88% trauma-exposed). PTSD was associated with significant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls, people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume, as well as reduced volume in subregions primarily within the posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), vermis (VI, VIII), flocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and corpus medullare (all p(-FDR) < 0.05). Effects of PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. These findings implicate regionally specific cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum appears to play an important role in higher-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of translational models for PTSD.

AB  - In general, fish meat that is elastic and hard is preferred by consumers, but few methods have been identified for improving fillet quality. "Xianfeng No. 1", a new hybrid of Erythroculter ilishaeformis (female) x Ancherythroculter nigrocauda (male), is an important species for aquaculture in China. A short-term exercise trial (12 days) was conducted, followed by texture and histomorphology analysis, to determine the influence of exercise on fillet hardness of this hybrid species. Furthermore, transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses were carried out to better understand the molecular bases under the process of fillet quality formation. There are several novel findings in our study. First, exercise at a moderate velocity (1.2 body lengths per second) for 12 days can significantly increase the muscle texture (i.e., hardness and springiness) of this hybrid species. Second, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of muscle sections indicated a decrease in myofiber diameter and increased myofiber density as the exercise duration increased. Third, a total of 2056, 2414, and 3366 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the 4, 8, and 12 days treatment groups, respectively. Fourth, the DEGs were enriched in signaling pathways linked to muscle hardening (tight junction and hippo signaling pathways) and glucose metabolism (AMPK signaling pathways and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis). Genes associated with muscle hardening (WNT2B, CDH1, MYCB, MYH1, MYH2, and MYH6), immune defense (MAVS, EPO, and SKAP2), and glucose metabolism (HK1, GAPDH, LDHA, and PGK1) were also identified. From our study, there are several possible molecular bases on which exercise improves fillet hardness: exercise may activate hippo pathway to stimulate hyperplasia to further increase myofiber density, modulate the expression of MYHs to change myofiber type, and activate tight junction signaling pathway to narrow intermyofibrillar spaces. These findings will further accelerate the breeding of more appetizing and disease-resistant species.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline. Working memory impairment, a hallmark of early-stage AD, is hypothesized to arise from deficits in encoding processes. Given the critical role of hippocampal-prefrontal interactions in working memory, we investigated whether disrupted encoding mechanisms in this circuit contribute to AD-related deficits. We performed simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of APP/PS1 transgenic mice during a spatial working memory task. We analyzed oscillatory dynamics and directed information flow between these two regions across distinct task phases. Wild-type mice exhibited task-phase-specific enhancement of theta (4-12 Hz) and low-gamma (30-40 Hz) information flow from vHPC to mPFC during encoding, which correlated with performance accuracy. APP/PS1 mice showed a significant reduction in the theta and low-gamma flow and impaired task performance. Decoding analyses revealed a robust correlation between the strength of directed information flow and performance accuracy. These findings provide compelling evidence for a neurophysiological mechanism linking vHPC-mPFC circuit dynamics to encoding processes, offering new insights into the neural basis of working memory impairment in AD.

AB  - In-farm livestock production vaccinations are commonly delivered intramuscularly using needles. While there are alternative strategies these have been subject to little attention and limited commercialisation. One such alternative is needle-free vaccines and studies have focused on the immune response few have addressed the welfare implications. This study aims to compare the impact of intradermal needle-free vaccination and intramuscular injection in terms of the welfare of the piglets. A total of 179 piglets were divided into two treatments: intradermal needle-free delivery and intramuscular delivery of a vaccine. Measures of health and welfare included, vocalisations, behavioural observations, papule formation, and weight. Piglets vaccinated via the needle-free intradermal route vocalised less and displayed no significant behavioural differences but showed increased weight compared to piglets vaccinated intramuscularly. The use of a needle-free device to deliver a vaccine through an intradermal route revealed no adverse effects on piglet welfare and supports the use of alternative strategies to vaccinate livestock.

AB  - IntroductionThe barrier function of the gut is important for many organs and systems, including the brain. If gut permeability increases, bacterial fragments may enter the circulation, giving rise to increased systemic inflammation. Increases in bacterial translocation are reflected in higher values of blood markers, including lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14). Some pioneer studies showed a negative association between bacterial translocation markers and brain volumes, but this association remains scarcely investigated. We investigate the effect of bacterial translocation on brain volumes and cognition in both healthy controls and patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Materials and methodsHealthy controls (n = 39) and SSD patients (n = 72) underwent an MRI-scan, venipuncture and cognition assessments. We investigated associations between LBP and sCD14 and brain volumes (intracranial volume, total brain volume, and hippocampal volume) using linear regression. We then associated LBP and sCD14 to cognitive function using a mediation analysis, with intracranial volume as mediator. ResultsHealthy controls showed a negative association between hippocampal volume and LBP (b = -0.11, p = .04), and intracranial volume and sCD14 (b = -0.25, p = .07). Both markers were indirectly associated with lower cognitive functioning in healthy controls (LBP: b = -0.071, p = .028; sCD14: b = -0.213, p = .052), mediated by low intracranial volume. In the SSD patients, these associations were markedly less present. ConclusionThese findings extend earlier studies suggesting that increased bacterial translocation may negatively affect brain volume, which indirectly impacts cognition, even in this young healthy group. If replicated, this finding stresses the importance of a healthy gut for the development and optimal functioning of the brain. Absence of these associations in the SSD group may indicate that other factors such as allostatic load, chronic medication use and interrupted educational carrier had larger impact and attenuated the relative contribution of bacterial translocation.

AB  - Background Species domestication is generally characterized by the exploitation of high-impact mutations through processes that involve complex shifting demographics of domesticated species. These include not only inbreeding and artificial selection that may lead to the emergence of evolutionary bottlenecks, but also post-divergence gene flow and introgression. Although domestication potentially affects the occurrence of both desired and undesired mutations, the way wild relatives of domesticated species evolve and how expensive the genetic cost underlying domestication is remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the demographic history and genetic load of chicken domestication. Results We analyzed a dataset comprising over 800 whole genomes from both indigenous chickens and wild jungle fowls. We show that despite having a higher genetic diversity than their wild counterparts (average pi, 0.00326 vs. 0.00316), the red jungle fowls, the present-day domestic chickens experienced a dramatic population size decline during their early domestication. Our analyses suggest that the concomitant bottleneck induced 2.95% more deleterious mutations across chicken genomes compared with red jungle fowls, supporting the "cost of domestication" hypothesis. Particularly, we find that 62.4% of deleterious SNPs in domestic chickens are maintained in heterozygous states and masked as recessive alleles, challenging the power of modern breeding programs to effectively eliminate these genetic loads. Finally, we suggest that positive selection decreases the incidence but increases the frequency of deleterious SNPs in domestic chicken genomes. Conclusion This study reveals a new landscape of demographic history and genomic changes associated with chicken domestication and provides insight into the evolutionary genomic profiles of domesticated animals managed under modern human selection.

AB  - PurposeLamb meat is a crucial protein source in Icelanders' diets. Extensive grazing lands, locally grown hay feed, and traditional farming methods are often used as arguments for Icelandic lamb meat's environmental friendliness. However, no life cycle assessment (LCA) study exists to corroborate these arguments. This study conducts a national-level LCA to evaluate the environmental performance of lamb meat based on two functional units to identify key hotspot processes in its production.MethodThis study conducts a cradle-to-farm gate LCA at the national level for two functional units: 1 kg of edible lamb meat (ELM) and 100 g of ELM protein produced in Iceland in 2019. The multifunctionality between wool and meat is handled using mass allocation.The environmental impacts were estimated using the ReCiPe 2016 v1.1 mid-point (H) impact assessment method, emphasizing selected environmental categories: global warming, fossil resource scarcity, land use, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. In addition, the study conducts a scenario-based variability analysis by taking minimum and maximum values of inventory data to estimate the possible range of environmental impacts. Lastly, an overall uncertainty analysis and a global sensitivity analysis of the key hotspot process shed light on the variability and sensitivity of the LCA results.MethodThis study conducts a cradle-to-farm gate LCA at the national level for two functional units: 1 kg of edible lamb meat (ELM) and 100 g of ELM protein produced in Iceland in 2019.

Lastly, an overall uncertainty analysis and a global sensitivity analysis of the key hotspot process shed light on the variability and sensitivity of the LCA results.Result and discussionFor the 18 ReCiPe impact categories, animal and feed (hay) production are the hotspot processes, followed by feed (grazing) as a hotspot for land use. The global warming impact for 1 kg of ELM ranges 41-53 kg CO2 equivalent, and for 100 g of protein, 19-29 kg CO2 equivalent. Fossil resource scarcity impact for 1 kg of ELM impact ranges 2.5-3.6 kg oil equivalent, and for 100 g protein, 1-2 kg oil equivalent. Terrestrial ecotoxicity impacts for 1 kg of ELM range 46-69 kg 1,4-DCB, and for 100 g protein, 21-37 kg 1,4-DCB. Lastly, land use impacts for 1 kg of ELM range 562-2448 m2a crop equivalent, and for 100 g protein, 261-1324 m2a crop equivalent.ConclusionWith its traditional farming practices, Icelandic lamb meat production is close to an extensive farming system, which is in line with its higher global warming impact per kg ELM. Additionally, due to low hay yield and high fertilization rate, the impact on other impact categories is still higher compared to an extensive system. This perspective shifts when analyzed per 100 g of protein, where it performs close to the global average.

AB  - Obesity and related metabolic health issues are a growing human threat, with many theories regarding its causes. In swine, physiologically alike to humans, considerable knowledge on obesity mechanisms has been accumulated. Calorie counting is the basis for managing swine diets and applied with great accuracy. Epigenetic programing predisposes pigs to insulin insensitivity, but pigs seem to sense this insensitivity and consequently eat less, preventing obesity. Pigs naturally prefer to eat small breakfasts and large dinners. Deviating from this eating pattern or providing diets with a high glycemic burden can trigger obesity; however, pigs will restrict food intake to prevent serious obesity. Interestingly, in practice, problems with obesity are rarely seen, even when pigs are fed poorly timed diets similar to junk food, likely because swine diets are balanced for every nutrient. Indeed, feeding pigs diets deficient in micronutrients does trigger obesity. For humans, several micronutrient requirements have not been set officially, and diets optimized for all micronutrients are rarely provided. In conclusion, various obesity triggers are being debated for humans, which have been proven in swine. Obesity problems in pigs are nevertheless less excessive, likely because pigs recognize unhealthy eating practices and consequently reduce food intake to avoid serious complications. Finally, swine diets are normally balanced for all nutrients, which may be an important practice to prevent obesity, from which human health could greatly benefit.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the antibacterial effect of metal nanoparticles applied by laser-induced forward transfer on a wound infection model using pig skin. Nanoparticles were applied by laser-induced forward transfer using a nanosecond laser. The effect of nanoparticles was studied on five bacterial strains. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the treated areas of pig skin. Biofilm formation is considered one of the main complications of the treatment of wound infections and it is associated with the transition of wounds to a chronic non-healing state. We have presented a fundamentally new method of direct laser-induced nanoparticle transfer, which allows the infected surface to be treated with "fresh nanoparticles" obtained directly during transfer from a metal plate (silver, copper, zinc). An ex vivo model of wound infection using pig skin was obtained, which showed excellent reproducibility between repeats. The high antimicrobial potential of this method was shown on a model of a wound infected with clinically significant bacteria: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  - Background Shoot branching is one of the important agronomic traits affecting yields and quality of tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Cytokinins (CTKs) play critical roles in regulating shoot branching. However, whether and how differently alternative splicing (AS) variant of CTKs-related genes can influence shoot branching of tea plant is still not fully elucidated. Results In this study, five AS variants of CTK biosynthetic gene adenylate isopentenyltransferase (CsA-IPT5) with different 3 ' untranslated region (3 UTR) and 5 UTR from tea plant were cloned and investigated for their regulatory effects. Transient expression assays showed that there were significant negative correlations between CsA-IPT5 protein expression, mRNA expression of CsA-IPT5 AS variants and the number of ATTTA motifs, respectively. Shoot branching processes induced by exogenous 6-BA or pruning were studied, where CsA-IPT5 was demonstrated to regulate protein synthesis of CsA-IPT5, as well as the biosynthesis of trans-zeatin (tZ)- and isopentenyladenine (iP)-CTKs, through transcriptionally changing ratios of its five AS variants in these processes. Furthermore, the 3 ' UTR AS variant 2 (3AS2) might act as the predominant AS transcript. Conclusions Together, our results indicate that 3AS2 of the CsA-IPT5 gene is potential in regulating shoot branching of tea plant and provides a gene resource for improving the plant-type of woody plants.

AB  - Noise is an inarticulate stimulus that threatens health and well-being. It compromises audition and induces a strong stress response that activates the brain at several levels. In the present study, we expose male and female rats to environmental noise in order to investigate if acute or chronic stimulation produces differential brain activation patterns. The animals were exposed to a rat's audiogram-fitted adaptation of a noisy environment and later sacrificed to quantify the expression of the brain activity marker c-fos. Additionally, the serum corticosterone (CORT) levels were measured to elucidate possible the stress-related effects of noise. It was found that environmental noise differentially increased the serum CORT levels in male and female rats. We identified 17 brain regions outside the classical auditory circuits with a high expression of c-fos, including the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, habenular complex, septum, cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, insular cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Overall, we evidenced that females exhibit less intense c-fos expression in most of the examined areas. We concluded that females might be less affected by the changes produced by environmental noise.

AB  - Trichomes are a key feature of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) and essential for tea flavor compound formation, but their developmental mechanisms are still unclear. This study identified a transcription factor, CsNAC25, which positively regulates trichome formation in the 'Qiancha 1' tea plant cultivar. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CsNAC25 shares the highest homology with Arabidopsis XND1, and in situ hybridization revealed its specific expression in xylem cells and in trichomes of tea plant. Overexpression of CsNAC25 significantly inhibited xylem cell differentiation, reduced lignin and cellulose content, and led to a marked increase in trichome density. Conversely, using virus-induced gene silencing to silence CsNAC25 in tea plants resulted in reduced trichome density and elevated lignin content. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of key phenylpropanoid pathway genes, such as NtPAL2, Nt4CL1, NtCAD1, and NtCCR1, was significantly reduced in the overexpression lines. Conversely, in the CsNAC25-silenced tea cuttings, the expression of CsPAL1, Cs4CL2, CsCAD1, and CsCCR1 was drastically increased. Moreover, the expression of CsMYB1, a positive regulator of trichome development, was significantly decreased in the CsNAC25-silenced lines. Further yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase assays showed that CsNAC25 binds to the CsCCR1 promoter and represses its expression, suggesting that CsNAC25 regulates trichome development possibly by modulating CsCCR1 and impacting resource allocation within the phenylpropanoid metabolic network. In summary, our findings indicate that CsNAC25 in tea plants plays a dual role in regulating the secondary cell wall formation and trichome development.

The small size of nanobodies bestows multiple therapeutic advantages (stability, tumor penetration) with the first therapeutic approval in 2018 cementing the clinical viability of this format. Structured data and sequence information of nanobodies will enable the accelerated clinical development of nanobody-based therapeutics. Though the nanobody sequence and structure data are deposited in the public domain at an accelerating pace, the heterogeneity of sources and lack of standardization hampers reliable harvesting of nanobody information. We address this issue by creating the Integrated Database of Nanobodies for Immunoinformatics (INDI, http://naturalantibody.com/nanobodies). INDI collates nanobodies from all the major public outlets of biological sequences: patents, GenBank, next-generation sequencing repositories, structures and scientific publications. We equip INDI with powerful nanobody-specific sequence and text search facilitating access to >11 million nanobody sequences. INDI should facilitate development of novel nanobody-specific computational protocols helping to deliver on the therapeutic promise of this drug format.

AB  - Plants produce complex chemical defenses against herbivores, resulting in the emergence of detoxification strategies in phytophagous insects. While enzymatic detoxification and target site mutagenesis are well-documented, the quantitative contribution of excretion remains less studied. We focus on the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni), a generalist herbivore, to elucidate the detoxification of a steroidal alkaloid, solanidine, produced in potato (Solanum tuberosum). Through larval feeding experiments and chemical analysis of metabolites using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identify solanidine 3-O-beta-glucopyranoside and solanidine 3-phosphate as major metabolization products of solanidine. Glycosylation and phosphorylation reactions have not previously been observed in cabbage looper. Modified solanidine derivatives exhibit reduced lipophilicity, preventing passive transport as predicted by physicochemical analyses, and only solanidine was detected in body tissue. In addition, the metabolism of solanidine in a T. ni mutant strain with midgut cadherin protein knocked out was also investigated to examine the potential role of the cadherin, an important receptor for Bt toxins, in steroidal alkaloid detoxification. T. ni cadherin-knockout strain showed lower solanidine conversion (33.9% +/- 2.2) and uptake (27.41 +/- 0.49 nmol/g) compared to the wild-type strain (51.3% +/- 4.1, 33.66 +/- 2.48 nmol/g) but similar excretion kinetics. Although solanidine negatively impacted the feeding performance of both strains the cadherin-knockout does not affect the feeding performance. Our study expands the metabolization enzyme repertoire in cabbage loopers, emphasizing the complexity of detoxification mechanisms in generalist herbivores.

AB  - The mammalian family Bovidae has been widely studied in ecomorphological research, with important applications to paleoecological and paleohabitat reconstructions. Most studies of bovid craniomandibular features in relation to diet have used linear measurements. In this study, we conduct landmark-based geometric-morphometric analyses to evaluate whether different dietary groups can be distinguished by mandibular morphology. Our analysis includes data for 100 species of extant bovids, covering all bovid tribes and 2 dietary classifications. For the first classification with 3 feeding categories, we found that browsers (including frugivores), mixed feeders, and grazers are moderately well separated using mandibular shape. A finer dietary classification (frugivore, browser, browser-grazer intermediate, generalist, variable grazer, and obligate grazer) proved to be more useful for differentiating dietary extremes (frugivores and obligate grazers) but performed equally or less well for other groups. Notably, frugivorous bovids, which belong in tribe Cephalophini, have a distinct mandibular shape that is readily distinguished from all other dietary groups, yielding a 100% correct classification rate from jackknife cross-validation. The main differences in mandibular shape found among dietary groups are related to the functional needs of species during forage prehension and mastication. Compared with browsers, both frugivores and grazers have mandibles that are adapted for higher biomechanical demand of chewing. Additionally, frugivore mandibles are adapted for selective cropping. Our results call for more work on the feeding ecology and functional morphology of frugivores and offer an approach for reconstructing the diet of extinct bovids.

AB  - Background: Wound healing through second intention was prone to issues. As a result, there is a high need in veterinary medicine for medicines that hasten the healing of secondary wounds. These studies demonstrate the effect of autogenic, allogenic and heterogenic PRP on healing of wounds. Methods: Six rabbits weighing (1.8-2.5 kg), blood samples were collected from the rabbits and goats. Skin markings of 1cm in diameter were made on dorsal midlines. These wounds were allocated into four groups, control, autogenic, allogenic and heterogenic PRP treated groups. Planimetric monitoring to determine the diameter (mm) and histologically were performed at 3,7,15, and 21 days after injury. Results: Clinically, on day fifteen there were improvements in wound contraction in Auto and Allo PRP groups, better than control. There was slight improvement in the heteroPRP group. After 21 days of wounding, the Auto and AlloPRP group's wounds were completely closed. Histopathologically, after 1 week, the AutoPRP and AlloPRP groups revealed scab formation. However, in the XenoPRP and control groups the thick scab covers the incision line. After 2nd week of post wounding, the two treated groups were nearly similar compared with the XenoPRP and control group including scab detachment. At the end of the 3rd week, The NS group revealed scab formation partially detached. While all treated showed a complete regeneration of the epidermis layer, newly formed hair follicles beneath the regenerated epidermis layer. Conclusion: For the promotion of wound repair processes, autogenic additionally allogenicPRP therapy may be a straightforward, affordable, and successful option.

AB  - Covid-19, one of the coronaviruses, emerged in Wuhan, China, due to zoonotic infection towards the end of December 2019. According to WHO data, Covid-19 has been present among 267.865.289 people in 222 countries, causing death for 5.285.888 (December 12, 2021). Furthermore, these figures are increasing every day. In Turkey, 8.984.407 people have been infected thus far, and 78.602 have died (December 12, 2021). The following questions were investigated in this study: Does Covid-19 affect the use of medicinal and aromatic plants? If it does, what are the changes? What types of herbs are used and in which ways are they used? Who advises people to use these herbs? According to the results, 113 taxa belonging to 61 families and 105 genera were used by the participants at the genus, species and subspecies levels. Herbs that were widely used are Thymus spp., Tilia spp., Salvia spp., Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Mentha spp., Curcuma longa L., Rosa canina L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Lavandula spp., Matricaria spp., respectively. There was a positive and moderate-level relationship between medicinal and aromatic plants before and after COVID-19 and another positive and moderate-level relationship between the frequencies of using medicinal and aromatic plants before and after the pandemic. The relationships were significant for both questionnaire items. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the frequency of use of medicinal and aromatic plants before and after Covid-19.

AB  - The myogenic differentiation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) is an important biological process that plays a key role in the regeneration and repair of skeletal muscles. However, the mechanisms regulating myoblast myogenesis require further investigation. In this study, we found that STEAP3 is involved in myogenic differentiation based on the Yunan black pig MuSCs model in vitro using cell transfection and other methods. Furthermore, the expression of myogenic differentiation marker genes MyoG and MyoD and the number of myotubes formed by the differentiation of cells from the si-STEAP3 treated group were significantly decreased but increased in the STEAP3 overexpression group compared to that in the control group. STEAP3 played a role in iron ion metabolism, affecting myogenic differentiation via the uptake of iron ions and enhancing IRP-IRE homeostasis. STEAP3 also activated the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus promoting myoblast differentiation of Yunan black pig MuSCs. The results of this study showed that STEAP3 overexpression increased intracellular iron ion content and activated the homeostatic IRP-IRE system to regulate intracellular iron ion metabolism.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch is a polyphagous widespread herbivore pest and one of the most economically important species which feeds more than 1,100 plant species. The functional response at five different constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), prey switching, and mutual interference behaviors of the predatory coccinellid, Stethorus gilvifrons Mulsant on TSSM nymphs were assessed in laboratory conditions (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH and L:D 16:8 h) to evaluate its potential for biological control of TSSM. The predator showed a type II functional response at all tested temperatures. The shortest handling time (T-h) and highest searching efficiency (alpha) were obtained at 30 degrees C and 20 degrees C, respectively. The highest and lowest values of the maximum attack rate (T/T-h) of the predator were obtained at temperatures of 30 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. The switching behavior was not observed in S. gilvifrons between different density proportions of TSSM nymph and adult. The highest value of total predation and lowest value of per capita predation rate belonged to the predator density of 16. The results revealed a strong predation capacity of S. gilvifrons on TSSM, especially in higher temperatures which makes it an efficient biocontrol agent in integrated TSSM management programs.

AB  - Introduction Adversities during the perinatal period can decrease oxygen supply to the fetal brain, leading to various hypoxic brain injuries, which can compromise the regularity of brain development in different aspects. To examine the catecholaminergic contribution to the link between an early-life hypoxic insult and adolescent behavioral aberrations, we used a previously established rat model of perinatal hypoxia but altered the hypobaric to normobaric conditions.Methods Exploratory and social behavior and learning abilities were tested in 70 rats of both sexes at adolescent age. Inherent vertical locomotion, sensory-motor functions and spatial learning abilities were explored in a subset of animals to clarify the background of altered exploratory behavior. Finally, the concentrations of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline in midbrain and pons, and the relative expression of genes for DA receptors D1 and D2, and their down-stream targets (DA- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32 kDa, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, and inhibitor-5 of protein phosphatase 1) in the hippocampus and thalamus were investigated in 31 rats.Results A lesser extent of alterations in exploratory and cognitive aspects of behavior in the present study suggests that normobaric conditions mitigate the hypoxic injury compared to the one obtained under hypobaric conditions. Increased exploratory rearing was the most prominent consequence, with impaired spatial learning in the background. In affected rats, increased midbrain/pons DA content, as well as mRNA levels for DA receptors and their down-stream elements in the thalamus, but not the hippocampus, were found.Conclusion We can conclude that a mild hypoxic event induced long-lasting disbalances in mesothalamic DA signaling, contributing to the observed behavioral alterations. The thalamus was thereby indicated as another structure, besides the well-established striatum, involved in mediating hypoxic effects on behavior through DA signaling.

AB  - Background Various regulators coregulate muscle development in animals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial regulators that participate in multiple aspects of myofiber formation. Method: To identify key miRNAs and target genes associated with muscle development, embryos or longissimus dorsi of Chinese Merino sheep were collected for whole-transcriptome sequencing across 11 gestation periods: 26 days (D26), D29, D32, D35, D40, D45, D55, D75, D85, D105, and D135. The functions of key miRNAs and target genes were determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and Immunofluorescence staining.Results A total of 284 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were screened by comparing the transcriptome data across all 11 periods. DE-miRNAs were divided into two developmental stages (stage A and stage B) based on heat map clustering analysis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DE-miRNAs in stage A were closely related to myofiber formation, whereas those in stage B were closely related to myofiber growth and maturation. Differential expression and functional enrichment analysis of target genes of DE-miRNAs obtained from stage A revealed the target relationships between 159 DE-miRNAs and 21 differentially expressed target genes associated with myofiber formation. In vitro assays revealed that myoblast differentiation and myotube formation were significantly inhibited by MYH3 knockdown via siMYH3 and that novel-miR-766 targets and decreases the expression of MYH3. In addition, the expression levels of marker genes related to myoblast differentiation and myofiber types were altered after the overexpression and inhibition of novel-miR-766 in sheep myoblasts.Discussion This research not only elucidates the core temporal expression patterns of miRNAs but also suggests that novel-miR-766 influences myoblast differentiation and myofiber-type formation. This provides an important theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate myofiber development.

AB  - Territorial defence is a relatively common behaviour in reef fish. Aggression typically occurs between individuals of the same sex, given that members of the opposite sex may represent potential breeding partners. Seahorses are cryptic reef fish with typical sedentary behaviour, especially during the male pregnancy. In this context, we investigated the agonistic behaviour of pregnant seahorses, Hippocampus reidi, towards other males, pregnant or not, relating the duration of their interactions to the size and robustness of the resident and intruder. Robustness was measured as the circumference of the brood pouch divided by total body length. The study was based on four alternative treatments, which were monitored in situ: (i) a pregnant male in its home range was exposed to a pregnant intruder male; (ii) a non-pregnant male in its home range was exposed to a pregnant intruder male; (iii) a pregnant male in its own home range was exposed to a non-pregnant intruder male, and (iv) a non-pregnant male in its home range was exposed to a non-pregnant intruder male. The control to test for the effect of seahorse translocation on later displacement behaviour consisted of male seahorses translocated to an area of 60 m from the capture site and quantification of their displacement range. Low-level aggressive behaviour was recorded in the trials, although the pregnant males presented dominance behaviour, both within and outside their own home ranges or territories, to expel intruders, while non-pregnant males avoided interaction. No correlation was found between robustness and either the displacement of the intruder or the duration of the interaction.

AB  - Translocation of elephants is used to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Asia and Africa. However, few studies investigate how translocations affect the movements and social behaviour of individuals following their release, which may have important implications for whether translocated animals survive and succeed. Using GPS-tracking data, we explored movements of five translocated bull elephants (Loxodonta africana) moved to Tsavo, Kenya, and compared them with five resident bull elephants. Position data was collected hourly for 1 year (March 2018-March 2019), and analysed to investigate home range, displacement rates, problematic behaviour and group size. Of the five translocated elephants, three were illegally killed and one continued to break fences and raid crops. Only one elephant stayed away from human settlement. We found group size and composition to be significantly different, with translocated elephants observed in smaller groups with no female elephant interactions. All elephants showed variation in home ranges and displacement rates, but differences were not significant between resident and translocated elephant groups. For future translocations, we recommend careful consideration of elephant social systems, elephant age, timing, release site and proximity to human settlements that might create human-elephant conflict. This will improve chance for success of such high-stake and expensive translocations.

AB  - The plant immune system has evolved to sense and respond to potential threats. When an insect attacks a plant, endogenous molecules called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released into the apoplast, triggering a cascade of intracellular signals. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a DAMP signal which activates the plant's immune responses. However, our understanding of whether the detection of eDNA can lessen the damage caused by herbivores is still restricted. Here, we demonstrate that eDNA treatment in Arabidopsis leaves induced plant resistance against the herbivorous insect Frankliniella occidentalis without compromising the plant's growth. The number of leaves, rosette diameter, fresh weight, and other growth-related parameters in eDNA-treated plants was comparable to water-treated plants. Besides, eDNA treatment reduced the feeding symptoms of F. occidentalis on Arabidopsis leaves. We further found that enhanced resistance in eDNA-treated plants was accompanied by callose accumulation in the affected area, and using the callose-deficient mutant pmr4-1, we demonstrated the positive role of callose in eDNA-induced resistance (eDNA-IR). Additionally, the induction in the jasmonic acid (JA)-signaling marker genes LOX2 and AOS, and the higher accumulation of Jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and JA revealed the role of jasmonates in eDNA-IR. Finally, we demonstrated that the JA signaling mediates callose deposition in eDNA-treated plants by using the JA response mutant jar1-1. These results advance our knowledge of the ability of eDNA to trigger plant resistance and the underlying mechanisms involved in eDNA-IR.

AB  - Background Six-spotted spider mite (Eotetranychus sexmaculatus) is one of the most damaging pests of tea (Camellia sinensis). E. sexmaculatus causes great economic loss and affects tea quality adversely. In response to pests, such as spider mites, tea plants have evolved resistance mechanisms, such as expression of defense-related genes and defense-related metabolites.Results To evaluate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of resistance in C. sinensis against spider mites, "Tianfu-5" (resistant to E. sexmaculatus) and "Fuding Dabai" (susceptible to E. sexmaculatus) were inoculated with spider mites. Transcriptomics and metabolomics based on RNA-Seq and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology were used to analyze changes in gene expression and metabolite content, respectively.RNA-Seq data analysis revealed that 246 to 3,986 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in multiple compared groups, and these DEGs were significantly enriched in various pathways, such as phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, MAPK signaling, and plant hormone signaling. Additionally, the metabolome data detected 2,220 metabolites, with 194 to 260 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) identified in multiple compared groups, including phenylalanine, lignin, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid. The combined analysis of RNA-Seq and metabolomic data indicated that phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling, and Ca2+-mediated PR-1 signaling pathways may contribute to spider mite resistance.Conclusions Our findings provide insights for identifying insect-induced genes and metabolites and form a basis for studies on mechanisms of host defense against spider mites in C. sinensis. The candidate genes and metabolites identified will be a valuable resource for tea breeding in response to biotic stress.

AB  - The late Middle Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stages 11-6, ca. 425-125 ka) saw the transition from the so-called steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii) to the woolly mammoth (M. primigenius) in Europe. A metrical study of molariform teeth from more than 40 localities in Britain and continental Europe allows this transition to be traced in detail. The morphological trend began as early as MIS 10, with the final transition to M. primigenius around the MIS 7/6 boundary where several samples (Marsworth, Crayford, La Cotte) span both species' morphology. The 'small mammoth' of MIS 7 is not homogeneous, as those from Stanton Harcourt (Oxfordshire, UK) are smaller and more advanced than those from Ilford (Essex, UK), likely corresponding to their younger age within MIS 7. Contrary to expectation, the thinning of molar enamel and increase in lamellar packing from MIS 16 to MIS 7 appear not to have been driven by increase in lamellar number since they precede it, nor is lamellar number primarily correlated to molar size. The adaptive significance of size changes is unclear, but they affected molar function via their effects on lamellar spacing. This study underlines the importance of adequate sample sizes and bivariate analysis of metric variables to take account of size change. The implications of the study for taxonomy, biostratigraphy and the effects of insularity are discussed. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). BPA exposure dysregulates ASD-related genes in the hippocampus and neurological functions of offspring. However, whether prenatal BPA exposure has an impact on genes in the prefrontal cortex, another brain region highly implicated in ASD, and through what mechanisms have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts the transcriptome-interactome profiles of the prefrontal cortex of neonatal rats. Interestingly, the list of BPA-responsive genes was significantly enriched with known ASD candidate genes, as well as genes that were dysregulated in the postmortem brain tissues of ASD cases from multiple independent studies. Moreover, several differentially expressed genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex were the targets of ASD-related transcription factors, including AR, ESR1, and RORA. The hypergeometric distribution analysis revealed that BPA may regulate the expression of such genes through these transcription factors in a sex-dependent manner. The molecular docking analysis of BPA and ASD-related transcription factors revealed novel potential targets of BPA, including RORA, SOX5, TCF4, and YY1. Our findings indicated that prenatal BPA exposure disrupts ASD-related genes in the offspring's prefrontal cortex and may increase the risk of ASD through sex-dependent molecular mechanisms, which should be investigated further.

AB  - Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that can cause fatal diseases such as meningitis and sepsis in pigs and human beings. The overuse of antibiotics is leading to an increased level of resistance in S. suis, and novel antimicrobial agents or anti-virulence agents for the treatment of infections caused by S. suis are urgently needed. In the present study, we investigated the antibacterial activity, mode of action and anti-virulence effects of floxuridine against S. suis. Floxuridine showed excessive antibacterial activity against S. suis both in vivo and in vitro; 4 x MIC of floxuridine could kill S. suis within 8 h in a time-kill assay. Meanwhile, floxuridine disrupted the membrane structure and permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane. Molecular docking revealed that floxuridine and SLY can be directly bind to each other. Moreover, floxuridine effectively inhibited the hemolytic capacity and expression levels of the virulence-related genes of S. suis. Collectively, these results indicate that the FDA-approved anticancer drug floxuridine is a promising agent and a potential virulence inhibitor against S. suis.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying viable seed production of perennial bunchgrasses is critical to improving restoration and conservation success in Great Basin sagebrush steppe rangelands. We studied the effects of pre- and post-anthesis flag-leaf removal and post-anthesis seed-head shading on reproductive effort in two important rangeland restoration species, the exotic crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) and native squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). Flag-leaf removal had distinct, species-specific effects on seed filling. Pre-anthesis flag-leaf removal in crested wheatgrass reduced the proportion of filled seeds, while post-anthesis removal did not. In contrast, squirreltail increased filled seed proportions regardless of flag-leaf removal timing. Neither flag-leaf removal treatment affected seed quality, as quantified by seed-specific mass (in grams per square meter), which significantly reduced with seed-head shading in both species. Seed-head shading reduced total propagule production (unfilled + filled seeds) in crested wheatgrass but increased it in squirreltail, possibly due to our shading method protecting from seed-head herbivory or high-light stress. Flag-leaf removal in the squirreltail also induced a negative shading effect on filled seed area, mass, and specific mass. These findings suggest flag leaves can modulate reproductive effort outside of seed provisioning, either by maintaining pre-fertilized seed viability, as in crested wheatgrass, or acting as a competitive sink to the fully emerged seed-head, as in squirreltail. Moreover, this study demonstrates photosynthetic activity by the seed-head itself is critical to the expression of seed quality traits important to seedling establishment success of semiarid perennial bunchgrasses.

AB  - Hypoxia in preterm infants is a clinical condition that has been associated with cognitive and behavioral disturbances for which treatment strategies are strongly required. Melatonin administration following brain insults has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Not surprisingly, it has been extensively studied for preventing disturbances following brain injury. This study evaluated the effects of melatonin on developmental disturbances, memory disruption, and hippocampal cell loss induced by neonatal anoxia in rats. Neonatal Wistar rats were subjected to anoxia and subsequently treated with melatonin. Later, maturation of physical characteristics, ontogeny of reflexes, learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM), and estimates of the number of hippocampal neurons, were evaluated. Melatonin treatment attenuated (1) female anoxia-induced delay in superior incisor eruption, (2) female anoxia-induced vibrissae placement reflexes, and (3) male and female anoxia-induced hippocampal neuronal loss. Melatonin also promoted an increase (5) in swimming speeds in the MWM. In addition, PCA analysis showed positive associations between the acoustic startle, auditory canal open, and free fall righting parameters and negative associations between the male vehicle anoxia group and the male melatonin anoxia group. Therefore, melatonin treatment attenuates both anoxia-induced developmental deficits and hippocampal neuronal loss.
   Neonatal Wistar rats were subjected to anoxia and then treated with melatonin.

AB  - Simple Summary Animals have always lived with humans, but their presence in cities is growing. This phenomenon warrants a specific reflection on the advantages of human-animal interactions as a potential nature-based solution (solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which provide environmental, social, and economic benefits). This article aims to provide an overview of the current situation of animals in cities and to explore the roles of animals and their interactions with humans in such a context. Through the lens of the European project IN-HABIT in Lucca (Italy) (which aims to codify an integrated policy on the relationship between people and animals that will then be transferred and replicated in other cities), we investigated all these aspects. In addition, our work suggests the need for the involvement of different stakeholders in the implementation of actions that aim to valorize human-animal relationships and their positive effects.Abstract In recent decades, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have spread in scientific research, and they are increasingly deployed in cities' strategic planning. While the number of nonhuman animals in cities is growing, a specific reflection on the advantages of human-animal interactions as potential NBSs is still lacking. This article aims to provide an overview of the current situation of animals in cities and to explore the roles of animals and their interactions with humans in such a context. These topics are crucial to the European project IN-HABIT in Lucca (Italy), which aims to codify an integrated policy on the relationship between people and animals; its outputs will then be transferred and replicated in other cities. This article concludes by highlighting the need for the involvement of different stakeholders in public-private-people partnerships to implement actions that aim to valorize human-animal relationships and their positive effects. This study presents a perspective on the relevance of animal NBSs to increase the quality of life in cities, both for citizens and for animals living in cities, and to also introduce the opportunity to develop an integrated animal urban policy able to valorize human-animal interactions in cities.

AB  - Camellia oleifera Abel is an economically-important, cross-pollinated oil tree grown commercially in China. Fruit set is greatly enhanced when animal pollinators are available in this system. Prior studies have shown that bees are the primary pollinators of Camellia oleifera, but we do not know which are the most effective. This study was conducted in Xinyu, Jiangxi province, China. Through tracking observation, we measured visit duration and the tendency of bees to visit new plants, critical for the self-incompatible C. oleifera. Further, we assessed pollen loads, pollen removal rates and pollen deposition per single visit to C. oleifera, as measures of pollination efficiency for comparing the managed honey bee (A. cerana) with wild bees (C. gigas and four Andrena species). Determining the pollination efficiency of bees is important for increasing fruit set and crop yield. The managed hongeybee Apis cerana has the longest single-visit time (92.40 +/- 8.31s) with a higher visit frequency to flowers on the same tree. The difference in duration was not significant between Apis cerana and three wild bee species (A. camellia, A. hunanensis and A. striata). Conversely, the pollen deposition of A. cerana was the lowest, significantly lower than that of four species of Andrena. Further, there were significant differences in the pollen load of six species: the amount of pollens on hind legs and body surface of A. cerana was much lower than in the wild bees. Compared with the four species of Andrena, Colletes gigas moved between plants more frequently. Given its large size, it also had the highest pollen load size, pollen removal and higher deposition rates, meaning it can essentially deposit more pollen across more flowers per unit time. The efficiency of Andrena striata Wu was relatively low compared to its congeners, which were similar. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease featuring deficits in spatial memory, which relies on spatial representations by hippocampal place cells. Place cells exhibit task-responsive representation to support memory encoding and retrieval processes. Yet, it remains unclear how this task-responsive spatial representation was interrupted under AD pathologies. Here, we employed a delayed match-to-place spatial memory task with associative and predictive memory processes, during which we electrophysiologically recorded hippocampal place cells with multi-tetrode hyperdrives in rats with i.c.v. amyloid/saline injection. We found that the directional selectivity of place cells coding was maintained in the Amyloid group. The firing stability was higher during predictive memory than during associative memory in both groups. However, the spatial specificity was decreased in the Amyloid group during both associative and predictive memory. Importantly, the place cells in the Amyloid group exhibited attenuated task-responsive representations, i.e. lack of spatial overrepresentations towards the goal zone and a higher representation of the rest zone, especially during the predictive memory stage. These results raise a hypothesis that the disrupted task-responsive representations of place cells could be an underlying mechanism of spatial memory deficits induced by amyloid proteins.

AB  - The Morris Water Maze (MWM) behavioral test is a universal method for testing cognitive functions in experimental rodents, and it is especially effective in detecting deviations in memory functions and learning, which makes it indispensable in a study of aging, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, effects of therapeutic drugs, and so on. However, this test can be a far more informative tool for analyzing the behavior of experimental animals than it seems at first glance. The formation and consolidation of memory, as well as learning, are quite complex processes that mainly involve the hippocampus but, in addition, many other brain areas. The numerous MWM protocols are so sensitive to changes in functioning of different, not only hippocampal, brain areas that they can be used as an "indicator" of normal cognitive function. Thus, MWM modifications involve different mechanisms of navigation, learning and memory, and the results of these tests, as well as their correct interpretation, can give a lot more information about the behavior of tested animals. Here, we survey most popular methods for conducting the MWM procedure and discuss those informative parameters that can help analyze the results of this test.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the impacts of glyphosate herbicide on the survival and proliferation of glioblastoma cells and to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects. For this, cultured human glioblastoma cell line, A172, was exposed to the glyphosate analytical standard, a glyphosate-based herbicide formulation (GBH), or the metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). The three com-pounds induced A172 cytotoxicity after 24 h of exposure, with more prominent cytotoxic effects after 48 and 72 h of treatment. Further experiments were performed by treating A172 cells for 6 h with glyphosate, GBH, or AMPA at 0.5 mg/L, which corresponds to the maximum residue limits for glyphosate and AMPA in drinking water in Brazil. Colony forming units (CFU) assay showed that AMPA increased the number of CFU formed, while glyphosate and GBH increased the CFU sizes. The three compounds tested altered the cell cycle and caused DNA damage, as indicated by the increase in gamma-H2AX. The mechanisms underlying the pesticide effects involve the activation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways, oxidative imbalance, and inflammation. Glyphosate led to NLRP3 activation culminating in caspase-1 recruitment, while AMPA decreased NLRP3 immunocontent and GBH did not alter this pathway. Results of the present study suggest that exposure to glyphosate (isolated or in formulation) or to its metabolite AMPA may affect cell signaling pathways resulting in oxidative damage and inflammation, giving glioblastoma cells an advantage by increasing their proliferation and growth.

AB  - Hippopotamid phylogeny has proven difficult to resolve with proposed relationships between extant and fossil species receiving mixed levels of support. Of particular interest is the divergence between the two extant hippopotamid species, the well-known common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) and the enigmatic pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). Previous studies have relied on morphological and fossil evidence to identify the ancestral species at the core of this divergence and its timing. In this study, we assembled a molecular matrix of 26 nuclear gene sequences from 11 ungulate species with two primates as an outgroup. We used a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach to reconstruct a calibrated time tree for Cetartiodactyla and estimate the divergence date between the common and pygmy hippopotamus. While previous morphological studies have estimated this event to have occurred sometime during the Late Miocene (between 11.6 and 5.3 million years ago), our nuclear gene-based estimates suggest a more recent split of about 4.04 Ma (95% confidence interval: 8.31-1.97 Ma) via RelTime-ML or 2.4 Ma (95% confidence interval: 3.1-1.6 Ma) via MCMCTree. These more recent estimates correspond with the Early Pliocene - Early Pleistocene sub-epochs and align most closely with the results of previous genomic studies. We discuss how our results compare with previous estimates based on both morphological and molecular studies, some of which extend the predicted range of this divergence date even further back in time. Our results suggest a different path of evolution for the understudied pygmy hippopotamus and reveal that morphological evidence alone may not resolve the correct hippopotamid phylogenetic and time trees. We suggest that the common and pygmy hippopotamus may be phylogenetically closer than once believed. Our results also call for further studies to develop a combined approach incorporating both molecular and morphological evidence to reach a consensus on the evolutionary patterns and timing that led to modern hippopotamid evolution.

AB  - The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of feeding different levels concentrations of dietary calcium propionate (CaPr) on lambs' growth performance; ruminal fermentation parameters; glucose-insulin concentration; and hypothalamic mRNA expression for neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Thirty-two individually fed lambs were randomly assigned to four treatments: (1) control diet (0 g/kg of CaPr), (2) low CaPr, (30 g/kg dry matter (DM)), (3) medium CaPr, (35 g/kg DM), and (4) high CaPr (40 g/kg DM). After 42 days of feeding, lambs were slaughtered for collecting samples of the hypothalamus. Data were analyzed as a complete randomized design, and means were separated using linear and quadratic polynomial contrast. Growth performance was not affected (p >= 0.11) by dietary CaPr inclusion. The ruminal concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased linearly (p = 0.04) as dietary CaPr increased. Likewise, a linear increase in plasma insulin concentration (p = 0.03) as dietary CaPr concentration increased. The relative mRNA expression of NPY exhibited a quadratic effect (p < 0.01), but there were significant differences in the mRNA expression of AgRP and POMC (p >= 0.10). Dietary calcium propionate did not improve lamb growth performance in lambs feed with only forage diets. Intake was not correlated with feed intake with mRNA expression of neuropeptides.

AB  - A total of 1,031,143 records of daily dairy control test of Spanish Florida goats were used for this study. The database was edited, and only the records of the first three lactations were kept. The final database contained 340,654 daily-test somatic cell counts from 27,749 daughters of 941 males and 16,243 goats. The evolution of this count in the last 14 years was analyzed following French and American international associations' criteria for the risk of mastitis in goats, and confirmed the slight increase in SCS in the last years and the importance of this problem (50% of dairy control tests show a risk of suffering mastitis). For the genetic analysis, the SCS records were log-transformed to normalize this variable. Two strategies were used for the genetic analysis: a univariate animal model for the SCS assuming that SCS does not vary throughout the parities, and a multi-character animal model, where SCS is not considered as the same character in the different parities. The heritabilities (h(2)) were higher in the multiple traits models, showings an upward trend from the first to the third parity (h(2) between 0.245 to 0.365). The genetic correlations of the same trait, as well as between breeding values (GVs) between different parities, were different from unity. The breeding values (EBVs) obtained for both models were subjected to a PCA: the first eigenvector (lambda(1)) explained most of the variations (between 74% to 90%), while the second lambda(2) accounted for between 9% to 20% of the variance, which shows that the selection will be proportionally favorable but not equivalent in all parities and that there are some variations in the type of response.

AB  - Feeding high-fiber (HF) coproducts to grow-finish pigs as a cost-saving practice could compromise growth performance, while the inclusion of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) may improve it. The hindgut is a shared site of actions between fiber and AGPs. However, whether the metabolic interactions between them could occur in the digestive tract of pigs and then become detectable in feces have not been well-examined. In this study, wheat middling (WM), a HF coproduct, and bacitracin, a peptide antibiotic (AB), were fed to 128 grow-finish pigs for 98 days following a 2 x 2 factorial design, including antibiotic-free (AF) + low fiber (LF); AF + HF; AB + LF, and AB + HF, for growth and metabolic responses. The growth performance of the pigs was compromised by HF feedings but not by AB. A metabolomic analysis of fecal samples collected on day 28 of feeding showed that WM elicited comprehensive metabolic changes, especially in amino acids, fatty acids, and their microbial metabolites, while bacitracin caused selective metabolic changes, including in secondary bile acids. Limited metabolic interactions occurred between fiber and AB treatments. Moreover, the correlations between individual fecal metabolites and growth support the usage of fecal metabolome as a source of biomarkers for monitoring and predicting the metabolic performance of grow-finish pigs.

AB  - Tobacco is an economic crop that primarily relies on nitrate (NO3- ) as its nitrogen source, and tobacco aphid is one of the significant pests that harm its growth. However, the impact of NO3- supply on the resistance of tobacco to aphids remains unclear. Present study investigated the effects of different NO3- concentrations supply on the reproductive capacity of tobacco aphids, impact of aphid infestation on tobacco growth, secondary metabolic and transcription changes. Physiological experiments were performed to verity the transcription analysis. The results indicated that aphids preferred tobacco treated with higher concentration of nitrate, showing greater reproductive capacity under high nitrate supply. From the results of transcriptome analysis, it can be seen that the gene expression of the shoot changed significantly after aphid and NO3- treatment. GO analysis showed that the pathways associated with cell wall biosynthesis were enriched in different groups. At the same time, RNA-seq analysis revealed several genes related to the pathway of aphid damage in tobacco, as well as some transcription factors associated with insect resistance. Inoculating tobacco with aphids under different NO3- concentration increased the levels of soluble sugars, free amino acids, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid in shoot of tobacco. Additionally, it was observed that the cell wall development of leaves from low NO3- supply was incomplete, and the cell wall from high NO3- supply concentration is notably thicker. The lignin content was lower under lower NO3- supply, regardless of aphid inoculation. The trends of transcription levels in genes related to cell wall and lignin biosynthesis were consistent with the lignin contents. Collectively, our findings not only shed light on the physiological and biochemical responses of tobacco plants to NO3- treatment, but also offer novel perspectives for optimizing tobacco cultivation practices and enhancing insect resistance.

AB  - The alpine grasshoppers Sigaus nivalis, Sigaus australis and Sigaus nitidus are sympatric in the central mountains of South Island, Aotearoa New Zealand. These grasshoppers feed on a range of alpine plants but show preference towards dicots over monocots. Because herbivorous insects often use smell and taste to locate and recognize food plants it was expected that these grasshoppers would show sensitivity to their favorite foods and potential sensitivity to nonhost plants. Here, we determined feeding preference in captivity allowing each of these three sympatric grasshoppers the same choice of six native alpine plant species. We analyzed the chemical compositions of the plants used in these experiments using gas-chromatograph coupled with mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and then recorded olfactory responses in the grasshoppers to plant-derived smells (with synthetic compounds) using electroantennogram (EAG). The grasshoppers were able to distinguish between the potential food plants and ate the shrub Coriaria sarmentosa but not the grass Chionochloa pallens, however, the chemicals we detected in the six plant species were very similar. High sensitivity to fatty acid derived aldehydes (decanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, hexanal) and a 6-carbon alcohol ((Z)-2-hexen-1-ol) compared to terpenoids (alpha-phellandrene, beta-myrcene, beta-ocimene, eucalyptol, (S)-(-)-limonene, (1S)-(-)-alpha-pinene) or an aromatic compound (2-phenylethanol) was recorded in the antennae of all three grasshopper species and no species- or sex-specific sensitivity to particular compounds was observed. As aldehydes and alcohols are emitted upon plant damage, it is possible that these generalist grasshoppers are sensitive to the smells of damaged plants rather than species-specific plant smells.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known endocrine disruptor and has been gradually replaced in industrial applications by other bisphenols, such as bisphenol S (BPS). However, whether these analogues are any safer for the central nervous system remains elusive. Here, we investigated behavioral impairments in mice after BPA and BPS exposure from postnatal days 21-49 (P21-P49). Results showed that BPA (0.1 and 1 mg/kg/d) and BPS (1 mg/ kg/d) impaired emotion and social interaction of mice, while low dose exposure (0.1 mg/kg/d) induced no observable changes on emotion in mice. The behavioral deficits were accompanied by hyperactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), i.e., dose-dependent increase in neuronal firing rates and local field potential power. In addition, glutamate receptors were up-regulated in the BLA, showing the same activation trend after exposure to different doses of BPA and BPS. Taken together, these findings imply that BPA and BPS cause behavioral impairments in juvenile mice by disrupting local neuronal activation in the BLA. Although BPS exerted less adverse effects on mice than BPA at the low dose, it does not appear to be a safe alternative to BPA in regard to brain function after prolonged high-volume exposure.

AB  - Cold significantly impacts the growth and development of tea plants, thereby affecting their economic value. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are thought to play a pivotal role in signaling the plant's response to cold and regulating cold tolerance. Among the RLK subfamilies, wall-associated receptor-like kinases (WAKs) have been investigated across various plant species and have been shown to regulate cell growth and stress responses. However, the function of WAK genes in response to cold stress in tea has yet to be studied. In a previous investigation, we identified the WAK gene family from Camellia sinensis and isolated a specific WAK gene, CsWAK12, which is induced by abiotic stresses. Here, we demonstrate that CsWAK12 is involved in the regulation of cold tolerance in tea plants. CsWAK12 was rapidly induced by cold, peaking at 3 hours after treatment at 4 degrees C (10-fold increase). Heterologous overexpression of CsWAK12 (35S:CsWAK12) in Arabidopsis promoted plant growth by enhancing root length and seed size under normal conditions, although it reduced cold resistance compared to the wild type. Under cold stress, the transgenic plants exhibited a lower survival rate and significantly altered levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared to the wild type (WT). Furthermore, the expression of C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor (CBF) genes was diminished in CsWAK12-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants following cold treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes associated with the CBF pathway, such as transcription factor genes (ERF53, ERF54, and DREB2A) were markedly reduced in the overexpression line. These data suggest that CsWAK12 acts as a negative regulator, reducing the cold tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis by mediating the CBF pathway. Therefore, CsWAK12 may serve as a candidate gene for the molecular breeding of cold resistance in tea plants.

AB  - Anthocyanin and catechin production in tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves can positively affect tea quality; however, their regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we report that, while the CsMYB75- or CsMYB86-directed MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complexes differentially activate anthocyanin or catechin biosynthesis in tea leaves, respectively, CsMYBL2a and CsMYBL2b homologs negatively modified the light- and temperature-induced anthocyanin and catechin production in both Arabidopsis and tea plants. The MBW complexes activated both anthocyanin synthesis genes and the downstream repressor genes CsMYBL2a and CsMYBL2b. Overexpression of CsMYBL2b, but not CsMYBL2a, repressed Arabidopsis leaf anthocyanin accumulation and seed coat proanthocyanin production. CsMYBL2b strongly and CsMYBL2a weakly repressed the activating effects of CsMYB75/CsMYB86 on CsDFR and CsANS, due to their different EAR and TLLLFR domains and interactions with CsTT8/CsGL3, interfering with the functions of activating MBW complexes. CsMYBL2b and CsMYBL2a in tea leaves play different roles in fine-tuning CsMYB75/CsMYB86-MBW activation of biosynthesis of anthocyanins and catechins, respectively. The CsbZIP1-CsmiR858a-CsMYBL2 module mediated the UV-B- or cold-activated CsMYB75/CsMYB86 regulation of anthocyanin/catechin biosynthesis by repressing CsMYBL2a and CsMYBL2b. Similarly, the CsCOP1-CsbZIP1-CsPIF3 module, and BR signaling as well, mediated the high temperature repression of anthocyanin and catechin biosynthesis through differentially upregulating CsMYBL2b and CsMYBL2a, respectively. The present study provides new insights into the complex regulatory networks in environmental stress-modified flavonoid production in tea plant leaves.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of exercise combined with an enriched environment on learning and memory in rats. Forty healthy male Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were randomly assigned into 4 groups (N = 10 in each group): control (C) group, treadmill exercise (TE) group, enriched environment (EE) group and the TE + EE group. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the learning and memory ability in all rats after eight weeks of exposure in the different conditions. Moreover, we employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) in the rats. The data showed that the escape latency and the number of platform crossings were significantly better in the TE + EE group compared to the TE, EE or C groups (p < 0.05). In addition, there was upregulation of BDNF and TrkB in rats in the TE + EE group compared to those in the TE, EE or C groups (p < 0.05). Taken together, the data robustly demonstrate that the combination of TE + EE enhances learning and memory ability and upregulates the expression of both BDNF and TrkB in rats. Thus, the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway might be modulating the effect of exercise and enriched environment in improving learning and memory ability in rats.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Traditional herbal medicine books "Shin Rhong Bon Cho Kyung" and "Hyang Yak Jip Sung Bang" mentioned that Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Rchb.f. (Orchidaceae) was often used as a medicinal plant and is used in oriental medicine to treat wounds, inflammatory symptoms, and ulcers in stomach, lung, and skin. However, systematic studies on its value as a promising anti-inflammatory remedy were not fully elucidated yet. Aim of the study: The eventual goal of this paper was to explore anti-inflammatory and anti-gastritis effects of Bletilla striata and its inhibitory mechanism with an ethanol extract of this plant (Bs-EE). Materials and methods: In vitro study includes nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory test by was Griess assay, cell viability check by MTT assay, mRNA level analysis of inflammatory genes by PCR and RT-PCR, and protein level analysis by Western blotting and CESTA. In vivo analysis was done with a mouse gastritis model triggered by HCl/EtOH. Phytochemical finger printing result was observed by GC/MS-MS. Results: Our in vitro trials showed that Bs-EE dose-dependently reduced NO production in lipopolysaccharide-, Poly(I:C)-, and Pam3CSK-treated RAW264.7 cells without causing cytotoxicity, as shown by an MTT assay. The levels of inflammation-related genes (iNOS, IL-6, IL-1(3) showed meaningful reductions in RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The NF-kappa B activity enhanced in MyD88-overexpressing HEK293T cells was strongly reduced by Bs-EE. Western blotting results indicated that the Bs-EE suppressed the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, IKK alpha/(3, AKT, p65, p50, Syk, and Src, which produced anti-inflammatory effects. Both Syk and Src were found to be direct targets of Bs-EE. This extract attenuated the inflammatory effect in a murine acute gastritis model induced by HCl/EtOH. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an ethanol extract of Bletilla striata could be developed as a promising natural anti-inflammatory drug or health functional food with NF-kappa B pathway inhibitory activity.

AB  - The sika deer is one type of seasonal breeding animal, and the growth of its antler is affected by light signals. Melatonin (MLT) is a neuroendocrine hormone synthesized by the pineal gland and plays an important role in controlling the circadian rhythm. Although the MLT/MT1 (melatonin 1A receptor) signal has been identified during antler development, its physiological function remains almost unknown. The role of MLT on antler growth in vivo and in vitro is discussed in this paper. In vivo, MLT implantation was found to significantly increase the weight of antlers. The relative growth rate of antlers showed a remarkable increased trend as well. In vitro, the experiment showed MLT accelerated antler mesenchymal cell differentiation. Further, results revealed that MLT regulated the expression of Collage type II (Col2a) through the MT1 binding mediated transcription of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in antler mesenchymal cells. In addition, treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoted chondrocytes degeneration by downregulating the expression of Col2a and Sox9 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9). MLT effectively inhibited VEGF-induced degeneration of antler chondrocytes by inhibiting the Signal transducers and activators of transcription 5/Interleukin-6 (STAT5/IL-6) pathway and activating the AKT/CREB (Cyclin AMP response-element binding protein) pathway dependent on Sox9 expression. Together, our results indicate that MLT plays a vital role in the development of antler cartilage.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the genetic variability in the SCD1 gene and its association with performance traits in 100 Murrah buffaloes. Two regions of the gene, i.e., 400 and 752 bp fragments of exon 5 and exon 1, respectively, were amplified via PCR, and genotyping was done using the RFLP technique. The fragments of the SCD1 gene were digested with Nco1 and Taq1 enzymes, respectively. In the present study, monomorphic patterns were revealed for the exon 5 region, and polymorphic patterns were revealed for the exon 1 region of the SCD1 gene. The exon 1 region of the SCD1 gene revealed two types of genotypes, i.e., AA (752 bp) and AC (752, 620 and 132 bp) after digestion with the Taq1 restriction enzyme. The frequencies of 'A' and 'C' alleles were found to be 0.95 and 0.05, and genotypic frequencies for AA and AC were 0.89 and 0.11, respectively, in Murrah buffaloes. Results of the Chi-square test showed that the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with respect to the targeted loci. The association analysis revealed that individuals having the AA genotype had better production performance, while individuals with the AC genotype had comparatively better reproduction performance; however, there was no statistically significant association among the genotypes and performance traits. Further, a total of 10 samples of the exon 1 region of the SCD1 gene were Sanger sequenced. Multiple alignments of the sequenced samples were done using BioEdit software. On comparison of sequencing results with the reference sequence of the Italian Mediterranean river buffalo (EMBL-FM876222), polymorphism was noticed at one position, i.e., g.300 C>T in two samples out of the total 10 samples. Sequenced samples were also compared with the reference sequence of Bos taurus (AY241932.1). A total of 13 nucleotide changes were observed, out of which seven were transversions and six were transitions. An insertion of nucleotide 'G' was also observed at position 1400, and two novel SNPs were observed, i.e., g.1581 C>T and g.1992 G>C. It was concluded that nucleotide changes at different locations in Murrah buffaloes as compared to Bos taurus can be used as selection signatures in Murrah buffaloes.

AB  - Background Plant-parasitic nematodes and herbivorous insects have a significant negative impact on global crop production. A successful approach to protect crops from these pests is the in planta expression of nematotoxic or entomotoxic proteins such as crystal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or plant lectins. However, the efficacy of this approach is threatened by emergence of resistance in nematode and insect populations to these proteins. To solve this problem, novel nematotoxic and entomotoxic proteins are needed. During the last two decades, several cytoplasmic lectins from mushrooms with nematicidal and insecticidal activity have been characterized. In this study, we tested the potential of Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) to furnish Arabidopsis plants with resistance towards three economically important crop pests: the two plant-parasitic nematodes Heterodera schachtii and Meloidogyne incognita and the herbivorous diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. Results The expression of MOA does not affect plant growth under axenic conditions which is an essential parameter in the engineering of genetically modified crops. The transgenic Arabidopsis lines showed nearly complete resistance to H. schachtii, in that the number of female and male nematodes per cm root was reduced by 86-91 % and 43-93 % compared to WT, respectively. M. incognita proved to be less susceptible to the MOA protein in that 18-25 % and 26-35 % less galls and nematode egg masses, respectively, were observed in the transgenic lines. Larvae of the herbivorous P. xylostella foraging on MOA-expression lines showed a lower relative mass gain (22-38 %) and survival rate (15-24 %) than those feeding on WT plants. Conclusions The results of our in planta experiments reveal a robust nematicidal and insecticidal activity of the fungal lectin MOA against important agricultural pests which may be exploited for crop protection.

AB  - In briefFrozen-thawed ram spermatozoa show reduced fertility following cervical artificial insemination, likely attributed to an elevated immune response in the ewe. This paper identifies the immunoprotective effect of ram seminal plasma (SP) against polymorphonuclear neutrophil binding, highlighting potential for fertility improvement.AbstractFollowing cervical artificial insemination, frozen-thawed (FT) ram spermatozoa display reduced fertility compared to fresh spermatozoa, irrespective of sperm motility and viability, likely attributed to an elevated immune response in the ovine cervix. SP has previously been shown to be beneficial to sperm transport in the ovine cervix, yet the components responsible for this protective effect remain unknown. As such, the present study examined the immune dynamics of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), utilising a neutrophil binding assay. The effect of 25% v/v SP supplementation on binding susceptibility was also investigated. A portion of SP was heat-treated before incubation (HTSP) to isolate the impact of SP proteins. The presence of SP significantly reduced sperm-PMN binding (37.15 +/- 0.02%, 46.59 +/- 0.02%, 38.83 +/- 0.02%) compared to FT alone (62.83 +/- 0.02%, 75.74 +/- 0.02%, 56.0 +/- 0.03%) across all serum groups (no serum, serum and heat-treated serum, respectively). HTSP showed comparable binding susceptibility to the FT treatments, indicating that the protective effect of SP is attributed to a heat-labile factor. Serum significantly increased sperm-neutrophil binding irrespective of SP treatment. However, this was reduced to serum-free levels following heat-treatment, suggesting sperm-neutrophil dynamics are further mediated by protein components within ewe serum, likely complement proteins. The viability of sperm or the presence of freezing medium did not influence PMN binding. Furthermore, PMN viability and therefore binding were not influenced by the presence of serum or SP. Together, the current study presents new evidence for the immunoprotective properties of SP in sheep, which could be leveraged to aid transit through the cervix.

AB  - A new species of Microlepidogaster is described from rio Pardo drainage, a coastal basin in eastern Brazil. This species can be differentiated from its congeners by having the following unique features: 1) anterior portion of snout with a large odontode-free band extending laterally from the anterior tip of snout to the postrostral plate 2; 2) transverse process of second dorsal-fin pterygiophore exposed and bearing odontodes; and 3) exposed area of pectoral girdle extended to the mesial symphysis, with odontodes mainly distributed in the coracoid ventral expansion. The new species is further distinguished by several other morphological non-exclusive features. Recently, some Microlepidogaster species were reallocated to Rhinolekos. The taxonomic changes involving these genera is herein discussed.

AB  - Flavonoids are ubiquitously distributed in plants, showing pleiotropic effects in defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. Although it has been shown that seed priming with flavonoids can enhance plant resistance to abiotic stress, little is known about its potential to enhance plant tolerance to biotic stresses, especially for herbivorous insects. Here, we investigated whether treatment of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seeds with rutin improves plant resistance against the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). Specifically, we measured the effect of rutin seed treatment on tomato seedling vigour, plant growth, feeding behavior and performance of B. tabaci on plants grown from control and rutin-treated seeds, and plant defense responses to B. tabaci attack. We found that seed treatment with different concentrations of rutin (viz 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mM) had minimal impact on shoot growth. Furthermore, seed treatment of rutin reduced the developmental rate of nymphs, the fecundity and feeding ef-ficiency of adult females on plants grown from these seeds. The enhanced resistance of tomato against B. tabaci is closely associated with increased flavonoids accumulation, callose deposition and the expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense genes. Additionally, callose deposition and expression of JA-dependent genes in tomato plants grown from rutin-treated seeds significantly increased upon B. tabaci infestation. These results suggest that seed treatment with rutin primes tomato resistance against B. tabaci, and are not accompanied by reductions in shoot growth. Defense priming by seed treatments may therefore be suitable for commercial exploitation.

AB  - Simple Summary The butterflies of the Lepidoptera are representatives of herbivorous insects. Host plant diversities may shape the evolution of chemosensory receptors in butterflies. However, little is known about whether the host plant range is correlated with the size differences of chemoreceptors as key molecular targets for butterfly-plant chemical interactions. Here, we characterized 381 odorant (ORs) and 328 gustatory (GRs) receptors in one Papilio generalist and five other Papilio specialists regarding their comprehensive annotation, gene structure, phylogenetics and expression profiles. Among six Papilio species, orthologous ORs or GRs shared conserved gene structure, but the differences in intron size frequencies were observed between the generalist and the specialists. Furthermore, expression profiles identified candidate OR and GR genes in antennae, foretarsi or reproductive tissues of P. xuthus. This study addresses, for the first time, the issue that the breath of host plants does not appear to result in the obvious expansions of ORs and GRs in Papilio butterflies and identifies candidate molecular targets associated with olfaction, oviposition or reproduction in P. xuthus. The chemical interactions of insects and host plants are shaping the evolution of chemosensory receptor gene families. However, the correlation between host range and chemoreceptor gene repertoire sizes is still elusive in Papilionidae. Here, we addressed the issue of whether host plant diversities are correlated with the expansions of odorant (ORs) or gustatory (GRs) receptors in six Papilio butterflies. By combining genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics approaches, 381 ORs and 328 GRs were annotated in the genomes of a generalist P. glaucus and five specialists, P. xuthus, P. polytes, P. memnon, P. machaon and P. dardanus. Orthologous ORs or GRs in Papilio had highly conserved gene structure. Five Papilio specialists exhibited a similar frequency of intron lengths for ORs or GRs, but which was different from those in the generalist. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 60 orthologous OR groups, 45 of which shared one-to-one relationships. Such a single gene in each butterfly also occurred in 26 GR groups. Intriguingly, bitter GRs had fewer introns than other GRs and clustered into a large clade. Focusing on the two chemoreceptor gene families in P. xuthus, most PxutORs (52/58) were expressed in antennae and 31 genes in reproductive tissues. Eleven out of 28 foretarsus-expressed PxutGRs were female-biased genes, as strong candidates for sensing oviposition stimulants. These results indicate that the host range may not shape the large-scale expansions of ORs and GRs in Papilio butterflies and identify important molecular targets involved in olfaction, oviposition or reproduction in P. xuthus.

AB  - Simple Summary The efficacy of vaccination against type 2 porcine circoviruses is influenced by the level of maternally derived antibodies present at the time of vaccination of the piglets. This aspect was investigated by using two types of vaccines either comprised of a whole virus or its single protein. Both vaccines were able to overcome the impact of the maternal antibodies, however, the immunity, measured by serum antibody levels, developed faster for the whole virus type vaccine. The correlation between the maternally derived antibody levels at the time of vaccination and the challenge viral load showed differences amongst the tested lymph nodes. Additionally, it was confirmed also in this study that group oral fluid samples provide a reliable and relatively easy animal welfare-friendly way of estimating the PCV2 status of groups of pigs. Piglets from a porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) stable farm of low and high levels of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) against PCV2 were vaccinated either with a whole virus type or a PCV2 ORF2 antigen-based commercial subunit vaccine at three weeks of age. Two non-vaccinated groups served as low and high MDA positive controls. At four weeks post vaccination, all piglets were challenged with a PCV2d-2 type virus strain and were checked for parameters related to vaccine protection over a four-week observation period. MDA levels evidently impacted the outcome of the PCV2d-2 challenge in non-vaccinated animals, while it did not have a significant effect on vaccine-induced protection levels. The humoral immune response developed faster in the whole virus vaccinates than in the subunit vaccinated pigs in the low MDA groups. Further, high MDA levels elicited a stronger negative effect on the vaccine-induced humoral immune response for the subunit vaccine than for the whole virus vaccine. The group-based oral fluid samples and the group mean viraemia and faecal shedding data correlated well, enabling this simple, and animal welfare-friendly sampling method for the evaluation of the PCV2 viral load status of these nursery piglets.

AB  - Increased long-chain C20:0 ceramides have been found in the serum of patients with depression. Moreover, ceramides are linked with increased microglia reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production, which are associated with depression. Since ceramides can readily cross the blood brain barrier, peripheral C20:0 ceramides could enter the brain, activate microglia, and induce depressive-like behavior. In this study, we determined whether localized infusion of C20:0 ceramides into the ventral hippocampus (VH) of rats is sufficient to activate microglia and induce depressive-like behaviors. Adult male and female rats received infusions of C20:0 ceramides or vehicle solution every other day for 2 weeks. After the third infusion, C20:0-infused animals showed reduced sucrose preference suggesting anhedonia-like behavior. In contrast, infusions of C20:0 ceramides did not affect immobility in the forced swim test or sucrose grooming suggesting that the behavioral effects of ceramides are task dependent. Furthermore, C20:0-infusions did not increase Iba-1 + microglia or inflammatory markers in the VH suggesting that localized increases in C20:0 ceramides in the VH are sufficient to induce anhedonia-like behavior without microglia activation.

AB  - Ants tending aphid colonies may reduce the effectiveness of aphid natural enemies, which can result in additional plant damage. However, their mutualistic interaction is complex, and depending on the quantity and quality of the sugar that aphids produce, it may change to a predator-prey interaction. This study aims to test this hypothesis by providing ants with a high-quality sugar supply with the prediction that ants with an extra sugar source should more often prey on aphids and, therefore, the abundance of aphids on plants should decrease. We carried out an experiment on pepper plants infested with Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in greenhouses with naturally occurring Tapinoma ibericum Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in three different periods. Results showed a significant reduction in aphid abundance and greater aphid predation by ants in plants with an artificial sugar supply. However, the expected effects varied among greenhouses and seasons. A negative effect on aphid abundance was mainly detected in autumn, whereas the largest effect on aphid predation by ants was detected in summer when lower ant activity on the plants occurred. Although our results show that artificial sugar supply changes ant behavior from tending to preying on aphids, the large variation observed indicates that other unconsidered factors influence its effectiveness. Future research should focus on understanding factors driving variations across locations and seasons. Additionally, the effect of sugar feeders and their disruption of the ant-aphid mutualism may improve the access of biological control agents to aphid colonies, which is worth testing.

AB  - The phytoremediation technique is gaining excessive consideration as a promising method to remediate indus-trially contaminated soils with heavy metals. In this study, a pot experiment was performed in which the ornamental plant Helianthus annus L. was grown in the pots with three concentrations i.e., 0, 5, and 10 % of contaminated soil amended with compost (2 %) in all pots of the experiment following three treatments of bacteria i.e., Co, Stutzerimonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas sundara. After sixty days of the experiment, the plants were harvested and morphological, physiological, antioxidants and pollution parameters were investigated. The plant height and biomass of the sunflower were increased by the inoculation of S. stutzeri and P. sundara. Pig-ments e.g., chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids and proteins of the plants were enhanced. There was an increase in antioxidants e.g., catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and proline content and a decrease in hydrogen peroxide content of plants by inoculation of S. stutzeri and P. sundara. The bacteria boosted the uptake of heavy metals (cadmium, chromium and lead) in parts of plants. Post-harvested soil analysis indicated decreased electronic conductivity, total dissolved solids, bicarbonates and heavy metals in the soil. In the future, the combination of H. annus and bacteria could be a better technique to remediate the heavy metals in industrially polluted soils.

AB  - It has been nearly two years since the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected the world. Several innovations and discoveries related to COVID-19 are surfacing every day and new problems associated with the COVID-19 virus are also coming to light. A similar situation is with the emergence of deep invasive fungal infections associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent literature reported the cases of pulmonary and rhino-cerebral fungal infections appearing in patients previously infected by COVID-19. Histopathological analysis of these cases has shown that most of such infections are diagnosed as mucormycosis or aspergillosis. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis usually affects the maxillary sinus with involvement of maxillary teeth, orbits, and ethmoidal sinuses. Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for both COVID-19 as well as mucormycosis. At this point, there is scanty data on the subject and most of the published literature comprises of either case reports or case series with no long-term data available. The aim of this review paper is to present the characteristics of COVID-19 related mucormycosis and associated clinical features, outcome, diagnostic and management strategies. A prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment planning can surely benefit these patients.

AB  - Background and Aims Herbaria were recently advertised as reliable sources of information regarding historical changes in plant traits and biotic interactions. To justify the use of herbaria in global change research, we asked whether the characteristics of herbarium specimens have changed during the past centuries and whether these changes were due to shifts in plant collection practices.
   Methods We measured nine characteristics from 515 herbarium specimens of common European trees and large shrubs collected from 1558 to 2016. We asked botanists to rank these specimens by their scientific quality, and asked artists to rank these specimens by their beauty.
   Key Results Eight of 11 assessed characteristics of herbarium specimens changed significantly during the study period. The average number of leaves in plant specimens increased 3-fold, whereas the quality of specimen preparation decreased. Leaf size negatively correlated with leaf number in specimens in both among-species and within-species analyses. The proportion of herbarium sheets containing plant reproductive structures peaked in the 1850s. The scientific value of herbarium specimens increased until the 1700s, but then did not change, whereas their aesthetic value showed no systematic trends.
   Conclusions Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that many characteristics of herbarium specimens have changed systematically and substantially from the 16th to 21st centuries due to changes in plant collection and preservation practices. These changes may both create patterns which could be erroneously attributed to environmental changes and obscure historical trends in plant traits. The utmost care ought to be taken to guard against the possibility of misinterpretation of data obtained from herbarium specimens. We recommend that directional changes in characters of herbarium specimens which occurred during the past 150.200 years, primarily in specimen size and in the presence of reproductive structures, are accounted for when searching for the effects of past environmental changes on plant traits.

AB  - Coccotrypes rhizophorae (Coleoptera), an insect native to Indonesia, has been introduced to several American countries, including Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands. C. rhizophorae is the principal pest of mangrove species in the genus Rhizophora. Here, we examine the damage caused by C. rhizophorae infestations in a mangrove forest at eleven locations along the Ecuadorian coast throughout one year. We collected 13 200 Rhizophora spp. propagules in total (1200 individuals per site per year). The total C. rhizophorae infestation rate was 45%. The total prevalence of Rhizophora spp. propagules infested by C. rhizophorae was significantly higher during the rainy season (55%) compared to the dry season. Bellavista Island, Corazon and Fragatas Island, and Guayaquil Historical Park showed higher damage prevalence compared to other sites. In all sites and in both seasons, the prevalent location of damage in affected propagules was in the basal area (59.81%). There was an inverse relationship between the population size inside the propagule (larvae and adults) and rainfall. The number of holes created by C. rhizophorae in Rhizophora spp. propagules was associated with the damage intensity. These results are critical for the management, conservation, and restoration of mangrove forests in Ecuador and other countries where C. rhizophorae is present.

AB  - Plant-produced volatile compounds play important roles in plant signaling and in the communication of plants with other organisms. Many plants emit green leaf volatiles (GLVs) in response to damage or attack, which serve to warn neighboring plants or attract predatory or parasitic insects to help defend against insect pests. GLVs include aldehydes, esters, and alcohols of 6-carbon compounds that are released rapidly following wounding. One GLV produced by maize (Zea mays) is the volatile (Z)-3-hexenal; this volatile is produced from the cleavage of (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid by hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) of the cytochrome P450 CYP74B family. The specific HPL in maize involved in (Z)-3-hexenal production had not been determined. In this study, we used phylogenetics with known HPLs from other species to identify a candidate HPL from maize (ZmHPL). To test the ability of the putative HPL to produce (Z)-3-hexenal, we constitutively expressed the gene in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 that contains a natural loss-of-function mutant in AtHPL and examined the transgenic plants for restored (Z)-3-hexenal production. Volatile analysis of leaves from these transgenic plants showed that they did produce (Z)-3-hexenal, confirming that ZmHPL can produce (Z)-3-hexenal in vivo. Furthermore, we used gene expression analysis to show that expression of ZmHPL is induced in maize in response to both wounding and the insect pests Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodoptera exigua. Our study demonstrates that ZmHPL can produce GLVs and highlights its likely role in (Z)-3-hexenal production in response to mechanical damage and herbivory in maize.

AB  - Cryopreservation is a widely used technique for long-term semen storage; however, it can induce oxidative stress, compromising sperm quality. This study examines the effect of Kaempferia parviflora (KP) supplementation in semen extenders on the post-thaw sperm quality of Thai native bulls. Fresh semen was collected and evaluated for motility, viability, and concentration prior to cryopreservation. Semen samples were allocated to four treatment groups: 0 mg/mL (control), 0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 1.5 mg/mL KP. Subsequently, the samples were frozen, then thawed, and analyzed for sperm motility, viability, membrane integrity, and oxidative stress. The results showed that supplementation with 1.0 mg/mL KP significantly improved sperm motility (46.29 +/- 2.66%) and viability (43.42 +/- 2.15%) compared to the control (40.77 +/- 2.76% and 38.63 +/- 2.66%, respectively). Membrane integrity was also enhanced (47.64 +/- 1.18% vs. 41.85 +/- 1.98% in the control), while oxidative stress levels were reduced (MDA concentration: 2.33 +/- 0.29 mu M/mL vs. 2.73 +/- 0.33 mu M/mL in the control). However, the highest concentration (1.5 mg/mL KP) negatively affected sperm quality, with reduced motility (36.97 +/- 3.32%), viability (30.88 +/- 3.02%), and membrane integrity (35.64 +/- 1.61%). These findings suggest that 1 mg/mL KP is the optimal concentration for improving post-thaw semen quality in cryopreservation protocols for Thai native bulls.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal trends and geographical differences in Sr-90 and stable element (Ba, Ca, Mn, Sr, Pb, Zn) levels in the bones of Croatian and Polish brown bear (Ursus arctos) populations. Experimental data suggest that in the decades after nuclear weapon tests and the Chernobyl accident, Sr-90 bone activity concentrations decreased from 352 to 11 Bq kg(-1) in the Croatian bear population (period 1982-2015) and from 831 to 27 Bq kg(-1) in Polish bears (period 1962-2020). Calculated effective and ecological half-lives were 9 and 13 years for Croatian bears, and 15 and 31 years for Polish bears, respectively. Different temporal trends were noted in levels of Ba, Mn, Pb and Zn between the two countries with majority of bones having lower Pb, Sr and Zn in Croatian than in Polish bears. Estimated values for the soil-to-bear transfer of Sr-90 were the same order of magnitude in the studied populations. Contrary to this, the estimated transfer of stable Sr was an order of magnitude lower for the Croatian bear population compared to Polish bears. The observed differences in soil-to-bear transfer between stable Sr and Sr-90 found for Croatian bears might suggest the need for careful consideration on the use of stable Sr data as an analogue for Sr-90. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analysed Sr-90 activity in tissue of brown bears. As such, it provides insight into the fate and behaviour of one of the most relevant anthropogenic radionuclides at the top of the food chain.

AB  - Physical exercise is a well-proven neurogenic stimulus, promoting neuronal progenitor proliferation and affecting newborn cell survival. Besides, it has beneficial effects on brain health and cognition. Previously, we found that three days of physical activity in a very precocious period of adult-generated granule cell life is able to antedate the appearance of the first GABAergic synaptic contacts and increase T-type Ca2+ channel expression. Considering the role of GABA and Ca2+ in fostering neuronal maturation, in this study, we used short-term, voluntary exercise on a running wheel to investigate if it is able to induce long-term morphological and synaptic changes in newborn neurons. Using adult male rats, we found that: (i) three days of voluntary physical exercise can definitively influence the morpho-functional maturation process of newborn granule neurons when applied very early during their development; (ii) a significant percentage of new neurons show more mature morphological characteristics far from the end of exercise protocol; (iii) the long-term morphological effects result in enhanced synaptic plasticity. Present findings demonstrate that the morpho-functional changes induced by exercise on very immature adult-generated neurons are permanent, affecting the neuron maturation and integration in hippocampal circuitry. Our data contribute to underpinning the beneficial potential of physical activity on brain health, also performed for short times.

AB  - Navigation is commonly associated with two-dimensional (2D) representations of space. Recordings from place and grid cells in the rodent and bat brain have largely upheld this association. Recent studies have investigated how these 2D representations might extend into the three-dimensional (3D) world. One unexplored question is whether grid cells represent vertically separated horizontal surfaces as a single 3D space or distinct planar environments. To address this issue, we recorded grid cells as rats foraged in both an openfield environment and one with a transparent floor suspended directly above the open-field environment. Rats either actively locomoted up a ramp to the elevated environment, or they were passively moved between the two environments, to test how differences in path integration may affect grid cell firing. We found that grid cell firing patterns in the elevated environment were translated (but not rotated) relative to those in the floor environment and were consistent across active and passive sessions. The translation of the grid pattern on the elevated surface was consistent among co-recorded grid cells but differed between animals and between different groups of grid cells recorded from the same animal. Non-grid spatially modulated cells also rearranged their location preferences between the two surfaces. Overall, we did not observe any evidence that the two surfaces were represented with a single 3D representation but instead were treated as two distinct surfaces connected by a common orientation signal. These findings suggest that grid cell representations on visually distinct, vertically displaced horizontal surfaces are planar rather than volumetric.

AB  - The lactose-C-13-ureide ((LCU)-C-13) test, used in humans to measure oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) in breath CO2, was assessed for its suitability in pigs as a noninvasive alternative to intestinal cannulation. The OCTT was determined with the (LCU)-C-13 test in breath and saliva samples when pigs were fed low or high dietary fiber (DF) (low fiber, 2.8% DF; high fiber 6.5% DF) diets, and 24 h after an i.m. injection with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or NaCl. The OCTT measured in breath was longer in LF-LPS than in LF-NaCl and HF-LPS groups (3.4 vs 2.9 h; p < 0.05). Additionally, LPS prolonged the OCTT of pigs, and DF prevented this effect. 90 % of OCTT estimates measured in saliva and breath CO2 did not differ. We conclude that the (LCU)-C-13 breath test is useful for determining OCTT in pigs; saliva is generally suitable as a sample matrix for OCTT, but its use requires further validation.

AB  - Pesticides are detected in a wide array of foods of animal origin, posing a threat to food safety and human health. Here, to facilitate the management of pesticide residues in livestock products, we proposed a screening model for simulating pesticide biotransfer factors (BTFs, ratio of steady-state pesticide concentration between animal tissues and feed) in mammalian bodies. The proposed model was developed based on simple matrix algebra using first-order kinetics. Simulation of over 700 pesticides in common food products derived from cattle and sheep indicated that pesticide biotransfer is a balancing process between uptake efficiency from the gut lumen and the uptake-elimination ratio (ratio of the overall uptake and elimination rate constants) in individual tissues. Furthermore, we parameterized the developed BTF model using the octanol-water partition coefficient. The simulated pesticide BTFs could be categorized into three lipophilicity phases, namely, the lipophilicity-boosting (log K-OW < 4), lipophilicity-balancing (4 <= log K-OW <= 8), and lipophilicity-limiting (log K-OW > 8) phases, and the simulated general trends of BTFs were consistent with the experimental data. Although the metabolic rate constants of pesticides in mammalian bodies warrant further evaluation, the model proposed here can assist in the risk assessment and regulatory management of pesticide residues in foods of animal origin.

AB  - Two major groups of specialized metabolites in maize (Zea mays), termed kauralexins and dolabralexins, serve as known or predicted diterpenoid defenses against pathogens, herbivores, and other environmental stressors. To consider the physiological roles of the recently discovered dolabralexin pathway, we examined dolabralexin structural diversity, tissue-specificity, and stress-elicited production in a defined biosynthetic pathway mutant. Metabolomics analyses support a larger number of dolabralexin pathway products than previously known. We identified dolabradienol as a previously undetected pathway metabolite and characterized its enzymatic production. Transcript and metabolite profiling showed that dolabralexin biosynthesis and accumulation predominantly occur in primary roots and show quantitative variation across genetically diverse inbred lines. Generation and analysis of CRISPR-Cas9-derived loss-of-function Kaurene Synthase-Like 4 (Zmksl4) mutants demonstrated dolabralexin production deficiency, thus supporting ZmKSL4 as the diterpene synthase responsible for the conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate precursors into dolabradiene and downstream pathway products. Zmksl4 mutants further display altered root-to-shoot ratios and root architecture in response to water deficit. Collectively, these results demonstrate dolabralexin biosynthesis via ZmKSL4 as a committed pathway node biochemically separating kauralexin and dolabralexin metabolism, and suggest an interactive role of maize dolabralexins in plant vigor during abiotic stress.

AB  - Background Sea buckthorn (Hippophae) is in the focus of interest mainly for its positive effects on health of both human and animal organisms. Due to the similarities in vegetative morphology, Hippophae species are often misidentified. Therefore, current study was focused on ITS based sequence characterization of sea buckthorn species and comparative biochemical evaluation for its antioxidant properties. Methods and results DNA was extracted from leaf samples. Primer pairs K-Lab-SeaBukRhm-ITS1F1- K-Lab-SeaBukRhm-ITS1R1 and K-LabSeaBukTib- ITSF1- K-LabSeaBukTib-ITSR1 were used for PCR amplification. The purified PCR products were outsourced for sequencing. Phylogenetic tree was constructed based on neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Moreover, comparison of antioxidant potential of leaves of two sea buckthorn species (Hippophae rhamnoides and Hippophae tibetana) collected from different regions of Ladakh viz., Stakna, Nubra, DRDO Leh and Zanskar was determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), and Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) by phosphomolybdenum assays. The present investigation led to the differentiation of two sea buckthorn species viz., H. rhamnoides and H. tibetana based on Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. Moreover, significant variation was observed in antioxidant potential of leaf extracts collected from different regions. Conclusions Primary ITS sequence analysis was found to be powerful tool for identification and genetic diversity studies in sea buckthorn. Leaves of sea buckthorn have pronounced antioxidant properties and can be used in food, neutraceuticals and pharmaceutical industries etc. The current study will pave the way to discover small bioactive molecules responsible for antioxidant and anticancer properties in sea buckthorn.

AB  - Noise can alter the behavior and welfare of pigs, although they have good adaptive abilities. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between different regularly emitted sounds and the behavior of gestating sows as well as their potential time of habituation to these sounds. Two groups of gestating sows (n = 15, n = 17) were involved in the experiment over two consecutive weeks. During the first week, ("Base week"), no sound was emitted, while the following week ("Test week") one sound among 40 sounds grouped into 4 types (alarm, animal, metallic, and human) was emitted randomly every 10 min during the observed periods. The sows posture (lying, sitting, standing) and behavior (sleeping, observing, in the automations) were observed thanks to manual video analysis during a resting period (PM: 13:30 h - 18:30 h) and a feeding period (Night: 23:00 h - 04:00 h) on Mondays (for Base and Test weeks - Test1) and on Wednesday (only for Test week - Test2). Sows' location in the different areas of the room, posture, and behaviour were recorded. The sows spent less time sleeping during Test1 than Base but this behavior increased again during Test2. The number of behavior changes increased during Test1 and decreased in Test2. In Test1 during the PM time, the number of area, posture and behavior changes was higher during the emissions of Alarm sounds than during the emission of other sounds, but no difference among the type of sounds was observed during the Night. During the emission of Human sounds in Test2, the sows spent more time sitting and observing, and less time sleeping than with the emission of other sounds. They also changed position more during PM of Test2 with the emission of human sounds. To conclude, frequent emission of short sounds, even below 85 decibels, can reduce to time spent sleeping and cause behavior changes. However, gestating sows can habituate to the sound stimuli and return to normal behavior by the second day of testing. The effects of different types of sounds on sow behavior and posture are not yet fully understood and require further research based on the sounds characteristics.

AB  - Vertebrates differ over 100,000-fold in responses to pro-inflammatory agonists such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), complicating use of animal models to study human sepsis or inflammatory disorders. We compared transcriptomes of resting and LPS-exposed blood from six LPS-sensitive species (rabbit, pig, sheep, cow, chimpanzee, human) and four LPS-resilient species (mice, rats, baboon, rhesus), as well as plasma proteomes and lipidomes. Unexpectedly, at baseline, sensitive species already had enhanced expression of LPS-responsive genes relative to resilient species. After LPS stimulation, maximally different genes in resilient species included genes that detoxify LPS, diminish bacterial growth, discriminate sepsis from SIRS, and play roles in autophagy and apoptosis. The findings reveal the molecular landscape of species differences in inflammation. This may inform better selection of species for pre-clinical models and could lead to new therapeutic strategies that mimic mechanisms in inflammation-resilient species to limit inflammation without causing immunosuppression.

AB  - Epithelial polarity is controlled by a polarity machinery that includes Rho GTPase CDC42 and Scribble/PAR. By using intestinal stem cell (ISC)-specific deletion of CDC42 in olfactomedin-4 (Olfm4)-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-EGFP/CreERT2;CDC42(flox/flox) mice, we find that CDC42 loss initiated in the ISCs causes a drastic hyperproliferation of transit amplifying (TA) cells and disrupts epithelial polarity. CDC42-null crypts display expanded TA cell and diminished ISC populations, accompanied by elevated Hippo signaling via YAP/TAZ-Ereg (yes-associated protein/WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1-epiregulin) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, independent from canonical Wnt signaling. YAP/TAZ conditional knockout (KO) restores the balance of ISC/TA cell populations and crypt proliferation but does not rescue the polarity in CDC42-null small intestine. mTOR or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor treatment of CDC42 KO mice exhibits similar rescuing effects without affecting YAP/TAZ signaling. Inducible ablation of Scribble in intestinal epithelial cells mimics that of CDC42 KO defects, including crypt hyperplasia and Hippo signaling activation. Mammalian epithelial polarity regulates ISC/TA cell fate and proliferation via a Hippo-Ereg-mTOR cascade.

AB  - Defoliation tolerance (DT) in Amaranthus cruentus is known to reach its apex at the panicle emergence (PE) phase and to decline to minimal levels at flowering (FL). In this study, defoliation-induced changes were recorded in the content of non-structural carbohydrates and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), and in the expression and/or activity of sugar starvation response-associated genes in plants defoliated at different vegetative and reproductive stages. This strategy identified sugar-starvation-related factors that explained the opposite DT observed at these key developmental stages. Peak DT at PE was associated with increased cytosolic invertase (CI) activity in all organs and with the extensive induction of various class II trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS) genes. Contrariwise, least DT at FL coincided with a sharp depletion of starch reserves and with sucrose (Suc) accumulation, in leaves and stems, the latter of which was consistent with very low levels of CI and vacuolar invertase activities that were not further modified by defoliation. Increased Suc suggested growth-inhibiting conditions associated with altered cytosolic Suc-to-hexose ratios in plants defoliated at FL. Augmented cell wall invertase activity in leaves and roots, probably acting in a regulatory rather than hydrolytic role, was also associated with minimal DT observed at FL. The widespread contrast in gene expression patterns in panicles also matched the opposite DT observed at PE and FL. These results reinforce the concept that a localized sugar starvation response caused by C partitioning is crucial for DT in grain amaranth.

AB  - Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp) infection severely affects the daily weight gain and feed-to-meat ratio of pigs, while secondary infections with other pathogens can further lead to increased mortality, causing significant economic losses to the pig industry. CD40L is a molecular adjuvant that enhances the cellular and humoral immune responses to vaccines. In this study, the CD40L peptide was fused to the C-terminus of the chimeric P97R1P46P42 protein by genetic engineering using the pFastBac Dual vector. The recombinant chimeric protein P97R1P46P42 and its fusion P97R1P46P42-CD40L were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified. Mice were immunized with P97R1P46P42 or its fusion protein. Seppic ISA 201 emulsified protein, conventional Mhp vaccine and PBS control groups were included. Immunogenecity was assessed by specific IgG antibody response, splenic lymphocyte proliferation, and cytokine IL-4 and IFN-gamma levels. We found that CD40L fusion significantly enhanced specific antibody response, lymphocyte proliferation and IL-4 level in the immunized mouse sera as compared to the P97R1P46P42 or conventional vaccine group. This study provides clear evidence that CD40L potentiates the humoral and cellular immune responses to the Mhp chimeric protein P97R1P46P42 in the mouse model. This CD40L-fused chimeric protein could be a MPS subunit vaccine candidate to be tested for its efficacy in pigs in response to challenges with pathogenic Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae strain(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) predicts that alien plant species are unsuitable hosts for native phytophagous insects. However, the biotic resistance hypothesis (BRH) predicts that generalist herbivores may prefer an alien plant over their common host plant. In this study, we have tested these two hypotheses by comparing the potential colonization of the invasive Pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum L.) versus the common rearing host plants by two generalist aphid species (Aphis fabae and Myzus persicae). We assessed (i) the probing behavior using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique and (ii) survival and fecundity in Petri dishes.RESULTS: The results showed the inability of A. fabae and Myzus persicae to immediately colonize R. ponticum. Despite their ability to feed on this invasive plant, the two aphid species hardly survived and poorly reproduced.CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the ERH, since R. ponticum appeared as an unsuitable host for native phytophagous insects.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - In Turkey, facilities for the use of biomass resources in energy production are increasing, and new conversion facilities are commissioned every year to provide environmentally friendly energy production. Therefore, reliable energy potential estimates are needed. In this study, the animal manure-based-biogas potentials of Antalya, Isparta, and Burdur provinces in the Western Mediterranean Region of Turkey were calculated. Here, special information on cattle, small ruminants, and poultry, and animal age, number, and manure amount information were used in detail. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions, coal, electricity, and thermal energy, methane emission values with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches were calculated and predicted by machine learning algorithms. To determine the model with the best results, machine learning algorithms support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and linear regression (LR) were used, and hyper-parameter optimization was performed. According to the results of biogas potential, CO2 emission, electricity production, and thermal energy estimations SVM models are seen as the best models with R-2 = 0.999. When the coal amount estimation is examined, the LR models produce better results than SVM and MLP with R-2 = 0.997. In the estimation of CH4 using the Tier 1 approach, the MLP model can perform the best estimation with R-2 = 0.977. In the CH4 modeling obtained using the Tier 2 approach, the LR models were superior to the other models with the performance value of R-2 = 0.962.

AB  - This Special Issue presents articles that combine traditional approaches, novel experimental methods, and advanced techniques, to provide a more in-depth understanding of trophic interactions in biological control. Studies mainly cover behavioural and chemical ecology, molecular ecology using PCR, qPCR and highthroughput sequencing, population genetics, automated deep learning image analysis and photo trapping. Through laboratory and field investigations, articles provide novel insights into host/prey specificity of natural enemies, their multitrophic interactions, and how they behave in space and time. Ultimately, results may be useful for the development of management strategies that aim to improve biocontrol effectiveness against native and invasive herbivorous insects.

AB  - Groundwater quality in the Shivganga river basin, Western India, was evaluated by an integrated approach using pollution index of groundwater (PIG), health risk assessment (HRA) and chemometric analysis. Sixty eight (68) representative groundwater samples were collected and analysed for pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), major cation and anion during pre- (PRM) and post (POM)-monsoon seasons of 2016. Hydro-chemical analysis inferred that EC, total hardiness, alkalinity, boron and fluoride are exceeding the permissible limits of the World Health Organisation (WHO). PIG was computed based on considered physicochemical parameters and WHO drinking standards to ascertain the degree of pollution level. PIG results inferred that about 6% samples fall in moderate, 12% in low and 82% in insignificant pollution in PRM season; while, 12% of sample fall within low, 88% insignificant pollution in POM season. HRA was carried to know the health impacts of boron and fluoride toxicity on infants, children and adults. HRA results suggest that children are more susceptible to non carcinogenic health risk than infants and adults. Chemometric analysis included correlation matrix (CM), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) to know the relationship between water quality variables and their collective influence on overall groundwater quality. CM and PCA suggested that, inputs of TDS, Mg, NO3, Na, Cl, and SO4 are elevated due to rainfall and anthropogenic activities. These techniques are useful to evaluate the influence of seasonal variation of natural or anthropogenic processes controlling the groundwater quality in the study region.

AB  - Dietary differences are often observed among generalist herbivores co-occurring in the same community. However, the factors underlying the differences remain poorly understood. In the context of insect herbivores, we hypothesized that interspecific dietary differences are associated with life history traits. Specifically, we hypothesized that the size of wings as well as gender participate in defining dietary preferences, that is, long-winged species and males will tend to forage on plants with high C/N to maximize dispersal and mating, whereas short-winged species and females will forage on N-rich plants to maximize egg production. We tested this hypothesis by examining the diets of the males and females of three long-winged and two short-winged grasshopper species in an alpine meadow. The dietary composition and relative abundance of each species were determined using DNA meta-barcoding. The data showed that the consumed plant species were similar among all of the grasshopper species and between the males and females. However, quantitative differences in the diets were significant between the long-winged and short-winged guilds and between the males and females of each species. Consistent with the hypothesis, (1) the long-winged species fed more on monocots with high C/N, whereas the short-winged species fed more on legumes with high N contents, (2) for each short-winged species the males fed more on monocots with high C/N compared to the females, and (3) across all grasshopper species, egg numbers were positively associated with the weighted dietary N. These data indicate that the dietary preferences of these generalist grasshoppers are associated with life history tradeoffs.

AB  - Benzoxazinoids are plant specialized metabolites with defense properties, highly abundant in wheat (Triticum), one of the world's most important crops. The goal of our study was to characterize dioxygenase BX6 genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genotypes and to elucidate their effects on defense against herbivores. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four BX6 genes in the hexaploid wheat T. aestivum, but only one ortholog was found in the tetraploid (T. turgidum) wild emmer wheat and the cultivated durum wheat. Transcriptome sequencing of durum wheat plants, damaged by either aphids or caterpillars, revealed that several BX genes, including TtBX6, were upregulated upon caterpillar feeding, relative to the undamaged control plants. A virus-induced gene silencing approach was used to reduce the expression of BX6 in T. aestivum plants, which exhibited both reduced transcript levels and reduced accumulation of different benzoxazinoids. To elucidate the effect of BX6 on plant defense, bioassays with different herbivores feeding on BX6-silenced leaves were conducted. The results showed that plants with silenced BX6 were more susceptible to aphids and the two-spotted spider mite than the control. Overall, our study indicates that wheat BX6 is involved in benzoxazinoid formation in planta and contributes to plant resistance against insect herbivores.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of trade-offs among traits is vital for comprehending the evolution and maintenance of trait variation. Theoretical frameworks propose that evolutionary mechanisms governing trade-offs frequently exhibit a scale-dependent nature. However, empirical tests of whether trade-offs exhibited across various biological scales (i.e. individuals, populations, species, genera, etc.) remains scarce. In this study, we explore trade-off between dispersal and reproductive effort among sympatric sister species of wasps in the genus Belonocnema (Hymenoptera: Cynipini: Cynipidae) that form galls on live oaks: B. fossoria, which specializes on Quercus geminata, and B. treatae, which specializes on Q. virginiana. Specifically, our results suggest that B. fossoria has evolved reduced flight capability and smaller wings, but a larger abdomen and greater total reproductive effort than B. treatae, which has larger wings and is a stronger flier, but has a smaller abdomen and reduced total reproductive effort. These traits and the relationships among them remain unchanged when B. fossoria and B. treatae are transplanted and reared onto the alternative host plant, suggesting that trait divergence is genetically based as opposed to being a plastic response to the different rearing environments. However, when looking within species, we found no evidence of intraspecific trade-offs between wing length and reproductive traits within either B. fossoria or B. treatae. Overall, our results indicate that observed trade-offs in life history traits between the two gall former species are likely a result of independent adaptations in response to different environments as opposed to the amplified expression of within species intrinsic tradeoffs.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder that affects the social life of patients. Psychiatric disorders are caused by a complex combination of genetic (G) and environmental (E) factors. Polysialylation represents a unique posttranslational modification of a protein, and such changes in neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) have been reported in postmortem brains from patients with psychiatric disorders. To understand the G x E effect on polysialylated NCAM expression, in this study, we performed precise measurements of polySia and NCAM using a disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)-mutant mouse (G), a mouse model of schizophrenia, under acute stress conditions (E). This is the first study to reveal a lower number and smaller length of polySia in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of DISC1 mutants relative to those in wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, an analysis of polySia and NCAM responses to acute stress in five brain regions (olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex, suprachiasmatic nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus) revealed that the pattern of changes in these responses in WT mice and DISC1 mutants differed by region. These differences could indicate the vulnerability of DISC1 mutants to stress.

AB  - Objective To comprehensively examine the molecular epidemiological characteristics of human rhinovirus (HRV) in Beijing. Methods A total of 7,151 children and adults with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) were recruited from 35 sentinel hospitals in Beijing between 2018 and 2022. Their respiratory samples were obtained, and epidemiological and clinical data were collected. Nucleic acid testing for 11 respiratory pathogens, including HRV, was performed on the specimens. We sequenced VP4/VP2 or 5'UTR of HRV isolates to identify their genotypes using phylogenetic analyses. Results HRV was detected in 462 (6.5%) cases. A total of 105 HRV genotypes were successfully identified in 359 (77.7%) specimens, comprising 247 (68.8%) with HRV-A, 42 (11.7%) with HRV-B, and 70 (19.5%) with HRV-C. No predominant genotype was observed. HRV was prevalent year-round with two weak peaks in spring and autumn. HRV detection declined gradually between 2018 and 2022, with seven genotypes disappearing and five genotypes emerging. HRV detection rate decreased by age without resurge among old people. HRV-C was more common among children aged less than 5 years with severe community-acquired pneumonia compared to HRV-A and HRV-B. Adults infected with HRV-B had higher rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and complications than those infected with HRV-A and HRV-C. Conclusion HRV epidemics in Beijing were highly dispersed in genotypes, which probably resulted in a high prevalence of HRV infection, attenuated its seasonality, and made it more difficult to establish effective population immunity.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as naringin (NG), Eucommiol, isopsoralen, icariin, Astragalus polysaccharides, and chondroitin sulfate, contained in Drynariae Rhizoma, Eucommiae Cortex, Psoralea corylifolia, Herba Epimedii, Astragalus radix and deer antler, are considered promising candidates for enhancing the healing of osteoporotic defects due to their outstanding bone homeostasis regulating properties. They are commonly used to activate bone repair scaffolds. Aim of the review: Bone repair scaffolds are inadequate to meet the demands of osteoporotic defect healing due to the lack of regulation of bone homeostasis. Therefore, selecting bone scaffolds activated with TCM to improve the therapeutic effect of repairing osteoporotic bone defects. Materials and methods: To gather information on bone scaffold activated by traditional Chinese medicine, we conducted a thorough search of several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Results: This review discusses the mechanism of TCM active ingredients in regulating bone homeostasis, including stimulating bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption process and the healing mechanism of traditional bone repair scaffolds activated by them for osteoporotic defect healing. Conclusion: In general, the introduction of TCM active ingredients provides a novel therapeutic approach for modulating bone homeostasis and facilitating osteoporotic defect healing, and also offers a new strategy for design of other unconventional bone defect healing materials.

AB  - Identifying the particular guilds of herbivore arthropods that affect the production of crops is key to developing sustainable pest-management strategies; however, there is incomplete information about the identity of herbivore arthropods that could potentially damage the production of both highland and lowland quinoa landraces grown in Chile. By both reviewing the literature and conducting field collections across a large latitudinal gradient, we generated an updated list of 43 herbivore arthropods associated with quinoa production in Chile. In general, most species are polyphagous feeders, and only seven are specialists. The number and identity of species varied in relation with the latitude, such that four distinctive assemblages of herbivores were identified, each containing 32, 27, 34, and 22 species between latitudes 18-26, 26-32, 32-40, and 40-44 degrees S, respectively. The most northern production area (18-26 degrees S) is affected by nine unique species, including the major quinoa pest Eurysacca quinoae PovolnATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Similarly, the central area (32-40 degrees S) contains four unique species, including Eurysacca media PovolnATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and Orthotylus flavosparsus (Sahlberg) (Hemiptera: Miridae). The particular species assemblages described here will help further development of local pest-management practices.

AB  - The effects of low doses of toxicants are often subtle and information extracted from metabolomic data alone may not always be sufficient. As end products of enzymatic reactions, metabolites represent the final phenotypic expression of an organism and can also reflect gene expression changes caused by this exposure. Therefore, the integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data could improve the extracted biological knowledge on these toxicants induced disruptions. In the present study, we applied statistical integration tools to metabolomic and transcriptomic data obtained from jejunal explants of pigs exposed to the food contaminant, deoxynivalenol (DON). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and self-organizing map (SOM) were compared for the identification of correlated transcriptomic and metabolomic features, and O2-PLS was used to model the relationship between exposure and selected features. The integration of both 'omics data increased the number of discriminant metabolites discovered (39) by about 10 times compared to the analysis of the metabolomic dataset alone (3). Besides the disturbance of energy metabolism previously reported, assessing correlations between both functional levels revealed several other types of damage linked to the intestinal exposure to DON, including the alteration of protein synthesis, oxidative stress, and inflammasome activation. This confirms the added value of integration to enrich the biological knowledge extracted from metabolomics.

AB  - High-concentrate diets can damage the barrier function of the rumen epithelium and lead to inflammation, which may result in digestive and metabolic disorders and growth retardation in lambs. The phenolic phytonutrients, such as cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and capsicum oleoresin, have been suggested to act as rumen modifiers. Our results show that a blend of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and capsicum oleoresin (CEC) supplementation improved the growth performance and rumen health of lambs fed a high-concentrate diet, which could be due to reducing inflammation and apoptosis, protecting barrier function, and modulating the bacterial community.
   We investigated the effects of CEC on the fermentation characteristics, epithelial gene expression, and bacterial community in the rumen of lambs fed a high-concentrate diet. Twenty-four 3-month-old female crossbred lambs with an initial body weight of 30.37 +/- 0.57 kg were randomly allocated to consume a diet supplemented with 80 mg/kg CEC (CEC) or not (CON). The experiment consisted of a 14 d adaptation period and a 60 d data collection period. Compared with the CON group, the CEC group had higher ADG, epithelial cell thickness, ruminal butyrate proportion, and lower ammonia nitrogen concentration. Increases in the mRNA expression of Occludin and Claudin-4, as well as decreases in the mRNA expression of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), cytochrome c (Cyt-C), Caspase-8, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Caspase-7, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), were observed in the CEC group. Moreover, CEC treatment also decreased the concentration of IL-1 beta, IL-12, and TNF-alpha. Supplementation with CEC altered the structure and composition of the rumen bacterial community, which was indicated by the increased relative abundances of Firmicutes, Synergistota, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Olsenella, Schwartzia, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-002, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, Acetitomaculum, [Eubacterium]_ruminantium_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-004, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Sphaerochaeta, Pyramidobacter, and [Eubacterium]_eligens_group, and the decreased relative abundances of Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, and MND1. Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the altered rumen bacteria were closely correlated with rumen health-related indices. Dietary CEC supplementation improved growth performance, reduced inflammation and apoptosis, protected barrier function, and modulated the bacterial community of lambs fed a high-concentrate diet.

AB  - Globally, drought has emerged as one of the most serious threats to oil seed crops including Camelina production, which necessitates screening of drought resistant cultivars that are more responsive to mitigation treatments. Effect of microbes and Selenium (Se) is associated with the upregulation of available nutrients. Therefore, present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of Se interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus intraradices at four different treatments (T1: CK), T2: inoculation of R. intraradices), T3: Se-priming (2 mM), T4: inoculation of R. intraradices+ Se-priming (2 mM) on two Camelina genotypes (Australian and Canadian) under varied water levels (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% field capacity, FC). Se with Seed priming and microbes were applied through inoculation of Camelina seed. The experiment was conducted in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications at MNS- University of Agriculture Multan, Pakistan. The results exhibited that inoculation of R. intraradices + Se-priming (2 mM) application significantly improved the physiological and growth parameters of Camelina under water stress. The application of inoculation of R. intraradices + Se-priming (2 mM) increased crop growth, physiology, and antioxidants as compared to other treatments (T1: (Control), T2: Microbes (R. intraradices), T3: Se-priming (2 mM). The application of Microbes + Se-priming (2 mM) increased the total soluble sugars by 69.6%, 23.4%, and 10.8% as compared to other treatments (T1: (Control), T2: inoculation of R. intraradices), T3: Se-priming (2 mM)., respectively, irrespective of field capacity levels. Among varied water levels, 100% FC showed unmatched results regarding crop growth traits, physiological aspects, and antioxidants activities as compared to water stressed levels of 75%, 50%, and 25% FCs. Proline contents were also increased by 93.9%, 52.5%, and 10.2% at 100% FC as compared to 25%, 50%, and 75% FCs. The response of Canadian Camelina was found better than Australian Camelina in most of the growth, physiological, and antioxidant parameters. Canadian Camelina also showed a 2.14% increase in superoxide dismutase activity as compared to Australian Camelina. The combination of Canadian Camelina inoculation of R. intraradices + Sepriming (2 mM) is recommended to achieve higher productivity under water-stressed conditions. However, long-term studies must be conducted to screen out drought resistant and inoculation of R. intraradices + Sepriming responsive genotypes for increasing Camelina yield in low input farming systems. Further, Semediated physiological and biochemical associated with drought tolerance in Camelina plants and future research prospects have been elucidated.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the randomised controlled trials that explored the effect of kangaroo mother care on physiological stress parameters of premature infants. Methods: Two independent researchers performed a systematic review of indexed studies in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane and Scopus. We included data from randomized controlled trials measuring the effects of kangaroo care compared to standard incubator care on physiological stress outcomes, defined as oxygen saturation, body temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate. The PRISMA model was used to conduct data extraction. We performed a narrative synthesis of all studies and a meta-analysis when data were available from multiple studies that compared the same physiological parameters with the kangaroo method as an intervention and controls and used the same outcome measures. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. According to statistical analysis, the mean respiratory rate of preterm infants receiving KMC was lower than that of infants receiving standard incubator care (MD, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.17 to -1.83; p < 0.00001). Infants who received kangaroo mother care had a higher mean heart rate, oxygen saturation and temperature, although these results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that kangaroo care in the neonatal intensive care unit setting is a safe method that may have a significant effect on some of the physiological parameters of stress in preterm infants. However, due to clinical heterogeneity, further studies are needed to assess the effects of physiological stress in the neonatal intensive care unit on the development of preterm infants.

AB  - Sod farms, where turfgrass is commercially produced, have a unique system, in which sod is harvested within 2 yr after planting. Understanding the turfgrass factors that influence the abundance of predators, herbivores, detritivores, and parasitoids that inhabit turfgrass paves the foundation for developing effective pest management programs. However, little is known about those factors in sod farms. The objective of the study was to determine the influence of turfgrass height, density, and thatch thickness on abundance of arthropod taxa in sod farms. The study was conducted at 18 and 10 sod field sites in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Four pitfall traps were deployed at each site. In 2019, each site was sampled in May, June, and July, whereas in 2020, each site was sampled in June and August. In 2019, the numbers of predatory heteropterans were two times greater in bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) than in zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.). The numbers of predatory mirids, Spanogonicus albofasciatus (Reuter), and carabids significantly decreased with increases in turfgrass height. In 2020, the abundance of staphylinids increased as the thatch thickness increased. The abundance of Sphenophorus spp. adults were significantly greater in bermudagrass than in zoysiagrass in 2020 and were more abundant in the denser turfgrasses in both years. The predatory arthropods were positively correlated with increased densities of cicadellids, whereas predatory mirids were positively associated with cicadellids, delphacids, and chrysomelids. These results have implications on management of arthropod pests in sod farms as abundance of beneficial arthropods are influenced by turfgrass factors.

AB  - Encoding spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data serves to identify the biological semantics of RNA expression within the tissue while preserving spatial characteristics. Depending on the analytical scenario, one may focus on different contextual structures of tissues. For instance, anatomical regions reveal consistent patterns by focusing on spatial homogeneity, while elucidating complex tumor micro-environments requires more expression heterogeneity. However, current spatial encoding methods lack consideration of the tissue context. Meanwhile, most developed SRT technologies are still limited in providing exact patterns of intact tissues due to limitations such as low resolution or missed measurements. Here, we propose STForte, a novel pairwise graph autoencoder-based approach with cross-reconstruction and adversarial distribution matching, to model the spatial homogeneity and expression heterogeneity of SRT data. STForte extracts interpretable latent encodings, enabling downstream analysis by accurately portraying various tissue contexts. Moreover, STForte allows spatial imputation using only spatial consistency to restore the biological patterns of unobserved locations or low-quality cells, thereby providing fine-grained views to enhance the SRT analysis. Extensive evaluations of datasets under different scenarios and SRT platforms demonstrate that STForte is a scalable and versatile tool for providing enhanced insights into spatial data analysis.

AB  - C-repeat binding factors (CsCBFs) play a pivotal role in regulating cold response in higher plants. Camellia sinensis cv. Baiye 1, a representative albino tea cultivar, has been identified as temperature-sensitive based on long-term observations by tea farmers. However, it remains unclear whether CsCBFs are involved in temperature-mediated albinism and seasonal greening in 'Baiye 1', and the mechanisms by which CBFs regulate cold responses in albino leaves are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that CsCBF2 suppresses the seasonal greening of albino leaves by inhibiting chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis under cold stress. In tea plantations, the accumulation of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the albino shoots of 'Baiye 1' is closely correlated with the effective accumulated temperature during its seasonal greening process. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis revealed negative associations between CsCBF expression and chlorophylls, carotenoids, as well as their biosynthetic genes REVEILLE 1 (CsRVE1) and Zeaxanthin epoxidase 1 (CsZEP1) under temperature fluctuations during seasonal greening. Cold-induced upregulation of CsCBF2 expression and decreased chlorophyll and carotenoids under controlled climate conditions. Transient suppression of CsCBF2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides elevated expressions of target genes and increased chlorophylls and carotenoids. CBF-binding cis-elements were identified in CsRVE1, Protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (CsPORA) and CsZEP1 promoters. Luciferase assays suggested CsCBF2 binding to the CRT/DRE cis-elements and repressing expression of CsRVE1, CsPORA and CsZEP1. These findings highlight CsCBF2 as a key transcriptional repressor involved in the seasonal greening of albino 'Baiye 1' under cold stress by modulating cold responses and inhibiting genes associated with chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the thermal exchanges, physiological responses, productive performance and carcass yield of Guinea Fowl confined under thermoneutral conditions and under thermal stress. For the experiment, 96 animals were confined in 8 experimental boxes of 1 m(2) of area, each, divided in equal numbers and placed inside two distinct climatic chambers, where the birds were distributed in a completely randomized design, with two treatments (air temperatures of 26 and 32 degrees C, respectively). For the collection of physiological responses and carcass yield 16 birds were evaluated and for the collection of data on feed and water consumption and productive responses, 48 birds per treatment were evaluated. The environmental variables (air temperature (AT), air relative humidity and wind speed), temperature and humidity index (THI), heat exchanges, physiological responses (respiratory rate, surface temperature, cloacal temperature and eyeball temperature), feed (FC) and water (WC) consumption and production responses (weight gain, feed conversion index and carcass yield) of the birds were evaluated. With the elevation of the AT, it could be noticed that the THI went from a thermal comfort condition to an emergency condition, where the birds lost part of their feathers, increased all physiological responses evaluated, and consequently, reduced by 53.5% the amount of heat dissipated in the sensible form and increased by 82.7% the heat losses in the latent form, increasing also the WC. ATs of up to 32 degrees C did not significantly affect the productive performance and carcass yield of the guinea fowl.

AB  - Research on the welfare of pet guinea pigs and connections between their behaviour and husbandry practices is scarce. Through an online survey among 1181 German-speaking guinea pig caretakers, we investigated husbandry practices (including social composition, housing type, free roaming, enrichment, and feeding), human-animal interactions, and guinea pig behaviour. Most participating caretakers seemed attentive to their animals' needs and welfare, as shown by the prevalence of self-built enclosures (42.8%) and fenced floor areas (21.1%), with various enrichment and furnishings, and mostly balanced nutrition. Husbandry practices that can negatively impact welfare, such as individual housing and no constant access to hay, were observed for 7.5% and 0.4% of the animals, respectively. Eating and resting next to conspecifics and locomotor play occurred several times per day in 87.6%, 48.1%, and 19.9% of animals, respectively. Biting, running up and down and bar chewing were rare (several times per day in 0.4%, 2.9%, and 0.7% of animals, respectively). We found significant associations of guinea pig behaviour with human-animal interactions and housing conditions. For instance, affiliative behaviour and locomotor play and use of enrichment were more frequently reported in the case of more frequent positive human-animal interactions and food enrichment. Our results provide additional knowledge to support consultations on behaviour and husbandry practices.

AB  - This article assesses farmers' willingness to participate in a stylised scheme supporting the adoption of slurry acidification techniques in livestock facilities. Slurry acidification is a novel technique, developed in Denmark, to reduce ammonia emissions. In a discrete choice survey of 129 German livestock farmers, the respondents were asked to choose among different support schemes and the status quo. The attributes presented in the choice sets were the expected emission reduction, the cost share on offer, a factor by which the additional nitrogen in acidified slurry must be accounted for in fertiliser plans, and concessions on current fertiliser regulations. A mixed logit model showed that the majority of respondents valued emission reductions, a higher cost share and concessions on the statutory requirements of the Fertiliser Ordinance. A latent-class model was applied to reveal preference heterogeneity. It identified three preference classes with different perceptions of the scheme's attributes.

AB  - Defoliation management can significantly affect subsequent grassland's forage productivity and sustainability. To assess the type and persistence of native warm-season grass (NWSG) yield responses to changes in defoliation intensity, a five-year harvest trial was conducted, in a randomized complete block design, at Virginia State University's research farm. Yield responses of newly established indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans L.). Nash, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) stands to second-year changes in harvest regimes were monitored. In 2012, seedlings of these native grasses were transplanted in clean-tilled plots, with 16 plants in each pot. The field was not irrigated, but broadleaf weeds were manually controlled, and all plots were mowed in August and mid-November of 2013. Starting June 2014, each plot had three harvest-strips assigned to single, two, or three cuts per year from early June to mid-October using a plot-harvester; forage weights were recorded. Based on the recorded fresh and oven-dry sample weights, plot forage DM yields were estimated. Cumulative forage biomass of all three-cut strips flipped to single-cut increased by >= 30% and >50% for big bluestem. The second-year single-cut yields also outperformed those cut thrice since the first year by 22-51%. The second-year biomass increases from single-cut strips that were cut thrice in the first year demonstrated that flipping-triggered compensatory yield responses overshadowed the first- year losses in plant vigor. The compensatory yield increases continued to, but not beyond, the third year and varied between species. The yield responses also showed that magnitudes of defoliation management-triggered NWSG growth responses depend more on growing conditions during the recovery period than its actual duration.

AB  - Recent studies demonstrate that lipid peroxidation-induced ferroptosis participates in 2,2 ',4,4 '-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47)-evoked neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction. Melatonin has been indicated to confer neuroprotection against brain diseases via its potent anti-ferroptotic effects. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether melatonin can mitigate BDE-47-elicited cognitive impairment via suppressing ferroptosis, and further delineate the underlying mechanisms. Our results found that melatonin administration effectively inhibited BDE-47-induced ferroptosis in mice hippocampi and murine hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells. AcylCoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a key lipid metabolism enzyme dictating ferroptosis sensitivity, accompanied by higher MDA and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), was remarkably increased under BDE-47 stress, while melatonin supplementation could suppress the elevated ACSL4 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, melatonin facilitated lysosomal ACSL4 degradation through enhancing lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (LAMP2a) expression and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) activity, while LAMP2a knockdown abrogated the positive effects of melatonin on ACSL4 elimination in BDE-47-treated HT-22 cells. Moreover, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation by melatonin contributed to LAMP2a upregulation and CMA of ACSL4 and subsequent neuronal ferroptosis. Importantly, melatonin, CMA activator CA77.1, and ACSL4 inhibitor rosiglitazone (RSG) administration substantially attenuated neuronal/ synaptic injury and cognitive deficits following BDE-47 exposure. Taken together, these findings revealed that melatonin could prevent BDE-47-provoked ferroptosis in the hippocampal neurons and mitigate cognitive dysfunction by facilitating ACSL4 degradation via Nrf2-chaperone-mediated autophagy. Therefore, melatonin might be a potential candidate for treating BDE-47-elicited neurotoxicity and neurobehavioral disorder.

AB  - In vivo tuberculin skin test and in vitro IFN gamma assays are the most explored diagnostics for Mycobacterium bovis infection (Bovine Tuberculosis) in animals. However, there are other potential biomarkers like IP10 which may allow diagnosis of tuberculosis. In this study, IFN gamma and IP10 mRNA responses in guinea pig and cattle were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in whole blood samples stimulated PPDs and recombinant protein cocktail containing eight purified rCFP2, rESAT6, rCFP10, rMTC28, rMPB53, rMPB63, rMPB64 and rMPB83 proteins. Blood samples were obtained from M. bovis sensitised guinea pigs and tuberculin test positive cattle. Both guinea pigs and cattle blood cultures produced a significant increase in mRNA level of IFN gamma and IP10 when stimulated with protein cocktail as compared to that of bovine PPD. Upon different antigenic stimulations, IP10 mRNA responses were followed the similar kinetics to those of IFN gamma with high correlation (r = 0.97 for guinea pig and 0.96 for cattle).

AB  - BackgroundGastrointestinal (GI) functions are controlled by the enteric nervous system (ENS) in vertebrates, but data on snakes are scarce, as most studies were done in mammals. However, the feeding of many snakes, including Crotalus atrox, is in strong contrast with mammals, as it consumes an immense, intact prey that is forwarded, stored, and processed by the GI tract. We performed immunohistochemistry in different regions of the GI tract to assess the neuronal density and to quantify cholinergic, nitrergic, and VIPergic enteric neurons. We recorded motility patterns and determined the role of different neurotransmitters in the control of motility. Neuroimaging experiments complemented motility findings.ResultsA well-developed ganglionated myenteric plexus (MP) was found in the oesophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. In the submucous plexus (SMP) most neurons were scattered individually without forming ganglia. The lowest number of neurons was present in the SMP of the proximal colon, while the highest was in the MP of the oesophagus. The total number of neurons in the ENS was estimated to be approx. 1.5 million. In all regions of the SMP except for the oesophagus more nitric oxide synthase+ than choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ neurons were counted, while in the MP ChAT+ neurons dominated. In the SMP most nerve cells were VIP+, contrary to the MP, where numerous VIP+ nerve fibers but hardly any VIP+ neuronal cell bodies were seen. Regular contractions were observed in muscle strips from the distal stomach, but not from the proximal stomach or the colon. We identified acetylcholine as the main excitatory and nitric oxide as the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. Furthermore, 5-HT and dopamine stimulated, while VIP and the ss-receptor-agonist isoproterenol inhibited motility. ATP had only a minor inhibitory effect. Nerve-evoked contractile responses were sodium-dependent, insensitive to tetrodotoxin (TTX), but sensitive to lidocaine, supported by neuroimaging experiments.ConclusionsThe structure of the ENS, and patterns of gastric and colonic contractile activity of Crotalus atrox are strikingly different from mammalian models. However, the main excitatory and inhibitory pathways appear to be conserved. Future studies have to explore how the observed differences are an adaptation to the particular feeding strategy of the snake.

AB  - Photoperiodism is a critical environmental factor that influences the development, growth, feeding, metabolism, and reproduction in all living organisms. Photoperiod regulates the biological rhythms which entrain the circadian clock in association with the sleep-wake cycle, feed intake, metabolism, cognition and hormone secretion which are essential for physiological homeostasis in fishes. This study summarizes the effect of photomanipulations on early life-history characteristics, growth, reproductive performance and stress response in farmed fishes. Studies found that photomanipulations for long-day period results in improved growth in larvae, juveniles and adults in some fish species. Long-day photoperiod also has a positive effect on the reproductive performance in fishes depending on the species, photoperiod and exposure time. In contrast, short-day photoperiod has both positive and negative effects on growth and reproduction in farmed fish species. In both cases (short-day and long-day photoperiod conditions), manipulated photoperiod exerts a stress response by altering the hematobiochemical profile of fishes. A number of biomolecules including melatonin, hypothalamic neuropeptides, growth factors and sex steroids are involved in regulation of growth and reproduction in changing photoperiod depending on the species. Overall, this study is the first comprehensive review regarding photomanipulations and aquaculture performance of commercially important farmed fishes all over the world.

AB  - The mammalian tongue is a muscular hydrostat composed of multiple muscles, each with complex fiber architecture and small motor units. This allows it to move and deform in three dimensions (3D) to function in several complex behaviors, including suckling. The ability of infant mammals to successfully suckle is dependent on these variable deformations, as the tongue must perform multiple functions simultaneously. The lateral margins of the tongue curl to seal around a nipple, while the middle of the tongue moves in an anteroposterior wave to suck milk into the mouth, transport it posteriorly, and swallow it. The kinematics, mechanics, and coordination of the tongue during suckling are impacted by nipple properties, as evidenced by differences between feeding from nipples with narrow ducts (e.g., breastfeeding) and nipples that are hollow cisterns (e.g., bottle feeding). These structural differences result in different feeding outcomes, yet their effect on tongue function and kinematics is poorly understood. In addition, despite the 3D shape of the tongue during suckling, measurements of tongue movement have been limited to motion along the midsagittal plane and have not assessed suck volume. To evaluate how tongue function differs between ducted and cisternic nipples, we used X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology and a dynamic endocast, synchronized with intraoral suction, to quantify 3D tongue kinematics and suck volume. We found that pigs generated less suction but had greater suck volumes when they fed on cisternic nipples compared to ducted nipples. This is likely because the pigs compressed the cisternic nipple to express milk, resulting in higher flow, which we hypothesize slowed the accumulation of suction and permitted the tongue to achieve a larger suck volume. These results suggest that nipple design impacts the relationship between fluid dynamics and tongue function during feeding. In addition, we found that infants moved the surface of their tongue ventrally and posteriorly throughout the suck, but they did not increase the width of the suck volume. The use of a digital endocast to measure suck volume represents an important advance in our ability to evaluate the mechanics of feeding and could be used in the future to understand the relationships between tongue function and performance as infants mature, as well as in a comparative framework.

AB  - The aim of this research is to examine the influence of heat stress (HS) on body temperature (BT) measured rectally (RT) or by infrared thermography (IRT) of the nose (NT), eye (ET), leg (LT) and abdominal (AT) regions in intensively and extensively breed sheep and to detect a correlation between body temperature and metabolic response in sheep. A total of 33 Wurttemberg x Sjenica Pramenka sheep breeds were examined, 17 ewes were from outdoors and 16 were from indoor housing systems during three experimental periods (thermoneutral period, severe HS and moderate HS). Sheep under HS have a higher BT, and the magnitude of BT measured by infrared thermography (IRT) was higher than RT. LT and AT showed positive linear correlations with the temperature-humidity index (THI), while other ways of measuring BT did not give statistically significant correlations. Sheep under HS showed higher cortisol, insulin, total protein, albumin, urea, creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and index of insulin resistance, with lower values of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), glucose, calcium, inorganic phosphates, magnesium and cholesterol. BT and metabolic response were different in the function of the housing method of sheep. LT and AT showed a significant correlation with almost all blood parameters, and the strongest connections were made with T3, T4, BHB and the revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index of insulin resistance. The abdomen and legs are good thermal windows because LT and AT are good summative responses to external ambient THI and internal metabolic changes in sheep under heat stress.

AB  - This study evaluated the quality of groundwater and its suitability for drinking and irrigation in the hilly area of the Taihang Mountains in Henan Province, China. Groundwater samples were collected from 43 unconfined and 20 confined wells and analyzed. The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) was estimated based on the physicochemical parameters, and seven indices, including the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (%Na), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), magnesium ratio (MR), Kelley's ratio (KR), and corrosivity ratio (CR), were calculated to qualify the groundwater within the research area for irrigation activities. Multivariate statistical techniques were performed to better understand the hydrochemical processes. Chemical analysis showed that the dominant cation and anion were Ca2+ and HCO3-, respectively, and the principal hydrochemical facies was Ca-Mg-HCO3. In terms of pH, total dissolved solids, Na+, Cl-, F-, and SO42-, most samples were well within the limits prescribed by Chinese standards for drinking water quality, but more than half of the unconfined samples exceeded the specified limits for total hardness and nitrate. The PIG values suggested the pollution level was insignificant for all confined water samples and 72.09% of unconfined water samples, but the PIG distribution map showed that the water in the south central part of the study area had low to moderate pollution. According to the computed values of SAR, %Na, RSC, PI, KR, and MR and the results of a salinity diagram, the results further indicated that most of the studied samples were appropriate for irrigation usage. Only the CR values rendered 41.86% of the unconfined samples and 20% of the confined samples unfit for irrigation. Hence, proper measures are needed to resolve the corrosivity problem. Factor analysis resulted in the extraction of 3 factors that explained 81% of the data variability, and the extracted factors pointed towards geogenic factors governing the groundwater quality.

AB  - . Tree-kangaroos (genus Dendrolagus) are a morphologically distinctive genus of specialized, arboreal macropodids confined to the wet forests of New Guinea and northeast Australia. A distinct Goodfellow's group, containing up to four species, has long been recognized. Resolving the relationships of taxa within the group has been hampered by limited samples of most taxa. Here we supplement published genetic data from high quality tissue samples with molecular data generated from museum specimens to improve taxon and geographic coverage. This includes specimens of the previously unsampled D. g. goodfellowi, the holotype and paratype of D. deltae, and additional specimens of D. matschiei, D. spadix and D. g. buergersi. DNA sequence data were generated from three mitochondrial loci. Phylogenetic analysis improved the resolution of relationships within the Goodfellow's group, with the morphologically similar D. g. goodfellowi and D. g. buergersi being recovered as sister taxa, while D. pulcherrimus was the sister to the closely related, but morphologically and ecologically distinct, D. spadix and D. matschiei. Despite being sister to D. g. buergersi, D. g. goodfellowi was highly divergent. However, the two are morphologically very similar and we recommend retaining the taxonomic status quo (recognizing them as two subspecies of a single species) until improved sampling and a more thorough analysis is possible. The problematic D. deltae was confirmed as a junior synonym of D. matschiei.

AB  - Phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are pivotal transcriptional regulators controlling photomorphogenesis, environmental responses, and development in plants. However, their specific roles in coordinating adaptation towards abiotic stress and metabolism remain underexplored in tea plants. Here, we identified seven PIF members from four distinct clades (PIF1, PIF3, PIF7, and PIF8). Promoter analysis implicated CsPIFs in integrating light, stress, hormone, and circadian signals. Most CsPIFs exhibited rapid increase in expression under shading, especially CsPIF7b/8a, which displayed significant changes in long-term shading condition. Under drought/salt stress, CsPIF3b emerged as a potential positive regulator. CsPIF3a was induced by low temperature and co-expressed with CsCBF1/3 and CsDREB2A cold response factors. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that act as negative regulator of the CBF pathway. Expression profiling across 11 tea cultivars associated specific CsPIFs with chlorophyll biosynthesis and accumulation of anthocyanins, flavonols, and other metabolites. In summary, this study highlights the significance of CsPIFs as central coordinators in managing intricate transcriptional reactions to simultaneous abiotic stresses and metabolic adjustments in tea plants. This insight informs future strategies for enhancing this economically crucial crop through crop improvement initiatives.

AB  - In this study, a hygro-elastic finite element framework, along with a strain-energy-density based bone remodeling framework, was developed and used to simulate the swelling of co-polymeric bone anchors to investigate their hygro-mechanical response. To validate the numerical results, free swelling and in vivo experiments were conducted as well. The free swelling experiments were conducted on co-polymeric porous bone anchors (composed of cross-linked poly [methyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid]) with two ratios of 80/20 and 90/10 to investigate their swelling characteristics in bovine serum, mimicking in vivo conditions. Subsequently, the swelling of bone anchors was simulated embedded in bone regions with different densities. The radial stresses induced in the interface were extracted to examine the mechanical response of the surrounding bone. According to Wolff's law, such mechanical loads can be regarded by bone mechanotransducers as stimuli for remodeling. The bone remodeling framework evaluated the impact of the radial force induced by the swelling of the bone anchor on the surrounding bone. The radial stress induced by the controlled swelling ratio of 90/10 composition resulted in favorable bone densification in the region of interest (approximately between 17.5% and 54% depending on the density of the region). However, the excessive swelling of 80/20 composition caused radial stresses to go beyond the threshold of 31 MPa, causing overload resorption in the interface (especially in high-density regions, where there was total resorption in the interface) and jeopardizing the success of the bone anchor and osteointegration. It was discovered that the swelling ratio plays an important role in bone remodeling, and that it must be controlled within a certain threshold to ensure bone densification and prevent overload resorption. The results of the in vivo sheep study also confirmed these findings.

AB  - Simple Summary A high nutritional plane before and during breeding may improve reproductive performance of hair sheep fed low quality forage. Supplementation of Dorper, Katahdin, and St. Croix sheep consuming wheat straw ad libitum with soybean meal at 0.16% body weight (BW) or a mixture of 25% soybean meal and 75% ground corn at 0.8% BW (dry matter basis) for 8 weeks before and in the early breeding period caused differences in BW, body condition score, and body composition. Supplementation with soybean meal alone increased wheat straw intake, resulting in similar total feed intake relative to BW. Reproductive performance was not affected by supplement treatment, which may be attributable to the moderate body condition score (3 to 3.5 on a 5-point scale) before breeding and the difference in wheat straw intake. Also, some results indicate that body mass indexes can be better predictors of change of body composition compared with body condition score. This study was conducted to assess effects of the nutritional plane before and during breeding on feed intake, body weight (BW) change, reproductive performance, body condition score (BCS), body mass indexes (BMI), and body composition of three breeds of hair sheep. Twenty-five Dorper, 27 Katahdin, and 33 St. Croix ewes were allocated to groups and treatments based on initial BW and age. Supplementation treatments were soybean meal fed at 0.16% BW (LS) and a mixture of 25% soybean meal and 75% ground corn given at 0.8% BW (HS; dry matter basis) for 88 to 102 days including 17 days after breeding. Wheat straw intake (% BW) was greater (p < 0.01) for LS than for HS. Average daily gain and BCS change were similar among breeds, but both were greater for HS vs. LS. Birth rate, litter size, total litter birth weight, gestation length, and number of services were similar among breeds (p > 0.05), although individual lamb birth weight was lower for St. Croix than for Katahdin (p < 0.05). None of these reproductive variables were influenced by treatment or the breed x treatment interaction (p > 0.05). There were no breed differences in whole body concentrations of water, fat, protein, ash, or energy in week 0 or 4, but in 8 week concentrations of water, protein, and ash were greatest among breeds for St. Croix (p < 0.05) and levels of fat and energy were lower for St. Croix than for Dorper (p < 0.05). In week 8, total amounts and concentrations of fat and energy were greater for HS vs. LS and those of water, protein, and ash were less for HS (p < 0.05). There were interactions (p < 0.05) between treatment and period in blood concentrations of cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids and between breed, treatment, and period in level of triglycerides and total antioxidant capacity. The concentration of cortisol was greater for HS vs. LS (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation did not influence reproductive performance despite differences in BW and BCS change, which may be due to the initial moderate BCS and greater wheat straw intake for the LS treatment.

AB  - ABSTR A C T Our previous study demonstrated that acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) remarkably improved the depressive-like behaviors in a rat model of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUS rats). However, the mechanisms by which chronic DBS altered depressive-like behaviors and reversed cognitive impairment have not been clarified. Recent work has shown that deficits in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its downstream proteins, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), might be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Therefore, we hypothesized that the antidepressant-like and cogni-tive improvement effects of DBS were achieved by activating the BDNF/mTOR pathway. CUS rats received vmPFC DBS at 20 Hz for 1 h once a day for 28 days. After four weeks of stimulation, the rats were assessed for the presence of depressive-like behaviors and euthanized to detect BDNF/mTOR signaling using immunoblots. DBS at the vmPFC significantly ameliorated depressive-like behaviors and spatial learning and memory deficits in the CUS rats. Furthermore, DBS restored the reduced synaptic density in the hippocampus induced by CUS and increased the expression or activity of BDNF, Akt, and mTOR in the hippocampus. Thus, the antidepressant-like effects and cognitive improvement produced by vmPFC DBS might be mediated through increased activity of the BDNF/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - Proanthocyanidins (PAs) is a kind of polyphenols widely distributed in plants, and their astringent properties can protect plants from herbivores and regulate fruit taste. There is a great difference in PA composition between astringent (A)-type and nonastringent (NA)-type persimmon. Here, we studied the potential of DkDTX1/MATE1 in regulating PAs composition through its preferred transport in persimmon fruit. The results of fluorescence microscope showed that the DkDTX1/MATE1 green fluorescence overlapped with the blue light emitted by PA. Overexpression of DkDTX1/MATE1 in persimmon leaves not only significantly increase the concentrations of PA, but also upregulated the expression of PA biosynthesis pathway genes. Further overexpression of DkDTX1/MATE1 in persimmon fruit discs and stable genetic transformation of DkDTX1/MATE1 also led to PA concentrations increased. Molecular docking and transporter assays showed that DkDTX1/MATE1 preferentially transported catechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate. DkDTX1/MATE1 mainly bound to the PA precursors via serine at position 68. Our findings indicate that DkDTX1/MATE1 play a role in the accumulation of PAs in early stage of fruit development and affects the astringency of persimmon through preferential transport PA precursors, which provided a theoretical basis for the future use of metabolic engineering to regulate the composition of PAs in persimmon.

AB  - Simple Summary: There is a great interest among the scientific community in breeding animals that emit less methane (CH4) as a strategy to mitigate the environmental impact of ruminants. The present study ranked individual dairy cows as low and high CH4 emitters fed the same diet and evaluated whether the original in vivo ranking was maintained in the in vitro conditions using two contrasting substrates each without or with an antimethanogenic compound. Results do not support a strong effect of rumen microbiome on observed CH4 production in vivo, and thus, ranking was not successfully replicated in in vitro conditions. Instead, it appears that animal-related factors such as digesta passage rate are more important drivers of enteric CH4 production.This study evaluated if ranking dairy cows as low and high CH4 emitters using the GreenFeed system (GF) can be replicated in in vitro conditions using an automated gas system and its possible implications in terms of fermentation balance. Seven pairs of low and high emitters fed the same diet were selected on the basis of residual CH4 production, and rumen fluid taken from each pair incubated separately in the in vitro gas production system. In total, seven in vitro incubations were performed with inoculums taken from low and high CH4 emitting cows incubated in two substrates differing in forage-to-concentrate proportion, each without or with the addition of cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) as an inhibitor of CH4 production. Except for the aimed differences in CH4 production, no statistical differences were detected among groups of low and high emitters either in in vivo animal performance or rumen fermentation profile prior to the in vitro incubations. The effect of in vivo ranking was poorly replicated in in vitro conditions after 48 h of anaerobic fermentation. Instead, the effects of diet and CNSL were more consistent. The inclusion of 50% barley in the diet (SB) increased both asymptotic gas production by 17.3% and predicted in vivo CH4 by 26.2%, when compared to 100% grass silage (S) substrate, respectively. The SB diet produced on average more propionate (+28 mmol/mol) and consequently less acetate compared to the S diet. Irrespective of CH4 emitter group, CNSL decreased predicted in vivo CH4 (26.7 vs. 11.1 mL/ g of dry matter; DM) and stoichiometric CH4 (CH(4)VFA; 304 vs. 235 moles/mol VFA), with these being also reflected in decreased total gas production per unit of volatile fatty acids (VFA). Microbial structure was assessed on rumen fluid sampled prior to in vitro incubation, by sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on operational taxonomic unit (OTU) did not show any differences between groups. Some differences appeared of relative abundance between groups in some specific OTUs mainly related to Prevotella. Genus Methanobrevibacter represented 93.7 & PLUSMN; 3.33% of the archaeal sequences. There were no clear differences between groups in relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter.

AB  - IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health concern with limited treatment options because it causes a cascade of side effects that are the leading cause of hospital death. Thioredoxin is an enzyme with neuroprotective properties such as antioxidant, antiapoptotic, immune response modulator, and neurogenic, among others; it has been considered a therapeutic target for treating many disorders. MethodsThe controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was used to assess the effect of recombinant human thioredoxin 1 (rhTrx1) (1 mu g/2 mu L, intracortical) on rats subjected to TBI at two different times of the light-dark cycle (01:00 and 13:00 h). We analyzed the food intake, body weight loss, motor coordination, pain perception, and histology in specific hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, and Dental Gyrus) and striatum (caudate-putamen) areas. ResultsBody weight loss, reduced food intake, spontaneous pain, motor impairment, and neuronal damage in specific hippocampus and striatum regions are more evident in rats subjected to TBI in the light phase than in the dark phase of the cycle and in groups that did not receive rhTrx1 or minocycline (as positive control). Three days after TBI, there is a recovery in body weight, food intake, motor impairment, and pain, which is more pronounced in the rats subjected to TBI at the dark phase of the cycle and those that received rhTrx1 or minocycline. ConclusionsKnowing the time of day a TBI occurs in connection to the neuroprotective mechanisms of the immune response in diurnal variation and the usage of the Trx1 protein might have a beneficial therapeutic impact in promoting quick recovery after a TBI.

AB  - The African rhinoceros beetle (AfRB), Oryctes monoceros (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is a very destructive coconut pest in Africa and Asia. Proper identification of a target pest is essential for developing integrated pest management strategies. Therefore, we morphologically characterized and compared AfRB populations from Coastal savannah, Transitional, Evergreen, and Deciduous forest agro-ecological zones in Ghana. Linear measurements of 24 morphological traits were selected, measured, and analyzed using t-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, PCA and the UPGMA method. The results showed variations in AfRB males and females, with males consistently larger than females. The AfRBs differed across the agro-ecological zones, with those from the Coastal savannah being the smallest. Beetles from the Transitional zone appeared larger, whereas those from the Deciduous forest were intermediate. Principal component analyses of the males and females from the agro-ecological zones showed overlaps of AfRB populations, with no clear separation. However, dendrogram formed by the UPGMA method using squared Euclidean distance of female AfRB populations showed that the Deciduous and Evergreen samples were similar but distinct from Coastal savannah and Transitional zones. Here we report that three subgroups can be morphologically separated within female AfRB populations in this study: (1) Deciduous and Evergreen, (2) Coastal savannah and (3) those from the Transitional zone. Our findings show that the morphometric variations of AfRB are influenced by the agro-ecological zones, which may effect the fitness parameters and dispersal potential of the pest.

AB  - Planning for the research and development (R&D) of renewable energy resources (RERs) has not received enough attention. This paper aims to study the planning for the R&D of RERs in order to avoid bottlenecks and ensure sustainable development in developing marine economies. We have established a triple difference model (DDD) model and a wise pig game model between the theoretical government and enterprise. The data on RERs come from the World Bank and International Energy Agency databases. We have three contributions on the basis of distinguishing between mature and immature marine RERs technologies. First, it emphasizes the importance of developing R&D planning for marine RERs immature technology in the future. Second, the DDD model is used to empirically establish whether RERs planning has a significant positive impact on RERs' output, which explains the importance of existing RERs planning. Third, the wise pig game model is used to analyze the welfare benefits to the government brought by the R&D planning of marine RERs which proves the importance of future RERs R&D planning.

AB  - Tissue loss of plants caused by herbivores is very common in nature. As the storage and first photosynthetic organ, the loss of cotyledon severely impacts dicot seedling establishment and the subsequent growth. However, it is still not clear how plants adjust their metabolic strategy in response to cotyledon loss. In this study, we employed ICP-OES, GC and LC-MS to examine the effects of cotyledon removal (RC1: remove one cotyledon, RC2: remove two cotyledon) on mineral element distribution and metabolite changes in a traditional Chinese herbal plant, Astragalus membranaceus. The results showed that cotyledon removal had a greater effect on shoot than root growth. Specifically, RC2 revealed a more serious impact on shoot growth than RC1. Microelement Mn and Na in shoot increased more in RC2 than RC1. Macroelement K and microelement B in root increased in RC2. The metabolite results in shoot showed that sugars related to galactose metabolism reduced while amino acids significantly increased in RC2. In root, sugars related to fructose and mannose metabolism decreased in both RC1 and RC2 while most flavonoids increased in RC2. It can be concluded that cotyledon removal triggered different metabolic strategies in both root and shoot. In shoot, more Mn was absorbed to improve the lowered photosynthetic efficiency. Meanwhile, increased Na may have promoted carbohydrate consumption and amino acid synthesis, thereby maintaining shoot growth. In root, K and B participation in cell division and expansion increased, as well as the delivery and metabolism of carbohydrates, to maintain root system growth.

AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of Child Chiqiao Qingre Granules combined with antibiotic management in treating children with acute cough and respiratory infections, this study enrolled 138 pediatric patients from August 2023 to December 2024. Participants were randomly divided into three groups: an antibiotic-only group (n=45), a Child Chiqiao Qingre Granules-only group (n=45), and a combined therapy group (n=48). Written informed consent was obtained from all guardians. Data collection focused on clinical outcomes, including recovery rates, symptom improvement times, and adverse reactions, while comparing the therapeutic effects across groups. The combined therapy group demonstrated the highest recovery rate (P<0.05) and fastest symptom resolution, particularly for fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and loss of appetite (P<0.05). Symptom improvement occurred earlier in the antibiotic-only group compared to the Child Chiqiao Qingre Granules-only group (P<0.05). Antibiotic usage was significantly reduced in the combined therapy group compared to the antibiotic-only group (P<0.05). Adverse reactions were less frequent in the combined therapy group (2.08%) compared to the antibiotic-only group (11.11%), with no severe complications observed. Parental satisfaction was highest in the combined therapy group, with significantly lower dissatisfaction rates compared to other groups (P<0.05). These findings suggest that combining Child Chiqiao Qingre Granules with antibiotics may improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce adverse reactions, and enhance patient satisfaction in managing acute cough and respiratory infections in children.

AB  - Mercury bioaccumulation from deep-ocean prey and the extreme life history strategies of adult female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) provide a unique system to assess the interactive effects of mercury and stress on animal health by quantifying blood biomarkers in relation to mercury (skeletal muscle and blood mercury) and cortisol concentrations. The thyroid hormone thyroxine (tT4) and the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) were associated with mercury and cortisol concentrations interactively, where the magnitude and direction of the association of each biomarker with mercury or cortisol changed depending on the concentration of the other factor. For example, when cortisol concentrations were lowest, tT4 was positively related to muscle mercury, whereas tT4 had a negative relationship with muscle mercury in seals that had the highest cortisol concentrations. Additionally, we observed that two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (tT3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), were negatively (tT3) and positively (rT3) associated with mercury concentrations and cortisol in an additive manner. As an example, tT3 concentrations in late breeding seals at the median cortisol concentration decreased by 14% across the range of observed muscle mercury concentrations. We also observed that immunoglobulin M (IgM), the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (IL 6), and a reproductive hormone, estradiol, were negatively related to muscle mercury concentrations but were not related to cortisol. Specifically, estradiol concentrations in late molting seals decreased by 50% across the range of muscle mercury concentrations. These results indicate important physiological effects of mercury on free-ranging apex marine predators and interactions between mercury bioaccumulation and extrinsic stressors. Deleterious effects on animals' abilities to maintain homeostasis (thyroid hormones), fight off pathogens and disease (innate and adaptive immune system), and successfully reproduce (endocrine system) can have significant individual-and population-level consequences.

AB  - While miRs have been extensively studied in the context of malignancy and tumor progression, their functions in regulating T-cell activation are less clear. In initial studies, we found reduced levels of miR-15a/16 at 3 to 18 h post-T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, suggesting a role for decreased levels of this miR pair in shaping T-cell activation. To further explore this, we developed an inducible miR15a/16 transgenic mouse model to determine how elevating miR-15a/16 levels during early stages of activation would affect T-cell proliferation and to identify TCR signaling pathways regulated by this miR pair. Doxycycline (DOX)-induced expression of miR-15a/ 16 from 0 to 18 h post-TCR stimulation decreased ex vivo T-cell proliferation as well as in vivo antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. We also combined bioinformatics and proteomics approaches to identify the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) (Map2k1) as a target of miR-15a/16. MEK1 targeting by miR-15a/16 was confirmed using miR mimics that decreased Map2k1 mRNA containing the 30-UTR target nucleotide sequence (UGCUGCUA) but did not decrease Map2k1 containing a mutated control sequence (AAAAA AAA). Phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Elk1, was also decreased by DOX-induced miR-15a/16 expression. In addition to MEK1, ERK1 was subsequently found to be targeted by miR-15a/16, with DOX-induced miR15a/16 reducing total ERK1 levels in T cells. These findings show that TCR stimulation reduces miR-15a/16 levels at early stages of T-cell activation to facilitate increased MEK1 and ERK1, which promotes the sustained MEK1-ERK1/2-Elk1 signaling required for optimal proliferation.

AB  - Currently, there are no animal models for studying both specific social fear and social fear with comorbidities. Here, we investigated whether social fear conditioning (SFC), an animal model with face, predictive and construct validity for social anxiety disorder (SAD), leads to the development of comorbidities at a later stage over the course of the disease and how this affects the brain sphingolipid metabolism. SFC altered both the emotional behavior and the brain sphingolipid metabolism in a time-point-dependent manner. While social fear was not accompanied by changes in non-social anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior for at least two to three weeks, a comorbid depressive-like behavior developed five weeks after SFC. These different pathologies were accompanied by different alterations in the brain sphingolipid metabolism. Specific social fear was accompanied by increased activity of ceramidases in the ventral hippocampus and ventral mesencephalon and by small changes in sphingolipid levels in the dorsal hippocampus. Social fear with comorbid depression, however, altered the activity of sphingomyelinases and ceramidases as well as the sphingolipid levels and sphingolipid ratios in most of the investigated brain regions. This suggests that changes in the brain sphingolipid metabolism might be related to the short- and long-term pathophysiology of SAD.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP), a progressive inflammatory disease, poses diagnostic challenges due to its initially asymptomatic nature. While CP's impact on exocrine and endocrine functions is well-recognized, its potential influence on other body systems, particularly in young individuals, remains underexplored. This study investigates the hypothesis that CP in growing pigs leads to alterations in articular cartilage and subchondral bone, potentially contributing to osteoarthritis (OA) development. Utilizing a pig model of cerulein-induced CP, we examined the structural and compositional changes in subchondral bone, articular cartilage, and synovial fluid. Histological analyses, including Picrosirius Red and Safranin-O staining, were employed alongside immuno-histochemistry and Western blotting techniques. Our findings reveal significant changes in the subchondral bone, including reduced bone volume and alterations in collagen fiber composition. Articular cartilage in CP pigs exhibited decreased proteoglycan content and alterations in key proteins such as MMP-13 and TGF-beta 1, indicative of early cartilage degradation. These changes suggest a link between CP and musculoskeletal alterations, underscoring the need for further research into CP's systemic effects. Our study provides foundational insights into the relationship between CP and skeletal health, potentially guiding future pediatric healthcare strategies for early CP diagnosis and management.

AB  - Insects can play an important role to upgrade waste streams into high-grade proteins and fats as food and feed ingredients or non-food products. The aim of this research was to assess the feasibility to use waste streams with a low value for direct application as animal feed as substrates to grow BSF larvae in terms of larval growth rate, waste reduction index, and efficiency of conversion of ingested feed. The growth of black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens larvae and conversion of biowaste was assessed in triplicate in biowaste substrates: chicken feed (CF; reference diet), pig manure solid (PMS), Betafert (R) solid (BTFS), swill (SW), olive pulp (OP), pig manure liquid mixed with chicken feed (PMLCF), and silage grass (SG). Per kilogram fresh substrate 2500 starter (8-days-old, second instar) larvae were incubated in 21 plastic containers (75 x 47 x 15 cm). The BSF larvae were fed according to a batch feeding system. Highest growth rate was found in larvae reared on SW (13.4 mg/d). Larval growth rate was even higher than in larvae reared on the reference substrate CF (7.2 mg/d). Growth rate in larvae reared on PMLCF (7.3 mg/d) did not differ from CF, whereas growth rate of larvae reared on PMS (3.2 mg/d) was lower than on CF. Growth rate of larvae reared on BTFS, OP and SG was very low (0.6, 0.2 and 0.7 mg/d, respectively). Waste Reduction Index (WRI) was highest on SW (11.3), followed by PMLCF (9.3), and both were higher than WRI on CF (8.5). Waste Reduction Index further decreased in descending order from PMS, SG, BTFS to OP (7.6, 4.0, 2.9 and 1.7, respectively). The Efficiency of Conversion of Ingested substrate (ECI) was highest on SW (0.31), followed in descending order by PMLCF, CF and PMS (0.25, 0.21 and 0.18, respectively). The substrates OP, BTFS and SG (0.16, 0.15 and 0.14, respectively) resulted in a lower ECI than other substrates. Highest CO2 and lowest NH3 concentrations were found above substrates with the highest larval growth performances. This study showed that BSF larvae can be reared on different biowaste substrates; the growth rate of the larvae was extremely high on SW. The effects of chemical composition and physical properties of the substrates on larval growth and gas emissions should be further considered.

AB  - Insulin is transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium to regulate aspects of metabolism and cognition. Brain insulin resistance often results from high-fat diet (HFD) consumption and is thought to contribute to spatial cognition deficits. To target BBB insulin function, we used Cre-LoxP genetic excision of the insulin receptor (InsR) from endothelial cells in adult male mice. We hypothesized that this excision would impair spatial cognition, and that high-fat diet consumption would exacerbate these effects. Excision of the endothelial InsR did not impair performance in two spatial cognition tasks, the Y-Maze and Morris Water Maze, in tests held both before and after 14 weeks of access to high-fat (or chow control) diet. The HFD increased body weight gain and induced glucose intolerance but did not impair spatial cognition. Endothelial InsR excision tended to increase body weight and reduce sensitivity to peripheral insulin, but these metabolic effects were not associated with impairments to spatial cognition and did not interact with HFD exposure. Instead, all mice showed intact spatial cognitive performance regardless of whether they had been fed chow or a HFD, and whether the InsR had been excised or not. Overall, the results indicate that loss of the endothelial InsR does not impact spatial cognition, which is in line with pharmacological evidence that other mechanisms at the BBB facilitate insulin transport and allow it to exert its pro-cognitive effects.

AB  - Herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play a crucial role in regulating interactions among multiple species, including triggering defense responses in neighboring plants. In this study, cowpea plants infested with Tetranychus urticae released substantial amounts of HIPVs, particularly methyl salicylate (MeSA). To investigate the impact of exposure to HIPVs at different distances and exposure to single MeSA on plant defense against mites, a series of experiments integrating physiology, biochemistry, behavioral, and chemical analysis were conducted. Exposure of healthy cowpea plants to either HIPVs or single MeSA enhanced their direct defense responses, with effects varying according to distance and dosage. These responses included improved antioxidant enzyme activities and increased phytohormone production. Furthermore, exposure to single MeSA increased the release of volatiles, decreased the survival rate of spider mites on leaves, and reduced leaf damage. Feeding on leaves exposed to HIPVs or single MeSA also influenced detoxification and defense-related enzymatic activities in spider mites. Additionally, plants which exposed to HIPVs or single MeSA chemical attracted predatory mites. These results emphasize the distance-dependent effect of HIPVs and highlight the role of MeSA as an airborne signal that primes direct and indirect defense responses against T. urticae, providing a scientific foundation for the development of eco-friendly pest management strategies based on plant defense responses to manage spider mites.

AB  - A distinctive signature of the prion diseases is the accumulation of the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, in the central nervous system of prion-affected humans and animals. PrPSc is also found in peripheral tissues, raising concerns about the potential transmission of pathogenic prions through human food supplies and posing a significant risk to public health. Although muscle tissues are considered to contain levels of low prion infectivity, it has been shown that myotubes in culture efficiently propagate PrPSc. Given the high consumption of muscle tissue, it is important to understand what factors could influence the establishment of a prion infection in muscle tissue. Here we used in vitro myotube cultures, differentiated from the C2C12 myoblast cell line (dC2C12), to identify factors affecting prion replication. A range of experimental conditions revealed that PrPSc is tightly associated with proteins found in the systemic extracellular matrix, mostly fibronectin (FN). The interaction of PrPSc with FN decreased prion infectivity, as determined by standard scrapie cell assay. Interestingly, the prion-resistant reserve cells in dC2C12 cultures displayed a FN-rich extracellular matrix while the prion-susceptible myotubes expressed FN at a low level. In agreement with the in vitro results, immunohistopathological analyses of tissues from sheep infected with natural scrapie demonstrated a prion susceptibility phenotype linked to an extracellular matrix with undetectable levels of FN. Conversely, PrPSc deposits were not observed in tissues expressing FN. These data indicate that extracellular FN may act as a natural barrier against prion replication and that the extracellular matrix composition may be a crucial feature determining prion tropism in different tissues.

AB  - The late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) witnessed the intensification of climatic gradients with the onset of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age. During this time, high latitudes were characterized by the spread of ice sheets, whereas the palaeotropics hosted the emergence of vast, verdant, coal-forming, swamp forests. Not only were the planet's landscapes transformed through proliferation and diversification of vascular plants, but the evolution of diverse insect groups, including 'primitive' roachoids, reconfigured the terrestrial fauna. Here, we re-examine and describe new roachoid taxa from Moscovian strata of the Benxi Formation. The studied insect material was sourced from early 20th century collections held in the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, and is co-preserved with a broad array of plant fossils-some with evidence of herbivory damage. Our findings introduce Tangshanblatta inexpectata gen. et sp. nov. (Phyloblattidae), Pseudaphtoromylacris paucinervis gen. et sp. nov. (in the family Pseudaphtoromylacridae, fam. nov.), Spilarchimylacris kaipingense sp. nov. (Archimylacridae), and Etomylacris straeleni sp. nov. and Sooblattella ater sp. nov. (both Mylacridae). We establish Pseudaphtoromylacridae on the basis of several new characters that clearly differentiate it from related families. Etomylacris is restored from synonymy with Mylacris. The co-preserved plant fossils reveal a rich palaeovegetation including pteridophytes, 'pteridosperms', sphenophytes, conifers, and arborescent lycophytes. The remains of these plants bear seven distinct damage types belonging to four functional feeding groups: hole feeding, margin feeding, piercing and sucking, and oviposition. This diversity of insects, plants, and herbivory strategies signifies a relatively complex food web in the Carboniferous tropical coal-forming forests of northeast China. This study also demonstrates the value of historical museum collections and the importance of inter-institutional collaboration for piecing together palaeobiodiversity and palaeoecological information from now inaccessible fossil sites.

AB  - One strategy presented as an alternative to avoid using chemical substances in soil disinfestation consists in the technique of biosolarization. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of seasonality on the effectiveness of biosolarization with different organic amendments for the control of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae (FOLAC) on lettuce plants, and to compare the results obtained using a classical soil infectivity bioassay and a qPCR-based molecular technique. None of the plants subjected to biosolarization in the summer season (469-700 and 0-463 h with temperature > 42 & DEG;C at 15 and 30 cm soil depth, respectively) showed damage by the pathogen except the untreated control. Conversely, in autumn (3-5 and 0-0 h at temperature = 38-40 & DEG;C at 15 and 30 cm soil depth, respectively), only two biosolarization treatments (wheat + semi-composted manure, sunflower pellets) that reduced FOLAC inoculum in soil and plants did not show any disease at the lowest depth (15 cm) in the soil infectivity bioassay. This same result was only obtained at 30 cm soil depth in the biosolarization treatment with sunflower pellets. The number of FOLAC sequences per gram of soil determined with qPCR was null in the biosolarization treatments in summer at both soil depths and corresponded to the absence of disease in the soil infectivity bioassay. A threshold of 145 sequences per gram of soil determined by the qPCR-based molecular technique corresponded to the presence of 10% of diseased lettuce plants infected by FOLAC. Therefore, this molecular technique has been shown to be useful for establishing the soil inoculum thresholds required for crop infection by pathogens, while reducing the time and execution tasks necessary to perform soil infectivity bioassays.

AB  - The cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) have diverse molecular functions in neurons, including the regulation of actin polymerization, mRNA translation, and mitochondrial morphology and function. Mutations in the CYFIP2 gene are associated with early-onset epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, while decreases in its protein levels are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, previous research has revealed AD-like phenotypes, such as dendritic spine loss, in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of 12-month-old Cyfip2 heterozygous mice but not of age-matched CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific Cyfip2 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice. This study aims to investigate whether dendritic spine loss in Cyfip2 cKO mice is merely delayed compared to Cyfip2 heterozygous mice, and to explore further neuronal phenotypes regulated by CYFIP2 in aged mice. We characterized dendrite and dendritic protrusion morphologies, along with excitatory/inhibitory synapse densities in CA1 pyramidal neurons of 17-month-old Cyfip2 cKO mice. Overall dendritic branching was normal, with a reduction in the length of basal, not apical, dendrites in CA1 pyramidal neurons of Cyfip2 cKO mice. Furthermore, while dendritic protrusion density remained normal, alterations were observed in the length of mushroom spines and the head volume of stubby spines in basal, not apical, dendrites of Cyfip2 cKO mice. Although excitatory synapse density remained unchanged, inhibitory synapse density increased in apical, not basal, dendrites of Cyfip2 cKO mice. Consequently, a cell-autonomous reduction of CYFIP2 appears insufficient to induce dendritic spine loss in CA1 pyramidal neurons of aged mice. However, CYFIP2 is required to maintain normal dendritic length, dendritic protrusion morphology, and inhibitory synapse density.

AB  - Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) is related to depression. However, the underlying mechanisms and whether HINT1 is a therapeutic target for depression remain unclear. In this study, we report that loganin, an antidepressant candidate from our previous research, directly targets HINT1 to alleviate depressive-like behaviors. Overexpression of HINT1 in the hippocampus induces depressive-like behaviors. Mechanistically, HINT1 hinders sigma-1 receptor (Sigma-1R) binding to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), promotes postsynaptic density protein (PSD95) binding to NMDAR, inhibits brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and impairs synaptic plasticity. The interaction between HINT1 and NMDAR is disturbed by loganin. The antidepressant-like effects of loganin are reversed by HINT1 overexpression, Sigma-1R inhibitor and tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB) inhibitor. These results not only indicate that HINT1 induces depression via impairing synaptic plasticity but also provide a candidate targeting HINT1 for depression therapy.Zhang et al. reported that a natural compound, loganin, improves synaptic plasticity and reduces depressive-like behaviors via its direct target HINT1. Mechanistically, overexpressed HINT1 hinders NMDAR/Sigma-1R interactions and increases NMDAR/PSD95 interactions, and HINT1/NMDAR interactions are disrupted by loganin treatment.

AB  - Ammonia is an important component of PM2.5 and PM10, and is also a major harmful gas in intensive and largescale pig houses, which poses a potential threat to the health of farmers and animals. Intestinal tract is the largest immune organ in the body and is also an important target organ for ammonia exposure. However, the potential toxicity mechanism of ammonia exposure to the intestine remains unclear. L-selenomethionine is an important source of organic selenium with the advantages of high bioavailability, safety and high efficiency. In order to explore the mechanism of ammonia enterotoxicity and the mitigation effect of L-selenomethionine on ammonia enterotoxicity, multi-dimensional ammonia toxicity models and L-selenomethionine intervention models were established in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that ammonia exposure up-regulated the levels of iron, ROS, MDA, and LPO in the small intestinal tissue and the IPEC-J2 cell, down-regulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the content of GSH, inhibited the Nrf2 pathway, significantly altered the expression of ferroptosis (TFR-1, FPN-1, FTH1, SLC7A11, GPX4, ACSL4) and intestine tight junctions (Claudin-1, Occludin, ZO-1) genes. Compared with the ammonia exposure group, L-selenomethionine group could significantly improve the changes of these ferroptosis indicators by affecting ROS and iron levels through Nrf2 pathway. Our results indicated that L-selenomethionine inhibited small intestinal epithelial cells ferroptosis caused by ammonia exposure through regulating ROS-mediated iron metabolism.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of social isolation on mental well-being. This study aims to evaluate the emotional and cerebral consequences of social isolation and assess whether prior environmental enrichment can mitigate the adverse effects. For that purpose, four groups were established: Behaviour group (Beh), n=8, subjected to a 4 % sucrose consumption test and the elevated zero maze (EZM) to assess anhedonia and unconditioned anxiety; Social isolation (SI) + Behaviour group, n=8, subjected to 4 consecutive weeks of social isolation followed by the behavioural testing; Environmental enrichment: EE+SI + Behaviour group, n = 8, subjected to EE prior to SI followed by behavioural assessment; and Basal group (BG), n = 8, used to determine the baseline of cytochrome c-oxidase (CCO). After behavioural testing, brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal and ventral hippocampus (vHIP), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were analysed for CCO activity. Results show that SI serves as a significant stressor, increasing anxiety and anhedonic responses in the SI group. However, pre-exposure to EE significantly reduced these responses. Regarding CCO activity, the SI group exhibited elevated levels across all brain regions compared to the EE+SI group. Moreover, the EE+SI group maintained CCO activity levels similar to those of the Basal group, suggesting that prior EE exposure mitigates the metabolic impact of social isolation across most brain regions, except for the vHIP. These results indicate that pre-exposure to an EE may buffer the adverse effects of SI, supporting enhanced resilience.

AB  - Key message A combined transcriptomic and metabolic analysis of Setaria viridis leaves responding to aphid infestation was used to identify genes related to serotonin biosynthesis. Setaria viridis (green foxtail), a short life-cycle C4 plant in the Poaceae family, is the wild ancestor of Setaria italica (foxtail millet), a resilient crop that provides good yields in dry and marginal land. Although S. viridis has been studied extensively in the last decade, the molecular mechanisms of insect resistance in this species remain under-investigated. To address this issue, we performed a metabolic analysis of S. viridis and discovered that these plants accumulate the tryptophan-derived compounds tryptamine and serotonin. To elucidate the defensive functions of serotonin, Rhophalosiphum padi (bird cherry-oat aphids) were exposed to this compound, either by exogenous application to the plant medium or with artificial diet bioassays. In both cases, exposure to serotonin increased aphid mortality. To identify genes that are involved in serotonin biosynthesis, we conducted a transcriptome analysis and identified several predicted S. viridis tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H) genes. Two candidate genes were ectopically expressed in Nicotiana tabacum, where SvTDC1 (Sevir.6G066200) had tryptophan decarboxylase activity, and SvT5H1 (Sevir.8G219600) had tryptamine hydroxylase activity. Moreover, the function of the SvTDC1 gene was validated using virus-induced gene silencing in S. italica, which caused a reduction in serotonin levels. This study provides the first evidence of serotonin biosynthesis in Setaria leaves. The biosynthesis of serotonin may play an important role in defense responses and could prove to be useful for developing more pest-tolerant Setaria italica cultivars.

AB  - Prokineticin 1 (PROK1) is an important factor in pregnancy establishment in pigs, acting at the embryo-maternal interface and the corpus luteum (CL). Estradiol-17 beta (E2) is the primary pregnancy recognition signal in pigs, and its effects are augmented by luteotropic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). On the contrary, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) exerts mainly a luteolytic effect. The present study aimed to elucidate whether E2, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha regulate the expression of PROK1 and its receptors in the porcine CL and to determine the PROK1 effect on luteal endothelial cells and pathways that may be involved in this regulation. The effects of E2, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha on the expressions of PROK1 and its receptors in the CL were studied using an in vitro model of ultrathin luteal tissue explants model. Additionally, the effects of E2 and PGE2 on the PROK1 system were determined using an in vivo approach, in which the hormones were administered into the uterine lumen to imitate their secretion by embryos. Endothelial cell proliferation was measured using the colorimetric method. E2 acting via estrogen receptors simulated the mRNA and protein expressions of PROK1 and PROKR1 in CL explants in vitro (p < 0.05). The simultaneous action of E2 with PGE2 enhanced the expression of luteal PROK1 mRNA in vitro (p < 0.05). Estradiol-17 beta acting alone significantly increased PROK1 mRNA levels in vivo, whereas E2 simultaneously administered with PGE2 significantly elevated the PROK1 mRNA expression and PROKR1 mRNA and protein contents in CLs adjacent to uterine horns receiving hormonal infusion compared with CLs adjacent to placebotreated uterine horns (p < 0.01). The PROK1 protein expression was significantly higher in the CLs of pigs treated with E2, PGE2, and E2 together with PGE2 than in the control group. PGF2 alpha increased the PROK1 mRNA content in CLs on days 12 and 14 of the estrous cycle (p < 0.05). The expression of PROKR2 at the mRNA and protein levels remained unchanged in response to in vitro and in vivo treatments. PROK1 stimulated the proliferation of luteal endothelial cells by activating the MAPK, AKT, and mTOR pathways (p < 0.05). In summary, the luteal expressions of PROK1 and PROKR1 in early pregnancy are regulated by E2 and PGE2. PROK1 stimulates luteal angiogenesis by activating the MAPK, AKT, and mTOR pathways. The regulation of luteal PROK1 expression by PGF2 alpha indicates PROK1's putative role during luteolysis. We conclude that PROK1-PROKR1 signaling supports luteal function during CL rescue in pregnancy in pigs.

AB  - The livestock sector plays an essential role in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, where fodder crop production has been largely identified as the main contributor to their environmental impact. This research evaluates the attributional environmental impacts of introducing food industry subproducts such as apple and olive pomaces to reduce the proportion of maize grain in the formulation of diets for fattening pigs, according to four alternatives, including the current diet with 69% maize. For this, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been used to determine the hotspots associated to these changes, considering a cradle-to-gate approach and two functional units: 1 kg of feed diet (FU1) and 1 kg of weight gain (FU2). Furthermore, the potential environmental consequences of using these subproducts for pig diet have also been considered with a consequential LCA methodology. The results show that the best diet was the one containing about 33% maize and 43% subproducts for all categories analysed. In addition, the allocation method used to assign subproduct loads, including mass, economic, and zeroburdens allocation, is crucial to validate the assumptions and recommendations for this strategy. The consequential LCA results suggest that this strategy could involve both positive and negative impacts (considered as environmental credits), depending on the substitutes for the avoided maize stover and the potential displaced bioproducts that could be obtained from these subproducts, mainly for bioenergy production.

AB  - The mechanical forces experienced during movement and the time constants of muscle activation are important determinants of the durations of behaviours, which may both be affected by sizedependent scaling. The mechanics of slow movements in small animals are dominated by elastic forces and are thus quasistatic (i.e. always near mechanical equilibrium). Muscular forces producing movement and elastic forces resisting movement should scale identically (proportional to mass2/3), leaving the scaling of the time constant of muscle activation to play a critical role in determining behavioural duration. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the duration of feeding behaviours in the marine mollusc Aplysia californica whose body sizes spanned three orders of magnitude. The duration of muscle activation was determined by measuring the time it took for muscles to produce maximum force as A. californica attempted to feed on tethered inedible seaweed, which provided an in vivo approximation of an isometric contraction. The timing of muscle activation scaled with mass0.3. The total duration of biting behaviours scaled identically, with mass0.3, indicating a lack of additional mechanical effects. The duration of swallowing behaviour, however, exhibited a shallower scaling of mass0.17. We suggest that this was due to the allometric growth of the anterior retractor muscle during development, as measured by microConsequently, larger A. californica did not need to activate their muscles as fully to produce equivalent forces. These results indicate that muscle activation may be an important determinant of the scaling of behavioural durations in quasistatic systems.

AB  - The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), native to the Americas, was confirmed in West and Central Africa in 2016 and reported in almost all countries of sub-Saharan Africa in 2017, becoming thereafter one of the major constraints on the production of maize, the main staple food crop in the region. Cereals depend on silicon (Si)-based defences to fight off herbivores. Both FAW strains, namely rice and corn strains, have been found to be present in Kenya. The present study tested the influence of Si on larval survival and relative growth rate according to the FAW strain, using potted maize plants treated with 10 and 20 g of Si. The results showed that plants treated with Si disturbed the larval growth of FAW larvae only from the corn strain but not from the rice strain. Overall, the corn strain performed better on maize as compared to the rice strain regardless of Si treatment, explaining why it has become the most abundant strain in Africa.

AB  - As the world's largest livestock producer, China faces pressing challenges in recycling manure to minimize resource waste and environmental degradation resulting from the vast amounts of manure generated. Understanding the drivering forces behind manure recycling is essential for advancing sustainable agriculture in China. This study estimated the manure recycling ratio (MRR), measured by nitrogen content, across 2853 Chinese counties using data from 390,000 farms representing four major livestock farming types in 2017. Northern Chinese counties demonstrated significantly higher MRRs, with values exceeding 50 %, compared to Southern regions, with values being lower than 30 %. Higher MRRs were linked to larger cropland size, higher urbanization levels, and a greater proportion of chicken farming. In contrast, MRRs declined in regions with higher temperatures, increased precipitation, higher manure production per livestock unit, a greater emphasis on pig farming, and an ageing rural population. Notably, natural factors such as temperature and precipitation predominantly influenced MRRs in both Southern and Northern China, whereas socioeconomic factors like cropland size and urbanization were more impactful in Eastern and Southwestern regions. These findings highlight the need for region-specific strategies that account for natural and socioeconomic conditions to enhance manure recycling practices across China.

AB  - There is a complex interplay of biochemical interactions which determine the host plant reaction to herbivory. We studied the Chilo partellus-induced biochemical plant defense system in sorghum. Present studies found that the total protein, starch and total sugar contents were significantly lower, while antioxidant enzymes like ascorbate oxidase (AO), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), phenyl ammonia lyase (PAL), tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), and nonenzymatic antioxidants such as total phenols, total antioxidants and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) higher in the seedlings of all the test sorghum genotypes as compared to susceptible genotype, Swarna both under healthy and C. partellus damaged conditions. Further, the C. partellus damage resulted in significant increase in amounts of all the test constitutional, enzymatic and nonenzymatic biochemicals in the test genotypes, however their percent increase was highly variable across genotypes. These studies demonstrate that both constitutive and C. partellus damage induced enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants like APX, AO, PAL, TAL, CAT, total phenols and FRAP were significantly greater in IS 2205, IS 18,551, ICSV 1, ICSV 700 and ICSV 93,046 than in susceptible check (Swarna) indicating their role in plant defense. Furthermore, these genotypes can be used in sorghum breeding for resistance against C. partellus.

AB  - The quality of in vitro matured oocytes is inferior to that of in vivo matured oocytes, which translates to low developmental capacity of embryos derived from in vitro matured oocytes. The developmental potential of in vitro matured oocytes is usually impaired due to oxidative stress. Stromal cell-derived factor-l (SDF1) can reduce oxidative stress and inhibit apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SDF1 supplementation during pig oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) on subsequent embryo development, and to explore the acting mechanisms of SDF1 in pig oocytes. We found that the IVM medium containing 20 ng/mL SDF1 improved the maturation rate of pig oocytes, as well as the cleavage rate and blastocyst rate of embryos generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilization, and parthenogenesis. Supplementation of 20 ng/mL SDF1 during IVM decreased the ROS level, increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and altered the expression of apoptosis-related genes in the pig oocytes. The porcine oocyte transcriptomic data showed that SDF1 addition during IVM altered the expression of genes enriched in the purine metabolism and TNF signaling pathways. SDF1 supplementation during pig oocyte IVM also upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of YY1 and TET1, two critical factors for oocyte development. In conclusion, supplementation of SDF1 during pig oocyte IVM reduces oxidative stress, changes expression of genes involved in regulating apoptosis and oocyte growth, and enhances the ability of in vitro matured pig oocytes to support subsequent embryo development. Our findings provide a theoretical basis and a new method for improving the developmental potential of pig in vitro matured oocytes.

AB  - Stress can increase ethanol drinking, and evidence confirms an association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Exposure to predator odor is considered a traumatic stressor, and predator stress (PS) has been used extensively as an animal model of PTSD. Our prior work determined that repeated exposure to intermittent PS significantly increased anxiety-related behavior, corticosterone levels, and neuronal activation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in naive male and female C57BL/6J mice. Intermittent PS exposure also increased subsequent ethanol drinking in a subgroup of animals, with heterogeneity of responses as seen with comorbid PTSD and AUD. The present studies built upon this prior work and began to characterize "sensitivity" and "resilience" to PS-enhanced drinking. Ethanol drinking was measured during baseline, intermittent PS exposure, and post-stress; mice were euthanized after 24-h abstinence. Calculation of median and interquartile ranges identified "sensitive" (>20% increase in drinking over baseline) and "resilient" (no change or decrease in drinking from baseline) subgroups. Intermittent PS significantly increased subsequent ethanol intake in 24% of male (up arrow 60%) and in 20% of female (up arrow 71%) C57BL/6J mice in the "sensitive" subgroup. Plasma corticosterone levels were increased significantly after PS in both sexes, but levels were lower in the "sensitive" vs. "resilient" subgroups. In representative mice from "sensitive" and "resilient" subgroups, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were analyzed by Western Blotting for levels of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor 1, CRF receptor 2, CRF binding protein, and glucocorticoid receptor, vs. separate naive age-matched mice. In prefrontal cortex, CRF receptor 1, CRF receptor 2, CRF binding protein, and glucocorticoid receptor levels were significantly higher in "sensitive" vs. naive and "resilient" mice only in females. In hippocampus, CRF receptor 1, CRF receptor 2 and glucocorticoid receptor levels were significantly lower in "resilient" vs. naive and "sensitive" mice across both sexes. These results indicate that sex strongly influences the effects of ethanol drinking and stress on proteins regulating stress and anxiety responses. They further suggest that targeting the CRF system and glucocorticoid receptors in AUD needs to consider the comorbidity of PTSD with AUD and sex of treated individuals.

AB  - Alkaline stress is a major concern in aquaculture that badly affects the aquatic species' health and hemostasis. This research investigated the effect of carbonate alkalinity exposure on the gills and kidney organs as important organs for hemostasis, as well as the ameliorative role of camel protein hydrolysates (CPH) as dietary additives against alkaline stress detrimental impacts in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The fish (n = 160) were divided into four groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4), with the control (G1) fed a basal diet, while G2 was fed a basal diet supplemented with 75 g CPH/kg and was reared in freshwater (carbonate alkalinity of 1.4 mu mol/L, pH = 7.19). The G3 and G4 were reared in alkaline water (carbonate alkalinity of 23.8 mu mol/L, pH = 8.65) and fed the same diets as G1 and G2 for 30 days, respectively. The fish were stocked under a water temperature of 26.4 +/- 1.5 degrees C, and the diets were introduced to the fish three times daily at a rate of 4% of their body weight. The results of this research showed that alkaline exposure increased kidney function parameters (creatinine, urea, and uric acid), glucose, and cortisol levels in the exposed fish. Alkaline exposure reduced the blood electrolytes level (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride) and branchial antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione) and elevated malondialdehyde level in the exposed fish. Significant downregulation of the branchial expression of Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-3 subunit (0.17-fold), calcium/calmodulin-dependant protein kinase 1 beta (0.23 fold), chloride channel protein 2 (0.38-fold), solute carrier family 12 a 2 (0.33-fold), and solute carrier family 4 a 4 (0.21-fold) was in the fish-reared under carbonate alkalinity stress. Alkaline exposure induced severe histopathological changes in the gills and kidney tissue architecture including inflammatory, circulatory, degenerative, and progressive responses. Supplementation of the Nile tilapia diet with 75 g CPH/kg ameliorated renal function and balanced the blood electrolytes, glucose, and cortisol levels in the alkaline-exposed fish. Modulation of the branchial gene expression profile and improving the gills and kidney microstructure were consequences of feeding on CPH diets during alkaline stress situations. Overall, fortifying the Nile tilapia diets with 75 g CPH/kg helps the fish restore their hemostasis and metabolic status during alkaline stress exposure which enables the sustainable culture of this species in such conditions.

AB  - BackgroundMorin is a flavonoid found in many edible fruits. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex play crucial roles in memory formation and consolidation. This study aimed to characterize the effect of morin on recognition and space memory in healthy C57BL/6 adult mice and explore the underlying molecular mechanism.MethodsMorin was administered i.p. at 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/24 h for 10 days. The Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition, novel context recognition, and tasks were conducted 1 day after the last administration. The mice's brains underwent histological characterization, and their protein expression was examined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques.ResultsIn the MWM and novel object recognition tests, mice treated with 1 mg/kg of morin exhibited a significant recognition index increase compared to the control group. Besides, they demonstrated faster memory acquisition during MWM training. Additionally, the expression of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), BDNF, and postsynaptic density protein 95 proteins in the hippocampus of treated mice showed a significant increase. In the entorhinal cortex, only the pro-BDNF increased. Morin-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in the hippocampus's number and length of dendrites.ConclusionThis study shows that morin improves recognition memory and spatial memory in healthy adult mice.
   Morin improves recognition and spatial memory in healthy adult mice. We suggest that the molecular mechanism for these effects involves the increased production and BDNF secretion by astrocytes. image

AB  - Sex steroid hormones such as 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) are critical neuromodulators of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory in both males and females. However, the mechanisms through which E-2 regulates memory formation in both sexes remain unclear. Research to date suggests that E-2 regulates hippocampus-dependent memory by activating numerous cell-signaling cascades to promote the synthesis of proteins that support structural changes at hippocampal synapses. However, this work has largely overlooked the equally important contributions of protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in remodeling the synapse. Despite being critically implicated in synaptic plasticity and successful formation of long-term memories, it remains unclear whether protein degradation mediated by the UPS is necessary for E-2 to exert its beneficial effects on hippocampal plasticity and memory formation. The present article provides an overview of the receptor and signaling mechanisms so far identified as critical for regulating hippocampal E-2 and UPS function in males and females, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which these mechanisms overlap to support structural integrity and protein composition of hippocampal synapses. We argue that the high degree of correspondence between E-2 and UPS activity warrants additional study to examine the contributions of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in regulating the effects of sex steroid hormones on cognition.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of nitrogen form on root activity and nitrogen uptake kinetics of Camellia oleifera Abel. seedlings, providing a scientific basis for improving nitrogen use efficiency and scientific fertilization in C. oleifera production. Taking one-year-old C. oleifera cultivar "Xianglin 27' seedlings as subjects, 8 mmolmiddotL(-1) of nitrogen in varied forms (NO3-:NH4+ = 0:0, 10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 0:10) was applied in this study as the treatment conditions to investigate the effects of different nitrogen forms on root activity and nitrogen uptake kinetics in C. oleifera seedlings. Com-paring the performance of nutrient solutions with different NO3-:NH4+ ratios, the results showed that a mixed nitrogen source improved the root activity of C. oleifera seedlings based on total ab-sorption area, active absorption area, active absorption area ratio, specific surface area, and active specific surface area. When NO3-:NH4+ = 5:5, the total absorption area and active absorption area of the seedling roots reached the maximum. The results of uptake kinetic parameters showed that Vmax NH4+ > Vmax NO3- and Km NO3- > Km NH4+, indicating that the uptake potential of ammonium-nitrogen by C. oleifera seedlings is greater than that of nitrate-nitrogen. The conclusion was that compared to either ammonium- or nitrate-nitrogen, the mixed nitrogen source was better for promoting the root activity of C. oleifera seedlings, and the best nitrate/ammonium ratio was 5:5.

AB  - Due to the human population explosion, demand for food, especially meat, has also increased. Increasing mutton production, in this scenario, is one way to mitigate this emerging issue as it nourishes a large human population. However, its production is challenging due to high feeding costs. This study was executed to develop cost-effective feed for mutton goat production by adding dried citrus pulp to the total mixed ration. Citrus pulp was used as an energy source instead of corn grain. A total of 12 bucks were divided into 4 groups, each having 3 animals. After 21 days of adaptation, bucks were assigned to experimental groups. The experimental groups were designated as A, B, C and D. They were fed TMR with 0, 10, 15 and 20% dried citrus pulp, respectively, as a replacement for corn grain for 90 days. The effect of the dried citrus pulp inclusion on the bucks' growth performance such as feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio was evaluated on weekly basis. Hematological and biochemical parameters including total protein, triglycerides, cholesterol, complete blood count and serum antioxidant (catalase) activity were also determined. Results indicated that all hematological and biochemical parameters showed non-significant differences among the control and treatment groups. Weekly weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were equal in corn based as well as in dried citrus pulp-based diet with a lower feeding cost for the latter. It is concluded that the use of dried citrus pulp up to 20% as a replacement of corn in ration of fattening bucks is economical to use without any adverse effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects several elderly people per years. AD is a pathology of multifactorial etiology, resulting from multiple environmental and genetic determinants. However, there is no effective pharmacological alternative for the treatment of this illness. In this sense, the purpose of current study was to characterize the mechanisms by which A beta 1-42 injection via intracerebroventricular induces neurobehavioral changes in a time-course curve. In addition, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) was used to investigate the involvement of epigenetic modifications A beta 1-42-caused in aged female mice. In general manner, A beta 1-42 injection induced a major neurochemical disturbance in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals and a serious impairment of memory. Overall, SAHA treatment attenuated neurobehavioral changes caused by A beta 1-42 injection in aged female mice. The subchronic effects presented of SAHA were through modulation of HDAC activity, regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and expression of BDNF mRNA, accompanied by unlocking cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of animals.

AB  - Ozone pollution has been associated with several adverse effects, including memory impairment, intellectual retardation, emotional disturbances. However, the potential mechanisms remain uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate whether ozone (O3) regulates synaptic plasticity through PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway and induces neurobehavioral modifications among the young rats. In vivo, the newborn rats were used to construct the animal model of early postnatal O3 treatment. In vitro, this study measured the effect of different concentrations of serum from O3 treated rats on the viability of the PC12 cells, and investigated the modifications of synaptic plasticity and PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway in the hippocampus and PC12 cells after O3 treated. The results revealed significant depression-like behavior and increased hippocampal histopathological damage in the young rats after O3 treated. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of synaptic related proteins including Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin and PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3 beta were decreased in the O3 treated group. In vitro assays, a significant reduction in Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3 beta was found in PC12 cells after O3 serum treated. While 740Y-P (a specific PI3K activator) admin-istered, the expression levels of Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3 beta in the 740Y-P + O3 group were significantly elevated in vivo and vitro compared with the O3-only group. In addition, miRNAs modulating PIK3R1 were screened on bioinformatics website, the study found aberrant expression of miR-221-3p in the hippocampus and serum of O3 treated group. Inhibition of miR-221-3p expression effectively reversed the reduction of Drebrin, PSD95, Synaptophysin, PIK3R1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3 beta in PC12 cells induced by O3 treatment. Altogether, these studies indicate that O3 restrained the expression of PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway and impaired synaptic plasticity that resulted in depressive-like behavior in young rats. Moreover, miR-221-3p plays an important role in this procedure by regulating PIK3R1.

AB  - This study aimed to promote the use of natural lighting in building designs to create a good lighting environment and to save energy. Dynamic daylight evaluation and analysis have become hot research topics due to the influence of outdoor light climate changes that occur throughout the season and over a period of time. However, there are certain gaps in the application of dynamic daylight evaluation for large-space buildings. In China, static daylight evaluation is mainly used to assess the actual daylighting performance of buildings. The Hangzhou E-sports Center in China was selected as the study object in this research, and dynamic daylight simulations were conducted using Rhino + Grasshopper and Ladybug + Honeybee for different representative days in each season and in each measurement zone. Spatial daylight autonomy (sDA) and useful daylight illuminance (UDI) were used as the dynamic daylight evaluation indicators, and a parameterized dynamic daylight evaluation method was proposed for evaluating the design scheme. By comparing the initial and optimized design schemes, the results showed the following: (1) the optimized scheme increased the ratio of area and time within the UDI 100-2000 lux range, and areas with an sDA >300 lux accounted for over 55% of the primary use areas, indicating a significant improvement in the daylighting quality of the large space; (2) the daylighting quality of the large space building showed seasonal changes, with the best daylighting quality occurring during the summer solstice and the worst occurring on the winter solstice, while the daylighting quality was similar during the spring and autumn equinoxes; (3) the dynamic evaluation metrics facilitated the identification of daylighting issues in large-scale buildings more effectively; (4) the parameterized method proposed in this study can solve the cumbersome process of daylight simulation and is more conducive to the adjustment and optimization of design schemes by designers. The parameterized dynamic daylight evaluation method proposed in this study provides references and ideas for the design and research of daylighting in other large-space buildings.

AB  - The occurrence of tail biting is one of the most important animal welfare problems in pig farming and needs to be recognised early to reduce injuries and suffering. The posture of the tail could be used as an indicator to detect tail biting at an early stage. This study analysed the relationship between tail posture and tail lesions in two different trials within the rearing period of piglets. The aim was to determine whether the tail posture should be recorded at animal or pen level to serve as a reliable early indicator of tail biting. The study used data from 368 (Trial 1) and 480 (Trial 2) pigs that were scored twice a week (11 and 12 scores) within the 40 days of rearing whereby tail posture (lifted or lowered) and tail lesions (lesions or no lesions) were observed. For analysis, a random regression model was used to determine random animal and pen effects on each score for tail posture and tail lesions. Data was analysed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (R) software. The correlation between tail posture and tail lesions for each score was determined using the random animal and pen effects. Results revealed correlations between tail posture on ScoreX and tail lesions on the successive Score+ 1 (3-4 days between the scores) which showed an increase in Trial 1 from the second to the tenth score at animal (0.32-0.44) and pen level (0.61-0.82). In Trial 2, the correlations ranged from 0.26 to 0.52 at animal and from 0.65 to 0.70 at pen level. The highest correlations (>0.9) were achieved in Trial 2 between scores five and nine. Between tail posture on ScoreX and tail lesions on Score+ 2 (7 days between the scores), the correlations showed a similar development and level as the correlations between ScoreX and Score+ 1. In general, this study identified a relationship between a lowered tail posture and the presence of tail lesions. In addition, this relationship was present a week before the first appearance of tail lesions with stronger correlations at pen than at animal level in both trials. Hence, the farmer should observe the tail posture of animals at pen level during daily inspection in order to intervene early by using appropriate measures against tail biting.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the cause of death in approximate to 50% of hemodialysis patients. Accumulation of uremic solutes in systemic circulation is thought to be a key driver of the endothelial dysfunction that underlies elevated cardiovascular events. A challenge in understanding the mechanisms relating chronic kidney disease to cardiovascular disease is the lack of in vitro models that allow screening of the effects of the uremic environment on the endothelium. Here, a method is described for microfabrication of human blood vessels from donor cells and perfused with donor serum. The resulting donor-derived microvessels are used to quantify vascular permeability, a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction, in response to serum spiked with pathophysiological levels of indoxyl sulfate, and in response to serum from patients with chronic kidney disease and from uremic pigs. The uremic environment has pronounced effects on microvascular integrity as demonstrated by irregular cell-cell junctions and increased permeability in comparison to cell culture media and healthy serum. Moreover, the engineered microvessels demonstrate an increase in sensitivity compared to traditional 2D assays. Thus, the devices and the methods presented here have the potential to be utilized to risk stratify and to direct personalized treatments for patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Plants respond to adverse conditions by activating defense mechanisms that alter metabolism and impact agricultural crop yield. Organic mulching of Camellia oleifera leads to increased oil yield compared to control. In this study, multi-platform untargeted metabolomics and qRT-PCR were used to measure the effects of organic mulching on seed kernel metabolism. Metabolomics analysis revealed that tyrosine, tryptophan, and several fla-vonoids and polyphenol metabolites were significantly lower in the mulched treatment compared to the control, indicating lower stress levels with mulching. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that EAR, SAD, and CoHCD were up regulated by mulching, while CT, FAD7, FAD8, CoATS1, SQS, SQE, FATB, and beta-AS were down-regulated. Correlation network analysis was used to integrate data from this multi-omics investigation to analyze the relationships between differentially expressed genes, metabolites, and fruit and soil indicators concerning mulch treatment of C. oleifera.

AB  - In response to disease outbreaks or other urgent circumstances, an increasing number of farm animals in the United States (US) are being killed en masse by depopulation. In the past few years, depopulation methods that rely on heatstroke as the mechanism of killing have been used with increasing frequency to kill birds and pigs raised for food production. While they are defended as expedient and faster to implement, heatstroke-based methods severely compromise animal welfare and there is a prolonged period prior to the animals losing consciousness. The US veterinary profession is entrusted with an ethical responsibility to protect and advance animal welfare, yet its classification of the heatstroke-based depopulation method Ventilation Shutdown Plus is used to justify this method's widespread use. Numerous strategies are suggested for how the US veterinary profession, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, can encourage the use of more humane methods when depopulations are performed.
   Depopulation of food-producing animals is becoming increasingly common in response to both disease outbreaks and supply chain disruptions. In 2019, the American Veterinary Medical Association released depopulation guidelines classifying certain heatstroke-based killing methods as "permitted in constrained circumstances", when circumstances of the emergency constrain reasonable implementation of "preferred" methods. Since then, tens of millions of birds and pigs have been killed by such methods, termed ventilation shutdown (VSD) Plus Heat and VSD Plus High Temperature and Humidity. While no research using validated measures of animal welfare assessment has been performed on these methods, their pathophysiology suggests that animals are likely to experience pain, anxiety, nausea, and heat distress prior to loss of consciousness. Heatstroke-based methods may result in prolonged suffering and often do not achieve 100% mortality. Potential and available alternative depopulation methods are briefly reviewed. The veterinary profession's ethical obligation to protect animal welfare in the context of depopulations is discussed.

AB  - To improve the efficiency of prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PG)-based estrus synchronization in sheep, this study assessed the effect of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) included in the long-interval PG treatment regimen for sheep estrus synchronization during the breeding season. In experiment 1, 30 multiparous Mongolian sheep (3-4.5 years old) were randomly divided into three groups. In the progesterone (P4)-equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) group (P4-eCG, n = 10), the ewes were synchronized with intravaginal P4 sponges for 14 days, and received an injection of 330 IU of eCG at sponge withdrawal. In the PG group (n = 10), the ewes received two doses of 0.1 mg PG with a 14 day interval. In the PG-GnRH-PG group (n = 10), the ewes were synchronized by two doses of 0.1 mg PG with a 14 day interval like that in the PG group, but received 50 mu g of GnRH 7 days after the first injection of PG. It was found that, at the end of treatment, the number of corpus luteum on the ovaries and the concentration of the serum P4 in the PG-GnRH-PG group were significantly higher than that of the PG and P4-eCG groups. In experiment 2, 59 multiparous Mongolian sheep (3-4.5 years old) were assigned to three groups, like in experiment 1 (n = 20, 20 and 19 for the P4-eCG, PG and PG-GnRH-PG groups, respectively). The estrus of ewes in the PG-GnRH-PG group was more synchronous compared to the PG group. After insemination of the estrus ewes, the pregnancy rate was numerically but not significantly higher in the PG-GnRH-PG group than that in the P4-eCG and the PG groups. In a field test, 285 multiparous Hu sheep (3-4.5 years old) were randomly assigned to a P4-eCG group (n = 142) and PG-GnRH-PG group (n = 143). Timed artificial insemination showed no significant differences in the rates of pregnancy and lambing between the PG-GnRH-PG and P4-eCG groups. We conclude that the addition of GnRH in the long-interval PG protocol may improve the efficiency of PG-based estrus synchronization, and would represent a potential alternative to the conventional P4-eCG based protocol during the breeding season in sheep.

AB  - Placental dysfunction is considered as one of the main etiologies of fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to be a vital epigenetic modification involved in regulating the placental function and pregnancy outcomes in mammals. However, the mechanisms underlying placenta-specific miRNAs involved in the occurrence and development of pig IUGR remain unclear. In this work, we compared the placental morphologies of piglets with IUGR and normal birth weight (NBW) by using histomorphological analysis and performed a miRNA-mRNA integrative analysis of the gene expression profiles of IUGR and NBW placentas through RNA sequencing. We also investigated the role of differentially expressed ssc-miR-339-5p/ GRIK3 through an in vitro experiment on porcine trophoblast cells (PTr2). IUGR piglets had significantly lower birth weight, placental weight, placental efficiency, and placental villus and capillary densities compared with the NBW piglets (P < 0.05). A total of 81 differentially expressed miRNAs and 726 differentially expressed genes in the placentas were screened out between the IUGR and NBW groups. The miRNA-mRNA interaction networks revealed the key core miRNA (ssc-miR-339-5p) and its corresponding target genes. Subsequently, we found that upregulation of ssc-miR-339-5p significantly inhibited the migration and proliferation of PTr2 cells (P < 0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter system showed that GRIK3 was the target gene of ssc-miR-339-5p, and the transcription level of GRIK3 may be negatively regulated by ssc-miR-339-5p. Additionally, overexpression of sscmiR-339-5p significantly increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. These results indicate that ssc-miR-339-5p may affect the migration and proliferation of trophoblast cells by regulating the expression of GRIK3 and altering the placental inflammatory response, resulting in a suboptimal morphology and function of the placenta and the development of pig IUGR.

AB  - Composting is a sustainable way to manage organic solid waste. This study evaluated the use of solar energy to increase the temperature in compost bins during the composting process of urban organic waste under high Andean conditions. Eight compost bins of 0.098 m(3) each were installed: four with solar heating using flat HDPE collectors (& Oslash;=3/4") and water as the heat transfer fluid, and four without solar heating. The experimental period was 45 days for the solar-heated bins and 60 days for the non-solar-heated bins. Each bin contained 52.5 kg of organic waste, 2.5 kg of sheep manure, and 100 mL of effective microorganisms. The pH, humidity, and temperature of the composting process were monitored, along with the ambient temperature, the temperature of the heat transfer fluid, and the greenhouse temperature using Arduino sensors. Organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, C/N ratio, and electrical conductivity of the produced compost were evaluated. The solar-heated compost bins reached compost maturity in 45 days, while the non-solar-heated bins did so in 60 days, with similar characteristics in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The greenhouse covered with 180-micron agrofilm maintained the compost at an average temperature of 28.9 degrees C during the 45 days, compared to an average ambient temperature of 5.2 degrees C. The solar collectors provided heat to the system, reaching temperatures of up to 39.83 degrees C and heat gains of 86.5 cal. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using solar energy for compost production in high Andean conditions.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) during the in vitro culture of isolated caprine early antral follicles. The isolated and selected early antral follicles were individually cultured for 18 days, and the following treatments were tested: & alpha;-MEM+ (control treatment) or & alpha;-MEM+ supplemented with 200 ng/mL GDF-9. The following endpoints were evaluated: follicular growth and morphology, estradiol production, oocyte nuclear maturation, and relative expression of key genes related to steroidogenesis (CYP19A1, CYP17, and insulin receptor) and basement membrane remodeling (MMP-9 and TIMP-2). In both treatments, a decrease was observed in the percentage of morphologically intact follicles with a concomitant increase in the rates of extruded and degenerated follicles (P < 0.05). The GDF-9 treatment showed higher rates of extruded follicles only on day 6 of culture (P < 0.05). Follicle diameter increased progressively throughout the culture period (P < 0.05) with similar diameters between treatments at all culture times (P > 0.05). Growth and differentiation factor 9 increased the daily growth rate from the first to the second third of culture, with higher values (P < 0.05) than control in the second third. Oocyte maturation rate as well as estradiol levels and relative mRNA expression for CYP19A1, CYP17, MMP-9, TIMP-2, and insulin receptor genes were similar between treatments (P > 0.05). This study shows for the first time that GDF-9 added to a culture medium increased the follicle growth rate of goat early antral follicles cultured in vitro.

AB  - Host-derived repellents offer a novel way to reduce disease vector-host interactions, particularly for vectors and nuisance pests where commercial repellents are not available, e.g., Culicoides biting midges. By revising the criteria previously used to identify bioactive volatile organic compounds for Culicoides nubeculosus, we identify (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-heptenal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E)-2-nonenal to be differentially present in the headspace odour of cattle hair and to elicit antennal responses in this research model species. A blend of these unsaturated aldehydes elicited an aversive response in C. nubeculosus, as well as a repellent response in three disease vector mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles coluzzii, a response that was stronger than that to the commercially available repellents tested (DEET, IR3535, PMD, icaridin, and d-allethrin). Culicoides nubeculosus was behaviourally indifferent to these commercially available repellents tested, except d-allethrin to which it was attracted. The identification of a host-derived repellent odour blend, which reduces the interaction between biting midges extends the array of tools to be used in integrated vector management of these and other disease vectors.

AB  - Plant extracts have been fed as additives to domestic animals, but their effects on behavior are variable, although synergism between products is rarely explored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oregano (Origanum vulgare) and green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) extracts fed separately or associated as additives on behavior in lactating dairy cows. Thirty-two Holstein and Holstein-Gyr cows were distributed in 4 groups of 8 animals: control (CON) - without plant extracts; oregano extract (OR) - addition of 0.056% of oregano extract in the diet dry matter (DDM); green tea (GT) - addition of 0.028% of green tea extract in DDM; and mixture (MIX) - addition of 0.056% of oregano extract and 0.028% of green tea extract in DDM, following a randomized block design with time-repeated measurements. The trial lasted 58 days. There was no treatment by day interaction for any of the variables, but block by treatment interaction was significant for eating time. In Holstein cows, GT and OR decreased eating time compared with cows in CON. Compared to CON, OR reduced eating rate, while GT increased time spent standing and the number of social interaction events between cows. There were not additive effects of feeding extracts associated, except for rumination time and the number of non-agonistic interactions. Cows in MIX spent less time ruminating compared with cows in GT and engaged more non-agonistic events compared with cows in OR. Cows in MIX tended to have more drinking bouts than cows in GT and OR, and tended to eat less feed than cows in GT. Oregano and green tea extracts did not disturb feeding behavior, feed intake and milk production when fed separately to lactating dairy cows. When oregano and green tea extracts were fed associated, cows tended to reduce feed intake and resting time, and decreased ruminating time. Therefore, its association is not recommended. Considering their potential benefits evidenced in other studies on health, redox status and mitigation of methane emissions, as well as the absence of negative effects on feed intake, behavior and milk production, oregano and green tea extract may be used separately for lactating cows.

AB  - Timely monitoring and precise estimation of body composition parameters, such as fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM), are crucial for pig production. Therefore, this study aimed to utilize three machine learning models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), and support vector regression (SVR), to predict FM and FFM in growing-finishing pigs using four input combinations of three variables, i.e., mass of pigs, feed intake, and surface temperature of pigs. An ultrasound-based back-fat depth measurement approach was used to determine FM and FFM, and these measurements were compared with reference mea-surements obtained from slaughtered pigs. Data from two experimental periods in 2021 and 2022 were used for training and testing these models. Performance metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to evaluate the models' performance and stability. The results showed that the SVR model had the highest accuracy in predicting FM and FFM, with the ability to explain the relationship between input and target variables up to 94.4% in FM and 94.6% in FFM prediction. Additionally, the SVR model consistently outperformed the RFR and MLR models in predicting FM, with an increase in R2 of up to 6.72% and 27.96%, respectively, and a reduction in RMSE of up to 24.06% and 36.82%, respectively, across different input combinations. Similar results were obtained in FFM prediction, where the SVR model showed an increase in R2 of up to 6.47% and 22.45%, and a reduction in RMSE of up to 23.96% and 36.57% compared to RFR and MLR models, respectively. Moreover, the SVR model demonstrated the highest stability, with only 2.9% to 3.3% decrease in R2 during the testing phase compared to the training phase, while the RFR model exhibited the worst stability. Findings of the present study suggested that the SVR model was the most stable and reliable, along with the ultrasound-based back-fat depth approach for measuring FM and FFM in growing-finishing pigs. This approach could aid in monitoring meat quality and providing a rapid overview of body composition for pig farmers.

AB  - Determination of the fatty acid profile in milk samples is one of the most important in food analysis. There are many methodologies for FA determination. The conventional procedure for determining the FA composition of milk is isolation of fat or indirect methylation, trans-methylation, extraction of fatty acids, and analysis by gas chromatography. In this study, eight methods based on alkaline methylation were compared for the analysis of fatty acids in cow's milk. The response factors (RF) for GC analysis using FID were calculated. For most acids, RFs were close to 1, with the exception of short-chain fatty acids (C4:0-C8:0). To facilitate the selection of the method for the determination of fatty acids in milk samples, the methods were assessed using the environmental assessment tools of the analytical procedure: the Analytical Eco-Scale, Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI), and Analytical Greenness for Sample Preparation (AGREEprep). The method based on direct milk methylation received the highest scores. Omitting the lipid separation step has an impact on reducing the quantity of used toxic chemicals and reagents, and produces a smaller amount of waste, a much higher throughput, and a reduced cost analysis.

AB  - 1. Plants lose a remarkable amount of energy to herbivorous animals, and this damage has substantial impacts on plant fitness and species' distributions. There are many ways ecologists can measure leaf damage, with some methods being more time-consuming than others. Due to a high variance in herbivory, accurate quantification of damage at the population level requires sampling of many leaves. A simple yet effective solution to this problem is to estimate leaf damage visually.
   2. Visually estimating leaf damage may be less accurate than scanning methods, but visual estimates of leaf damage are much faster than digital measurements. Using simulations, we show that gathering larger quantities of data at a slightly higher level of inaccuracy gives a more accurate estimate of a population's over-all leaf damage than fewer, exact measurements.
   3. We then introduce the ZAX Herbivory Trainer, a free online application that teaches researchers to accurately visually estimate leaf damage. On average, users took similar to 9 min and 48 images to complete our trainer which significantly decreased their estimate inaccuracy from 13.2% to 6%. This low level of inaccuracy can be retained up to 3 months post-training so researchers can use the ZAX Herbivory Trainer once prior to short fieldwork or every 3 months for extensive fieldwork. We also recommend a cut-off point, whereby if a person has not completed the app in 17.5 min or 85 images (90th percentile), they may not be suitable to estimate herbivory for research purposes.
   4. The ZAX Herbivory Trainer will allow researchers of any experience level to assess herbivory quickly and accurately in a globally standardised way. International collaborators, students and citizen scientists can all find use in this app, no matter the scale of their projects. From this we can gather better data to address big picture questions in ecology such as patterns in herbivory relating to latitude or climate change.

AB  - BackgroundThe inflammation and synaptic dysfunction induced by mitochondrial dysfunction play essential roles in the learning and memory impairment associated with sleep dysfunction. Elamipretide (SS-31), a novel mitochondrion-targeted antioxidant, was proven to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, the inflammatory response, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in models of cerebral ischemia, sepsis, and type 2 diabetes. However, the potential for SS-31 to improve the cognitive impairment induced by chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) and its underlying mechanisms is unknown.MethodsAdult c57BL/6J mice were subjected to CSD for 21 days using an activity wheel accompanied by daily intraperitoneal injection of SS-31 (5 mg/kg). The novel object recognition and Morris water maze test were used to evaluate hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine the effects of CSD and SS-31 on markers of mitochondria, inflammation response, and synaptic function. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to examine the levels of proinflammatory cytokines.ResultsSS-31 could improve the cognitive impairment induced by CSD. In particular, SS-31 treatment restored the CSD-induced decrease in sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator alpha levels and the increase in levels nuclear factor kappa-B and inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, SS-31 significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin in CSD mice.ConclusionTaken together, these results suggest that SS-31 could improve CSD-induced mitochondrial biogenesis dysfunction, inflammatory response, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment by increasing SIRT1 expression levels.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of two types of nutritional supplementation during late gestation on the chemical composition, energy value, and IgG concentration in the colostrum and the IgG concentration in the blood serum of lambs. Pregnant Merino Precoz ewes (n = 36) carrying single fetuses were used. Animals were kept grazing on the Mediterranean annual grassland. From day similar to 90 of pregnancy, animals were allocated into three groups: daily supplementation with oat grain or lupine grain and a control group without supplementation. Immediately after parturition, colostrum was collected from each ewe, and a blood sample was taken from the lambs 24 h after birth. For the evaluation of the chemical composition of the colostrum, an EKOMILK (R) milk analyzer was used. The energy value of the colostrum was calorimetrically evaluated. IgG concentrations were measured by simple radial immunodiffusion. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance. Colostrum content of protein and non-fat solids was higher in the group supplemented with oat grain than in the lupine grain supplemented and control groups (p <= 0.05). In contrast, ewes supplemented with lupine grain had the highest concentration of fat in their colostrum (p <= 0.05). Oat grain supplementation resulted in higher concentrations of IgG, both in sheep colostrum and in the blood serum of their lambs (p <= 0.05), being higher than those observed in the lupine grain and control groups. Ewes that gave birth to male lambs had significantly higher concentrations of IgG in their colostrum compared to ewes that gave birth to females (p <= 0.05). The colostral IgG concentration positively correlated with the serum IgG concentration of the lambs (r = 0.32; p <= 0.05). The results indicate that the quality of colostrum and the immunological status of the newborn lambs can be improved by supplementation with oat grain.

AB  - Interactions between female metabolic status, immune response, and reproductive system functioning are complex and not fully understood. We hypothesized that chemerin, considered a hormonal link between the above-mentioned processes, influences endometrial functions, particularly cytokine secretion and signaling. Using porcine endometrial explants collected during early pregnancy and the estrous cycle, we investigated chemerin effects on the secretion of interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8), leukemia inhibitory factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor alpha, and protein abundances of their respective receptors. Our results demonstrate chemerin modulation of cytokine secretion and receptor expression, with effects dependent on the stage of pregnancy and dose of chemerin. Furthermore, chemerin influences the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-amino-terminal kinase and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells in the endometrium. Chemerin multifaceted actions, such as involvement in immune response, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling, seem to be mediated by cytokines, at least in the endometrium. These findings underscore the potential crosstalk between chemerin and hormonal signaling pathways, providing insights into the complex mechanisms underlying early pregnancy establishment and maintenance.

AB  - Urban habitats present animals with persistent disturbances and acute stressors not present in rural habitats or present at significantly lower levels. Differences in the glucocorticoid stress response could underlie colonization of these novel habitats. Despite urban habitats characterization as more stressful, previous comparisons of urban and rural birds have failed to find consistent differences in baseline and stress induced glucocorticoid levels. Another aspect of glucocorticoid regulation that could underlie an animal's ability to inhabit novel habitats, but has yet to be well examined, is more efficient termination of the glucocorticoid stress response which would allow birds in urban habitats to recover more quickly after a disturbance. The glucocorticoid stress response is terminated by negative feedback achieved primarily through their binding of receptors in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and subsequent decreased synthesis and release from the adrenals. We investigated if male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in urban habitats show more efficient termination of the glucocorticoid stress response than their rural counterparts using two approaches. First, we measured glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11 beta-H5D2 (an enzyme that inactivates corticosterone) mRNA expression in negative feedback targets of the brain (the hippocampus and hypothalamus) as a proxy measure of sensitivity to negative feedback. Second, we measured plasma corticosterone levels after standardized restraint and again following a challenge with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, as a means of assessing how quickly birds decreased glucocorticoid synthesis and release. Though there were no differences in the hypothalamus of urban and rural song sparrows, urban birds had lower glucocorticoid receptor and 11 beta-HSD2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus. Further, urban and rural birds had similar reductions in corticosterone following the dexamethasone challenge, suggesting that they do not differ in how quickly they decrease glucocorticoid synthesis and release. Thus, urban and rural song sparrows display similar termination of the glucocorticoid stress response even though urban birds have decreased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor and 11 beta-HSD2 abundance.

AB  - Examining breed differences in farm animals is crucial for adopting the best management strategies to promote animal welfare and productivity. Hence, this study investigated whether two sheep breeds farmed in South Africa, one indigenous (Namakwa Afrikaners: NA) and one commercial breed (Dorper: DO), reacted differently when exposed to challenging situations. 323 NA and 358 DO ewe and ram lambs, aged 4 months, were tested over 7 years. These tests involved a stationary, seated human between them and their flock mates (arena test), a mobile human (docility test), and being constrained without the possibility of escape ('scale test'). In the arena test, we calculated the mean distance from the seated operator and the distance travelled by the test animal. In the docility test, we recorded an individual animal's time to enter and be contained by a mobile handler in a square area of the test arena within 3 min. In the 'scale-test,' the animals' behavioural response was recorded using a 5-point scoring system (1 =calm; 5 =wild) at weighing. In all tests, vocalizations and urinations/defecations were recorded. During the arena test, the average distance to the human operator and time spent in the two areas closer to the human operator were independent of breed (P > 0.05). However, DO spent significantly more time in the section farthest from the stationary human (P < 0.05) than NA. Additionally, NA bleated more frequently (P < 0.0001) than DO, and ewes also bleated more than rams (P < 0.05). In the docility test, no difference was observed between breeds and sexes regarding the success of the test and the time contained (P > 0.05). However, NA sheep took longer to enter the marked area than DO (P < 0.05). Ewes also took longer than rams (P < 0.05). Furthermore, NA and ewes vocalized more than DO (P < 0.0001) and rams (P < 0.05). During the scale test, no difference was observed between breeds and sexes regarding the score allocated (P > 0.05), but NA bleated more than DO (P < 0.05). All variables from the three tests, except for success rate, time to enter, time contained and vocalizations from the docility test, varied between years (P < 0.05). Ewes and indigenous NA lambs demonstrated more anxiety in controlled situations, as indicated by their higher frequency of bleating. Therefore, flocks that include NA and/or ewes should be managed with caution, as they are more susceptible to stress during routine husbandry practices involving separation from peers.

AB  - The tolerance of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) to plant-derived secondary compounds gradually increases with instars. Therefore, even if plant-based additives are applied at early stages, such as the second or third instar, they may have a differential impact on the ecofriendly control of S. frugiperda. In this study, S. frugiperda larvae were exposed to vanillic acid or sinapic acid at the second and third instar, and physiological and growth parameters were measured. The results showed that the effects of vanillic acid treatment on S. frugiperda were similar at the different instars. They can significantly affect the larval carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase, and mixed-function oxidase activities. By reducing larval food intake, food conversion, and utilization efficiency while increasing the food consumption rate, it inhibits weight accumulation. This leads to a significant extension of the development of both the larval and pupal stages, and the adult longevity was reduced. Treatment with sinapic acid at the second instar extended the negative effects on the pupal duration of S. frugiperda when compared to treatment at the third instar, but did not affect adult longevity. Therefore, vanillic acid treatment at the second or third instar stage, can play an important role in the ecofriendly control process of S. frugiperda. The results of this study are of great significance for integrated pest management.

AB  - Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) agonists has therapeutic effects in neurological disorders and possesses properties that can reverse cognitive dysfunction. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Sig-1R activation on cognitive dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ) combined with high fat and high sugar diet (HFD)-induced type 2 diabetic rats. By employing morris water maze (MWM) testing and computed tomography (CT) imaging, we observed that activation of Sig-1R effectively mitigated brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in diabetesinduced cognitive impairment (DCI) rats. Given the fundamental role of intact hippocampal synaptic plasticity in maintaining cognitive function, we investigated the correlation between Sig-1R and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a well-established neurotrophic factor. And we also analyzed the expression of Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) protein. Golgi staining, Haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence results show that activating Sig-1R can upregulate BDNF expression and reducing synaptic damage in hippocampal neurons. To elucidate the mechanism by which Sig-1R activation leads to increased BDNF levels, we investigated the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase/Cyclic AMP Response ElementBinding Protein(ERK/CREB) protein pathway. In vitro and in vivo, we observed that Sig-1R activates the ERK/ CREB signaling pathway, thereby stimulating BDNF release and increased PSD95 expression. Further intervention with BD1047 antagonist and Tropomyosin-Related Kinase B (TrkB) antagonist ANA-12 confirmed our conclusion that Sig-1R activation upregulated p-ERK and p-CREB protein expression, promoted BDNF transcription, the expression of PSD95 protein was up-regulated, reduces synaptic damage in damaged hippocampal neurons, and rescued cognitive impairment in DCI rats.

AB  - Simple Summary Environmental enrichment can mitigate the damage to animal welfare induced by modern intensive pig farming practices, especially when pregnant sows are raised in confined stalls. This study investigated the effects of enrichment items (such as adding pine and scented wood in confinement stalls) on the physiology and behavior of sows during late gestation. Adding both pine and scented wood in confinement stalls was shown to alleviate chronic stress and stereotypical behavior of sows, suggesting their potential as an interesting and feasible way to reduce welfare compromise. Modern intensive pig breeding harms animal welfare, which is especially noticeable for pregnant sows kept in confinement stalls. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of enrichment items on the movement and physiological parameters of sows in the third trimester of pregnancy. A total of 30 large white pregnant sows were randomly divided into three equal treatment groups (n = 10): control, pine wood, and scented wood groups. Interestingly, compared with the control group, the sows in the pine wood or scented wood groups showed less ventral lying and more lateral lying behavior (p < 0.01), coupled with significant reduction in the frequency of scratching and sham-chewing (p < 0.01), but with no significant difference in the degree of preference for these enrichment items (p > 0.05). Additionally, the sows in the pine wood or scented wood groups also decreased significantly in the concentration of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (p < 0.01) and the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (p < 0.05) throughout the late pregnancy period. Overall, adding enrichment items to confinement stalls can alleviate the chronic stress and the stereotypic behavior of sows, suggesting their potential to reduce welfare compromise.

AB  - In the present work, a nickel-ferrite/reduced-graphene-oxide composite was synthesized by a hydrothermal co-precipitation approach. The obtained materials were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray microscopy (mapping energy dispersive X-Ray), adsorption/desorption isotherms of nitrogen, vibrating sample magnetometer, X-ray photoelectron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The obtained composite with a large surface area consists of highly dispersed nickel-ferrite nanoparticles (7-10 nm) over reduced-graphene-oxide layers. In addition, this composite possesses high magnetization saturation with a soft magnetic property. A sensitive electrochemical sensor for the determination of clenbuterol was manufactured by modifying a glassy-carbon electrode with nickel ferrite/reduced graphene oxide composite film. The peak current measured with differential pulse voltammetry for clenbuterol solutions is linearly proportional to its concentration ranging from 0.99 to 18.03 mu M with a limit of detection of 0.17 mu M and a limit of quantification of 0.52 mu M. Furthermore, the reproducibility, precision, and accuracy of the proposed method were also investigated. This proposed method was applied to detect clenbuterol in pig urine samples with satisfactory results.

AB  - Pre-clinical research in aging is hampered by the scarcity of studies modeling its heterogeneity and complexity forged by pathophysiological conditions throughout the life cycle and under the sex perspective. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of dementia in older adults, we recently described in female wildtype and APP23 mice a survival bias and non-linear chronology of behavioral signatures from middle age to long life. Here, we present a comprehensive and multidimensional (physical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric-like symptoms) screening and underlying neuropathological signatures in male and female 3xTg-AD mice at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 16 months of age and compared to their non-transgenic counterparts with gold-standard C57BL/6J background. Most variables studied detected age-related differences, whereas the genotype factor was specific to horizontal and vertical activities, thigmotaxis, coping with stress strategies, working memory, and frailty index. A sex effect was predominantly observed in classical emotional variables and physical status. Sixteen-month-old mice exhibited non-linear age- and genotype-dependent behavioral signatures, with higher heterogeneity in females, and worsened in naturalistically isolated males, suggesting distinct compensatory mechanisms and survival bias. The underlying temporal and spatial progression of A beta and tau pathologies pointed to a relevant cortico-limbic substrate roadmap: premorbid intracellular A beta immunoreactivity and pSer202/pThr205 tau phosphorylation in the amygdala and ventral hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex and ventral hippocampus as the areas most affected by A beta plaques. Therefore, depicting phenotypic signatures and neuropathological correlates can be critical to unveiling preventive/therapeutic research and intervention windows and studying adaptative behaviors and maladaptive responses relevant to psychopathology.

AB  - Simple Summary Emotional contagion and social support are common phenomena in animals. The study evaluated whether pigs that did not observe the stimulus process could also perceive the negative emotions of their companions and provide social support. Here, the research compared differences in behavioral responses between treated individuals and naive companions by measuring the frequency/duration and latency of behaviors occurring in pigs under different test conditions to determine whether there were behavioral responses of the companions with emotional contagion to support the treated individuals. Whether or not the companions were aware of the source of the negative emotions of the treated pigs, they were able to respond to it in an appropriate emotional way and provide social support to the treated individual.Abstract This study expects to confirm the existence of emotional transmission in pigs from multiple perspectives and to provide theoretical references for improving animal welfare in livestock farming. A group that could directly observe (DO) and a group that could not directly observe (NO) were created based on whether or not their peers observed the treatment process, as the treated pig (TP) was treated with electrical shock and the companion pig (CP) either witnessed the treatment inflicted upon TP or not, and a third group was a control group, in which neither pig was stimulated. The behavioral responses of both the TPs and CPs were recorded to evaluate the emotional reaction. The results found that in both the DO and NO groups, the frequency of TP freezing was significantly higher than that of CP, and CP was significantly higher than that of the control group. Interestingly, although the social interaction responses of the CPs were not similar in the DO and NO groups, there were no significant differences between the behaviors of TPs in the DO and NO groups, except for nose-nose contact and a single approach to the partition, which allowed us to conclude that, whether or not the pigs directly observed the negative treatment, they were able to respond accordingly to fear and provide similar social support to their companions who were treated negatively.

AB  - AMPK plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and is involved in the regulation of luteal steroidogenesis by APN and its analog AdipoRon. To further explore the regulatory mechanism of AMPK in goat luteal steroidogenesis mediated by APN, cyclic and pregnant CL were utilized to assess the localization and expression of AMPK, EZH2, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac by WB and mIHC, and the interaction between AMPK and EZH2 by Co-IP. Then, isolated luteal cells were treated with APN/AdipoRon to evaluate the expression levels of AMPK, EZH2, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac. Results showed that AMPK and EZH2 were co-localized to the cytoplasm of luteal cells, and interacted as detected by Co-IP. H3K27me3 and H3K27ac were localized to the nucleus of goat luteal cells. H3K27me3 expression in late CL was significantly higher than that in early and middle CL, while the expressions of AMPK, H3K27ac and EZH2 in middle CL were significantly higher than those in early and late CL. Notably, all these proteins were expressed at similar levels between pregnancy and middle cycle, with the exception of EZH2. Following incubation with AdipoRon (25 mu M) and APN (1 mu g/mL) for 24 h, the expressions of AMPK and H3K27ac decreased, while H3K27me3 increased in luteal cells. Compound C (AMPK activity inhibitor) reversed the AdipoRon - induced decrease in EZH2 expression and the increase in H3K27me3 expression. The increased H3K27me3 expression and decreased steroidogenic protein (CYP11A1 and HSD3B) expression after GSK126 (EZH2 inhibitor) treatment were consistent with the effects seen after AdipoRon treatment. In conclusion, APN/AdipoRon inhibits luteal steroidogenesis by inhibiting the interaction between AMPK and EZH2, thereby promoting H3K27me3 expression.

AB  - Hipposideros spp. are insectivorous bats and karst cave dwellers. This study aimed to study the roosting ecology, reproduction, and population fluctuations of three species H. diadema, H. larvatus, and H. ater in Gunung Sewu Karst region, Indonesia. Age and reproductive status of individuals were identified and analyzed using a combination of forearm length (FA) and body mass grades (W). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between population size, rainfall and population structure based on FA, reproductive status, and W. Crude birth rate (CBR) and general fertility rate (GFR) were used to determine the population's birth rate and female fertility. The results showed that the population of the three Hipposideros species were quite stable over the year with a peak in January which classified them as monoestrous, with mating, pregnancy, and lactation occurring once a year with no delay between mating and pregnancy. Pregnancy lasted 8-12 weeks and lactation 4-5 weeks. The population structure of the three species tended to be stable over the year. The CBR and GFR values can be used for rapid assessment guidelines in an area.

AB  - Vector-borne plant pathogens often change host traits to manipulate vector behavior in a way that favors their spread. By contrast, infection by opportunistic fungi does not depend on vectors, although damage caused by an herbivore may facilitate infection. Manipulation of hosts and vectors, such as insect herbivores, has not been demonstrated in interactions with fungal pathogens. Herein, we establish a new paradigm for the plant-insect-fungus association in sugarcane. It has long been assumed that Fusarium verticillioides is an opportunistic fungus, where it takes advantage of the openings left by Diatraea saccharalis caterpillar attack to infect the plant. In this work, we show that volatile emissions from F. verticillioides attract D. saccharalis caterpillars. Once they become adults, the fungus is transmitted vertically to their offspring, which continues the cycle by inoculating the fungus into healthy plants. Females not carrying the fungus prefer to lay their eggs on fungus-infected plants than mock plants, while females carrying the fungus prefer to lay their eggs on mock plants than fungus-infected plants. Even though the fungus impacts D. saccharalis sex behavior, larval weight and reproduction rate, most individuals complete their development. Our data demonstrate that the fungus manipulates both the host plant and insect herbivore across life cycle to promote its infection and dissemination.

AB  - Simple Summary This study describes the improvement of biosecurity and environmental hygiene procedures in 20 pig farms monitored during a 12-month period. A checklist was used to develop tailor-made plans, which also included personnel training on hygiene procedures. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the content in environmental samples, was used as an output biomarker. To gain an insight into the environmental samples, the presence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) was also investigated as sentinel microorganisms to monitor antibiotic resistance. After 12 months, the average biosecurity was improved, and ATP contents decreased. Despite this, only ESBL-E. coli prevalence was effectively decreased by hygiene procedures, and a challenging persistence of a high prevalence of LA-MRSA after cleaning emerged. Results suggest that a tailored approach and on-farm training are useful to improve the application of biosecurity measures, in particular those related to hygiene management in the professional zone. However, this should not reduce the attention to the presence of resistant bacteria in the pig barns, in particular for the risk of spreading these bacteria to humans in close contact with pigs, moving the attention to the healthcare of workers in a one-health approach.
   In livestock, the importance of hygiene management is gaining importance within the context of biosecurity. The aim of this study was to monitor the implementation of biosecurity and hygiene procedures in 20 swine herds over a 12-month period, as driven by tailor-made plans, including training on-farm. The measure of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) environmental contents was used as an output biomarker. The presence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) was also investigated as sentinels of antibiotic resistance. A significant biosecurity improvement (p = 0.006) and a reduction in the ATP content in the sanitised environment (p = 0.039) were observed. A cluster including 6/20 farms greatly improved both biosecurity and ATP contents, while the remaining 14/20 farms ameliorated them only slightly. Even if the ESBL-E. coli prevalence (30.0%) after the hygiene procedures significantly decreased, the prevalence of LA-MRSA (22.5%) was unaffected. Despite the promising results supporting the adoption of tailor-made biosecurity plans and the measure of environmental ATP as an output biomarker, the high LA-MRSA prevalence still detected at the end of the study underlines the importance of improving even more biosecurity and farm hygiene in a one-health approach aimed to preserve also the pig workers health.

AB  - The study of carnivores' diet is a key component to enhance knowledge on the ecology of predators and their effect on prey populations. Although molecular approaches to detect prey DNA in carnivore scats are improving, the validation of their accuracy, a prerequisite for reliable applications within ecological frameworks, is still lagging behind the methodological advances. Indeed, variation in detection probability among prey species can occur, representing a potentially insidious source of bias in food-habit studies of carnivores. Calibration of DNA-based methods involves the optimization of specificity and sensitivity and, whereas priority is usually given to the former to avoid false positives, sensitivity is rarely investigated so that false negatives may be largely overlooked. We conducted feeding trials with captive wolves (Canis lupus) to validate a nanofluidic array technology recently developed for the detection of multiple prey species in scats. Using 371 scat samples from 12 wolves fed with a single-prey diet, the sensitivity of our nanofluidic array method varied between 0.45 and 0.95 for the six main ungulate prey species. The method sensitivity was enhanced by using multiple markers per species and by a relatively low threshold of number of amplifying markers required to confirm a detection. Yet, at least two markers should be used to avoid false positives. By acknowledging sources of bias in sensitivity to reliably interpret the results of DNA-based dietary methods, our study highlights the relevance of feeding experiments to optimally calibrate the relative thresholds to define a positive detection and investigate the occurrence and extent of biases in sensitivity.

AB  - Conditions associated with selenium (Se) and/or vitamin E (VitE) deficiency are still being reported in high-yielding pigs fed the recommended amounts. Here, the dietary effects of Se source (sodium selenite, NaSe, 0.40 or 0.65 mg Se/kg; l-selenomethionine, SeMet, 0.19 or 0.44 mg Se/kg; a NaSe-SeMet mixture, SeMix, 0.44-0.46 mg Se/kg) and VitE concentration (27, 50-53 or 101 mg/kg) on the antioxidant status of finisher pigs were compared with those in pigs fed non-Se-supplemented diets (0.08-0.09 mg Se/kg). Compared to NaSe-enriched diets, SeMet-supplemented diets resulted in significantly (p < 0.0018) higher plasma concentrations of total Se (14-27%) and selenospecies (GPx3, SelP, SeAlb; 7-83%), significantly increased the total Se accumulation in skeletal muscles, myocardium, liver and brain (10-650%), and enhanced the VitE levels in plasma (15-74%) and tissues (8-33%) by the end of the 80-day trial, proving better Se distribution and retention in pigs fed organic Se. Injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intravenously half-way into the trial provoked a pyrogenic response in the pigs followed by a rapid increase of inorganic Se after 5-12 h, a drastic drop of SeMet levels between 12 and 24 h that recovered by 48 h, and a small increase of SeCys by 24-48 h, together with a gradual rise of GPx3, SelP and SeAlb in plasma up to 48 h. These changes in Se speciation in plasma were particularly significant (0.0024 > p > 0.00007) in pigs receiving SeMet- (0.44 mg Se/kg, above EU-legislated limits) or SeMix-supplemented (SeMet and NaSe both at 0.2 mg Se/kg, within EU-legislated limits) diets, which demonstrates Se metabolism upregulation to counteract the LPS-induced oxidative stress and a strengthened antioxidant capacity in these pigs. Overall, a Se source combination (without exceeding EU-legislated limits) and sufficient VitE supplementation (>= 50 mg/kg) improved the pigs' antioxidant status, while doubling the allowed dietary organic Se increased the Se in tissues up to sixfold without compromising the animal's health due to toxicity. This study renders valuable results for revising the current dietary SeMet limits in swine rations.

AB  - Skeletal muscle development is spotlighted in mammals since it closely relates to animal health and economic benefits to the breeding industry. Researchers have successfully unveiled many regulatory factors and mechanisms involving myogenesis. However, the effect of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification, especially demethylase and its regulated genes, on muscle development remains to be further explored. Here, we found that the typical demethylase FTO (fat mass- and obesity-associated protein) was highly enriched in goats' longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles. In addition, the level of m(6)A modification on transcripts was negatively regulated by FTO during the proliferation of goat skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). Moreover, a deficiency of FTO in MuSCs significantly retarded their proliferation and promoted the expression of dystrophin-associated protein 1 (DAG1). m(6)A modifications of DAG1 mRNA were efficiently altered by FTO. Intriguingly, the results of DAG1 levels and its m(6)A enrichment from FB23-2 (FTO demethylase inhibitor)-treated cells were consistent with those of the FTO knockdown, indicating that the regulation of FTO on DAG1 depended on m(6)A modification. Further experiments showed that interfering FTO improved m(6)A modification at site DAG1-122, recognized by Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and consequently stabilized DAG1 transcripts. Our study suggests that FTO promotes the proliferation of MuSCs by regulating the expression of DAG1 through m(6)A modification. This will extend our knowledge of the m(6)A-related mechanism of skeletal muscle development in animals.

AB  - Recently, the Indonesian government has sought to secure food production from forestlands by implementing agroforestry in rural areas. Talas beneng or tall elephant ear plant ( Xanthosoma undipes ) is a potential species for agroforestry that produces medicinal tubers and leaves. It has high productivity and export opportunities, but its management strategy under community forestland needs to be more widely studied. In Ciamis Regency, talas beneng has been cultivated for the last two years, but the progress has not been significant. This study aimed to formulate strategic management for improving its business model by identifying internal and external factors. Two groups of farmers in Ciamis Regency were chosen as the case study. Observation and in-depth interviews with farming group leaders as key informants were employed to gather the existing model business. Internal and external factors were analyzed using a business model canvas (BMC) framework, SWOT analysis and quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM). Results show that the market channels between the two groups of talas beneng producers are slightly different. SWOT analysis shows that both groups have positions in which product development and market penetration are required as strategies to improve future management. Specific strategies that need to be prioritized include 1) improving farming intensification, 2) improving talas beneng product competitiveness, and 3) expanding the business partnership to access market information better.

AB  - Elucidating how the distinct components of synaptic plasticity dynamically orchestrate the distinct stages of memory acquisition and maintenance within neuronal networks remains a major challenge. Specifically, plas-ticity processes tuning the functional and also structural state of presynaptic active zone (AZ) release sites are widely observed in vertebrates and invertebrates, but their behavioral relevance remains mostly unclear. We here provide evidence that a transient upregulation of presynaptic AZ release site proteins supports aver-sive olfactory mid-term memory in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Upon paired aversive olfactory con-ditioning, AZ protein levels (ELKS-family BRP/(m)unc13-family release factor Unc13A) increased for a few hours with MB-lobe-specific dynamics. Kenyon cell (KC, intrinsic MB neurons)-specific knockdown (KD) of BRP did not affect aversive olfactory short-term memory (STM) but strongly suppressed aversive mid-term memory (MTM). Different proteins crucial for the transport of AZ biosynthetic precursors (transport adaptor Aplip1/Jip-1; kinesin motor IMAC/Unc104; small GTPase Arl8) were also specifically required for the formation of aversive olfactory MTM. Consistent with the merely transitory increase of AZ proteins, BRP KD did not interfere with the formation of aversive olfactory long-term memory (LTM; i.e., 1 day). Our data suggest that the remodeling of presynaptic AZ refines the MB circuitry after paired aversive condition-ing, over a time window of a few hours, to display aversive olfactory memories.

AB  - Perinatal mortality of lambs is the major source of reproductive loss in extensive sheep production systems. Treatment with caffeine has reduced intra-partum mortality and/or improved metabolic indicators in other species following hypoxia. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of caffeine for improving perinatal lamb survival. Experiment 1 comprised group-fed Merino ewes grazing pasture and offered 1.8 g/day (estimated 20 mg/kg live weight) caffeine throughout a 4-week lambing period, and a control without caffeine. The survival of lambs to marking (vaccinated, tail docked, males castrated) age in the caffeine treatment group (0.81) did not differ (P = 0.199) from that of control lambs (0.73; total born n = 877). Experiment 2 comprised Merino ewes lambing from three successive weekly joining groups. Treated ewes were drenched with an aqueous caffeine solution at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg live weight from the day before anticipated lambing, until the individual lambed. Control ewes were drenched with water. The proportion of lambs born dead (0.07) and the survival of lambs to marking age (caffeine 0.61; control 0.62) were similar between treatment groups (total born n = 1158). In both experiments, ewe mortality and the weight of lambs at marking were not altered by caffeine treatments. The results from this large-scale field study indicate caffeine is not an effective therapeutic agent to increase either intra-partum or perinatal survival, or lamb growth rates.

AB  - This study focuses on assessing inter-observer reliability (IOR) between two observers in the case of trichotomous and four-level animal-based welfare indicators assessed at individual level. The Body Condition Score (BCS) and Knee calluses (KNC) were chosen as trichotomous indicators; data were collected in fourteen intensively managed dairy goat farms in Italy (ITF1 to ITF7) and Portugal (PTF1 to PTF7) and in extensively managed dairy goat farms exploiting three alpine pastures (AP1, AP2 and AP3) in Italy. The Ear posture (EP) and Eye white (EW) were chosen as four-level indicators; data were collected in three intensively managed dairy cattle farms (F1, F2 and F3) in Italy. The performance of the most documented agreement indices was compared. In the case of trichotomous indicators, Scott's pi, Cohen's K, Cohen's KC, Cohen's weighted K and Krippendorff's alpha were affected by the paradox effect: when the concordance rate (P0) was high, they sometimes gave very low or even negative values (e.g. P0(BCS-ITF3) = 74%; Scott's pi = 0.05; Cohen's K = 0.09; Krippendorff's alpha = 0.06; P0(BCS-AP3) = 74%; Scott's pi = -0.12; Cohen's K = Krippendorff's alpha = -0.11). Bangdiwala's B, Gwet's gamma(AC1) and Quatto's weighted S were not affected by this phenomenon and provided values very close to P0 (e.g. P0(KNC-PTF1) = 88%; Bangdiwala's B = Gwet's gamma(AC1) = 0.85; P0(BCS-AP1) = 82%; Bangdiwala's B = Gwet's gamma(AC1) = 0.79). In the case of four-level indicators, Cohen's K and Krippendorff's alpha were not affected by the paradox behaviour. However, Cohen's KC in some cases exceeded the observed P0 (e.g. P0(EP-F3) = 78%; Cohen's KC = 1). Gwet's gamma(AC1) showed the best results for four-level indicators (e.g. P0(EP-F1) = 88%; Gwet's gamma(AC1) = 0.86), followed by Quatto's S and Holley and Guilford's G (e.g. P0(EP-F1) = 88%; Quatto's S = Holley and Guilford's G = 0.84). To evaluate IOR between two observers, Bangdiwala's B, Gwet's gamma(AC1) and Quatto's weighted S are suggested for trichotomous indicators, while Gwet's gamma(AC1), Quatto's S and Holley and Guilford's G are suggested for four-level indicators.

AB  - The implantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells may be a useful therapeutic strategy for targeting remyelination. However, it is yet to be established how these cells behave after implantation and whether they retain the capacity to proliferate or differentiate into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. One essential issue is the creation of administration protocols and determining which factors need to be well established. There is controversy around whether these cells may be implanted simultaneously with corticosteroid treatment, which is widely used in many clinical situations. This study assesses the influence of corticosteroids on the capacity for proliferation and differentiation and the survival of human oligodendroglioma cells. Our findings show that corticosteroids reduce the capacity of these cells to proliferate and to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and decrease cell survival. Thus, their effect does not favour remyelination; this is consistent with the results of studies with rodent cells. In conclusion, protocols for the administration of oligodendrocyte lineage cells with the aim of repopulating oligodendroglial niches or repairing demyelinated axons should not include corticosteroids, given the evidence that the effects of these drugs may undermine the objectives of cell transplantation.

AB  - Letrozole comprises a non-steroid aromatase inhibitor that has been applied as a preventive for many uses, such as breast cancer prevention, treatment of hormonal dysfunction, and male infertility. Precisely in Northeast Brazil, ovine consist of the leading livestock produced, and their reproduction in captivity has been demonstrated difficult. Thus, we hypothesized whether the application of letrozole will improve male sheep reproduction. One group of 6 animals received a daily dosage of 0.5mg/Kg of letrozole for 60 days, while the other six animals were used as control. Samples were collected from control and treated animals after 30 and 60 days of the experiment. Blood samples were collected to measure the steroid hormone levels. Semen was collected from control and treated groups using an artificial vagina and cryopreserved for spermatozoa morphology and CASA analysis. The testicles were collected for histological analysis, gene expression, and immunohistochemistry of P450aromatase protein. Hormone levels demonstrate no differences in the estradiol/testosterone levels among the control and both treated groups. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the presence of P450aromatase protein in spermatogonia cells and Leydig cells in the control and treated groups in both periods analyzed. Moreover, there were no differences in the P450aromase gene expression in the control and treated group. Morphological analysis of the spermatozoa revealed that letrozole treatment did not affect mitochondrial activity or cause any deformities. In addition, motility parameters in the sperm from the treated group were not affected by letrozole treatment compared to the control group. Morphological analysis of the testis demonstrated that letrozole treatment increase the seminiferous tubule area but no signs of germ cell damage. Our results show that letrozole has a morphological effect on the testicles in the ovine model but no pathological or severe effect caused by hormone level imbalance. Overall, letrozole comprises a nonsteroid aromatase inhibitor, which can be applied to ovine reproduction.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) inhabits one of the most challenging environments on Earth, referred to as the 'third pole'. Only a fraction of its vast range has been explored thus far, owing to myriad of barriers inflicted by the remote terrain and socio-ecological realities of the landscapes. Understanding distribution patterns of species is essential to devise practical management measures. This study aimed to understand the distribution pattern and factors influencing occupancy of snow leopard in the Pamir Mountain range through sign-based occupancy modelling. Our study confirmed that the Pamir range is a snow leopard stronghold, with occupancy estimated at 0.57 +/- 0.02. The topographic features positively influenced the detection probability (p = 0.37 +/- 0.005) of snow leopards. Occupancy was influenced by mean annual precipitation (b = -6.12 +/- 1.8), density of roads (b = -1.61 +/- 0.6) and water sources (b = 0. 74 +/- 0.4). Our findings underpin that sign-based distribution surveys provide vigorous scientific knowledge about elusive species and merit replication being used for other species.

AB  - Chronic diabetic conditions have been associated with certain cerebral complications, that include neurobehavioral dysfunctional patterns and morphological alterations of neurons, especially the hippocampus. Neuroanatomical studies done by the authors have shown decreased total dendritic length, intersections, dendritic length per branch order and nodes in the CA1 hippocampal region of the diabetic brain as compared to its normal control group, indicating reduced dendritic arborization of the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Epigenetic alterations in the brain are well known to affect age-associated disorders, however its association with the evolving diabetes-induced damage in the brain is still not fully understood. DNA hypermethylation within the neurons, tend to silent the gene expression of several regulatory proteins. The findings in the study have shown an increase in global DNA methylation in palmitic acid-induced lipotoxic Neuro-2a cells as well as within the diabetic mice brain. Inhibiting DNA methylation, restored the levels of HSF1 and certain HSPs, suggesting plausible effect of DNMTs in maintaining the proteostasis and synaptic fidelity. Neuroinflammation, as exhibited by the astrocyte activation (GFAP), were further significantly decreased in the 5-azadeoxycytidine group (DNMT inhibitor). This was further evidenced by decrease in proinflammatory cytokines TNF ⍺, IL-6, and mediators iNOS and Phospho-NFkB. Our results suggest that changes in DNA methylation advocate epigenetic dysregulation and its involvement in disrupting the synaptic exactitude in the hippocampus of diabetic mice model, providing an insight into the pathophysiology of diabetes-induced neuroepigenetic changes.

AB  - miR390 is a highly conserved miRNA in plant lineages known to function in growth and development processes, such as lateral root development, and in responses to salt and metal stress. In the ecological model species, Nicotiana attenuata, miR390's biological function remains unknown, which we explore here with a gain-of-function analysis with plants over-expressing (OE-) N. attenuata miR390 (Na-miR390) in glasshouse and natural environments. OEmiR390 plants showed normal developmental processes, including lateral root formation or reproductive output, in plants grown under standard conditions in the glasshouse. OEmiR390 plants did not have dramatically altered interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Fusarium pathogens, or herbivores. However, Na-miR390 regulated the plant's tolerance of herbivory. Caterpillar feeding elicits the accumulation of a suite of phytohormones, including auxin and jasmonates, which further regulate host-tolerance. The increase in Na-miR390 abundance reduces the accumulation of auxin but does not influence levels of other phytohormones including jasmonates (JA, JA-Ile), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). Na-miR390 overexpression reduces reproductive output, quantified as capsule production, when plants are attacked by herbivores. Exogenous auxin treatments of herbivore-attacked plants restored capsule production to wild-type levels. During herbivory, Na-miR390 transcript abundances are increased; its overexpression reduces the abundances of auxin biosynthesizing YUCCA and ARF (mainly ARF4) transcripts during herbivory. Furthermore, the accumulation of auxin-regulated phenolamide secondary metabolites (caffeoylputrescine, dicaffeoylspermidine) is also reduced. In N. attenuata, miR390 functions in modulating tolerance responses of herbivore-attacked plants.

AB  - Lactobacillus curvatus HY7602 fermented antler (FA) ameliorates sarcopenia and improves exercise performance by increasing muscle mass, muscle fiber regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis; however, its anti-fatigue and antioxidant effects have not been studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-fatigue and antioxidant effects and mechanisms of FA. C2C12 and HepG2 cells were stimulated with 1 mM of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative stress, followed by treatment with FA. Additionally, 44-week-old C57BL/6J mice were orally administered FA for 4 weeks. FA treatment (5-100 mu g/mL) significantly attenuated H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo experiments showed that FA treatment significantly increased the mobility time of mice in the forced swimming test and significantly downregulated the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate. Notably, FA treatment significantly upregulated the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) and increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, GPx1, GPx2, and GSR) in the liver. Conclusively, FA is a potentially useful functional food ingredient for improving fatigue through its antioxidant effects.

AB  - The study of fear conditioning has led to a better understanding of fear and anxiety-based disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite the fact many of these disorders are more common in women than in men, the vast majority of work investigating fear conditioning in rodents has been conducted in males. The goal of the work presented here was to better understand how biological sex affects contextual fear conditioning and expression. To this end, rats of both sexes were trained to fear a specific context and fear responses were measured upon re-exposure to the conditioning context. In the first experiment, male and female rats were given context fear conditioning and tested the next day during which freezing behavior was measured. In the second experiment, rats were trained and tested in a similar fashion while fear-potentiated startle and defecation were measured. We found that males showed more freezing behavior than females during a fear expression test. The expression of fear-potentiated startle did not differ between sexes, while males exhibited more defecation during a test in a novel context. These data suggest that the expression of defensive behavior differs between sexes and highlight the importance of using multiple measures of fear when comparing between sexes.

AB  - Premise Floral scent is a complex trait that mediates many plant-insect interactions, but our understanding of how floral scent variation evolves, either independently or in concert with other traits, remains limited. Assessing variation in floral scent at multiple levels of biological organization and comparing patterns of variation in scent to variation in other floral traits can contribute to our understanding of how scent variation evolves in nature. Methods We used a greenhouse common garden experiment to investigate variation in floral scent at three scales-within plants, among plants, and among populations-and to determine whether scent, alone or in combination with morphology and rewards, contributes to population differentiation in Oenothera cespitosa subsp. marginata. Its range spans most of the biomes in the western United States, such that variation in both the abiotic and biotic environment could contribute to trait variation. Results Multiple analytical approaches demonstrated substantial variation among and within populations in compound-specific and total floral scent measures. Overall, populations were differentiated in morphology and reward traits and in scent. Across populations, coupled patterns of variation in linalool, leucine-derived compounds, and hypanthium length are consistent with a long-tongued moth pollination syndrome. Conclusions The considerable variation in floral scent detected within populations suggests that, similar to other floral traits, variation in floral scent may have a heritable genetic component. Differences in patterns of population differentiation in floral scent and in morphology and rewards indicate that these traits may be shaped by different selective pressures.

AB  - Simple Summary The use of fibrous dietary ingredients can improve the profitability of pig production but can have detrimental effects on nutrient digestibility. To improve the utilisation of dietary fibre in pigs, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of increasing levels of xylanase supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, gut morphology and faecal volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations in weaning pigs. Xylanase significantly improved growth and nutrient digestibility, while also changing gut structure and metabolite levels, perhaps suggesting an underlying shift in intestinal microbiota. The addition of xylanase to piglet diets is known to improve performance and nutrient digestibility. The present study aimed to assess the impact of new xylanase on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and gut function of weaned piglets. A total of 144 pigs, weaned at 28 days (7.48 kg initial body weight, IBW), were assigned to 36 pens and 9 pens per treatment. Dietary treatments were a basal complex control diet, and the basal diet supplemented with 45,000, 90,000 and 135,000 U/kg xylanase. Performance was measured at days 0, 14 and 35. At day 35, samples were collected for assessment of intestinal histology, and volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations. After two weeks post-weaning, additional 12 piglets (11.34 kg IBW) were placed in metabolic crates for assessment of apparent total tract nutrient digestibility using a dietary marker. The addition of xylanase at 90,000 and 135,000 U/kg significantly improved average daily gain (333.6 g/day control, 364.86 g/day, 90,000 U/kg, 405.89 g/day, 135,000 U/kg, p < 0.05), G:F (0.557 control, 0.612 90,000 U/kg, 0.692 135,000 U/kg, p < 0.05), and reduced diarrhoea. This was driven improved nutrient digestibility and villus height in the jejunum (372.87 mu m control, 432.53 mu m 45,000 U/kg, 465.80 mu m 90,000 U/kg, 491.28 mu m 135,000 U/kg, p < 0.05). Xylanase supplementation also linearly increased faecal butyrate levels and had a quadratic relationship with propionate concentrations. 135,000 U/kg xylanase also reduced ammonia emissions. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with xylanase improved growth performance and feed efficiency in weaning piglets, likely driven by improvements to gut structure and function.

AB  - Simple Summary GH/IGF axis genes play a central role in the regulation of skeletal accretion during development and growth, and thus represent candidate genes for growth traits. Retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms are major contributors to structural variations. They tend to generate large effect mutations resulting in variations in target gene activity and phenotype due to the fact that they carry functional elements, such as enhancers, insulators, or promoters. In the present study, RIPs in four GH/IGF axis genes (GH, GHR, IGF1, and IGF1R) were investigated by comparative genomics and PCR. Four RIPs in the GHR gene and one RIP in the IGF1 gene were identified. Further analysis revealed that one RIP in the first intron of GHR might play a role in the regulation of GHR expression by acting as a repressor. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of RIPs in the genetic variation of GH/IGF axis genes and phenotypic variation in pigs. The genetic diversity of the GH/IGF axis genes and their association with the variation of gene expression and phenotypic traits, principally represented by SNPs, have been extensively reported. Nevertheless, the impact of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) on the GH/IGF axis gene activity has not been reported. In the present study, bioinformatic prediction and PCR verification were performed to screen RIPs in four GH/IGF axis genes (GH, GHR, IGF1 and IGF1R). In total, five RIPs, including one SINE RIP in intron 3 of IGF1, one L1 RIP in intron 7 of GHR, and three SINE RIPs in intron 1, intron 5 and intron 9 of GHR, were confirmed by PCR, displaying polymorphisms in diverse breeds. Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that the SINE insertion in intron 1 of GHR significantly repressed the GHR promoter activity in PK15, Hela, C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, qPCR results confirmed that this SINE insertion was associated with a decreased expression of GHR in the leg muscle and longissimus dorsi, indicating that it may act as a repressor involved in the regulation of GHR expression. In summary, our data revealed that RIPs contribute to the genetic variation of GH/IGF axis genes, whereby one SINE RIP in the intron 1 of GHR may decrease the expression of GHR by acting as a repressor.

AB  - The BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT (BZR1) transcription factor family is a key transcription factor downstream of the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway that plays a critical role in plant growth and resistance to environmental stress. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a perennial plant with important economic value. In this study, a total of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 7 CsBZR1s were identified from the genomes of wild tea plant ('DASZ') and four tea cultivars ('Longjing 43,' 'Shuchazao,' 'Tieguanyin,' and 'Huangdan'), respectively. The phylogenetic tree analysis classified the 33 CsBZR1s into four groups, with members in the same classification having similar conserved motifs. Covariance and gene structure analysis revealed that two CsBZR1 genes (DACsBZR1.1, DACsBZR1.4) have high sequence alignment rates among the five tea genomes. One unique CsBZR1 gene present in each of 'DASZ,' 'Longjing 43,' 'Shuchazao,' and 'Huangdan.' In comparison, 'Tieguanyin' has three specific CsBZR1 genes. The upstream promoter sequences of 33 CsBZR1 genes contain many regulatory elements associated with hormone and stress responses. The expression levels of lj43CsBZR1s and sczCsBZR1s in different tissues of tea plants were significantly different. Under hormonal (GA, ABA, and BR) and abiotic stress (cold, heat, drought, and salt) treatments, most lj43CsBZR1s and sczCsBZR1s showed up-regulation in their expression levels. The relative expression levels of lj43CsBZR1s and sczCsBZR1s under GA and heat treatments were significantly higher than those under other treatments. This study provided a potential theoretical basis for the analysis of the function of CsBZR1 protein and its regulatory mechanism in response to hormone and abiotic stress in tea plants.

AB  - Soil bacteria that associate with plant roots promote host vigor. Legume plants form mutualisms with rhizobial bacteria, and legumes grown with rhizobia have more nutrients and defenses than those grown without rhizobia. However, few studies have tested how stressors such as herbivores affect soil rhizobia, and the mechanisms mediating these interactions. Here we tested reciprocal interactions between a chewing herbivore, Sitona lineatus (pea leaf weevil), and Pisum sativum (pea) plants grown with or without rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar. viciae), and the plant-defense and nutritional mechanisms mediat-ing these interactions. We hypothesized that plants grown with rhizobia would have less feeding from S. lineatus due to greater expression of phytohormones or physical defenses. We also predicted that herbivory might impede the mutualism between P. sativum and rhizobia. Our experiments showed that leaf defoliation by S. lineatus was indeed lowest on plants with rhizobia. Plants grown with rhizobia had increased gene transcript expression associated with hormone-related defense (jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid) as well as physical and antioxidant-related defense, which may explain reduced feeding by S. lineatus. Conversely, S. lineatus feeding reduced the number of root nodules and nodule fresh weight, suggesting a disruption of the symbiosis between plants and rhizobia. Our study shows that aboveground herbivores can engage in mutually antagonistic interactions with soil microbes that are mediated through multiple plant-mediated pathways.

AB  - Synaptic dysfunction is associated with early neurodegenerative changes and cognitive deficits. Neuronal cellspecific alternative splicing (AS) programs exclusively encode unique neuron- and synapse-specific proteins. However, it remains unclear whether splicing disturbances in neurons influence the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Here, we observed that RNA-binding motif protein 24 (RBM24) expression was decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Using conditional RBM24 knockout mice, we demonstrated that deletion of RBM24 in the brain resulted in learning and memory impairment. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices from mice lacking RBM24 revealed multiple defects in excitatory synaptic function and plasticity. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and splicing analysis showed that RBM24 regulates a network of genes related to cognitive function. Deletion of RBM24 disrupted the AS of synapse-associated genes, including GluR2 and Prrt1, the major disease genes involved in cognitive impairment and memory loss, leading to cognitive dysfunction. Together, our results suggest that the regulation of mRNA splicing by RBM24 is a key process involved in maintaining normal synaptic function and provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of AD.

AB  - Total number born (TNB), number of stillborn (NSB), and gestation length (GL) are economically important traits in pig production, and disentangling the molecular mechanisms associated with traits can provide valuable insights into their genetic structure. Genotype imputation can be used as a practical tool to improve the marker density of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips based on sequence data, thereby dramatically improving the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this study, we applied Beagle software to impute the 50 K chip data to the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with average imputation accuracy (R-2) of 0.876. The target pigs, 2655 Large White pigs introduced from Canadian and French lines, were genotyped by a GeneSeek Porcine 50K chip. The 30 Large White reference pigs were the key ancestral individuals sequenced by whole-genome resequencing. To avoid population stratification, we identified genetic variants associated with reproductive traits by performing within-population GWAS and cross-population meta-analyses with data before and after imputation. Finally, several genes were detected and regarded as potential candidate genes for each of the traits: for the TNB trait: NOTCH2, KLF3, PLXDC2, NDUFV1, TLR10, CDC14A, EPC2, ORC4, ACVR2A, and GSC; for the NSB trait: NUB1, TGFBR3, ZDHHC14, FGF14, BAIAP2L1, EVI5, TAF1B, and BCAR3; for the GL trait: PPP2R2B, AMBP, MALRD1, HOXA11, and BICC1. In conclusion, expanding the size of the reference population and finding an optimal imputation strategy to ensure that more loci are obtained for GWAS under high imputation accuracy will contribute to the identification of causal mutations in pig breeding.

AB  - The adsorption performance of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is limited owing to self-aggregation. To avoid this and effectively control the eutrophication of water bodies, biochar (BC) was synthesized, herein, by pyrolyzing waste sheep manure at 500 & DEG;C, and Ca-Al-LDHs were loaded on the surface via a coprecipitation method to obtain Ca-Al-LDHs-BC(CA) composites with varying LDH contents. The fitted maximum adsorption capacities of the CA-5%, CA-10%, CA-15%, and CA-20% samples (corresponding to samples with 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% LDHs, respectively) were 10.21, 16.14, 22.40, and 28.47 mg g(-1), which were (when converted into metal proportions) 1.48, 1.23, 1.15, and 1.13 times of that of single hydrotalcite, respectively. The double-layer model was fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt iterative algorithm, which when combined with the characterization results, confirmed that the adsorption of phosphate ions by CA-BC occurred via the double-layer adsorption mechanism. Two types of direct adsorption were observed: ion exchange, which resulted in first-layer adsorption, and ligand exchange, which resulted in second-layer adsorption, with first-layer adsorption accounting for a higher proportion. This double-layer adsorption mechanism showed that LDHs-BC could achieve higher ligand exchange performance compared to that achieved using only LDHs.

AB  - Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism and fat deposition. The transcription of the ACSL1 gene is regulated specifically among cells and physiological processes, and transcriptional regulation of ACSL1 in adipogenesis remains elusive. Here, we characterize transcription factors (TFs) associated with adipogenesis in the porcine ACSL1 gene. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)& alpha;, a well-known adipogenic marker, was found to enhance the expression of the ACSL1 gene via binding two tandem motifs in the promoter. Further, we demonstrate that ACSL1 mediates C/EBP & alpha; effects on adipogenesis in preadipocytes cultured from subcutaneous fat tissue of pigs via gain- and loss-of-function analyses. The cAMP-response element binding protein, another TF involved in adipogenesis, was also identified in the regulation of ACSL1 gene expression. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened in the promoter of ACSL1 among four breeds including the Chinese indigenous Min, and Duroc, Berkshire, and Yorkshire pigs through sequencing of PCR products. Two tightly linked SNPs, -517G>T and -311T>G, were found exclusively in Min pigs. The haplotype mutation decreases promoter activity in PK-15 and ST cells, and in vivo the expression of ACSL1, illustrating a possible role in adipogenesis regulated by C/EBP & alpha;/ACSL1 axis. Additionally, a total of 24 alternative splicing transcripts were identified, indicating the complexity of alternative splicing in the ACSL1 gene. The results will contribute to further revealing the regulatory mechanisms of ACSL1 during adipogenesis and to the characterization of molecular markers for selection of fat deposition in pigs.

AB  - With the development of precision pig industry and the growing demands for pork products, it is of great significance to monitor the health of pigs. The reported detection methods suffer harmful, time-consuming, complex and expensive. Acoustic detection is a simple and effective contactless method to judge the health status of pigs. Strain sensor as an important contactless method has attracted wide research interest in acoustic detection. However, most strain sensors cannot accurately detect pig sounds due to their low sensitivity, slow response, and susceptibility to interference. In this work, a crack-based rGO strain sensor is proposed and exhibits unique "halfopen, half-close" microstructures. The strain changes the crack gaps, resulting in the resistance of sensor increases. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity and fast response in a wide frequency range from 110 Hz to 5000 Hz and its Delta R/R0 increases monotonically with increasing acoustic intensity. In addition, the rGO sensor is directional and thus has anti-interference ability to noise. The rGO sensor is applied for pig acoustic recognition and the measured results agree well with the original audios. In conclusion, the crack-based rGO strain sensor with high sensitivity, fast response and anti-interference shows great potential for pig acoustic recognition and its detected results can provide a reference for pig health monitoring.

AB  - Large changes in Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) size-at-age across decades have affected available fishery yield and management decisions. Characterizing mechanisms driving variability in size-at-age of adult Pacific halibut is challenging due to uncertainty associated with spatial and temporal partitioning of the phenomenon. We explored spatial and temporal changes in size-at-age structure of Pacific halibut in the Gulf of Alaska during 1998-2021, and the relationship between spatial patterns in size-at-age and diet using delta 13C and delta 15N analysis of muscle tissues collected in 2018. Pacific halibut size-at-age was spatially and temporally structured across the study area, with distinct regions of persistent anomalously high or low relative size-at-age. Further, trophic feeding level varied spatially and diet was related to size-at-age. Our results provide important context for investigations of specific mechanisms influencing Pacific halibut size-at-age and future research on Pacific halibut ecology. We recommend revisiting fundamental aspects of Pacific halibut biology, sampling methodology, and management practices from this spatiotemporal perspective.

AB  - Simple Summary: The livestock industry urgently needs alternatives to antibiotics, especially in post-weaning piglets. Numerous studies support the notion that dietary supplementation probiotics seem to be one of the most promising tactics to reduce post-weaning diarrhea in pigs. Bacillus li-caniforms S6 (BL-S6) supplementation in piglets was investigated for its effect on growth performance and gut health. The researchers found that BL-S6 supplementation modulated the piglet's immunity-oxidative capacity and composition of the cecum microbiota, which would, in turn, modulate intestinal barrier function, and eventually improve growth performance and relieves diarrhea. We highlight the potential role of BL-S6 as an option to improve growth performance and relieve diarrhea in pig production.
   Bacillus licheniformis (B. Licheniformis) has been considered to be an effective probiotic to maintain gut health and boost productivity in the pig industry, but there is no complete understanding of its mechanisms. We determined whether weaned piglets exposed to BL-S6 (probiotic) had altered intestinal barrier function or microbiota composition. In our study, 108 weaned piglets (54 barrows and 54 gilts) were divided equally into three groups, each with six pens and six piglets/pen, and fed a basal diet supplemented without or with antibiotic (40 g/t of Virginiamycin and 500 g/t of Chlortetracycline) or probiotic (1000 g/t of B. Licheniformis) for a 14-day trial. On day 14, one piglet was chosen from each pen to collect blood and intestinal samples. Compared with the control group, dietary supplementation with a probiotic promoted body weight (BW) gain and average daily gains (ADG) while reducing diarrhea incidence (p < 0.05). Probiotics enhanced superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum (p < 0.05), and increased the level of mRNA expression of SOD1, Nrf2, and HO-1 (p < 0.05) in the jejunum mucosa. Moreover, supplementation with probiotics improved intestinal mucosal integrity as evidenced by higher villus heights and a higher ratio of villus heights to crypt depths (duodenum and jejunum) and higher mRNA and protein levels of occludin and ZO-1 in jejunum mucosa (p < 0.05). The intestinal sIgA levels (p < 0.05) were elevated in the probiotic group, and that of serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) tended to be higher (p = 0.09). Furthermore, weaning piglets who were given probiotics had a better balance of the cecum microbiota, with lactobacillus abundance increased and clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 abundance decreased. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with the probiotic BL-S6 promoted intestinal integrity, which was associated, in part, with modulating intestinal barrier function and microbial diversity in weaned piglets; it may offer a promising alternative to antibiotics to prevent diarrhea.

AB  - Distinct brain systems are thought to support statistical learning over different timescales. Regularities encountered during online perceptual experience can be acquired rapidly by the hippocampus. Further pro-cessing during offline consolidation can establish these regularities gradually in cortical regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These mechanisms of statistical learning may be critical during spatial navi-gation, for which knowledge of the structure of an environment can facilitate future behavior. Rapid acquisition and prolonged retention of regularities have been investigated in isolation, but how they interact in the context of spatial navigation is unknown. We had the rare opportunity to study the brain systems underlying both rapid and gradual timescales of statistical learning using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) longitudinally in the same patient over a period of three weeks. As hypothesized, spatial patterns were represented in the hip-pocampus but not mPFC for up to one week after statistical learning and then represented in the mPFC but not hippocampus two and three weeks after statistical learning. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hippocampus may contribute to the initial extraction of regularities prior to cortical consolidation.

AB  - Premise Mismatches between light conditions and light-capture strategy can reduce plant performance and prevent colonization of novel habitats. Although light-capture strategies tend to be highly conserved among closely related species, evolutionary transitions from shaded to unshaded habitats (and vice versa) occur in numerous plant lineages. Methods We combined phylogenetic approaches with field and greenhouse experiments to investigate evolutionary constraints on light-capture strategy in North American milkweeds (genus Asclepias) and to determine whether colonization of shaded habitats in this heliophilic clade is associated with reduced plasticity and attenuation of the shade avoidance response. Results Colonization of shaded habitats has occurred at least 10 times in this genus, including at least once in each major North American clade. Evolutionary transitions between habitats exhibit strong directional bias, with shifts from full-sun to shaded habitats occurring at least three times as often as the opposite transition. In field and greenhouse experiments, sun species responded to shade by increasing internode length, height, and specific leaf area, consistent with the shade avoidance response; paired shade species exhibited reduced plasticity overall, and only one trait (specific leaf area) responded to experimental shade. Conclusions Our results suggest that milkweeds colonized shaded environments multiple times using a light-capture strategy distinct from the ancestral (putatively shade avoidant) strategy, including a general attenuation of plasticity in response to variable light conditions. This pattern bolsters the notion that shade avoidance and tolerance represent divergent evolutionary strategies for maximizing performance under qualitatively different types of shade.

AB  - The present study explores the compatible interaction between Arabidopsis thaliana and Myzus persicae to reduce host resistance from the previous aphid herbivore-mediated priming. The resumption of host resistance from the "reduced host resistance" was also recorded in due time when aphid herbivore was removed from leaf foliage. The vascular sap, isolated from the midpoint timing from the "reduced host resistance" to the "resumed host resistance" phase resolved in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis that identified an enrichment of dodecanoic acid (DA), an antibacterial metabolite and a saturated medium-chain fatty acid with a 12-carbon backbone. DA infiltration into leaf foliage revealed a significant reduction of aphid clonal proliferation on leaf foliage with concomitant reduction of the vascular microbiota titer as well as aphid body. The "resumed host resistance" from "reduced host resistance" also showed a comparable microbiota titer in comparison to control but the "reduced host resistance" evidenced a significant higher microbiota titer which was correlated with an enhanced aphid clonal proliferation on the leaf foliage. The DA infiltrated leaf foliage had no effect on total vascular sap ingestion by the aphid herbivore but induced RNA level of GUS expression under the control of promoter of pad-4, mpl-1, and sag-13. A similar pattern of gus expression was recorded from aphid herbivore. Thus, DA mediates aphid resistance toward aphid clonal proliferation in the host plant by manipulating vascular and aphid body microbiota titer.

AB  - Simple Summary The quality of wool is directly related to the development of hair follicles. The effect of hair follicles on hair growth is related to the processes of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Therefore, research on HFSCs in agricultural animals is rapidly gaining attention. The microRNA miR-27a has been shown to be involved in several diseases, such as lung cancer, ischemic stroke, neurofibromatosis and acute myocardial infarction, but the role of miR-27a in hair follicle development has not been studied. Here, we revealed that miR-27a is involved in the proliferation and apoptosis of HFSCs through its inhibition of the AKT/MTOR signaling pathway by targeting PIK3R3. We identified an miR-27a/PIK3R3 regulatory network with potential implications for hair follicle development and wool quality. Micro RNAs are regulatory factors in tissue development, organ formation, cell growth, apoptosis and other biological processes. In particular, several miRNAs are related to the development of hair follicles. Here, we investigated the effect of the targeting of PIK3R3 by miR-27a on the AKT/MTOR pathway and on the proliferation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in sheep. Knockdown of the expression of PIK3R3 was found to significantly inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of HFSCs. Similarly, a miR-27a mimic significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of HFSCs. The miR-27a mimic was also shown to significantly inhibit the expression of PIK3R3, AKT, and MTOR and the phosphorylation of AKT and MTOR, while a miR-27a inhibitor increased the expression of these genes. The presence of an miR-27a binding site in the 3 ' UTR of PIK3R3 was identified by a bioinformatics analysis, and the interaction was verified with a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of PIK3R3 mRNA and protein was negatively correlated with the presence of miR-27a, which suggests that this interaction may be involved in the biological impacts on proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, this study demonstrates that miR-27a plays a potential role in the proliferation and apoptosis of sheep hair follicle stem cells by targeting PIK3R3, which can be used to design new methods to improve sheep wool.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fermentative profile, chemical composition, and in situ degradability of total mixed ration silage with or without babassu byproducts formulated for sheep diets. The experiment was performed in a completely randomized design, with four treatments (silages) and five replications (silos). The treatments were SS: sugarcane silage (control); SSCS: sugarcane silage with corn and soybean meal; SSBF: sugarcane silage with corn, soybean meal, and babassu flour; and SSBC: sugarcane silage with corn, soybean meal, and babassu cake. The experimental diets were formulated to be isoprotein, and to meet the nutritional requirements of confined sheep with an average weight of 20 kg, according to Nutrient Requirements of Small Ruminants. The SSCS, SSBF, and SSBC treatments presented the highest values of dry matter recovery (83.74, 82.08, and 83.92%, respectively), and higher dry matter (349.07, 344,39, and 352.32 g/kg, respectively), crude protein (151.19, 136.98, and 142.14 g/kg DM, respectively), and non-fibrous carbohydrate (444.70, 353.40, and 371.30 g/kg DM, respectively) contents than the SS treatment. The largest degradations of DM, CP, and neutral detergent fiber in each treatment occurred at 72 h, in which the SSCS treatments presented the highest degradations in comparison to the others (80.59, 87.89, and 55.68, respectively). The inclusion of babassu byproducts in sugarcane silages in the form of total ration acted positively in the qualitative indicators of the silages, improving the fermentation profile and reducing losses, as well as improving the chemical composition and in situ degradability.

AB  - Genetic non-invasive sampling has been a popular tool in obtaining insight into species' ecology and biology, including demographic parameters, at a large landscape level. The possibility of inflated population estimates due to inherent genotyping errors has been established in the literature. However, the persistence of false 'ghost' individuals, despite widely used remedial measures, may influence population estimates and hence, requires re-examination and validation. Therefore, we used blind sub-samples of known individuals and aimed to (i) provide the extent of correct identification from faecal DNA while following standard protocols, (ii) quantify the error and (iii) suggest remedial measures using Asian elephants as a case study. We used six empirical sub-samples each from eight elephant individuals, resulting in 48 faecal DNA extracts, and genotyped across eight microsatellite markers in four replicates each to obtain consensus data. We tallied the known individual identities with the obtained genotypes of the sub-samples under several marker combinations. We observed that errors remained even after deriving consensus genotypes using a multi-tube approach. The loci-wise proportions of aberrant genotypes ranged up to 23.9%. The overall accuracy of individual assignment ranged from 18.1 to 95.2% under different marker combinations and mismatch thresholds. The combination of five markers allowing one-locus mismatch could group the highest number of empirical sub-samples (n = 28; 84.8%) correctly to their respective known genotypes. Therefore, we suggest undertaking pilot studies to screen microsatellite panels for their accuracy in assigning the identities of faecal DNA samples from known individuals using a blind test approach. Such empirical studies before undertaking large scale molecular census hold the potential to provide accurate demographic estimates.

AB  - Kazakh sheep are typical seasonal estrus animals. Their reproductive system regulation mainly involves the complex regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA), which is also closely related to reproductive hormone secretion. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), synthesized and secreted by the hypothalamus, is the key to controlling sheep reproductive activity. We studied how GNAQ (G protein subunit alpha q) regulates estrus in sheep by controlling GnRH expression and secretion. We used hypothalamic nerve cells as the research model. GNAQ overexpression and RNA interference vectors were constructed and transfected into the hypothalamic nerve cells of fetal Kazakh sheep. qPCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect GNAQ gene expression in Kazakh ewe tissues and analyze its regulatory effect on GnRH expression in the hypothalamic nerve cells. The fetal sheep hypothalamic nerve cells were successfully isolated and cultured. qPCR and cell immunofluorescence showed that the purity of positive cells was >95%. The tissue expression profile showed that there were different degrees of GNAQ gene expression in the Kazakh ewe tissue. Expression levels were relatively higher in the hypothalamus, pituitary, brain, and uterine tissues. When GNAQ expression was downregulated in the hypothalamic nerve cells, the upstream genes KISS1 (kisspeptin), GPR54 (KISS1 receptor), and ER (estrogen receptor) were all upregulated, as were the downstream genes PLCB1 (phospholipase C beta 1), PRKCB (protein kinase C beta), and GNRH. At the same time, GnRH secretion levels were also upregulated. GNAQ regulated its downstream gene PLCB1 in the hypothalamic nerve cells, and directly regulated GnRH expression and secretion through the calcium and PRKC signaling pathways. GNAQ also regulated kisspeptin expression, subsequently regulating GnRH expression and secretion indirectly through the kisspeptin-GPR54 signaling pathway. Our results are of great importance for improving the reproductive performance of seasonal-estrus sheep. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenolamides are important secondary metabolites in plant species. They play important roles in plant defense responses against pathogens and insect herbivores, protection against UV irradiation and floral induction and development. However, the accumulation and variation in phenolamides content in diverse maize lines and the genes responsible for their biosynthesis remain largely unknown. Here, we combined genetic mapping, protein regulatory network and bioinformatics analysis to further enhance the understanding of maize phenolamides biosynthesis. Sixteen phenolamides were identified in multiple populations, and they were all significantly correlated with one or several of 19 phenotypic traits. By linkage mapping, 58, 58, 39 and 67 QTLs, with an average of 3.9, 3.6, 3.6 and 4.2 QTLs for each trait were mapped in BBE1, BBE2, ZYE1 and ZYE2, explaining 9.47%, 10.78%, 9.51% and 11.40% phenotypic variation for each QTL on average, respectively. By GWAS, 39 and 36 significant loci were detected in two different environments, 3.3 and 2.8 loci for each trait, explaining 10.00% and 9.97% phenotypic variation for each locus on average, respectively. Totally, 58 unique candidate genes were identified, 31% of them encoding enzymes involved in amine and derivative metabolic processes. Gene Ontology term analysis of the 358 protein-protein interrelated genes revealed significant enrichment in terms relating to cellular nitrogen metabolism, amine metabolism. GRMZM2G066142, GRMZM2G066049, GRMZM2G165390 and GRMZM2G159587 were further validated involvement in phenolamides biosynthesis. Our results provide insights into the genetic basis of phenolamides biosynthesis in maize kernels, understanding phenolamides biosynthesis and its nutritional content and ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stress.

AB  - Arsenic contamination in drinking water causes a global public health problem. Emerging evidence suggests that arsenic may act as an environmental risk factor for anxiety disorders. However, the exact mechanism underlying the adverse effects has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the anxiety-like behaviors of mice exposed to arsenic trioxide (As2O3), to observe the neuropathological changes, and to explore the link between the GABAergic system and behavioral manifestations. For this purpose, male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to various doses of As2O3 (0, 0.15, 1.5, and 15 mg/L) through drinking water for 12 weeks. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the open field test (OFT), light/dark choice test, and elevated zero maze (EZM). Neuronal injuries in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were assessed by light microscopy with H & E and Nissl staining. Ultrastructural alteration in the cerebral cortex was assessed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The expression levels of GABAergic system-related molecules (i.e., glutamate decarboxylase, GABA transporter, and GABA(B) receptor subunits) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Arsenic exposure showed a striking anxiogenic effect on mice, especially in the group exposed to 15 mg/L As2O3. Light microscopy showed neuron necrosis and reduced cell counts. TEM revealed marked ultrastructural changes, including the vacuolated mitochondria, disrupted Nissl bodies, an indentation in the nucleus membrane, and delamination of myelin sheath in the cortex. In addition, As2O3 influenced the GABAergic system in the PFC by decreasing the expression of the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) and the GABA(B2) receptor subunit, but not the GABA(B1) receptor subunit. To sum up, sub-chronic exposure to As2O3 is associated with increased anxiety-like behaviors, which may be mediated by altered GABAergic signaling in the PFC. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the neurotoxic effects of arsenic and therefore more cautions should be taken.

AB  - Premise Extrafloral nectaries have mainly been studied in angiosperms, but have also been reported in 39 fern species. Here we provide a global review of nectaries in ferns and examined their structure, function, and nectar sugar composition in two genera. Methods We searched in the literature and living plant collections of botanical gardens for indications of fern nectaries, observed nectar-feeding animals, studied the morphoanatomy in the two genera Aglaomorpha and Campyloneurum, and analyzed the total sugar concentrations and ratios of 16 species. Diurnal nectar release was observed with time-lapse photography. Results We found evidence for nectaries in 101 species of ferns from 11 genera and 6 families. Most of the nectary-bearing species were tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) and epiphytic ferns of the family Polypodiaceae. Nectaries consisted of cytoplasm-rich parenchyma with large nuclei and an epidermis with or without stomata, were attached to amphiphloic vascular bundles, and released nectar on the lower leaf surface mainly on expanding leaves during the night. Sugar concentrations varied between species (3.8-15.3%) but not between genera, and were sucrose-dominant (3 spp.), sucrose-rich (7), or hexose-rich (3). In the greenhouse, introduced ants, scale insects, and snails fed on the nectar. Conclusions The wide taxonomic distribution, variable morphology, locations, and sugar compositions point to multiple evolutionary origins of fern nectaries. Nectar release in young leaves might attract mutualistic ants to protect leaves against herbivores only during this most vulnerable developmental stage. Even ex-situ, fern nectar is a valuable food source because it attracted several opportunistic animal species.

AB  - Although many important mediators and critical pathways are found to be involved in host immune responses to Haemonchus contortus infection, the initial responses to infection in the naive and in the previously exposed state have not been compared at the transcriptional level. To further understand the development of adaptive immunity to H. contortus infection, we compared the early abomasal gene expression patterns between a primary and a tertiary challenge for four lines of sheep to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The sheep were from the resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines of two flocks of sheep selected for divergent responses to gastrointestinal parasites (HSF and TSF). The flocks have separate origins and were initiated using two different strains of Merino sheep. One of the DEGs, mast cell proteinase 1, had significantly lower expression in tertiary compared to primary infections for all four lines of sheep. This gene was not identified in previous studies where resistant and susceptible sheep samples were compared within infection time points. Comparing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the two R lines reveals that responses differed very little between the primary and tertiary challenges for HSFR and only two genes were identified, in contrast to the TSFR where there were 134 genes identified including the two identified using the HSFR animals. Similarly, comparing the primary and tertiary challenges for HSFS identified 15 DEGs, whilst for TSFS there were 128 DEGs identified. It is surprising that so few genes respond similarly between the two challenge regimes across the four lines of sheep, and suggests significant differences in immune mechanisms between the two flocks (across the lines) and also between the lines within flocks. Our results offer a quantitative snapshot comparing the transcriptome in the ovine abomasum between primary and tertiary infections with H. contortus in both genetically resistant and susceptible sheep.

AB  - Health risks resulting from dermal or inhalational exposures are frequently assessed based on rodent oral toxicity information due to a lack of species- or route-specific toxicity data. Default uncertainty factors (UFs; e.g., 10-fold) are also applied during risk assessments to account for variability such as inter-species, intra-species, exposure duration, dose-response, and route-to-route extrapolations. However, whether rodent oral data and a default UF approach can provide adequate protection for other mammalian species under dermal or inhalational exposure scenarios remains understudied, particularly for cleaning product ingredients. Therefore, we collated and examined publicly available median lethal dose (LD50), no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) values from different types of standard mammalian toxicity studies for rats (dermal and inhalational), mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs (oral, dermal and inhalational) using the Cleaning Product Ingredient Safety Initiative (CPISI) database. Probabilistic hazard assessments using chemical toxicity distributions (CTDs) were subsequently conducted, and threshold concentrations (TCs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived to identify thresholds of toxicological concern (TTCs). Relative sensitivities among or between mammalian species, exposure routes, and chemical classes were also compared based on calculated TC5s and 95% CIs to support future toxicology studies and hazard and risk assessments. We then identified uncertainty factors (UFs) using both CTD comparisons and individual UF probability distributional approaches. Based on available rodent inhalational data, chemical category-specific UFs were derived for ethers. Additionally, we also determined whether default UFs of 10 or 100 would be protective for various distributions of cleaning product ingredients. Our novel observations among these routes of exposure and common mammalian model organisms appear particularly useful for read across and screening-level health hazard and risk assessments when limited data exists for specific chemicals.

AB  - During the last years, the role of astro- and microglial cells and associated neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of epilepsy has been extensively discussed. These cells can be in different functional state. The extreme A1 and M1 phenotypes producing predominantly pro-inflammatory (promoting epileptogenesis) proteins and the A2 and M2 phenotypes producing anti-inflammatory (preventing epileptogenesis) proteins. It has been suggested that the use of drugs that can stimulate polarisation from M1 and A1 to M2 and A2 phenotypes may be a successful strategy for the treatment of epilepsy. Such drugs include agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nuclear receptors (PPARs). The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the expression of micro- and astroglial proteins involved in the regulation of epileptogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus of rats in the lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and to investigate the effect of the PPAR agonist beta/delta cardarine on these processes. Cardarine was administered at the initial stages of epileptogenesis (within 7 days after induction of the TLE model), and two months later (chronic phase of the model) we analysed the expression of genes of interest in the dorsal hippocampus by real-time RT-PCR. The performed study revealed changes in gene expression of astro- and microglial proteins during epileptogenesis, mainly associated with the enhancement of neuroinflammatory processes and weakening of neuroprotective properties of these cells. In TLE rats the expression of genes of markers of astro- (Gfap) and microglia activation (Aif1), pro- (Il1b, Nlrp3) and anti-inflammatory (Il1rn) proteins, markers of the A1 phenotype of astrocytes (Lcn2, Gbp2) and growth factors (Bdnf, Fgf2) was increased. Gene expression of the protective M2 phenotype Arg1 gene was decreased in TLE rats. The most striking effect of cardarine administration was manifested in the enhanced expression of the marker A2 gene of the S100a10 astrocyte phenotype.

AB  - Simple Summary Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites of fungi that frequently contaminate animal feed and human food in different combinations; therefore, it is of great importance to determine the effects of mycotoxin co-contamination. Pigs are one of the most sensitive animal species to Fusarium mycotoxins, and the liver is an important site of mycotoxin metabolism. The objective of the present research was to determine histopathological changes, apoptosis, and proliferation in the liver of gilts fed with Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated feed for a prolonged time at the end of their pregnancy and until weaning of their piglets. Additionally, the same parameters were evaluated in the liver of their piglets to determine whether Fusarium mycotoxins would affect the offspring. The results revealed increased hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis as well as sinusoidal leukocytosis with inflammatory infiltrates of hepatic lobules in experimental gilts, but no significant changes were observed in the piglet livers, implying that the utilized concentrations and duration of exposure did not cause detrimental effects on them. Interestingly, the amount of interlobular connective tissue in the liver of experimental gilts was significantly decreased. The obtained results emphasized the need to evaluate Fusarium mycotoxin concentrations in feed because even at low concentrations, they can cause adverse effects, but there is less concern for severe detrimental effects on the offspring. Mycotoxins are common fungal secondary metabolites in both animal feed and human food, representing widespread toxic contaminants that cause various adverse effects. Co-contamination with different mycotoxins is frequent; therefore, this study focused on feed contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins, namely, deoxynivalenol (5.08 mg/kg), zearalenone (0.09 mg/kg), and fusaric acid (21.6 mg/kg). Their effects on the liver of gilts and their piglets were chosen as the research subject as pigs are one of the most sensitive animal species that are also physiologically very similar to humans. The gilts were fed the experimental diet for 54 +/- 1 day, starting late in their pregnancy and continuing until roughly a week after weaning of their piglets. Livers of gilts and their piglets were assessed for different histopathological changes, apoptosis, and proliferation activity of hepatocytes. On histopathology, gilts fed the experimental diet had a statistically significant increase in hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis (p = 0.0318) as well as sinusoidal leukocytosis with inflammatory infiltrates of hepatic lobules (p = 0.0004). The amount of interlobular connective tissue in the liver of experimental gilts was also significantly decreased (p = 0.0232), implying a disruption in the formation of fibrous connective tissue. Apoptosis of hepatocytes and of cells in hepatic sinusoids, further assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay, showed a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0224 and p = 0.0007, respectively). No differences were observed in piglet livers. These results indicated that Fusarium mycotoxins elicited increased apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation in the liver of gilts, but caused no effects on the liver of piglets at these concentrations.

AB  - The experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of Cadmium (Cd) on growth performance, blood biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, hepatocyte apoptosis and autophagy of weaned piglets. A total of 12 healthy weaned piglets were randomly assigned to the control and the Cd group, which were fed with a basal diet and the basal diet supplemented with 15 +/- 0.242 mg/kg CdCl2 for 30 d, respectively. Our results demonstrated that Cd significantly decreased final body weight, average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and increased feed-to-gain (F/G) ratio (P < 0.05). For blood biochemical parameters, Cd treatment significantly decreased the red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), total protein, albumin, copper content and iron content (P < 0.05). In addition, liver injury was observed in the Cd-exposed group. Our results also demonstrated that Cd exposure contributed to the production of ROS, activated the AMPK/PPAR-gamma/NF-kappa B pathway (increasing the expressions of P-AMPK/AMPK, NF-kappa B, I-kappa B-beta, COX-2, and iNOS, decreasing the expressions of PPAR-gamma and I-kappa B-alpha), finally induced autophagy (increasing the expressions of Beclin-1, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and p62), and apoptosis (increasing the expressions of Bax, Bak, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3, decreasing the expression of Bcl-2). Overall, these findings revealed the vital role of AMPK/PPAR-gamma/NF-kappa B pathway in Cd-induced liver apoptosis and autophagy, which provided deeper insights into a better understanding of Cd-induced hepatotoxicity.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.), the staple food for half of the world's population, suffers heavy damage by insect herbivores, especially the emerging fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda. HIGHER YIELD RICE (HYR), a master regulator of multiple biological pathways with an established gene regulatory network, has been found to improve rice yield to similar to 29% and tolerance to environmental stress. However, its impact on defense has not been explored. We hypothesized that, FAW would target HYR plants because of its vigorous growth and lead to trade-offs for defense. Through a series of experiments with HYR and its wild type (WT), we show that HYR plants have enhanced below-ground growth, physiological traits, and direct and indirect defense traits including leaf trichomes, wax, and volatile organic compounds. To test possible phytohormone-mediated defense signaling, we focussed on jasmonic acid and salicylic acid gene expression panel and found that most of these genes are highly expressed in HYR when compared to its WT counterpart. Bioassays examining developmental milestones also revealed that HYR plants effectively deter FAW, and when force-fed, caused negative effects. Collectively, our findings suggest that the master regulator HYR (Higher Yield Rice expressing) plants enhance growth and physiological traits, as well as physical and chemical defense mechanisms through co-ordinated defense gene expression, which deter herbivore feeding, growth, development, and host selection.

AB  - This study provides a pioneering analysis of the structural and topological characteristics of one of nature's simplest food webs, using the Montana Clara islet (Canary Islands) as a case study. Applying a multilayer network approach, which assesses multiple interaction types, we examined plant-animal and plant-fungi interactions during two seasons (humid and dry), comparing this oceanic island food web to one from Na Redona, a small continental island in the Balearic Islands. Data were collected through field observations, flower visitation records, fecal analysis, and DNA metabarcoding of root-associated fungi. The study identified 63 animal species and 367 fungal amplicon sequence variants interacting with 13 plant species, five of which (38%) were structurally significant, as indicated by high multilayer versatility values (>0.5). The network structure was modular, with 23 modules primarily representing single ecological functions, and most species were involved in only one interaction type. Notably, 73% of species shifted roles between interaction layers. Results reveal that Montana Clara's food web is simpler but more modular and versatile than that of the continental island, aligning with island biogeography theory. The study suggests that the unique biodiversity composition of oceanic islands, particularly islets, influences their ecological network structures.

AB  - Simple Summary The dromedary is a multipurpose livestock species. Growing interest in dromedary meat production, increasing intensification of meat production systems and rising business turnover for the dromedary athletic competition sector point to the need for a more effective genetic selection. To this aim, the identification of genetic markers, to be implemented in phenotype-genotype association studies, represents a pre-requisite. The myostatin gene is known to affect, to a various extent, muscularity in several animal species. In this study, we investigated the dromedary myostatin gene sequence variation through the analysis of data from 183 worldwide animals. A total of 99 variants were detected in the target region. Through a bioinformatic approach, we explored the possible functional effects of the detected variants. Several hints emerged, suggesting that natural variants at the dromedary myostatin locus may determine quali-quantitative changes in the myostatin expression, thus likely impacting on dromedary muscularity. Further efforts are needed to collect reliable phenotypic data on dromedary muscularity and racing performances, thus allowing for the unveiling of those genetic markers that are associated with the phenotypic variability in muscularity-related traits. Under intensive rearing systems, large-scale screening of genotypes at those markers in dromedary populations will effectively orient selection decisions and positively impact on rates of genetic gain. Myostatin (MSTN) is a highly conserved negative regulator of skeletal muscle in mammals. Inactivating mutations results in a hyper-muscularity phenotype known as "double muscling" in several livestock and model species. In Camelus dromedarius, the gene structure organization and the sequence polymorphisms have been previously investigated, using Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing technologies on a limited number of animals. Here, we carried out a follow-up study with the aim to further expand our knowledge about the sequence polymorphisms at the myostatin locus, through the whole-genome sequencing data of 183 samples representative of the geographical distribution range for this species. We focused our polymorphism analysis on the +/- 5 kb upstream and downstream region of the MSTN gene. A total of 99 variants (77 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and 22 indels) were observed. These were mainly located in intergenic and intronic regions, with only six synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in exons. A sequence comparative analysis among the three species within the Camelus genus confirmed the expected higher genetic distance of C. dromedarius from the wild and domestic two-humped camels compared to the genetic distance between C. bactrianus and C. ferus. In silico functional prediction highlighted: (i) 213 differential putative transcription factor-binding sites, out of which 41 relative to transcription factors, with known literature evidence supporting their involvement in muscle metabolism and/or muscle development; and (ii) a number of variants potentially disrupting the canonical MSTN splicing elements, out of which two are discussed here for their potential ability to generate a prematurely truncated (inactive) form of the protein.
   The distribution of the considered variants in the studied cohort is discussed in light of the peculiar evolutionary history of this species and the hypothesis that extremely high muscularity, associated with a homozygous condition for mutated (inactivating) alleles at the myostatin locus, may represent, in arid desert conditions, a clear metabolic disadvantage, emphasizing the thermoregulatory and water availability challenges typical of these habitats.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to estimate the (co)variance components and genetic parameters of body weights recorded in Landlly piglets from birth to weaning at weekly intervals (w0 to w6). The data pertained to body weights of 2462 piglets, born to 91 sires and 159 dams across different generations during a 7-year period from 2014 to 2020. Five animal models (I-V), differentiated by inclusion or exclusion of maternal effects with or without covariance between maternal and direct genetic effects, were fitted on the data using the Bayesian algorithm. The analyses were implemented by Gibbs sampling in the BLUPF90 program and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology was used to draw samples of posterior distribution pertaining to (co)variance components. Based on deviance information criteria (DIC), model V with inclusion of direct additive genetic, direct maternal genetic and permanent environmental effect of dam as random factors along with covariance between direct additive and maternal effects best fitted the data on pre-weaning traits (w0 to w5). Whereas, model I incorporating only the direct additive genetic effect best fitted the weaning weight (w6) data in Landlly piglets. The posterior mean estimates of direct heritability under the best models for W0 to W6 were 0.13, 0.19, 0.29, 0.13, 0.26, 0.32 and 0.46, respectively. Inclusion of the maternal component helped in better partitioning of variance for different body weights in Landlly piglets. The maternal heritability ranged from 0.06 to 0.14, while the litter heritability ranged from 0.11 to 0.15 for pre-weaning weights (W0 to W5) under the best-fit models. The influence of maternal environment was greater than maternal genetic effect from birth to 4th week of age. The results implied that variations in body weight of Landlly pigs were genetically controlled to moderate levels (especially w2 and w4) with contributions from direct additive and maternal genotype that can be exploited by designing efficient breeding programmes.

AB  - The effect of humidity on sheep wool during irradiation by an accelerated electron beam was examined. Each of the samples with 10%, 53%, and 97% relative humidity (RH) absorbed a dose of 0, 109, and 257 kGy, respectively. After being freely kept in common laboratory conditions, the samples were subjected to batch Co(II) sorption experiments monitored with VIS spectrometry for different lapses from electron beam exposure. Along with the sorption, FTIR spectral analysis of the wool samples was conducted for cysteic acid and cystine monoxide, and later, the examination was completed, with pH measuring 0.05 molar KCl extract from the wool samples. Besides a relationship to the absorbed dose and lapse, the sorptivity results showed considerable dependence on wool humidity under exposure. When humidity was deficient (10% RH), the sorptivity was lower due to limited transformation of cystine monoxide to cysteic acid. The wool pre-conditioned at 53% RH, which is the humidity close to common environmental conditions, demonstrated the best Co(II) sorptivity in any case. This finding enables the elimination of pre-exposure wool conditioning in practice. Under excessive humidity of 97% RH and enough high dose of 257 kGy, radiolysis of water occurred, deteriorating the sorptivity. Each wool humidity, dose, and lapse showed a particular scenario. The time and humidity variations in the sorptivity for the non-irradiated sample were a little surprising; despite the absence of electron irradiation, relevant results indicated a strong sensitivity to pre-condition humidity and lapse from the start of the monitoring.

AB  - This study selected fruit wood biochar (FWB), walnut shell biochar (WSB) and corncob biochar (CB) to compare and explore the humic acid (HA) formation mechanism differences added to the Chinese herbal residue (CHR) and Sheep manure (SM) composting. The results showed that the addition of multi-source biochar could improve carbon stability. Organic matter (OM) loss rates of CK, FWB, WSB and CB during SM composting were 25.3 %, 22.8 %, 20.8 % and 25.3 %, respectively, and that of CK, FWB, WSB and CB during CHR composting were 62.2 %, 47.9 %, 41.0 % and 43.3 %. Meanwhile, biochar addition promoted the HA formation, especially WSB in SM and CB in CHR. Moreover, the prediction results of the random forest model indicated that biochar could enhance the metabolic activity of bacterial communities closely related to HA formation during SM and CHR composting due to its porous structure. Finally, the structural equation model verified that CB with larger total pore volume promoted the conversion of macromolecular OM in CHR to form HA by stimulating microbial activity, while WSB with stronger adsorption capacity formed HA by polymerizing mall molecular components solidified in SM. This study provided theoretical and technical support for biochar to promote humification during different types materials composting.

AB  - In recent years, the plasmid-mediated transmission of the tigecycline resistance gene tet(X) in Escherichia coli has re-ceived considerable attention. However, studies on the global distribution of tet(X)-positive E. coli remain scarce. Herein, we performed a systematic genomic analysis of 864 tet(X)-positive E. coli isolates from humans, animals and the environment around the world. These isolates were reported in 25 countries and isolated from 13 different hosts. China reported the most tet(X)-positive isolates (71.76 %), followed by Thailand (8.45 %) and Pakistan (5.9 %). Pigs (53.93 %), humans (17.41 %), and chickens (17.41 %) were determined to be important reservoirs of these isolates. The sequence types (STs) of E. coli were highly diverse, with the ST10 clone complex (Cplx) being the most prevalent clone. Correlation analysis revealed a positive association between the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in ST10 E. coli and the presence of insertion sequences and plasmid replicons; however, we found no significant correlation between ARGs and virulence genes. Furthermore, the ST10 tet(X)-positive isolates from multiple sources displayed a high degree of genetic similarity (<200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) to the mcr-1-positive but tet(X)-negative human-derived isolates, suggesting clonal transmission. The most prevalent tet(X) variant in the E. coli isolates was tet(X4), followed by tet(X6)-v. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) indicated that compared to tet(X4), tet(X6)-v harbored more significantly different resistance genes. Notably, certain tet(X)-positive E. coli iso-lates from different geographical locations or hosts shared a few SNPs (<200 SNPs), indicating cross-contamination. Therefore, continuous global surveillance of tet(X)-positive E. coli is imperative in the future.

AB  - Follicular dynamics in dairy sheep is poorly understood. This study assessed the follicular dynamics of dairy sheep within and out of the breeding season by observing the effect of two progesterone concentrations (60 and 120 mg) used in vaginal pessaries in pre-synchronization. The experiment was conducted in April/May and October/November using 40 healthy multiparous dairy ewes predominantly of the Lacaune breed, which underwent daily transrectal ultrasound examinations. The number of ovulations (1.35 vs 1.05), ovulatory follicle diameter (mm) (5.97 vs 5.05), length of the luteal phase (11 vs 9.14 days), and length of the estrous cycle (16.83 vs 16.6 days) were assessed within and out of the breeding season, respectively. The sheep out of the breeding season did not present a corpus luteum at the time of insertion of the vaginal pessary, characterizing anestrus. The ovulatory follicle had a larger diameter in the breeding season even with the shorter length of the follicular phase, suggesting higher viability and quality of the ovulated oocyte. The application of exogenous progesterone extends the luteal phase in the breeding season (11 vs 9.14 days). The anestrus observed out of season suggests the need for a higher progesterone concentration in reproductive protocols. Therefore, breeding protocols can be adapted for different seasons, suggesting the use of vaginal pessaries with a higher progesterone concentration (120 mg) out of the breeding season. The data allowed the characterization of follicular dynamics in dairy sheep, demonstrating their differences in each season based on the use of different progesterone doses in pre-synchronization.

AB  - Regular exercise has been identified to facilitate neuroplasticity that maximize functional outcome after brain injuries. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has emerged as a key facilitator of neuroplasticity after exercise. The activity-regulated cytoskeleton associated protein (Arc) is induced by BDNF and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), contributing to functional modification of neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, early-life exposure to neuroendocrine disruptor di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) is a risk factor for behavioral deficits, but the mechanisms responsible for DEHP-induced neurotoxicity are not well understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether hippocampal Arc expression is impaired by DEHP exposure and to examine the protective role of exercise in the prenatally DEHP-exposed male rats. Sprague Dawley dams were fed with vehicle or DEHP during gestation. The male offspring were trained to treadmill running for 5 weeks followed by examination of behavioral and biochemical outcomes. The results showed that DEHP-exposed rats exhibited impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as down-regulations of BDNF, NMDAR, Arc, and synaptophysin. Importantly, aerobic exercise during childhood-adolescence prevented the impairment of learning and memory by recovering the expressions of BDNF, NMDAR, Arc, and synaptophysin. These findings suggest that exercise may provide beneficial effects on ameliorating the impairment of neuroplasticity in the prenatally DEHP-exposed male rats at late adolescence.

AB  - The detrimental effects of fluoride on neurotoxicity have been widely recorded, yet the detailed mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. This study explores lysosomal iron metabolism in fluoride-related neurotoxicity, with a focus on the Steap3/TRPML1 axis. Utilizing sodium fluoride (NaF)-treated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and mouse hippocampal neuron (HT22) cell lines, our research demonstrates that NaF enhances the accumulation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) in these cells, disrupting lysosomal iron metabolism through the Steap3/TRPML1 axis. Notably, NaF exposure upregulated ACSL4 and downregulated GPX4, accompanied by reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. These changes indicate increased vulnerability to ferroptosis within neuronal cells. The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) mitigates this disruption. DFO binds to lysosomal Fe2+ and inhibits the Steap3/TRPML1 axis, restoring normal lysosomal iron metabolism, preventing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), and reducing neuronal cell ferroptosis. Our findings suggest that interference in lysosomal iron metabolism may mitigate fluoride-induced neurotoxicity, underscoring the critical role of the Steap3/TRPML1 axis in this pathological process.

AB  - The Guangling Large-Tailed sheep is renowned for its unique tail fat deposition, with a significant proportion of its total body fat being localized in the tail region. Fat deposition is a complex biological process regulated by various molecular mechanisms. Our previous studies have identified a large number of differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the tail adipose tissue of the Guangling Large-Tailed sheep. These circRNAs may play a pivotal role in the process of fat deposition. Given the potential regulatory functions of circRNAs in adipose metabolism, investigating their roles in tail fat deposition is of significant scientific importance. In this study, we identified novel circARID1A. Using various experimental methods, including lentivirus infection, RNase R treatment, actinomycin D assay, qPCR, western blotting, and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we determined that circARID1A inhibits the expression of miR-493-3p through competitive binding, thereby regulating adipocyte differentiation. Further research revealed that miR-493-3p promotes adipocyte differentiation by targeting YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), and this regulatory effect is also influenced by circARID1A. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circARID1A inhibits tail fat cell differentiation in the Guangling Large-Tailed sheep through the circARID1A/miR-493-3p/YTHDF2 axis, providing theoretical support for improving meat quality and fat deposition in sheep.

AB  - Fungus-based biopesticides have been used worldwide for crop pest control as a safer alternative to chemical pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Both agrochemicals can be lethal and may also trigger side effects on the behavioral traits of non-target social insects, which play a crucial role in providing essential biological pest control services in agroecosystems. Here, we evaluated whether a commercial formulation of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana or the neonicotinoid imidacloprid causes mortality in foragers of Mischocyttarus metathoracicus. These social wasps are natural enemies of caterpillars and other herbivorous insects and inhabit both urban and agricultural environments in Brazil. We also tested whether wasps discriminate between biopesticide-exposed and unexposed conspecifics. Through a combination of laboratory (survival assay) and field experiments (lure presentation), along with chemical analyses (cuticular hydrocarbon profiles), we showed that topic exposure to the label rate of each pesticide causes a lethal effect, with the biopesticide exhibiting a slower effect. Moreover, wasps do not discriminate biopesticide-exposed from unexposed conspecifics, likely because of the similarity of their cuticular chemical profiles 24 h after exposure. Overall, the delayed lethal time at the individual level, combined with the indistinctive chemical cues of exposure and the lack of discrimination by conspecifics suggests that the fungal biopesticide may ultimately pose a threat to the colony survival of this predatory wasp.

AB  - Sheep in vitro embryo production (IVEP) is of great economic and scientific value, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) can negatively impact the quality and developmental potential of sheep embryos. Therefore, reducing ROS may enhance the efficacy of sheep IVEP. In this study, different concentrations of melatonin (10-9, 10-7, 10-5, 10-3 M) were supplemented during oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) and embryo in vitro culture (IVC). The developmental ability of sheep oocytes and embryos, the survival rate of vitrified blastocysts, ROS level, ATP content, ATP synthase activity and related gene expression levels of sheep blastocysts were detected. The results showed that 10-7 M melatonin significantly improved the developmental ability of sheep oocytes and embryos, elevated the survival rate of blastocysts after vitrification, reduced the ROS level, increased the ATP content and ATP synthase activity and improved the expression levels of quality-related genes in sheep blastocysts. We speculated that melatonin may enhance the developmental competence of sheep oocytes and embryos by reducing the ROS level and promoting ATP synthesis. In addition, high concentrations of melatonin may have an adverse impact on the development of sheep embryos.

AB  - Circadian rhythms have evolved in almost all organisms enabling them to anticipate alternating changes in the environment. As a consequence, the circadian clock controls a broad range of bodily functions including appetite, sleep, activity and cortisol levels. The circadian clock synchronizes itself to the external world mainly by environmental light cues and can be disturbed by a variety of factors, including shift-work, jet-lag, stress, ageing and artificial light at night. Interestingly, mood has also been shown to follow a diurnal rhythm. Moreover, circadian disruption has been associated with various mood disorders and patients suffering from depression have irregular biological rhythms in sleep, appetite, activity and cortisol levels suggesting that circadian rhythmicity is crucially involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression.The aim of the present review is to give an overview and discuss recent findings in both humans and rodents linking a disturbed circadian rhythm to depression. Understanding the relation between a disturbed circadian rhythm and the etiology of depression may lead to novel therapeutic and preventative strategies.

AB  - The accurate and effective detectionof severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential to preventing thespread of infectious diseases and ensuring human health. Herein, ananobody-displayed whole-cell biosensor was developed for colorimetricdetection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Serving as bioreceptors, yeastsurfaces were genetically engineered to display SARS-CoV-2 bindingof llama-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) with high captureefficiency, facilitating the concentration and purification of SARS-CoV-2.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) employed as signal transductions were functionalizedwith horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anti-SARS monoclonal antibodiesto enhance the detection sensitivity. In the presence of SARS-CoV-2spike proteins, the sandwiched binding will be formed by linking engineeredyeast, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and reporter AuNPs. The colorimetricsignal was generated by the enzymatic reaction of HRP and its correspondingcolorimetric substrate/chromogen system. At the optimal conditions,the developed whole-cell biosensor enables the sensitive detectionof SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in a linear range from 0.01 to 1 & mu;g/mLwith a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.037 & mu;g/mL (about 4 x10(8) virion particles/mL). Furthermore, the whole-cell biosensorwas demonstrated to detect the spike protein of different SARS-CoV-2variants in human serum, providing new possibilities for the detectionof future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - There are only a few studies devoted to the comparative and simultaneous study of the mechanisms of the length-dependent regulation of atrial and ventricular contractility. Therefore, an isometric force-length protocol was applied to isolated guinea pig right atrial (RA) strips and ventricular (RV) trabeculae, with a simultaneous measurement of force (Frank-Starling mechanism) and Ca2+ transients (CaT) or transmembrane action potentials (AP). Over the entire length-range studied, the duration of isometric contraction, CaT and AP, were shorter in the RA myocardium than in the RV myocardium. The RA myocardium was stiffer than the RV myocardium. With the increasing length of the RA and RV myocardium, the amplitude and duration of isometric contraction and CaT increased, as well as the amplitude and area of the "CaT difference curves" (shown for the first time). However, the rates of the tension development and relaxation decreased. No contribution of AP duration to the heterometric regulation of isometric tension was found in either the RA or RV myocardium of the guinea pig. Changes in the degree of overlap of the contractile proteins of the guinea pig RA and RV myocardium mainly affect CaT kinetics but not AP duration.

AB  - Theanine is an important quality parameter referring to tea quality. Applying nitrogen fertilizers is one strategy to improve the level of theanine; however, the effect of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria on theanine synthesis in tea roots has been less studied. In this study, the bacteria isolated from Qimen County with the maximum potassium (K) solubilization were identified as Bacillus by biochemical and molecular analyses. We show that tartaric and pyruvic acids produced by Bacillus were important components related to K solubilization in vitro. Pot experiments and enzymatic assays in vitro showed that inoculation with Bacillus-secreted organic acids increased the level of available potassium in the soil. The increased K level activated recombinant CsTSI activity (theanine biosynthesis enzyme) and increased ethylamine content (the synthesis precursor of theanine), resulting in promoted theanine synthesis in tea roots. Therefore, our study indicates that Bacillus can be a potential bioinoculant for biofortification of tea.

AB  - Food consumption and utilization parameters of Plutella xylostella (L.) were studied on the leaves of eight cabbage cultivars under laboratory conditions (27 +/- 2 degrees C, 70 +/- 5 % RH, 16 L: 8D photoperiod). The present study evaluated the effect of different biochemical factors of cabbage cultivars on the food consumption and utilization parameters of P. xylostella. All the food consumption and utilization parameters differed significantly among the cabbage cultivars. The highest values of relative consumption rate (RCR) and relative growth rate (RGR) were observed on the cabbage cultivars 'NS 183', 'DEB 806', 'Green Express' and 'Mohor'. The highest values of the efficiency of conversion of ingested (3.94 %) and digested (4.95 %) food was observed on the cabbage cultivar 'DEB 806'. In contrast, the 4th instar P. xylostella larvae fed on the cabbage cultivar 'Lucky Ball' exhibited the lowest values of RCR (1.31 mg food consumed/mg body weight/ day), RGR (0.33 mg weight gain/mg body weight/ day), ECI (2.47 %) and ECD (2.95 %). The food consumption and utilization parameters of P. xylostella were positively correlated with the protein: carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of cabbage cultivars. The food consumption and utilization parameters of P. xylostella showed a non-significant correlation with the total glucosinolate content and total phenolic content of cabbage cultivars. The present study will help to identify effective resistant or tolerant cabbage cultivars for the development of Integrated Pest Management strategies against P. xylostella.

AB  - Resource partitioning among sympatric species is crucial for assembling ecological communities, such as caterpillar-ant assemblages in tropical forests. Myrmecophilous caterpillars use behavioral and chemical strategies to coexist with ants, avoiding attacks. While these strategies are well-understood in single pair of interacting species, such as those involving myrmecophiles and ants, their role in complex multitrophic interactions that include several species of plants, herbivores and ants remains unclear. We aimed to identify the role of cuticular hydrocarbons and specialized morphological structures that caterpillars use to interact with ants (called ant organs) in the recognition process between two riodinid caterpillar species and their respective ant-plant systems. We hypothesized that caterpillars' cuticular profiles would be conspicuous, possessing cues of rewards to ants, allowing specific ants to recognize and not attack them on plants. We performed experiments exposing caterpillars to ants to assess the role of larval ant organs and the specificity of caterpillar-ant interactions on plants. We analyzed cuticular hydrocarbons of caterpillars, ant workers and plants using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Our experiments showed that larval ant organs were activated according to each treatment and caterpillars were consistently accepted by their associated ants when transferred to host plants occupied by the same ant species. However, caterpillars transferred to plants with a non-associated ant species that do not tend them were often killed. This highlights the specificity of these interactions. Caterpillar cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, while present in far lower amounts than those of ant workers and plants, were distinctive, suggesting a strategy of chemical conspicuousness that helps caterpillars to be recognized by ants and prevents attacks in specific ant-plant systems. Our results indicate that ants recognize conspicuous cuticular hydrocarbons, while caterpillars convey multimodal signals from ant organs during interactions, which are essential for caterpillar survival in these specific interactions.

AB  - Sperm acquire the ability to fertilize in a process called capacitation and undergo hyperactivation, a change in the motility pattern, which depends on Ca2+ transport by CatSper channels. CatSper is essential for fertilization and it is subjected to a complex regulation that is not fully understood. Here, we report that similar to CatSper, Cdc42 distribution in the principal piece is confined to four linear domains and this localization is disrupted in CatSper1-null sperm. Cdc42 inhibition impaired CatSper activity and other Ca2+-dependent downstream events resulting in a severe compromise of the sperm fertilizing potential. We also demonstrate that Cdc42 is essential for CatSper function by modulating cAMP production by soluble adenylate cyclase (sAC), providing a new regulatory mechanism for the stimulation of CatSper by the cAMP-dependent pathway. These results reveal a broad mechanistic insight into the regulation of Ca2+ in mammalian sperm, a matter of critical importance in male infertility as well as in contraception.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of phospholipase C (PLC) on the capacitation of cryopreserved ovine semen. Sixteen semen samples were cryopreserved with diluent added by 0, 10, or 20 mu M of U73122, a PLC inhibitor. The sperm kinetics of the thawed samples were evaluated using the "Computer-assisted Sperm Anal-ysis" system, and the integrity of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes was evaluated using fluorescent probes. Additionally, sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction with chlortetracycline hydrochloride were evaluated before and after capacitation induction. The results were analysed using analysis of variance and Tukey's test with a 95% probability. Concentrations of 10 or 20 mu M of U73122 did not affect the kinetics or number of sperm with intact plasma and mitochondrial membranes. However, after thawing, 10 and 20 mu M of the inhibitor reduced the percentage of capacitated and acrosome-reacted sperm. After induction of capacitation, there was a reduction in the number of non-capacitated sperm in all treatment groups, suggesting a reversible effect of U73122. In conclusion, U73122 at concentrations of 10 or 20 mu M prevents premature capacitation and acrosome reaction induced by the freezing procedure, without affecting the kinetics and integrity of the sperm membranes.

AB  - Caterpillar salivary glucose oxidase (GOX) can function as both an elicitor or as an effector of plant defense responses depending upon the system. Treatment with GOX reduces the stomatal aperture of tomato and soybean leaves, thereby reducing the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), that are important indirect defense responses of plants by attracting natural enemies of the caterpillars. Here we examined the effect of fungal GOX (fungal glucose oxidases have been used to determine specificity in defense response elicitation) on stomatal closure of maize leaves and on the volatile emission pattern whole maize plants. We also used salivary gland homogenate from wild-type and CRISPR-Cas9 Helicoverpa zea mutants deficient in GOX activity to determine the effect caterpillar saliva with and without GOX had on maize volatile emission. Collecting volatiles at 2-hour intervals allowed us to examine the changes in emission over time. Fungal GOX reduced the stomatal aperture in maize leaves, which may have influenced the observed significant reduction in total green leaf volatile (GLV) emission. Furthermore, fungal GOX significantly increased the emission of several key terpenes: linalool, DMNT, and Z-& beta;-farnesene from maize, while salivary gland homogenate from wild type (WT; GOX+) H. zea increased the emission of & alpha;-pinene, & beta;-pinene, and ocimene compared to H. zea unable to synthesize GOX. This study addressed a significant knowledge gap about the effect of GOX on maize volatiles and provides a baseline for further research on the effect of GOX on the regulation of terpene synthase genes and their relation to terpene volatile emission.

AB  - Cadmium in agricultural soils has emerged as a substantial threat to crop health and yields through its bioaccumulation along the food chain, with further repercussions for the growth, development, and population dynamics of herbivorous insects. In this study, potted potato plants were treated with Cd2+ solutions at concentrations of 0 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, and 120 mg/kg. Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) were fed on potato leaves exposed to these varying concentrations of cadmium, and the effects on their growth and development were assessed. The results revealed that: 1. The developmental period, pupal stage, and pre-oviposition period of the first-instar larvae of L. decemlineata feeding on cadmium-contaminated leaves was significantly prolonged, while both the lifespan and fecundity were reduced. 2. Key population parameters, including the innate rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), net reproductive rate (R0), and gross reproduction rate (GRR), were evidently lower in cadmium-exposed L. decemlineata, while the average generation time did not show a significant difference. 3. Cadmium exposure also resulted in a remarkable reduction in survival and reproductive rates at specific life stages, along with an increase in the incidence of deformations in newly emerged adults. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of cadmium on both crop health and pest populations. This study holds valuable implications for more effective implementation of pest control strategies in the future, offering robust scientific evidence to support the safeguarding of food security.

AB  - Simple Summary During the steam distillation of aromatic plants, two main fractions are usually obtained: the hydrophobic essential oils and the hydrophilic fraction commonly known as hydrolate (HY). The essential oils are largely used in several industry fields, including the agricultural industry as biopesticides. Residual HYs, instead, are often discarded as by-products of little or no value. Our research pointed out that also HYs have biological activity, suggesting their potential use in plant-based strategy for the pest control. In more detail, we investigated the insecticidal properties of the hydrolate from Monarda didyma, scarlet beebalm, towards Drosophila suzukii. Using specific molecular and behavioural assays, we showed that M. didyma hydrolate affected the fitness and behaviour of D. suzukii, providing new insights in the D. suzukii control strategies through M. didyma hydrolate. Drosophila suzukii (Matsumara) is an herbivorous pest whose control in the field with conventional chemical is particularly difficult and has important drawbacks. Here, we investigated the insecticidal properties of hydrolate from Monarda didyma, scarlet beebalm, an aromatic herb in the Lamiaceae family. The identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by CG-MS systems revealed that thymol (38%) and carvacrol (59%) were the most abundant VOCs in the hydrolate. M. didyma hydrolate did not show fumigant toxicity. Conversely, in contact assays, M. didyma hydrolate showed a LC50 of 5.03 mu L mL(-1), 48 h after the application on D. suzukii adults. Expression of detoxification genes increased in flies that survived the LC50 application. Furthermore, toxicity persisted for 7 days after the treatment in the survival evaluation. Artificial diet assays with 100 and 1000 mu L mL(-1) of M. didyma hydrolate resulted in a significant decrease in total food intake in both male and female D. suzukii adults. In addition, electropenetrography (EPG) showed that the D. suzukii females' feeding behaviour was altered in hydrolate-treated diets. The hydrolate also caused a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid in two different oviposition assays. Overall, our findings provide a new perspective for the improvement of D. suzukii control strategies through M. didyma hydrolate.

AB  - Objective: It is unclear whether beta-asarone has a good antidepressant effect and what is the main mechanism in Depression in Parkinson's disease (DPD) model rats. Methods: In this study, DPD model rats were screened from 6-OHDA induced rats by sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST). DPD model rats were divided into eight groups: model group, pramipexole group, beta-asarone low-dose group (beta-asarone 7.5 group), beta-asarone medium-dose group (beta-asarone 15 group), beta-asarone high-dose group (beta-asarone 30 group), 3-MA group, rapamycin group, and PI3K inhibitor group. 28 days after the end of treatment, open field test (OFT), SPT and FST were conducted in rats. The level of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in the striatum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of Beclin-1, p62 in the striatum was determined by western blot. The expression of PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and p62 in the hippocampus was determined by western blot. The spine density of neurons in the hippocampus was detected by golgi staining. Results: The results showed that 4-week oral administration of beta-asarone improve the motor and depressive symptoms of DPD model rats, and decrease the content of alpha-syn in the striatum. beta-asarone inhibited the expression of autophagy in the striatum of DPD model rats. Furthermore, beta-asarone decreased the levels of Beclin-1 protein, increased the expression of p62, p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR, and improved the density of neuron dendritic spine in the hippocampus. Conclusions: We concluded that beta-asarone might improve the behavior of DPD model rats by activating the PI3K/ Akt/mTOR pathway, inhibiting autophagy and protecting neuron.

AB  - What are the contents of the infant mind? In the last decade, computational advances in fMRI have allowed researchers access to the internal representations of adults. Applied similarly in infants, fMRI stands to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive development. By measuring representations at their source, infant fMRI overcomes some of the limitations of behavioral measures. We discuss example domains where this approach could be fruitful, including episodic memory, semantic cognition, spatial representations, and theory of mind. In these and other areas, the richness of fMRI data could give new insight into how infants represent the world and potentially help resolve ongoing debates in developmental science.

TI  - A Mini-Fluid Challenge to Predict Fluid Responsiveness in Swine
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE

KW  - SYSTOLIC PRESSURE VARIATION
AB  - Unnecessary and excessive fluid therapy increases the risk of adverse effects such as pulmonary edema. To prevent this, a mini-fluid challenge (MFC) has been utilized to predict whether fluid therapy will improve circulatory dynamics in human intensive care medicine. The study described here investigated whether MFC is also efficacious in pigs. Thirty-two domestic pigs anesthetized and maintained under mechanical ventilation were treated with successive IV fluid administrations of 2, 1, 1, and 2 mL/kg over a 10-min period for a total dose of 6 mL/kg of Ringer lactate. The percentage increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 2, 3, and 4 mL/kg of cumulative fluid administration was examined to determine whether responders could be identified that would benefit hemodynamically from higher doses of fluids. For the purposes of this study, a 10% increase or more in MAP after 6 mL/kg of fluid administration defined responders, and an increase of less than 10% in MAP was used to define nonresponders. The percentage increase in MAP at 2, 3, and 4 mL/kg fluid administration was evaluated to determine whether this could predict responder status. Eleven of the 32 animals were determined to be responders. Responder status was predicted with high accuracy by the administration of 3 mL/kg (AUC = 0.98) and was moderately predicted with administration of 2 mL/kg (AUC= 0.80), as well as pulse pressure variation (AUC= 0.75). Thus, MFC may be helpful to maintain tissue perfusion in pigs through the use of managed fluid therapy.

AB  - In the study, genotypes and allele frequencies for SNP of FASN and SCD1 genes in the herd of Zosl'achtena Valaska sheep in the second and third lactation were determined. In the obtained samples, the basic composition of milk, urea content and proportion of protein fractions were estimated. Blood samples were tested to determine FASN and SCD1 genes frequencies. After genotyping conducted in the sheep herd, three possible genotypes in SCD1/CfrI polymorphism and only two out of three possible genotypes in SCD1/PvuII and FASN/AciI polymorphisms (AA, AG and CC, CT, respectively) were found. Analyses have shown changes in milk composition and proportions of protein fractions in FASN and SCD1 genes depending on SNP genotypes. The analysis of the obtained results for FASN polymorphism allowed to establish that the milk of animals with CT genotype had the highest content of protein, fat and dry matter. The most desired profile of protein fractions was found in SCD/CfrI genotype among the homozygous CC genotype carriers: it allows to determine that the milk of these sheep has good technological traits.

AB  - Tea, the important cash crop and globally most consumed beverage, are precariously sensitive to the climatic conditions. Numerous biotic and abiotic stress challenges are upsetting their growth and quality to a severe extent in recent years. Alternative splicing is a leading molecular mechanism to increase the transcript diversity and regulate the gene expression to cope with stress injuries. Members of WRKY gene family play an essential role in safeguarding the plant during such biotic and abiotic hassles. This study aimed to explore the dynamics of splicing and differential expression in tea plant WRKY genes under diverse conditions. A total of 61 transcriptomes across different tissues and conditions were selected to identify the novel splicing event and expression profile within 80 WRKY genes of the tea plant. Almost half of the total WRKY genes differentially expressed and 37.5% genes are alternatively spliced across tissues and stress responses. Finally, TEA028167, TEA017542, TEA002467, TEA023777, and TEA008808 were elucidated to have most significant variations in expression and splicing along the physiological ascents. Functional consequences of the WRKY gene spliced variants are predicted to play an important role through compensation or competition with their corresponding full-length transcripts.

AB  - Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) is a picornavirus that causes vesicular lesions in pigs, significantly affecting global swine farming. The SVV 3C protease is essential for processing the viral polyprotein and facilitates immune evasion by cleaving or degrading multiple innate immune proteins. In this study, we identified three caspase inhibitors, including Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK (Z-VAD), Z-FA-FMK (Z-FA), and Z-VDVAD-FMK (Z-VDVAD), which significantly inhibit the cleavage activity of SVV 3C protease using a recombinant protein system. Comparative analysis revealed that Z-VAD exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect in a cell transfection system. Further investigations confirmed that Z-VAD, Z-FA, and Z-VDVAD bound directly to the 3C protein. Molecular docking analysis showed that Z-VAD interacted with key enzymatic site residues His48 and Cys160 of the 3C protease, while Z-VDVAD and Z-FA interacted only with residue Cys160. Infection experiments demonstrated that Z-VAD significantly suppressed the replication by targeting 3C protease. Furthermore, Z-VAD significantly suppressed the replication of Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of SVV 3C protease inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, offering valuable insights for the development of strategies to control SVV and other picornaviruses.

AB  - Two experiments were performed to determine the digestibility of diets with crude protein (CP) reduction supplemented with amino acids (18.15; 17.15; 16.15 and 15.15%) to growing pigs (30-50 kg), to assess the use of nutrients and account for the manure excretion, and to evaluate the performance, backfat thickness, Longissimus lumborum depth, and plasma urea, aiming to evaluate the environmental impact through life cycle assessment (LCA); for the first time in Brazil interacting experiments were developed to evaluate the CP reduction and LCA. The CP reduction resulted in greater daily weight gain (p = 0.011), final weight (p = 0.020), better use of N and P, through the greater N and P retained (p = 0.003 and p = 0.017, respectively). There was a linear reduction in acidification potential (p = 0.015), eutrophication potential (p = 0.001), and land occupation (p = 0.005) when dietary CP decreased from 18.15 to 15.15%. The reduction in CP and supplementation of amino acids in diets for growing pigs (30-50 kg) improved final and daily weight gain. Through LCA, and performance and metabolism data, it was concluded that for the acidification, eutrophication and land occupation categories, impacts were reduced as the protein concentration was reduced.

AB  - Maternal care is critical for epigenetic programming during postnatal brain development. Stress is recognized as a critical factor that may affect maternal behavior, yet owing to high heterogeneity in stress response, its impact varies among individuals. We aimed here to understand the connection between inborn stress vulnerability, maternal care, and early epigenetic programming using mouse populations that exhibit opposite poles of the behavioral spectrum (social dominance [Dom] and submissiveness [Sub]) and differential response to stress. In contrast to stress-resilient Dom dams, stress-vulnerable Sub dams exhibit significantly lower maternal attachment, serum oxytocin, and colonic Lactobacillus reuteri populations. Sub offspring showed a reduced hippocampal expression of key methylation genes at postnatal day (PND) 7 and a lack of developmentally-dependent increase in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) at PND 21. In addition, Sub pups exhibit significant hypermethylation of gene promoters connected with glutamatergic synapses and behavioral responses. We were able to reverse the submissive endophenotype through cross-fostering Sub pups with Dom dams (Sub/D). Thus, Sub/D pups exhibited elevated hippocampal expression of DNMT3A at PND 7 and increased 5-mC levels at PND 21. Furthermore, adult Sub/D offspring exhibited increased sociability, social dominance, and hippocampal glutamate and monoamine levels resembling the neurochemical profile of Dom mice. We postulate that maternal inborn stress vulnerability governs epigenetic patterning sculpted by maternal care and intestinal microbiome diversity during early developmental stages and shapes the array of gene expression patterns that may dictate neuronal architecture with a long-lasting impact on stress sensitivity and the social behavior of offspring.

Although this plant can colonize and spread in very saline soils, how it adapts to saline stress in the seedling stage remains unclear so a pot-based experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of four different saline stress levels (0, 50, 150, and 300 mM) on the morphological and physio-biochemical responses in A. sparsifolia seedlings. Results Our results revealed that N-fixing A. sparsifolia has a variety of physio-biochemical anti-saline stress acclimations, including osmotic adjustments, enzymatic mechanisms, and the allocation of metabolic resources. Shoot-root growth and chlorophyll pigments significantly decreased under intermediate and high saline stress. Additionally, increasing levels of saline stress significantly increased Na+ but decreased K+ concentrations in roots and leaves, resulting in a decreased K+/Na+ ratio and leaves accumulated more Na + and K + ions than roots, highlighting their ability to increase cellular osmolarity, favouring water fluxes from soil to leaves. Salt-induced higher lipid peroxidation significantly triggered antioxidant enzymes, both for mass-scavenging (catalase) and cytosolic fine-regulation (superoxide dismutase and peroxidase) of H2O2. Nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase also increased at low and intermediate saline stress levels but decreased under higher stress levels. Soluble proteins and proline rose at all salt levels, whereas soluble sugars increased only at low and medium stress. The results show that when under low-to-intermediate saline stress, seedlings invest more energy in osmotic adjustments but shift their investment towards antioxidant defense mechanisms under high levels of saline stress. Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that A. sparsifolia seedlings tolerate low, intermediate, and high salt stress by promoting high antioxidant mechanisms, osmolytes accumulations, and the maintenance of mineral N assimilation. However, a gradual decline in growth with increasing salt levels could be attributed to the diversion of energy from growth to maintain salinity homeostasis and anti-stress oxidative mechanisms.

AB  - The hippocampus is involved in the formation of memories that require associations among stimuli to construct representations of space and the items and events within that space. Neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), an initial input region of the hippocampus, have robust spatial tuning, but it is unclear how nonspatial information may be integrated with spatial activity in this region. We recorded from the DG of 21 adult mice as they foraged for food in an environment that contained discrete objects. We found DG cells with multiple firing fields at a fixed distance and direction from objects (landmark vector cells) and cells that exhibited localized changes in spatial firing when objects in the environment were manipulated. By classifying recorded DG cells into putative dentate granule cells and mossy cells, we examined how the addition or displacement of objects affected the spatial firing of these DG cell types. Object-related activity was detected in a significant proportion of mossy cells. Although few granule cells with responses to object manipulations were recorded, likely because of the sparse nature of granule cell firing, there was generally no significant difference in the proportion of granule cells and mossy cells with object responses. When mice explored a second environment with the same objects, DG spatial maps completely reorganized, and a different subset of cells responded to object manipulations. Together, these data reveal the capacity of DG cells to detect small changes in the environment while preserving a stable spatial representation of the overall context.

AB  - ObjectiveInsemination with spermatozoa, seminal plasma and extender, cause a rapid inflammatory response in pig endometrium, characterized by an influx of neutrophils into the uterus. The transient inflammatory response to semen involves cytokine induction. Potential functions for Interleukin-23 (IL-23) in the inflammatory response to different insemination treatments were examined by studying mRNA expression and immunostaining in gilt oviduct and endometrium 35-40 h after insemination. Insemination was performed with seminal plasma (SP), spermatozoa (SPZ) without SP in the extender Beltsville thawing solution (BTS), or BTS alone. In control gilts an insemination catheter was inserted without anything being inseminated.ResultsResults showed that IL-23 mRNA was expressed in oviduct and endometrium after insemination regardless of treatment. There was an approximate two- to fourfold increase in expression of IL-23 mRNA in catheter-insertion control compared with SPZ, SP and BTS treatment groups. IL-23 immunolabelling was detected in a small number of separate cells and in the sub-epithelial connective tissue of the endometrium, the endosalpinx of isthmus and infundibulum.ConclusionIn conclusion, insemination with SP, SPZ in BTS, and BTS alone decreased the expression of IL-23 mRNA in the endometrium compared to catheter-insertion control, indicating a possible role for IL-23 in the inflammatory response after insemination in gilts.

AB  - In clinical practice, the use of exogenous progesterone (Pro) is often required in assisted reproduction programs due to reduced levels of the hormone and the risk of miscarriage. Exposure to the hormone reduces anxiety in rodents, but the long-term effects of prenatal exposure in adult offspring are unknown. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of prenatal Pro treatment on anxiety- and depression-like behavior and the effect on plasma, hippocampal corticosterone (CORT) and hippocampal progesterone receptor (PR) in young adult male and female rat offspring. The behavioral responses of offspring of both sexes were tested in the open field, and the elevated plus maze tests, and for depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test, the forced swimming test and the splash test. CORT levels and PR expression were measured by ELISA. The results indicate that prenatal Pro exposure at low and high doses (10 and 50 mg kg-1 , s.c. during G0-G10) induces anxiogenic and depressive-like effects compared to vehicle-treated controls, which are associated with high plasma and hippocampal CORT levels and upregulated hippocampal PR in male and female adult offspring. Our results demonstrate that prenatal Pro exposure has detrimental effects on the emotional status of male and female adult offspring, which may be associated with long-term changes in hormonal homeostasis.

AB  - Untreated stormwater is a major source of microplastics, organic pollutants, metals, and nutrients in urban water courses. The aim of this study was to improve the knowledge about the start-up periods of bioretention filters. A rain garden pilot facility with 13 bioretention filters was constructed and stormwater from a highway and adjacent impervious surfaces was used for irrigation for similar to 12 weeks. Selected plants (Armeria maritima, Hippophae rhamnoides, Juncus effusus, and Festuca rubra) was planted in ten filters. Stormwater percolated through the filters containing waste-to-energy bottom ash, biochar, or Sphagnum peat, mixed with sandy loam. Influent and effluent samples were taken to evaluate removal of the above-mentioned pollutants. All filters efficiently removed microplastics >10 mu m, organic pollutants, and most metals. Copper leached from all filters initially but was significantly reduced in the biochar filters at the end of the period, while the other filters showed a declining trend. All filters leached nutrients initially, but concentrations decreased over time, and the biochar filters had efficiently reduced nitrogen after a few weeks. To conclude, all the filters effectively removed pollutants during the start-up period. Before being recommended for full-scale applications, the functionality of the filters after a longer period of operation should be evaluated.

AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postsurgical complication in elderly individuals, significantly impacting the quality of life of patients; however, there is currently no effective clinical treatment for POCD. Recent studies have shown that Icariin (ICA) has antiaging effects and improves cognitive function, but its effect in POCD has not been studied. In this study, we investigated the influence of ICA on cognitive function and the TLR4/NF-?B signaling pathway in a POCD rat model. We found that ICA reduced surgery-induced memory impairment, decreased hippocampal inflammatory responses, ameliorated neuronal injury in the hippocampus and inhibited microglial activation. In addition, we also observed that ICA inhibited activation of the TLR4/NF-?B signaling pathway. In summary, our research suggest that ICA can ameliorate surgery-induced memory impairment and that the improvements resulting from administration of ICA may be associated with inhibition of hippocampal neuroinflammation. Our research findings also provide insight into potential therapeutic targets and methods for POCD.

AB  - Simple Summary: Prenatal maternal feeding is critical for fetal development. miRNAs may impart unique metabolic and immunologic effects on developing fetuses. The fetal muscle miRNAome was found to be altered via maternal protein intake levels. oar-miR-3957-5p and miR-329a-3p were up-regulated in low- and standard-protein diets vs. high-protein diets. Many of the putative miRNA target genes and genetic pathways identified were involved in known muscle disease and immune function. Prenatal maternal feeding plays an important role in fetal development and has the potential to induce long-lasting epigenetic modifications. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that serve as one epigenetic mechanism. Though miRNAs have crucial roles in fetal programming, growth, and development, there is limited data regarding the maternal diet and miRNA expression in sheep. Therefore, we analyzed high and low maternal dietary protein for miRNA expression in fetal longissimus dorsi. Pregnant ewes were fed an isoenergetic high-protein (HP, 160-270 g/day), low-protein (LP, 73-112 g/day), or standard-protein diet (SP, 119-198 g/day) during pregnancy. miRNA expression profiles were evaluated using the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array. Twelve up-regulated, differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified which are targeting 65 genes. The oar-3957-5p miRNA was highly up-regulated in the LP and SP compared to the HP. Previous transcriptome analysis identified that integrin and non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase genes targeted by miRNAs were detected in the current experiment. A total of 28 GO terms and 10 pathway-based gene sets were significantly (padj < 0.05) enriched in the target genes. Most genes targeted by the identified miRNAs are involved in immune and muscle disease pathways. Our study demonstrated that dietary protein intake during pregnancy affected fetal skeletal muscle epigenetics via miRNA expression.

AB  - Paunch is comprised of the partially digested feed contained in cattle or sheep and contributes 20-50% of organic waste produced at red meat processing facilities. Anaerobic digestion has been identified as a promising technology for paunch treatment, however treatment times can be long and when combined with the moderate degradability of paunch this results in high treatment costs that need to be improved. Pre-treatment was investigated as a strategy to improve AD of paunch, alkaline treatment (NaOH or KOH) was selected due to the high lignin content. A range of alkaline loadings (1-20 g 100gTS-1) were tested with an equivalent hydroxide molar concentration of 9-250 mM [OH- ]. Alkaline pre-treatment improved both the hydrolysis rate and the overall degradability of paunch solid by up to 4.4 times and 60%, respectively. The enhanced hydrolysis rate and methane yield was correlated to changes in material composition during pre-treatment. While alkaline concentration was an important factor, there were no significant improvements at alkaline concentrations above 12 g 100gTS-1 (150 mM [OH- ]).

AB  - Sterculia quadrifida R.Br. Bark decoction is used to treat hepatitis and consumed as a tonic by Timorese in the East Nusa Tenggara Province, Indonesia. Raw herbal materials are susceptible to fungi contamination, have limitations in transportation, and have low economic value. Processing the bark into powder packed in tea bags is expected to overcome these obstacles. Stevia, ginger, and mint leaves are herbs often added to herbal drink formulas. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity, total flavonoid content (TFC), total phenol content (TPC), physicochemical properties, and sensory properties of six formulas, namely: (F1) pure S. quadrifida bark; (F2) bark of S. quadrifida and leaves of stevia; (F3) stem bark of S. quadrifida and ginger; (F4) bark of S. quadrifida, stevia, and ginger; (F5) bark of S. quadrifida and mint leaves; (F6) bark of S. quadrifida, stevia, and mint. Total phenolic content was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and total flavonoids were determined using the AICI3 method. Antioxidant activity was measured using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) method. The TPC of S. quadrifida tea ranged from 14.09 +/- 0.7 to 68.20 +/- 0.95% Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE), and the TFC ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.005 to 0.09 +/- 0.004% QE. The Ascorbic acid Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (AEAC) of F1, F2, F5, and F6 were insignificantly different. The pure S. quadrifida bark formula (F1) contained the highest levels of antioxidants (1,044.3 +/- 28.48 ppm Ascorbic Acid Equivalent (AAE)). Formulas with the addition of stevia, mint, and ginger showed weaker antioxidant activity than pure S. quadrifida. The formula of pure S. quadrifida bark (F1) and S. quadrifida with the addition of stevia (F2) have the potential to be developed as commercial herbal teas.

AB  - Local signaling events at synapses or axon terminals are communicated to the nucleus to elicit transcriptional responses, and thereby translate information about the external environment into internal neuronal representations. This retrograde signaling is critical to dendritic growth, synapse development, and neuronal plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal activity induces retrograde translocation and nuclear accumulation of endosomal adaptor APPL1. Disrupting the interaction of APPL1 with Importin alpha 1 abolishes nuclear accumulation of APPL1, which in turn decreases the levels of histone acetylation. We further demonstrate that retrograde translocation of APPL1 is required for the regulation of gene transcription and then maintenance of hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation. Thus, these results illustrate an APPL1-mediated pathway that contributes to the modulation of synaptic plasticity via coupling neuronal activity with chromatin remodeling.

AB  - ObjectiveOrofacial pain with high prevalence is one of the substantial human health issues. The importance of this matter became more apparent when it was revealed that orofacial pain, directly and indirectly, affects cognition performances. Currently, researchers have focused on investigating pharmaceutics to alleviate pain and ameliorate its subsequent cognitive impairments.DesignIn this study, the rats were first treated with the central administration of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bio-compound. After 20 min, orofacial pain was induced in the rats by the injection of capsaicin in their dental pulp. Subsequently, the animals' pain behaviors were analyzed, and the effects of pain and MeJA treatments on rats learning and memory were evaluated/compared using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. In addition, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 beta, BDNF, and COX-2 genes in the rats' hippocampus was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction.ResultsExperiencing orofacial pain resulted in a significant decline in the rats learning and memory. However, the central administration of 20 mu g/rat of MeJA effectively mitigated these impairments. In the MWM, the performance of the MeJA-treated rats showed a two- to threefold improvement compared to the nontreated ones. Moreover, in the hippocampus of pain-induced rats, the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and COX-2 significantly increased, whereas the BDNF expression decreased. In contrast, MeJA downregulated the pro-inflammatory factors and upregulated the BDNF by more than 50%.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the notable antinociceptive potential of MeJA and its ability to inhibit pain-induced learning and memory dysfunction through its anti-inflammatory effect.

AB  - Plant extracts have been successfully used to obtain nanoparticles with superior biological activity. This study assessed the biosynthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity, and cytotoxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) synthesized using the extracts of green tea (Camellia sinensis) or anise seeds (Pimpinella anisum) as reducing and capping agents. These plant extracts presented significant concentrations of important phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and flavonoids. The biosynthesized nanoparticles were characterized by antioxidant capabilities, dynamic light scattering, high transmission electron microscope, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Uv-visible spectral analyses. Spherical nanoparticles with sizes of 11.31 +/- 3.83 nm and 2.98 +/- 0.44 nm using green tea and anise were obtained, respectively. Both the extracts and the biosynthesized particles presented antioxidant properties. The antimicrobial activity of both nanoparticles was evaluated against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the nanoparticles and their ability to disrupt the established biofilm of P. aeruginosa. Both nanoparticles demonstrated significant inhibitory effects, with MIC values of 31.25 mu g/mL and 62.50 mu g/mL against E. coli and S. aureus strains, respectively, and 15.62 mu g/mL for the yeast. At the MIC concentration the nanoparticles inhibited 30 % of the bacterial cells of P. aeruginosa biofilm, and at higher concentrations, the CuO NPs achieved complete inhibition, i.e. more than 99 % of the cells. In these concentrations, the nanoparticles did not present significant cytotoxicity to mammal cells. These findings highlight the promising applications of both nanoparticles synthesized against resilient pathogens.

AB  - Simple Summary With the improvement of living standards, people have higher requirements for pork quality. Intramuscular fat is among the important factors that determine the quality of pork, affecting the taste and flavor. Producing quality meat with high intramuscular fat content has been a major challenge for China's livestock industry. In addition, m6A modification is abundant in many circRNAs, and m6A-circRNAs play an important regulatory role in a variety of biological processes. In this study, a total of 12 putative m6A-circRNAs were identified, their potential molecular regulatory mechanisms on fat deposition and meat quality in Chinese and Western pigs were explored through a series of bioinformatics analyses, which laid a foundation for further elucidations of the functions of m6A-circRNAs in fat deposition and growth and development of pigs. It is well known that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in linear RNA molecules, but many circRNA molecules have now been found to have a wide range of m6A modification sites as well. However, there are few relevant studies and information on the expression profile and functional regulatory properties of m6A-modified circRNAs (m6A-circRNAs) in longissimus dorsi. In this study, a total of 12 putative m6A-circRNAs were identified and characterized in the longissimus dorsi of Queshan Black and Large White pigs-8 of them were significantly more expressed in the longissimus dorsi of Queshan Black than in Large White pigs, while the other 4 were the opposite. These 12 putative m6A-circRNAs were also found to act as miRNA sponge molecules to regulate fat deposition by constructing the ceRNA regulatory network. Enrichment analysis also revealed that the 12 m6A-circRNAs parent genes and their adsorbed miRNA target genes were widely involved in fat deposition and cell proliferation and differentiation-related pathways, such as the HIF-1 signaling pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, and the TNF signaling pathway, suggesting that the analyzed m6A-circRNAs may be largely involved in the formation of pork quality. These results provide new information to study the regulatory properties of m6A-circRNAs in the formation of pork quality.

AB  - The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) have a wide range of foraging needs and heterogeneous habitat preferences that bring them close to the forest edge. Currently, most of the range of wild elephants is located outside protected areas (PA). Nighttime light data (NTL) has been used as a component of human footprint due to its characteristics of characterizing the intensity of human activities and spatio-temporal continuity. We chose Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve, the main distribution area of Asian elephants, as the study area and used NTL to monitor human activities, supplemented by land cover (LC) type data, to study the Asian elephant sanctuary and its surrounding areas, and found that: 1) NTL features inside and outside the PA are approaching, and the boundary effect of the sanctuary is weakening; 2) The NTL gathering area in the study area is mainly distributed in the south of the PA, 86.21% of the area's nighttime lights have a significant increase trend, and the human activity range is evolving toward the southeast in the past decade; 3) the percentage of areas with a significant increasing trend of NTL under different LC types is greater than decreasing, nearly 50% of the forest showed an increasing trend of NTL.

AB  - Simple Summary A ewe's diet in the last period of gestation can modify the immunoglobulin G composition of the colostrum and consequently the health status of lambs. This study aims to determine the role of hazelnut skin on the immunological colostrum quality and the passive immunity transfer in newborns. The results show that hazelnut skin supplementation in the diet positively affects the immunoglobulin G composition of the colostrum. The experimental trial underlines that the use of by-products in livestock feeding provides a paramount opportunity to create a circular economy system with health benefit on farmed animals. Passive immunity transfer has a pivotal role in newborn lambs, where the colostrum represents the primary source of immunoglobulins. This study hypothesized that the high content in polyphenolic compounds, mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, and vitamin E of hazelnut skin affects blood and colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration and related gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in sheep and their lambs. In the last 45 days of pregnancy, ewes were divided into a control (CTR) and a hazelnut skin supplemented group (HZN). Blood and colostrum were collected from ewes and lambs before the first suckling, at 24 and 48 h after birth, then IgG concentration, GGT and LDH activity levels were measured. IgG concentration in the colostrum and in lamb's serum were significantly greater in HZN than CTR. No significant difference was detected for ewe's blood. A significant positive correlation was found between IgG and GGT in lambs' serum and colostrum, between IgG and LDH, as well as between GGT and LDH in lambs' serum and colostrum. Our results suggest that hazelnut skin supplementation influences IgG colostrum concentration, with improved immune passive transfer to the suckling lambs. The transfer of maternal derived immune factors is confirmed by the GGT and LDH enzyme activity levels.

AB  - Drought is the most severe abiotic stress and hinders the normal growth and development of plants. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.) is a typical drought-resistant tree species. In this study, the leaves of the H. rhamnoides ssp. sinensis ('FN') and H. rhamnoides ssp. mongolica ('XY') were selected during drought-recovery cycles for RNA sequencing, and physiological and biochemical analyses. The results revealed that drought stress significantly decreased leaf water potential, net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance in both sea buckthorn subspecies. Similarly, the contents of flavone, flavonol, isoflavone and flavanone significantly decreased under drought stress in 'XY'. Conversely, in 'FN', the flavone and abscisic acid (ABA) contents were significantly higher under drought stress and recovered after rehydration. Meanwhile, 4618 and 6100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified under drought stress in 'FN' and 'XY', respectively. In total, 5164 DEGs were observed in the comparison between 'FN' and 'XY' under drought stress. This was more than the 3821 and 3387 DEGs found when comparing the subspecies under control and rehydration conditions, respectively. These DEGs were mainly associated with carotenoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Six hub DEGs (ABCG5, ABCG22, ABCG32, ABCG36, ABF2 and PYL4) were identified to respond to drought stress based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis using DroughtDB. These six DEGs were annotated to play roles in the ABA-dependent signaling pathway. Sixteen RNA sequencing results involving eight genes and similar expression patterns (12/16) were validated using quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of drought responses by ABA and flavonoids in sea buckthorn were clarified. In this study, gene co-expression networks were constructed, and the results suggested that the mutual regulation of ABA and flavonoid signaling contributed to the difference in drought resistance between the different sea buckthorn subspecies.

AB  - We present the description of a new species of Solifugae from the Iberian Peninsula, Gluvia brunnea sp. nov., which has been found so far in southeast Spain. The morphological description is accompanied by molecular and multiple factor analyses, jointly giving full support to the specific status of the taxon. Finally, we discuss the intraspecific variability of both species, G. dorsalis and G. brunnea sp. nov., and the recent history of the genus. We also discuss the usefulness of multiple factor analysis for quantitatively separating species, and we stress that some specimens of this new species were found in Mesovoid Shallow Substratum stations, representing the very first time that Solifugae have been captured in this type of trap.

AB  - Camellia yuhsienensis Hu, a species of tea oil tree with resistance to anthracnose, is widely used to breed disease-resistant Camellia varieties. In 2019, anthracnose symptoms were observed on Ca. yuhsienensis for the first time. However, the species and biological characteristics of Colletotrichum spp. isolated from Ca. yuhsienensis (YX-Colletotrichum spp.) have not been elucidated. In this study, five isolates (YX2-5-2, 2YX-3-1, 2YX-5-1, 2YX-8-1-1 and 2YX-8-1-2), which were consistent with the morphological characteristics of Colletotrichum spp., were obtained from Ca. yuhsienensis. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that YX2-5-2, 2YX-3-1 and 2YX-8-1-2 belonged to first clade along with Colletotrichum fructicola. 2YX-8-1-1 belonged to the second clade along with Colletotrichum siamense. 2YX-5-1 belonged to the third clade with Colletotrichum camelliae. Pathogenicity tests revealed that the pathogenicity of YX-Colletotrichum spp. was stronger than that of Colletotrichum spp. isolated from Camellia oleifera (GD-Colletotrichum spp.). Biological characteristics illustrated that the mycelial growth of YX-Co. camelliae (2YX-5-1) was slower than that of GD-Co. camelliae when the temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. In addition, in the presence of ions, the mycelial growth of YX-Co. fructicola (YX2-5-2) and YX-Co. siamense (2YX-8-1-1) was also slower than that of GD-Co. fructicola and GD-Co. siamense. Furthermore, the ability of YX-Colletotrichum spp. to utilize lactose and mannitol was weaker than that of GD-Colletotrichum spp., while the ability to utilize NH4+ was generally stronger than that of GD-Colletotrichum spp. This is the first report of anthracnose of Ca. yuhsienensis induced by Co. fructicola, Co. siamense and Co. camelliae in China. These results will provide theoretical guidance for the study of the pathogenesis and control of anthracnose on Ca. yuhsienensis.

TI  - Fermented Yak-Kong using Bifidobacterium animalis derived from Korean infant intestine effectively relieves muscle atrophy in an aging mouse model
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Yak-Kong (YK) is a small black soybean widely cultivated in Korea. It is considered to have excellent health functionality, as it has been reported to have better antioxidant efficacy than conventional black or yellow soybeans. Since YK has been described as good for the muscle health of the elderly in old oriental medicine books, this study sought to investigate the effect of fermented YK with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis LDTM 8102 (FYK) on muscle atrophy. In C2C12 mouse myoblasts, FYK elevated the expression of MyoD, total MHC, phosphorylated AKT, and PGC1 alpha. In addition, two kinds of in vivo studies were conducted using both an induced and normal aging mouse model. The behavioral test results showed that in the induced aging mouse model, FYK intake alleviated age-related muscle weakness and loss of exercise performance. In addition, FYK alleviated muscle mass decrease and improved the expression of biomarkers including total MHC, myf6, phosphorylated AKT, PGC1 alpha, and Tfam, which are related to myoblast differentiation, muscle protein synthesis, and mitochondrial generation in the muscle. In the normal aging model, FYK consumption did not increase muscle mass, but did upregulate the expression levels of biomarkers related to myoblast differentiation, muscle hypertrophy, and muscle function. Furthermore, it mitigated age-related declines in skeletal muscle force production and functional limitation by enhancing exercise performance and grip strength. Taken together, the results suggest that FYK has the potential to be a new functional food material that can alleviate the loss of muscle mass and strength caused by aging and prevent sarcopenia.

AB  - Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has been used to improve goats reproductive efficiency. This study aimed to (i) evaluate if hCG administered by the intramuscular (i.m.) or intravaginal (i.vag.) route can be detected by a rapid beta-hCG test in blood plasma samples and (ii) document ovarian effects of hCG administered by both routes at the time of artificial insemination (AI) performed 60 h after oestrus synchronization in goats. Twenty-two Alpine goats received two i.m. injections of 30 mu g of d-cloprostenol (Prolise (R), Tecnopec, Sao Paulo, Brazil) 7.5 days apart. One day after the onset of oestrus (at the time of AI), the goats were randomly allocated to one of the three groups that received: control (n = 7): 0.3 ml of saline solution intravaginally; hCG(i.m.) (n = 7): 300 IU of hCG (Vetecor (R); Hertape-Calier, Sao Paulo, Brazil) i.m. and hCG(i.vag.) (n = 8): 300 IU of hCG deposited intravaginally. Blood samples were drawn at -1, 3, 6, 9 and 24 h after as well as on days 3, 7, 10, 13, 17 and 21 after hCG treatment/AI. All animals tested negative for hCG (ECO Diagnostica, Corinto, Brazil) at -1 h, and all control animals tested negative throughout the entire blood collection period. All hCG(i.m.) animals tested positive from 3 h until D3 post-AI but only 50% of hCG(i.vag.) goats tested positive during the present study. In all animals studied, mean circulating P-4 concentrations increased (p < .05) from D3 to D7 after AI and then declined (p < .05) from D10 to D17 in control and hCG(i.m.) groups and from D17 to D21 in the hCG(i.vag.) group. Total cross-sectional luteal area (CLA), mean colour Doppler area (DA), DA/CLA, mean high-velocity Doppler area and HVDA/CLA all declined (p < .05) by D17-D21 in all animals studied. In summary: (i) human chorionic gonadotropin could consistently be detected in blood samples using the rapid beta-hCG test only in the hCG(i.m.) group; and (ii) there were no significant differences in the mean pregnancy rate, circulating P-4 concentrations and various luteal parameters studied among Control, hCG(i.m.) and hCG(i.vag.) dose.

AB  - Cypermethrin (CYP), a pyrethroid insecticide, exerts the detrimental effect on the reproductive system, while astaxanthin (AST), a xanthophyll carotenoid, possesses the powerful antioxidant property and can protect oocyte maturation. However, the toxicity of CYP and the protective role of AST against CYP during oocyte maturation remain unclear. Here, porcine oocytes were applied to investigate the potential effects and underlying mechanisms of CYP and AST during oocyte maturation. This work demonstrated that CYP significantly decreased oocyte maturation rate and subsequent embryo development in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). And, CYP obviously induced the overproduction of reactive oxygen spe-cies and the reduction of glutathione content by downregulating the expression of redox genes in oo-cytes (P < 0.05). Moreover, CYP significantly caused oocyte DNA damage and disturbed the function of endoplasmic reticulum by altering the transcription of DNA damage repair and endoplasmic reticulum stress related genes (P < 0.05). Whereas CYP-exposed oocytes were treated with AST, these defects caused by CYP were significantly ameliorated (P < 0.05).

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of raw andCandida utilis-fermentedyellow (YL) and narrow-leaved lupine (NL) seeds on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficients(AID) of protein and amino acids in pigs and the metabolic activity of their intestinal microflora.Five cross-bred castrated 25-kg barrows were surgically fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileumand housed individually in metabolic cages. They were fed five semi-synthetic diets containing only one source of protein: soybean meal (SBM), raw or fermented yellow lupine seeds (RYL or FYL), raw or fermented narrow-leaved lupine seeds (RNL or FNL). The study period consisted of six-day adaptation to the diet and one-day collection of digesta, which was sampled for microbial and chemical analyses. The AID coefficients of protein and amino acids were calculated with the marker method with TiO2. One-way (feed effect) and two-way (variety effect, fermentation effect)analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Duncans test at p < 0.05 were applied. The digesta from the SBM and FNL variants had significantly higher (p < 0.05) AID coefficients of protein, asparagine, threonine, serine, isoleucine, leucine, histidine, and tyrosine, whereas the SBM variant was characterized by the lowest AID of cystine and the highest AID of alanine and methionine (p < 0.05). The ileal digesta of the pigs fed with FYL contained more bacteria, whereas the count of yeast was higher in the FNL variant. The digesta of the pigs from the FNL and RYL variants had the highest count of moulds(p < 0.05), whereas the digesta in the FYL, SBM, and RNL variants had almost no moulds at all. The ileal dry matter content was significantly lower in SBM group. The lowest pH was noted in the RYL variant (p < 0.05). The content of ammonia and total volatile fatty acids in the ileal digesta of the SBM variant was the lowest (p < 0.05). Fermentation significantly improved the AID of protein, asparagine, threonine, tyrosine, histidine, and arginine, increased the counts of total bacteria and yeast, the pH value, and isobutyrate and isovalerate concentrations, but decreased the dry matter and ammonia & nbsp;content (p < 0.05). The digesta of the NL variants was characterized by higher AID of asparagine, threonine, serine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, and arginine, and higher counts of LAB and moulds but lower total bacteria count than in the YL variants. The ileal pH was lower in the YL variants, where higher isobutyrate and butyrate concentrations (p < 0.05) were observed. To sum up, fermentation increased the counts of the ileal microbiota and improved the digestibility coefficients of protein and some amino acids. The narrow-leaved lupine seeds resulted in more positive changes in the digesta of growing pigs than yellow lupine.</p>

AB  - Senecavirus A (SVA) is an oncolytic virus, which can propagate in human tumor cells and has been used as an oncolytic virotherapy candidate in humans. Besides, SVA circulates in pigs and causes vesicles and coalescing erosions on the snouts and coronary bands in infected pigs and results in neonatal morbidity. SVA has evolved the ability to suppress host innate immune response to benefit viral replication. SVA 3Cpro and 2C protein inhibit the production of host type I interferon (IFN) by degradation of several components of innate immune pathway. In this study, for the first time, we determined that SVA 2B antagonized host innate immune response in both human and porcine cells. SVA 2B protein degraded mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), a key host molecule in the innate immune pathway, and a colocalization and interaction between 2B and MAVS was observed in the context of viral infection. Further study showed that the 1-48 and 100-128 regions of 2B were essential for inhibition of type I IFN expression. In addition, we determined that 2B degraded MAVS depending on caspase-9 and caspase-3. In conclusion, our results revealed a novel strategy for SVA 2B protein to antagonize host innate immune response, which will help for clarification of the pathogenesis of SVA and provide an insight for oncolytic virotherapy of SVA.

AB  - Fat tissue-a vital energy storage organ-is intricately regulated by various factors, including circular RNA, which plays a significant role in modulating fat development and lipid metabolism. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the regulatory mechanism of sheep adipocyte proliferation and differentiation by investigating the involvement of circTIAM1, miR-485-3p, and its target gene PLCB1. Through previous sequencing data, circTIAM1 was identified in sheep adipocytes, with its circularization mechanism elucidated, confirming its cytoplasmic localization. Experimental evidence from RNase R treatment and transcription inhibitors highlighted that circTIAM1 is more stable than linear RNA. Additionally, circTIAM1 promoted sheep adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a robust interaction between miR-485-3p and circTIAM1. Further experiments revealed that miR-485-3p inhibits fat cell proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting PLCB1, with circTIAM1 alleviating the inhibitory effect via competitive binding. In summary, our findings elucidate the mechanism through which circTIAM1 regulates Guangling Large-Tailed sheep adipocyte proliferation and differentiation via the miR-485-3p-PLCB1 pathway, offering a novel perspective for further exploring fat metabolism regulation.

AB  - The preventive and therapeutic mechanisms of CDBE on osteoporosis were studied by observing the serum bone-related biochemical indicators, bone trabecular micro-structure and intestinal flora in ovariectomized osteoporosis model mice, in order to provide a scientific theoretical basis for the further study on the effect of CDBE on osteoporosis, and the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis with clinical traditional Chinese medicines. The components in CDBE were detected by UHPLC-MS. A mouse osteoporosis model was established by the bilateral ovariectomy in female ICR mice. The biochemical indicators related to osteoporosis were detected, the right proximal tibia was scanned by Micro-CT, the intestinal microflora in the colon contents were examined, and the changes of microflora were taken as the main target to evaluate the effect of CDBE on the intestinal microflora in the model mice. A total of 16 compounds were obtained by the combined application of UHPLC-MS. CDBE could significantly increase the contents of E2, Ca2+, CT, HyP, OCN, FOXP3, P1NP and CTX-II, in the model mice. CDBE could significantly improve the trabecular micro-structure, Tb.N, Tb.Sp, SMI and Conn.D. CDBE could make the intestinal flora of osteoporosis model mice tend to healthy mice in species and quantity. CDBE can improve the symptoms of postmenopausal osteoporosis in mice, with a positive effect on the intestinal flora of postmenopausal mice. Its mechanism of regulating the symptoms of osteoporosis may be related to the regulation of bone-related biochemical indicators in the serum of mice.
   Practical applications This research has a positive impact on the development of functional food with anti-osteoporosis in the future.

AB  - Sugarcane is a long duration important cash crop in India which is harvest after 10-18 months. Amongst various biotic and abiotic stressors affecting sugarcane, sugarcane stalk borer Chilo auricilius causes huge economic losses in yield and quality parameters. No synthetic chemical is effective against stalk borer due to its internally feeder habitat. Therefore, one ecologically sound best management practice in sugarcane is application of silicon to mitigate against stalk borer. Various sources of silicon viz. T-1, T-2, T-3 and T-4 were of silicon material (SM) 50% @ 8, 10, 12 and 15 kg/acre, respectively; T-5 and T-6 were of rice husk ash (RHA) @ 200 and 400 kg/acre; T-7 and T-8 were of bagasse ash (BA) @ 200 and 400 kg/acre; T(9)Trichogramma chilonis @ 20,000 eggs per card (12 releases) and T-10 untreated control were evaluated for retention in soil, plant and impact on stalk borer, cane yield and quality traits in sugarcane cultivar CoPb 98. In soil, silicon persistence decreased over the time in T-4 at 0 (209.82 +/- 1.28 mg kg(-1)) and 300 days after planting (DAP) (126.94 +/- 4.49 mg kg(-1)), respectively. In sugarcane stalks, the uptake of silicon increased over days (T-4) 1.84 +/- 0.07 and 2.50 +/- 0.32 mg kg(-1) at 0 and 300 DAP, respectively. Stalk borer incidence (%) reduced significantly in T-4 (12.89 +/- 0.77%) compared to control (21.33 +/- 1.33%) (p <= 0.000). Cane traits viz. cane length, per cent germination, number of millable cane/clump, single cane weight, yield increased significantly with the application of silicon. Juice quality traits such as Brix, Sucrose, Commercial cane sugar, CCS and CCS %, were also enhanced significantly in CoPb 98. As observed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), third instar stalk borer larvae on the Si+ stalks eroded their mandibles with feeding on silicon enriched tissues. The cost-benefit ratio showed that among the SM the highest B:C ratio 1.74 in (T-4) SM 50% @ 15 kg/acre was at par 1:73 with 12 kg/acre (T-3) in terms of reducing stalk borer infestation and significantly increase cane yield and quality traits. Therefore, SM 50% @ 12 kg/acre can be used for the management of stalk borer and also be vibrant part of integrated pest management in sugarcane crop.

AB  - PDCoV is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that mainly causes acute diarrhea in piglets, seriously affecting pig breeding industries worldwide. To date, the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-induced immune and inflammatory responses or host responses in LLC-PK cells in vitro are not well understood. HSP90 plays important roles in various viral infections. In this study, HSP90AB1 knockout cells (HSP90AB1(KO)) were constructed and a comparative transcriptomic analysis between PDCoV-infected HSP90AB1(WT) and HSP90AB1(KO) cells was conducted using RNA sequencing to explore the effect of HSP90AB1 on PDCoV infection. A total of 1295 and 3746 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in PDCoV-infected HSP90AB1(WT) and HSP90AB1(KO) cells, respectively. Moreover, most of the significantly enriched pathways were related to immune and inflammatory response-associated pathways upon PDCoV infection. The DEGs enriched in NF-kappa B pathways were specifically detected in HSP90AB1(WT) cells, and NF-kappa B inhibitors JSH-23, SC75741 and QNZ treatment reduced PDCoV infection. Further research revealed most cytokines associated with immune and inflammatory responses were upregulated during PDCoV infection. Knockout of HSP90AB1 altered the upregulated levels of some cytokines. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the host response to PDCoV infection from the transcriptome perspective, which will contribute to illustrating the molecular basis of the interaction between PDCoV and HSP90AB1.

AB  - Secondary plant metabolites with a specific function are a diverse group of molecules responsible for adapting the plant to its environment. Within the adaptation of plants is the defense against herbivores and pathogens. Among the specialized metabolites is the group of alkaloids, encompassing the capsaicinoids. Capsaicinoids are molecules found in the fruits of the Capsicum genus plants that are responsible for their spicy taste. The main capsaicinoid is capsaicin. Capsaicin has a broad activity spectrum, including antibacterial and antifungal effects. The extraction of specific capsaicinoids from the fruits of Capsicum is complicated, expensive, and of low yield, due to the similarity in the structures. Thus, it is more convenient to synthesize their compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of a synthetic capsaicinoid oleoresin (CO, containing 70% nonivamide and 30% dihydrocapsaicin) against single isolates of Fusarium oxysporum Sch and Clavibacter michiganensis Davis (in vitro and in vivo), as well as against Phytophthora capsici Leon. and Pseudomonas syringae Van Hall (in vitro), the former two both in vitro and in vivo, the last two only in vitro. Inhibition of growth of these pathogens ranging from 25.2 to 94.8% was obtained in in vitro assays. In vitro tests were carried out in liquid and solid growth inhibition medium assays for Fusarium oxysporum, Phytophthora capsici, Clavibacter michiganensis and Pseudomonas syringae. In vivo tests used plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) for Clavibacter michiganensis and Fusarium oxysporum. Post-harvest tests were carried out on tomato fruits with natural infections. In vivo tests showed inhibitions from 80.6 to 97.2% and 87.7% in soil for Fusarium oxysporum and in plant for Clavibacter michiganensis, respectively, at concentrations of 0.05 and 0.10% of CO. A significant decrease in damage index was found in plants inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum and Clavibacter michiganensis and treated with CO at 0.05 and 0.10%. Post-harvest tests displayed a significant difference for weight loss and fruit damage due to rotting in the treatment CO 0.05% and 0.20% in comparison to control.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a chronic disease affecting 1% worldwide population, of which 30% are refractory to the available treatments: thus, searching for new pharmacological targets is imperative. The acute and repeated ketamine administration are validated preclinical models that recreate the behavioral and neurochemical features of this pathology, including the parvalbumin-expressing interneurons dysfunction. Angiotensin II, through AT(1) receptors (AT(1)-R), modulates the dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We evaluated the AT(1)-R role in the long-term neuronal activation and behavioral alterations induced by repeated ketamine administration. Adult male Wistar rats received AT(1)-R antagonist candesartan/vehicle (days 1-10) and ketamine/saline (days 6-10). After 14 days of drug-free, neuronal activation and behavioral analysis were performed. Locomotor activity, social interaction and novel object recognition tests were assessed at basal conditions or after ketamine challenge. Immunostaining for c-Fos, GAD67 and parvalbumin were assessed after ketamine challenge in cingulate, insular, piriform, perirhinal, and entorhinal cortices, striatum, and hippocampus. Additionally, to evaluate the AT(1)-R involvement in acute ketamine psychotomimetic effects, the same behavioral tests were performed after 6 days of daily-candesartan and a single-ketamine administration. We found that ketamine-induced long-lasting schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations, and regional-dependent neuronal activation changes, involving the GABAergic neurotransmission system and the parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, were AT(1)-R-dependent. The AT(1)-R were not involved in the acute ketamine psychotomimetic effects. These results add new evidence to the wide spectrum of action of ketamine and strengthen the AT(1)-R involvement in endurable alterations induced by psychostimulants administration, previously proposed by our group, as well as their preponderant role in the development of psychiatric pathologies.

AB  - Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are taxonomically unique mammals in the order Carnivora that evolved to an arboreal and herbivorous existence in the mountainous regions of south east-central Asia. Now endangered, they have a precarious future in nature due to ever-changing environmental conditions and increasing anthropogenic threats. This study reports on an early mitochondrial DNA survey successfully accomplished by fecal sampling of 68 (minimum) wild red pandas in three regional populations of Nepal at the western end of their range. From 383 bp of control region sequences, our study identified 17 haplotypes, relatively high haplotype diversity (Hd = 0.83) but low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.010) overall with both measures decreasing from east to west, a comparatively close phylogenetic relationship between mtDNA-defined subspecies, differentiation of one population, and the discovery of a haplotype in two samples that belongs to the purported subspecies previously recorded only from the eastern end of their range. We argue for caution in elevating taxonomic rank without incorporating other species-defining criteria, suggest reconsidering subspecies' boundaries and investigating hybridization in the contact zone, provide some evolutionary hypotheses for the genetic distribution exposed, propose specific applications for conservation management, and stress inclusion of nuclear markers to complement future research. This study presents valuable information on red panda population genetics from the western end of their range in Nepal, essential for recovery programs like the IUCN Green Status of Species, to establish an historical baseline for future genetic monitoring and decision-making in the conservation of a rare but iconic endangered species.

AB  - The root lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans parasitizes a wide range of economically important crops, including potato (Solanum tuberosum). Damage by P. penetrans impacts not only the potato yield but can also reduce the tuber quality. Detailed information on tuber infection by P. penetrans is scarce for most cultivars and molecular detection of nematodes from infected tubers is needed. The objective of this study was to assess tuber symptomatology due to P. penetrans infection in 10 potato cultivars and to provide an accurate molecular methodology for nematode detection using tuber peels. Sprouts of certified potato seed from cultivars Agata, Agria, Camel, Desiree, Dirosso, Kennebec, Laura, Picasso, Royata, and Stemster were planted in 2 L pots, and soil was inoculated with 4 P. penetrans/g of soil. Sixty days after inoculation, tubers were harvested, inspected for lesions, and the number of nematodes/g of potato peel assessed. Observations of tubers with symptoms showed the presence of P. penetrans in superficial layers of peels around the lenticels and injured necrotic tissue. Different nematode stages were detected in tubers of all inoculated cultivars, varying from 4 to 46 nematodes/g of potato peel. Species-specific primers showed suitable sensitivity and reproducibility for the detection of P. penetrans in tuber potato peel samples. The molecular detection of P. penetrans directly from tuber peels can facilitate routine nematode inspections of potato seed tubers or cull potatoes for nematode detection, and prevent further dissemination of this species.

AB  - It has been established that cisplatin causes neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. However, the mechanism is not sufficiently clear. Apelin-13 is an endogenous peptide with strong neuroprotective effects through the synthesis of neurotrophic factors and suppression of inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) signaling pathway and the potential inhibitory effects of apelin-13 in the mechanism of cisplatin-induced hippocampal damage and cognitive impairment. Apelin-13 was administered to adult sprague dawley male rats at a dose of 20 nmol/kg every day for 4 weeks, cisplatin was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg once a week for 4 weeks. The spatial and recognition memory tests of the rats were performed on the 5th week. BDNF and the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) and interleukin-1? (IL-1?) levels were measured by ELISA in hippocampal homogenates. Pyramidal neuron and glial cell damage in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) were analyzed histologically. TrkB activity in the hippocampus was determined by immunohistochemical methods. Cisplatin impaired spatial and recognition memory in rats, while apelin-13 improved spatial memory but did not affect recognition memory. Cisplatin suppressed BDNF in the hippocampus while increased IL-1? and TNF-?. In contrast, apelin-13 administration increased BDNF but significantly suppressed TNF-? and IL-1B. Cisplatin caused pyramidal neuron and glial cell damage in CA1, CA3 and DG. In the cisplatin + apelin-13 group, however, pyramidal neuron and glial cell damage was less than those without apelin-13. Cisplatin increased TrkB activity in the hippocampus, which was counteracted by apelin-13. In conclusion, apelin-13 reduced the cisplatininduced cognitive deficiency, by suppressing inflammation and stimulating the synthesis and activation of neurotrophic factors in hippocampal tissue.

AB  - It is a known fact that cryopreservation initiates premature capacitation in spermatozoa during the cryopreservation process. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a landmark of cascade reaction account-able for capacitation or capacitation-like changes in spermatozoa. Therefore, our hypothesis was to test an inhibitor (H89) that reversibly inhibits the cascade reaction responsible for capacitation during the cryopreservation process but does not hamper normal capacitation and fertilizing ability of sperm. For this, sixteen ejaculates were collected from Murrah buffalo bulls (n 1/4 4). Each ejaculate was divided into four equal aliquots and diluted in an egg yolk-based semen dilutor supplemented with 0, 2, 10, and 30 mM concentrations of H89 and cryopreserved. Interestingly, H89 reduces cholesterol efflux from spermatozoa and protects spermatozoa from membrane damage during the cryopreservation process. H89 did not prevent lipid peroxidation of the sperm membrane. H89 reduced intracellular calcium concentration in spermatozoa in a dose-dependent manner, but tyrosine phosphorylation reduction was observed in the 2 and 10 mM H89 groups. The CTC assay revealed that the percentage of uncapacitated spermatozoa in different treatment groups increases in a dose-dependent manner. In the in vitro capacitation medium, the effect of H89 is abolished and spermatozoa underwent normal capacitation, but H89-treated spermatozoa attached to zona pellucida in large numbers compared to untreated spermatozoa. In conclusion, H89 does not only inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of spermatozoa but it reduces cholesterol efflux and calcium influx, and ultimately reduces capacitation-like changes during the cryopreservation process.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Main conclusion Genetic variation in seed protein composition, seed protein gene expression and predictions of seed protein physiochemical properties were documented in C. sativa and other Camelina species. Seed protein diversity was examined in six Camelina species (C. hispida, C. laxa, C. microcarpa, C. neglecta, C. rumelica and C. sativa). Differences were observed in seed protein electrophoretic profiles, total seed protein content and amino acid composition between the species. Genes encoding major seed proteins (cruciferins, napins, oleosins and vicilins) were catalogued for C. sativa and RNA-Seq analysis established the expression patterns of these and other genes in developing seed from anthesis through to maturation. Examination of 187 C. sativa accessions revealed limited variation in seed protein electrophoretic profiles, though sufficient to group the majority into classes based on high MW protein profiles corresponding to the cruciferin region. C. sativa possessed four distinct types of cruciferins, named CsCRA, CsCRB, CsCRC and CsCRD, which corresponded to orthologues in Arabidopsis thaliana with members of each type encoded by homeologous genes on the three C. sativa sub-genomes. Total protein content and amino acid composition varied only slightly; however, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CsCRA and CsCRB genes contributed > 95% of the cruciferin transcripts in most lines, whereas CsCRC genes were the most highly expressed cruciferin genes in others, including the type cultivar DH55. This was confirmed by proteomics analyses. Cruciferin is the most abundant seed protein and contributes the most to functionality. Modelling of the C. sativa cruciferins indicated that each type possesses different physiochemical attributes that were predicted to impart unique functional properties. As such, opportunities exist to create C. sativa cultivars with seed protein profiles tailored to specific technical applications.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the effects of vitamin B-12 in cryopreservation medium on frozen-thawed semen of buffalo (Bubalus Bubalis) bulls. Semen from five bulls (fertility-proven) were diluted in five aliquots not supplemented (control), or supplemented with 1, 2, 4, or 5 mg/mL of vitamin B-12 and evaluated using the Computer Assisted Sperm motion Analysis, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation (LPO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP concentrations, and in vitro fertilization rate (%). Sperm progressive motility, rapid velocity (%), mitochondrial potential, and acrosome integrity were greater (P < 0.05) with supplementation of 4, and 5 mg/mL vitamin B-12 than the control sample. Similarly, compared with the control, samples with 5 mg/mL vitamin B-12 supplementation had markedly greater average-path, straight-line, and curved-line velocities (um/sec). Semen samples supplemented with 2, 4 and 5 mg/mL vitamin B-12 had greater concentrations of GPx (U/mL) and SOD (U/mL), whereas LPO (mu M/mL) was less (P < 0.05) compared with the control sample. Seminal plasma ROS concentrations (10(4)/25 x 10(6)) were less in the 5 mg/mL vitamin B-12 supplemented than control sample. Semen samples supplemented with 5 mg/mL of vitamin B-12 had greater concentrations of ATP than control and the 1 mg/mL vitamin B-12 supplemented sample. Semen samples supplemented with 5 mg/mL of vitamin B-12 had greater plasmalemma and DNA integrities (%) than the control sample. In summary, vitamin B-12 supplementation augments semen quality, as evidenced by values for CASA variables, antioxidant enzymes, and ATP concentrations, which may occur as a consequence of inhibition in LPO and ROS production by buffalo spermatozoa.

AB  - Background: Elderly patients experience postoperative cognitive impairment frequently; therefore, effective interventions are urgently needed. Central nervous inflammation characterized by microglia may promote the progression of POCD by reducing synaptic plasticity. Notably, clinical studies revealed that the incidence of female patients was significantly lower than that of male patients. Besides, the brain estrogens have an anti-inflammatory effect and regulate the microglia at the same times. This study aimed to determine whether suppressing microglia overactivation by hippocampal estrogens can rescue the decrease of synaptic plasticity after surgery and anesthesia.Methods: Exploratory laparotomy was used to establish the POCD model in 15-month-old male or female C57BL/6 J mice and animal behavioral tests were performed to test hippocampal-dependent memory capacity. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to detect the microglial activation and plasticity related protein expressions. Elisa was used to detect the content of estrogens in the hippocampus. Estrogens and estrogen receptor inhibitor were used to replenish the estrogens in the brain and inhibit the effect of estrogens.Results: Surgery and anesthesia did not cause POCD in female mice (P > 0.05), while the cognitive function decreased significantly after estrogen receptor inhibitor was given(P < 0.05). Male mice experienced cognitive dysfunction after surgery and anesthesia, and their cognitive function improved after estrogens supplementation (P < 0.05). Given estrogens and estrogen receptor inhibitors at the same time, the cognitive function of male mice could not be saved (P < 0.05). By correlation analysis, there was a negative correlation between the content of hippocampal estrogens and microglia (P < 0.05). The number or degree of activation of microglia affected the synaptic plasticity, which ultimately regulated the cognitive function of mice.Conclusion: Hippocampal estrogens rescued the decline of synaptic plasticity after surgery and anesthesia by inhibiting microglia overactivation

AB  - Background In mammals, transitioning from sole milk uptake to the intake of solid feed results in dramatic developmental changes in intestinal function and immunological status. In fact, weaning stress is often accompanied by intestinal inflammatory processes. To develop effective intervention strategies, it is necessary to characterize the developmental pattern and immune response that occurs on weaning, as we have done in this study for piglets. Results To comprehensively delineate cell heterogeneity in ileum tissues and the underlying mechanisms in weaning-induced intestinal inflammation of piglets, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of 42,149 cells from ileum mucosa of normally suckling and post-weaned piglets. There were 31 cell subtypes including epithelial, stromal, and immune cells. A bifurcating trajectory was inferred to separate secretory and absorptive lineages. Integrated cross-species datasets showed well-conserved cellular architectures and transcription signatures between human and pig. Comparative analyses of cellular components, cell-cell communications, and molecular states revealed that T cell subpopulations were significantly altered in weaned piglets. We found that T helper (Th) 17 functional plasticity across changes in the cytokine milieu and the enrichment of granzyme B (GZMB)-expressing cytotoxic T cells potentially exacerbate mucosal inflammation via mitochondrial dysfunction in epithelial cells. Conclusions Our work has elucidated the single-cell molecular characteristics of the piglet ileum before and after weaning. We have provided an atlas that portrays the landscape of the intestinal pathophysiological inflammatory process associated with weaning, finding a level of conservation between human and pig that support the use of piglets as a model for human infants.

AB  - In Europe, mountain livestock farming systems fall within the scope of the agro-ecological transition due largely to animals grazing on spontaneous vegetation. Recently, the development of organic farming production has become noticeable and has contributed to changes in production systems organization. In the context of a strong sociotechnical system, around dairy sheep production, in the "Grands Causses" region in southern France, we investigate whether this development is a means of fostering the agro-ecological transition. We interviewed seventeen farmers chosen to capture changes in breeding practices under effects due to sociotechnical system. We describe their conversion to organic farming using the processual analysis framework, studying the changes in their practices over time with regard to the sociotechnical system. In the early 2000s, some farmers entered the first pathway to organic conversion, while milk sales under organic signs were not possible because the local collection network was insufficient and the network was not near their farm. Then, in 2005, a second pathway to organic conversion emerged with farmers looking to increase their free time and their revenue, which requires increasing milk production (volume) and recruiting a new collaborator. These farmers chose to supply their organic milk with a price premium to dairies operating outside the Roquefort interprofessional organization, which at that time had restricted volumes by "quotas." A third pathway to conversion was developed in 2014, following the abolition of the "quotas," and it drew producers who were looking for a niche to secure the price of their milk; these producers were encouraged by the future buyers of their farms who wanted to continue with organic farming. In the three pathways, the farmers stopped using chemical inputs, replacing them with other practices and showing that organic farming permits certain agroecology principles, such as closing nutrient cycles. To sell milk with premium price due to organic products, some of the farmers changed the seasonality of production (April to October) and increased the productivity of ewes (liter/ewe), contributing to a reduction or abandonment in rangeland grazing. However, not all the farmers in our sample opted for these strategies, proving that organic farms are very diverse. This questions the choice of organic agriculture as a means of upholding all the principles of the agro-ecological transition and shows the importance of the sociotechnical system, specifically the organization of downstream sector and agricultural extension actors to promote it.

AB  - In this study, the implementation of traditional machine learning models in the intelligent management of swine is explored, focusing on the impact of LDA preprocessing on pig facial recognition using an SVM. Through experimental analysis, the kernel functions for two testing protocols, one utilizing an SVM exclusively and the other employing a combination of LDA and an SVM, were identified as polynomial and RBF, both with coefficients of 0.03. Individual identification tests conducted on 10 pigs demonstrated that the enhanced protocol improved identification accuracy from 83.66% to 86.30%. Additionally, the training and testing durations were reduced to 0.7% and 0.3% of the original times, respectively. These findings suggest that LDA preprocessing significantly enhances the efficiency of individual pig identification using an SVM, providing empirical evidence for the deployment of SVM classifiers in mobile and embedded systems.

AB  - Extant Old World camels (genus Camelus) contributed to the economic and cultural exchanges between the East and West for thousands of years.1,2 Although many remains have been unearthed,3-5 we know neither whether the prevalent hybridization observed between extant Camelus species2,6,7 also occurred between extinct lineages and the ancestors of extant Camelus species nor why some populations became extinct while others survived. To investigate these questions, we generated paleogenomic and stable isotope data from an extinct two -humped camel species, Camelus knoblochi. We find that in the mitochondrial phylogeny, all C. knoblochi form a paraphyletic group that nests within the diversity of modern, wild two -humped camels (Camelus ferus). In contrast, they are clearly distinguished from both wild and domesticated (Camelus bactrianus) two -humped camels on the nuclear level. Moreover, the divergence pattern of the three camel species approximates a trifurcation, because the most common topology is only slightly more frequent than the two other possible topologies. This mito-nuclear phylogenetic discordance likely arose due to interspecific gene flow between all three species, suggesting that interspecific hybridization is not exclusive to modern camels but a recurrent phenomenon throughout the evolutionary history of the genus Camelus. These results suggest that the genomic complexity of Old World camels' evolutionary history is underestimated when considering data from only modern species. Finally, we find that C. knoblochi populations began declining prior to the last glacial maximum and, by integrating palaeoecological evidence and stable isotope data, suggest that this was likely due to failure to adapt to a changing environment.

AB  - In the last two decades, there has been a blossoming literature aiming to counter the neglect of plant capacities. In their recent paper, Miguel Segundo-Ortin and Paco Calvo begin by providing an overview of the literature to then question the mistaken assumptions that led to plants being immediately rejected as candidates for sentience. However, it appears that many responses to their arguments are based on the implicit conviction that because animals have far more sophisticated cognition and agency than plants, and that plants should not have the same moral status as animals, plants should not have any moral status. Put in simpler terms: it is not as bad to eat plants than to eat, say, pigs. While there are still uncertainties around comparative moral and policy implications between animals and plants, given a gradualist account of quasi-sentience and partial moral status, both of which we claim are a matter of degree, we may not have to abolish our convictions by declaring that plants have no sentience or moral status at all. Indeed, we can hold two things at the same time: that animals and plants have moral status, but animals have prima facie more moral status than plants.

AB  - Ozone (O-3)-induced metabolic changes in leaves are relevant and may have several ecological significances. Here, variations in foliar chemistry of two poplar clones (Populus deltoides x maximowiczii, Eridano, and P. x euramericana, I-214) under a chronic O-3 treatment (80 ppb, 5 h d(-1) for 10 consecutive days) were investigated. The aim was to elucidate if leaf age and/or O-3-sensitivity (considering Eridano and I-214 as O-3-sensitive and O-3-resistant, respectively) can affect suitability of poplar foliage for Chrysomela populi L. (Coleoptera Chrysomelidae), in terms of palatability. Comparing controls, only low amino acid (AA) contents were reported in Eridano [about 3- and 4-fold in mature and young leaves (ML and YL, respectively)], and all the investigated primary metabolites [i.e. water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), proteins (Prot) and AA] were higher in YL than in ML of I-214 (+23, +54 and + 20%, respectively). Ozone increased WSC only in YL of Eridano (+24%, i.e. highest values among samples; O-3 effects are always reported comparing O-3-treated plants with the related controls). A concomitant decrease of Prot was observed in both ML and YL of Eridano, while only in YL of I-214 (-41, -45 and -51%, respectively). In addition, O-3 decreased AA in YL of Eridano and in ML of I-214 (-40 and -14%, respectively). Comparing plants maintained under charcoal-filtered air, total ascorbate (Asc) was lower in Eridano in both ML and YL (around -22%), and abscisic acid (ABA) was similar between clones; furthermore, higher levels of Asc were reported in YL than in ML of Eridano (+19%). Ozone increased Asc and ABA (about 2- and 3-fold, respectively) in both ML and YL of Eridano, as well as ABA in YL of I-214 (about 2-fold). Comparing leaves maintained under charcoal-filtered air, the choice feeding test showed that the 2nd instar larvae preferred YL, and the quantity of YL consumed was 9 and 4-fold higher than ML in Eridano and I-214, respectively. Comparing leaves exposed to O-3-treatment, a significant feeding preference for YL disks was also observed, regardless of the clone. The no-choice feeding test showed that larval growth was slightly higher on untreated YL than on untreated ML (+19 and + 10% in Eridano and I-214, respectively). The body mass of larvae fed with O-3-treated YL was also significantly higher than that of larvae fed with untreated YL (3- and 2-fold in Eridano and I-214). This study highlights that realistic O-3 concentrations can significantly impact the host/insect interactions, a phenomenon dependent on leaf age and O-3-sensitivity of the host.

AB  - In keeping with sustainability initiatives in the commercial wood protection sector to develop cost-effective, environmentally acceptable wood treatment alternatives to traditional biocides, this paper reports on an above -ground test for protection against subterranean termite damage to blocks of termite -susceptible heartwood of tropical (Malaysian) kempas hardwood (Koompassia malaccensis). The blocks were envelope -treated (brush -on) with a novel wood preservative based on plant extracts in a cypermethrin mixture (Biocide 1: 0.16% cypermethrin, 0.08% tebuconazole, 2% vegetal extracts). A commercial permethrin-based LOSP (Biocide 2: 0.2% permethrin, 1.8% tributyltin naphthenate, 0.1% dichlorofluanid) applied in 3 -minute dips served as the control treatment. The air-dried kempas blocks were H2 -weathered under a rigorous laboratory volatilization regime (representing long-term evaporative ageing of treated wood for above -ground indoor use in prolonged H2 -hazard class situations). The blocks were then exposed for 6 months above ground, inside a containerised test design targeting subterranean Coptotermes curvignathus termites, at a humid forest site (representing a severe H2 -hazard class situation with treated wood isolated from wetting, soil contact, and weather). The results showed irrefutably that untreated kempas heartwood was severely attacked by C. curvignathus (mean mass loss: 70.4% and 20,416 mg) with a low mean visual termite rating (2.4). However, the treated kempas wood was well protected at very low surface retention of Biocide 1 (mean negligible mass loss: 0.66% and 207 mg) and very low surface retention of the control Biocide 2 (mean negligible mass loss: 1.01% and 306 mg), with both treatments similarly yielding the highest mean visual termite rating for all replicate kempas specimens (rating 10). The performances of the two biocides were similar but varied significantly (P < 0.05) from the attacks against their untreated counterparts. Biocide 1 therefore has considerable anti -termite potential and could replace conventional LOSP Biocide 2 treatments to protect wood exposed to a long-term H2 -hazard class environment.

AB  - The key role of APP for Alzheimer pathogenesis is well established. However, perinatal lethality of germline knockout mice lacking the entire APP family has so far precluded the analysis of its physiological functions for the developing and adult brain. Here, we generated conditional APP/APLP1/APLP2 triple KO (cTKO) mice lacking the APP family in excitatory forebrain neurons from embryonic day 11.5 onwards. NexCre cTKO mice showed altered brain morphology with agenesis of the corpus callosum and disrupted hippocampal lamination. Further, NexCre cTKOs revealed reduced basal synaptic transmission and drastically reduced long-term potentiation that was associated with reduced dendritic length and reduced spine density of pyramidal cells. With regard to behavior, lack of the APP family leads not only to severe impairments in a panel of tests for learning and memory, but also to an autism-like phenotype including repetitive rearing and climbing, impaired social communication, and deficits in social interaction. Together, our study identifies essential functions of the APP family during development, for normal hippocampal function and circuits important for learning and social behavior.

AB  - Simple Summary Two major concerns for sustainable swine production are the shortage of protein feed resources and the excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment. Those concerns can be partly alleviated by increasing nitrogen utilization by improving nutrition for pigs. This study observed that a low crude protein and dietary fiber supplemented diet can improve nitrogen utilization and reduce urinary nitrogen excretion. Additionally, late gestating sows have greater nitrogen utilization than those of early gestation, characterized by reduced nitrogen in urine and lower amino acids in serum. These findings offer nutritional solutions for improving nitrogen utilization. To investigate the effects of dietary fiber (DF), crude protein (CP) level, and gestation stage on nitrogen utilization, 28 Landrace-Yorkshire cross gestating sows at parity two were randomly divided into four dietary treatments with seven duplicates of one pig with a repeated-measures design. The diets comprised one with normal crude protein (CP) of 13.3%, one with a low CP diet of 10.1%, and two diets, one with dietary fiber (DF) supplementation of inulin and cellulose at the ratio of 1:1 and one without DF. The total litter size, litter size alive, and newborn birthweight of piglets did not differ between treatment groups. Sows that received high DF levels had greater nitrogen output in feces, lower urinary nitrogen, and increased nitrogen retention. Sows that received a low CP diet had reduced nitrogen excretion in feces and urine, lower nitrogen retention, and an unchanged nitrogen retention ratio. Sows at the late stage of gestation on days 95 to 98 had lower nitrogen excretion in urine and greater nitrogen retention than in the early stage of gestation on days 35 to 38, associated with a significant decrease in serum amino acids in late gestation. Maternal protein deposition was increased by high DF, decreased by low CP, and lower in late gestation compared with early gestation. Collectively, DF improved nitrogen utilization by decreasing urine nitrogen output, and nitrogen utilization increased as gestation advanced.

AB  - Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an effective stimulator of the immune system, has been widely applied in an experimental pig model for human sepsis. Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of small integral membrane proteins responsible for facilitating water fluxes through the cell membrane, offer potential promising drug targets for sepsis treatment due to their role in water balance and inflammation.Methods: In order to investigate the potential effect of a dietary amino acid mixture supplementation on LPS-challenged weaned piglets, a total of 30, 28-day-old, males were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 dietary treatments for a 5-week period, with 10 animals in each: diet 1 was a control (CTL) treatment; diet 2 was LPS treatment, where the piglets were intraperitoneally administered LPS (at 25 & mu;g/kg body weight); diet 3 was LPS + cocktail treatment, where the piglets were intraperitoneally administered LPS and fed a diet supplemented with a mixture of arginine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA, leucine, valine, and isoleucine), and cystine. Key organs that control sepsis were collected and processed by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for the AQPs and cytokines transcriptional profiles. Results: Minor variations were detected for AQPs and inflammatory markers mRNA levels, upon the dependence of LPS or the amino acid cocktail suggesting the piglets' immune recovery. Using a discriminant analysis tool, we report for the first time, a tissue-specific variation in AQPs and cytokines transcriptional profiles that clearly distinguish the small intestine and the kidney from the liver and the spleen.Conclusions: This study provides a novel insight into the gene expression signature of AQPs and cytokines in the functional physiology of each organ in piglets.

AB  - Many carnivores exhibit demographic and functional responses to changes in prey abundance. Demographic responses of-ten include changes in population size, litter size, and recruitment of young into the adult population. Functional feeding responses are commonly reported for many carnivore species. We investigated demographic and functional responses of kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis Merriam, 1888) to changes in prey abundance during 2010-2013 in western Utah, USA. Between 2010 and 2013, litter size averaged 3.9 (+/- 1.4) pups/litter. Survival rates of kit fox pups were 0.07, 0.01, 0.46, and 0.16, respectively, and there was a correlation between pup survival rates and rodent abundance; leporid (family Leporidae Fischer, 1817) abundance did not influence pup survival. There was a functional response as occurrence of kangaroo rat in the diet closely followed changes in kangaroo rat abundance. The occurrence of rodents in kit fox diet followed declines in rodent abundance (ex-cluding Dipodomys spp. Gray, 1841). Leporid consumption by kit foxes was not correlated to leporid density. Kit fox survival was dependent on rodent abundance and more specifically, kangaroo rats. Understanding which population parameters of kit foxes are influenced by prey is critical for the conservation of this native mesocarnivore.

AB  - To enhance the remediation effect of heavy metal pollution, organic fertilizers with different maturity levels were added to cadmium-contaminated soil. The remediation effect was determined by evaluating the form transformation and bioavailability of cadmium in heavy metal-contaminated soil. -Results showed that when the maturity was 50%, although the soil humus (HS) content increased, it didn't contribute to reducing the bioavailability of soil Cd. Appropriately increasing the maturity (GI >= 80%), the HS increased by 113.95%similar to 157.96%, and reduced significantly the bioavailability of soil Cd, among the exchangeable Cd decreased by 16.04%similar to 33.51% (P < 0.01). The structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that HS content is a critical factor influencing the transformation of Cd forms and the reduction of exchangeable Cd accumulation; the HS and residual Cd content were positively correlated with the maturity (P < 0.01), while exchangeable Cd content was negatively correlated with maturity (P < 0.01), and the correlation increased with increasing maturity. In summary, appropriately increasing the maturity (GI >= 80%) can increase significantly HS, promote the transformation of exchangeable Cd into residual Cd, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of organic fertilizers in the remediation of soil Cd pollution. These results provide a new insight into the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil through organic fertilizer as soil amendment in Cd-contaminated soil.

AB  - The extensive use of florfenicol in poultry industry results in the emergence of optrA gene, which also confers resistance to clinically important antibiotic linezolid. This study investigated the occurrence, genetic environments, and removal of optrA in enterococci in mesophilic (37 C) and thermophilic (55 C) anaerobic digestion systems, and a hyper-thermophilic (70 C) anaerobic pretreatment system for chicken waste. A total of 331 enterococci were isolated and analyzed for antibiotic resistance against linezolid and florfenicol. The optrA gene was frequently detected in enterococci from chicken waste (42.7%) and effluents from mesophilic (72%) and thermophilic (56.8%) reactors, but rarely detected in the hyper-thermophilic (5.8%) effluent. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that optrA-carrying Enterococcus faecalis sequence type (ST) 368 and ST631 were the dominant clones in chicken waste, and they remained dominant in mesophilic and thermophilic effluents, respectively. The plasmid-borne IS1216E-fexA-optrA-erm(A)-IS1216E was the core genetic element for optrA in ST368, whereas chromosomal Tn554-fexA-optrA was the key one in ST631. IS1216E might play a key role in horizontal transfer of optrA due to its presence in different clones. Hyper-thermophilic pretreatment removed enterococci with plasmid-borne IS1216E-fexA-optrA-erm(A)-IS1216E.

AB  - SRY-box transcription factor 18 (SOX18) is known to play a crucial role in the growth and development of hair follicles (HF) in both humans and mice. However, the specific effect of SOX18 on sheep hair follicles remains largely unknown. In our previous study, we observed that SOX18 was specifically expressed within dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in ovine hair follicles, leading us to investigate its potential role in the growth of hair follicles in sheep. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of SOX18 in DPCs and preliminarily study its regulatory mechanism through RNA-seq. We initially found that the overexpression of SOX18 promoted the proliferation of DPCs compared to the negative control group, while the interference of SOX18 had the opposite effect. To gain further insight into the regulatory mechanism of SOX18, we conducted RNA-seq analysis after knocking down SOX18 in Hu sheep DPCs. The result showed that the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway was involved in the growth process of DPC after SOX18 knockdown. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of SOX18 on the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway in DPCs using TOP/FOP-flash, qRT-PCR, and Western blot (WB) analysis. Our data demonstrated that SOX18 could activate the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway in DPCs. Additionally, we observed that SOX18 could rescue the proliferation of DPCs after inhibiting the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway. These findings underscore the essential role of SOX18 as a functional molecule governing the proliferation of DPCs. Additionally, these findings also greatly enhance our understanding of the role of SOX18 in the proliferation of DPCs and the growth of wool in Hu sheep.

TI  - Trunk Tip Wear in Wild African Savanna Elephants
T2  - INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The anatomy and function of tactile structures, such as vibrissae, are typically studied in captive animals, but we know little about how tactile structures compare between captive and wild animals. We analyzed trunk tip morphology in wild (n = 6) and captive (n = 6) adult African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found striking differences in both vibrissae and skin structure between the two groups. Wild elephants showed significant vibrissae abrasion, with frontal trunk tip vibrissae often entirely worn down, whereas captive elephants retained proportionally more long vibrissae, particularly along the trunk tip rim. In wild elephants, vibrissae rarely exceeded 1 cm in length, whereas many captive individuals had vibrissae several centimeters long. In contrast, vibrissae inside the nostril-a trunk region not directly exposed to feeding-were similar in length and density between wild and captive elephants. Additionally, trunk tip skin in wild elephants appeared to be worn down to a smooth surface, whereas all captive elephants showed distinct papillary skin structure and folds at the lateral trunk tip opening and nasal septum. These findings suggest that wild elephants experience feeding-related trunk abrasion, leading to significant alterations in both vibrissa structure and skin texture. Our results highlight the importance of studying sensory structures in wild animals to understand sensing in natural environments.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of Turraea fischeri leaf extract for maintaining the viability of cryopreserved goat sperm. Ejaculated semen was collected from 5 mature Baladi bucks (50-60 kg, 2-4 years of age) and those samples with mass motility >= 70% and sperm concentration >=.5 x 10(9)/mL were selected, pooled, and divided into 4 aliquots. Each aliquot was diluted in Tris-citric-soybean lecithin extender containing a different concentration of T. fischeri leaf extract (0, 125, 250, or 375 mu g/mL). Treated semen samples were cooled to 5 degrees C, transferred to 0.25-mL French straws, and stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) at -196 degrees C. After thawing, membrane integrity was examined by transmission electron microscopy, apoptotic activity by Annexin/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, and both enzyme activities and antioxidant capacity by spectroscopic assays. The leaf extract at 375 mu g/mL significantly improved semen quality as indicated by enhanced total antioxidant capacity, reduced H2O2 concentration, a greater proportion of structurally intact motile sperm, and concomitant reductions in apoptosis and necrosis. The extract also significantly increased the proportion of sperm with a contiguous plasma membrane and intact acrosome (p < 0.05). Furthermore, LC-MS revealed numerous secondary metabolites in the extract that may contribute to sperm cryopreservation.

AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the antioxidant status and the developmental competence of oocytes recovered by ovum pick-up (OPU) in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes supplemented with green tea extracts (GTE) for 90 days. Buffalo cows (n = 16) were randomly assigned to a control group receiving no supplement and a treatment group, receiving GTE starting 90 days before OPU, carried out for five consecutive sessions. Blood samples were collected before the start of supplementation with GTE (T0) and at day 45 (T1) and day 90 (T2) of supplementation, to measure ferric reducing activity (FRAP), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The antioxidant status of follicles was measured as TAC on the follicular fluid collected from the dominant follicle just prior OPU, coinciding with T2, and at the end of five repeated OPU sessions (T3). Another objective was to assess in vitro the protective effects of green tea extracts on hepatic cells exposed to methanol insult. Different concentrations of GTE (0.5 mu M and 1 mu M) were tested on cultured hepatic cells and viability, morphology and SOD activity were assessed at 24, 48 and 72 h.Supplementation with GTE increased (P < 0.05) the number of total follicles (8.7 +/- 0.5 vs 6.9 +/- 0.5), the number and the percentage of Grade A + B cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) compared with the control (3.7 +/- 0.4 vs 2.3 +/- 0.3 and 57.5 +/- 4.2 vs 40.4 +/- 4.9 %, respectively). Oocyte developmental competence was improved in the GTE group as indicated by the higher (P < 0.05) percentages of Grade 1,2 blastocysts (44.8 vs 29.1 %). In the GTE group, plasma TAC was higher both at T1 and T2, while FRAP increased only at T2, with no differences in SOD and CAT. The TAC of follicular fluid was higher (P < 0.05) in the GTE compared to the control both at T2 and at T3 The in vitro experiment showed that co-treatment with methanol and 1 mu M GTE increased (p < 0.01) cell viability at 24 h (P < 0.01), 48 h (P < 0.05) and 72 h (P < 0.01) compared with the methanol treatment co-treatment with 1 mu M GTE prevented the decrease in SOD activity observed with methanol at 24 and 48 h of culture. In conclusion, the results of in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that supplementation with GTE increases buffalo oocyte developmental competence, by improving oxidative status and liver function.

AB  - The incidence of distraction spinal cord injury (DSCI), which results from spinal cord ischemia due to vascular compromise and spinal cord tract disturbances, remains high. Furthermore, because no ideal animal model that mimics DSCI in clinical settings is available thus far, the related molecular mechanisms underlying DSCI remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to establish a porcine model of DSCI and investigate the neuroinflammation and apoptosis mechanisms in these pigs. Before surgery, all pigs were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, osteotomy surgery only; the incomplete distraction spinal cord injury (IDSCI) and complete distraction spinal cord injury (CDSCI) group, osteotomy plus DSCI surgery with a motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude decreased by approximately 75% and 100%, respectively. After surgery, modified Tarlov scoring and MRC muscle strength scoring were used to evaluate neurologic function in each group. We observed the distracted spinal cord using MRI, and then all pigs were sacrificed. Inflammatory cytokine levels in the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also analyzed. We used immunofluorescence staining to assess the neuronal and microglial structure and function and astrocyte hyperplasia in the central DSCI lesions (T15). Western blotting was used to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Results showed that the modified Tarlov scoring and muscle strength decreased significantly in the two DSCI groups. T2-MRI showed a relative enhancement at the center of the DSCI lesions. H&E and Lxol fast blue staining revealed that spinal cord distraction destroyed the normal structure of spinal cord tissues and nerve fiber tracts, exacerbating inflammatory cell infiltration, hyperemia, and edema. The IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels increased in the spinal cord and CSF following DSCI. Immunofluorescence staining results indicated the GFAP, Iba-1 expression increased following DSCI, whereas the NeuN expression reduced. Moreover, DSCI promoted the protein expression of P53, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 in the spinal cord tissues, whereas it reduced the Bcl-2 expression. This study successfully established a porcine DSCI model that closely mimics DSCI in clinical settings, and clarified the mechanisms underlying DSCI-associated neuroinflammation and apoptosis; thus, our findings highlight potential DSCI-treatment strategies for further establishing suitable drug therapies.

AB  - Livestock digestate provides nutrients and organic matter to the soil while increasing agricultural sustainability. Nevertheless, nitrogen (N) losses due to the nutrient surplus in regions characterized by intensive animal farming activities still represent an unsolved issue. For this purpose, digestate needs proper treatment and management to avoid N losses in the environment. In the livestock farming context, anaerobic digestion (AD) can be accompanied by an ammonia stripping (AS) process for N recovery. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility AS prior to and after AD of the manure, focusing on two different livestock farms, representative of dairy cattle and pig breeding in southern Italy. AS was performed at a lab scale by injecting microbubbles of air, which allowed the pH to increase, and thus the removal of ammonia. The results show that treating a dairy raw slurry with high intermediate alkalinity (IA) (6707 mg CaCO3 L-1) with AS may not be convenient in terms of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) reduction. As a matter of fact, the loss of buffering capacity during the stripping process resulted in a pH never exceeding the value of 9, which could not promote free ammonia volatilization, whereas integrating AD with AS allowed us to obtain a 34% higher TAN reduction under the same stripping conditions at a temperature (T) of 38 & DEG;C and a gas-to-liquid ratio (G/L) of 1:1. Therefore, the AS removal efficiency strongly depends on the characteristics (mainly IA) of the treated matrix. High IA values suggest a possible high concentration of volatile fatty acids, which hinders pH increases and, thus, enables ammonia stripping. Despite the initial matrix origin, a low IA compared to the total alkalinity (TA) (<20% of TA) ensures a greater ammonia removal efficiency, which could be similar between digestate and raw manure in the same operative process conditions. Nonetheless, the amount of ammonia stripped is related to the initial TAN concentration of the specific matrix.

AB  - Buttermilk, a potential material used to produce milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), is obtained as a byproduct of butter making from milk whole cream and cheese whey cream. This study investigated the effects of rennet and acid coagulation on the protein profiles of buttermilk rennet-coagulated whey (BRW) and buttermilk acid-coagulated whey (BAW). They were compared to those of whey cream buttermilk (WCB). Rennet coagulation was more efficient in removing casein, while retaining more IgG and lactoferrin than acid coagulation. BRW had more MFGM than BAW. Butyrophilin, xanthine dehydrogenase, and mucin1 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in BRW, while fatty acid-binding protein 3 was enriched in BAW. KEGG analysis showed that complement and coagulation cascades had the greatest differences, and the abundance of proteins involved in this signaling pathway in BRW and BAW was higher, suggesting their potential anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activity. BAW had higher apolipoprotein A4 and transcobalamin 2, which are essential carriers for transporting long-chain fatty acids and vitamin B12 from the intestine to the blood. Therefore, BAW intake might improve lipids and vitamin B12 absorption. This study can help deepen the understanding of protein composition of MFGM-enriched whey and facilitate the production of MFGM proteins for infants and old-aged populations.

AB  - As scientists involved in identifying and helping to implement actions to conserve declining populations of threatened species, we are concerned at the mismatch between the speed and extent of many currently observed declines and the fitness-for-purpose and scale of implementation of conservation programmes. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of the external causes of declines should be an important component of most species conservation programmes. We propose a stepwise framework to ensure that this can be done in a timely way. Central to our proposals is the recognition that seeking a perfect diagnosis can foreclose options for successful remedial action in a rapidly accelerating conservation crisis. We therefore outline approaches that may be used when detailed data are lacking or sparse. Solution. Expand the use of the diagnostic processes we describe to identify and test effective actions to halt and reverse species' population declines.

AB  - The gut microbiome of plant-eaters is affected by the food they eat, but it is currently unclear how the plant metabolome and microbiome are influenced by the substrate the plant grows in and how this subsequently impacts the feeding behavior and gut microbiomes of insect herbivores. Here, we use Plutella xylostella caterpillars and show that the larvae prefer leaves of cabbage plants growing in a vermiculite substrate to those from plants growing in conventional soil systems. From a plant metabolomics analysis, we identified 20 plant metabolites that were related to caterpillar feeding performance. In a bioassay, the effects of these plant metabolites on insects' feeding were tested. Nitrate and compounds enriched with leaves of soilless cultivation promoted the feeding of insects, while compounds enriched with leaves of plants growing in natural soil decreased feeding. Several microbial groups (e.g., Sporolactobacillus, Haliangium) detected inside the plant correlated with caterpillar feeding performance and other microbial groups, such as Ramlibacter and Methylophilus, correlated with the gut microbiome. Our results highlight the role of growth substrates on the food metabolome and microbiome and on the feeding performance and the gut microbiome of plant feeders. It illustrates how belowground factors can influence the aboveground properties of plant-animal systems, which has important implications for plant growth and pest control.

AB  - Saltmarsh plants have several defense mechanisms against threatening abiotic conditions, such as salinity, inundation, or exposure to intense radiation, less is known regarding response to insect pests attack. Salicornia europaea L. plant stands are produced as cash crops in Portuguese coastal areas. In 2017, these crops suffered significant attacks from a gall midge fly (Baldratia salicorniae Kieffer), reducing its economic value. To understand how this attack influenced S. europaea chemical composition, infested and non-infested branches were collected, and their extracts were analysed by GS-MS and UHPLC-MS. Results revealed that different degrees of infestations displayed different chemical composition. Several compounds were for the first time identified in S. europaea, such as, arachidic acid, alpha-tocopherol, henicos-1-ene, and squalene. Most evident results were the reduced amount of alkanes in the infested conditions, which seems to be a direct consequence of insect infestation. Several compounds identified in the infested branches are known to have negative effects on insect larvae by reducing larval growth (linoleic acid) or increasing insect mortality (oleic acid). Halophyte plants production is increasing and it is accompanied by the urge to develop early control strategies against potential pests. These strategies may include ecological friendly solutions such as endogenous production of specialized metabolites to retrieve plant self-defences. Further, our results showed that B. salicorniae herbivory also induced the production of higher number of specialized metabolites with important known biological activities. In years in which high infestations reduce organoleptic qualities for fresh consumption plants can be used in biorefinery industries for metabolite extraction.

AB  - Insect herbivores are relatively specialized. Why this is so is not clear. We examine assumptions about associations between local abundance and dietary specialization using an 18-year data set of caterpillar-plant interactions in Ecuador. Our data consist of caterpillar-plant associations and include standardized plot-based samples and general collections of caterpillars, allowing for diet breadth and abundance estimates across spatial scales for 1917 morphospecies. We find that more specialized caterpillars are locally more abundant than generalists, consistent with a key component of the 'jack of all trades, master of none' hypothesis. As the diet breadth of species increased, generalists were not as abundant in any one location, but they had broader occupancy across the landscape, which is a pattern that could reflect high plant beta diversity and is consistent with an alternative neutral hypothesis. Our finding that more specialized species can be both rare and common highlights the ecological complexity of specialization.

AB  - Automatic methods for detecting and delineating relief features allow remote and low-cost mapping, which has an outstanding potential for wildlife ecology and similar research. We applied a filled-DEM (digital elevation model) method using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to automatically detect dolines and other karst depressions in a rugged terrain of the Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. Using this approach, we detected 9711 karst depressions in a 137 km(2) study area and provided their basic morphometric characteristics, such as perimeter length, area, diameter, depth, and slope. We performed visual validation based on shaded relief, which indicated 83.5% accordance in detecting depressions. Although the method has some drawbacks, it proved suitable for detection, general spatial analysis, and calculation of morphometric characteristics of depressions over a large scale in remote and forested areas. To demonstrate its applicability for wildlife research, we applied it in a preliminary study in combination with GPS-telemetry data to assess the selection of these features by two wild felids, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and the European wildcat (Felis silvestris). Both species selected for vicinity of karst depressions, among which they selected for larger karst depressions. Lynx also regularly killed ungulate prey near these features, as we found more than half of lynx prey remains inside or in close vicinity of karst depressions. These results illustrate that karstic features could play an important role in the ecology of wild felids and warrant further research, which could be considerably assisted with the use of remote detection of relief features.

AB  - Background and purposeCognitive impairment is a prevalent adverse consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The neuroprotective effects of nicorandil (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-nicotinamide nitrate) has been previously documented, yet its protective effects against cognitive dysfunction post-TBI remain unclear. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate whether nicorandil attenuates cognitive dysfunction in TBI rats and the underlying mechanism behind this process.MethodsThe TBI model was established with a controlled cortical impact (CCI). The effects of nicorandil on cognitive dysfunction of rats with TBI were examined through Novel object recognition (NOR) test, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze (MWM) task. After behavioral tests, hippocampal tissue was collected for Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay.ResultsWe observed that nicorandil administration effectively ameliorates learning and memory impairment in TBI rats. Alongside, nicorandil treatment attenuated oxidative stress in the hippocampus of TBI rats, characterized by the decreased reactive oxygen species generation, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls levels, and concurrent promotion of antioxidant-related factors (including superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) activities. Additionally, nicorandil treatment attenuated the inflammatory response in the hippocampus of TBI rat, as evidenced by the upregulated levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as the downregulated level of IL-10. Mechanistically, nicorandil treatment significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus of TBI rats.ConclusionThese findings suggest that nicorandil mitigates cognitive impairment after TBI by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially through enhancing BDNF and NGF levels.
   1. Nicorandil attenuates cognitive impairment after TBI. 2. Nicorandil reduces oxidative stress and inflammatory response in the hippocampus of TBI rats. 3. Nicorandil promotes BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus of TBI rats.image

AB  - Increasing pig productivity and maintaining animal health without the use of antibiotics and other growth stimulants are key challenges in modern pig farming. In addition to the long-standing ban on the use of antibiotics in livestock farming, in 2022, the EU also introduced a ban on the use of zinc oxide in piglet feeding due to the environmental contamination risks. In order to overcome the food deficit and improve the overall productivity of the industry, selective breeding is being carried out in pig farming to enhance the litter size of sows. However, this often leads to the birth of a large number of small piglets that require special care to ensure adequate nutrition to support their growth and development. One such approach is the use of functional amino acids in animal feeding, as recent studies have shown the impact of amino acids on metabolism and the body as a whole, their utilization, exchange, and application to improve productivity, health, and animal well-being. The correct selection and use of functional amino acids in pig feeding can contribute not only to increased productivity but also to improved product quality and reproductive performance. The aim of this review was to summarize data from the last 10-15 years regarding the use of functional amino acids in the feeding of pigs from various groups. An analysis of the literature showed that the use of functional amino acids in pig feeding can enhance their productivity and serve as an alternative to banned substances, especially during critical periods of life, as well as for stimulating growth and productivity in animals.

AB  - Tamarix (Tamaricaceae), a phreatophyte genus from the Old World, is a tenacious competitor which has invaded North America (namely the United States and Mexico), Australia, and South Africa amongst other countries. Biological control of invasive Tamarix taxa in South Africa is complicated by the indigenous T. usneoides, which is phylogenetically distant from the invasive T. chinensis and T. ramosissima. This suggests the possibility of finding a host specific biological control agent. Trabutina mannipara underwent laboratory-based host specificity trials. During no-choice testing, T. mannipara showed no difference in host range selection as there was no significant difference in the settling and developmental rate on all Tamarix taxa tested. These undesirable non-target effects on the indigenous species led us to reject T. mannipara as a potential biological control agent of invasive Tamarix taxa. We examined the possibility of secondary metabolites being a factor in the feeding choice of T. mannipara, but no significant difference in the bark tannin levels was found between the above Tamarix taxa. Further investigation of plant secondary metabolites, used for defense against insect herbivory, may however, assist in the selection of biological control agents against invasive Tamarix in South Africa.

AB  - A recent expedition in the Potwar Plateau of Pakistan has yielded dental material of three rhinocerotid species Chilotherium intermedium, Alicornops complanatum, and Brachypotherium perimense. The material came from the Nagri and Dhok Pathan formations of the Middle Siwalik Subgroup in Punjab, Pakistan. These specimens are good addition to provide additional morphological characters that show information about the variations in dental characters of theese already recorded species and contribute to recent work on Rhinocerotidae from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup of Pakistan. The studied remains of these three rhinocerotids species whose remains are relatively low in the Middle Siwaliks are good paleontological contribution with some more detailed work suggested here to understand about these genera. Presence of these Siwalik rhinocerotids indicates diverse habitats from forest to savanna environments.

AB  - Pestalotiod fungi are associated with a wide variety of plants worldwide and occur as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes. The present study provides an updated phylogeny for genera Neopestalotiopsis, Pestalotiopsis, and Seiridium using fresh collections from woody oil plants (Camellia oleifera, Olea europaea, Paeonia suffruticosa, Sapium sebiferum, and Vernicia fordii) in Sichuan Province, China. We coupled morphology and combined sequence data analyses of ITS, tub2, and tef1-alpha for Neopestalotiopsis and Pestalotiopsis, with ITS, LSU, tub2, tef1-alpha, and rpb2 for Seiridium. Three novel species of Neopestalotiopsis (N. mianyangensis, N. paeonia-suffruticosa, N. terricola) and three of Seiridium (S. guangyuanum, S. vernicola, S. oleae), were found. Three other species, Pestalotiopsis kenyana, Seiridium ceratosporum, and S. rosarum were identified and reported as new records. All isolated species are fully described and illustrated. Additionally, the sexual morph of Pestalotiopsis kenyana is described for the first time. Pathogenicity tests revealed that Neopestalotiopsis mianyangensis, N. paeonia-suffruticosa, N. terricola, Pestalotiopsis kenyana, Seiridium guangyuanum, S. vernicola, and S. oleae are pathogenic on detached olive leaves.

AB  - Tioconazole is one of the drugs used to treat topical mycotic infections. It exhibited severe toxicity during systemic administration; however, the molecular mechanism behind the cytotoxic effect was not well established. We employed HeLa cells as a model to investigate the molecular mechanism of its toxicity and discovered that tioconazole inhibited HeLa cell growth through mitotic block (37%). At the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (approximate to 15 mu M) tioconazole apparently depolymerized microtubules and caused defects in chromosomal congression at the metaphase plate. Tioconazole induced apoptosis and significantly hindered the migration of HeLa cells. Tioconazole bound to goat brain tubulin (K-d, 28.3 +/- 0.5 mu M) and inhibited the assembly of microtubules in the in vitro assays. We report for the first time that tioconazole binds near to the colchicine site, based on the evidence from in vitro tubulin competition experiment and computational analysis. The conformation of tubulin dimer was found to be "curved" upon binding with tioconazole in the MD simulation. Tioconazole in combination with vinblastine synergistically inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and augmented the percentage of mitotic block by synergistically inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. Our study indicates that the systemic adverse effects of tioconazole are partly due to its effects on microtubules and cell cycle arrest. Since tioconazole is well tolerated at the topical level, it could be developed as a topical anticancer agent in combination with other systemic anticancer drugs.

AB  - Triclosan (TCS), a newly identified environmental endocrine disruptor (EED) in household products, has been reported to have toxic effects on animals and humans. The effects of TCS exposure on individual social behaviors and the potential underlying mechanisms are still unknown. This study investigated the behavioral effects of 42day exposure to TCS (0, 50, 100 mg/kg) in drinking water using the open field test (OFT), social dominance test (SDT), social interaction test (SIT), and novel object recognition task (NOR). Using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed the effects of TCS exposure on the gut microbiota and ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons and synapses. Behavioral results showed that chronic TCS exposure reduced the social dominance of male and female mice. TCS exposure also reduced social interaction in male mice and impaired memory formation in female mice. Analysis of the gut microbiota showed that TCS exposure increased the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla in female mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that TCS exposure induced ultrastructural damage to hippocampal neurons and synapses. These findings suggest that TCS exposure may affect social behaviors, which may be caused by altered gut microbiota and impaired plasticity of hippocampal neurons and synapses.

AB  - This study comprehensively investigates the physiological and molecular regulatory mechanisms of Camellia oleifera seedlings under drought stress with a soil moisture content of about 30%, where exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) was applied via foliar spraying at concentrations of 50 mu g/L, 100 mu g/L, and 200 mu g/L. The results demonstrated that appropriate concentrations of ABA treatment can regulate the physiological state of the seedlings through multiple pathways, including photosynthesis, oxidative stress response, and osmotic balance, thereby aiding in the restructuring of their drought response strategy. ABA treatment effectively activated the antioxidant system by reducing stomatal conductance and moderately inhibiting the photosynthetic rate, thus alleviating oxidative damage caused by drought stress. Additionally, ABA treatment promoted the synthesis of osmotic regulators such as proline, maintaining cellular turgor stability and enhancing the plant's drought adaptability. The real-time quantitative PCR results of related genes indicated that ABA treatment enhanced the plant's response to the ABA signaling pathway and improved disease resistance by regulating the expression of related genes, while also enhancing membrane lipid stability. A comprehensive evaluation using a membership function approach suggested that 50 mu g/L ABA treatment may be the most-effective in mitigating drought effects in practical applications, followed by 100 mu g/L ABA. The application of 50 mu g/L ABA for 7 h induced significant changes in various biochemical parameters, compared to a foliar water spray. Notably, superoxide dismutase activity increased by 17.94%, peroxidase activity by 30.27%, glutathione content by 12.41%, and proline levels by 25.76%. The content of soluble sugars and soluble proteins rose by 14.79% and 87.95%, respectively. Additionally, there was a significant decrease of 31.15% in the malondialdehyde levels.

AB  - Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily that inhibits skeletal muscle growth and development. The esophagus is composed of skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but the effect of MSTN on esophagus striated muscle (ESM) is unknown. The present study investigated the role of MSTN in ESM using MSTN mutant pigs through histological, gene and protein expression analysis in ESM of MSTN knockout (MSTN-/-) pigs and their wild type (WT) littermates. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the fiber cross-sectional areas in ESM of MSTN-/- pigs were significantly larger than WT pigs (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the percentage of type I muscle fibers in MSTN-/- pigs were significantly lower than WT pigs (P < 0.01) and type IIA muscle fibers in MSTN-/- pigs were significantly higher than WT pigs (21% higher, P < 0.01). However, type IIB muscle fibers were not detected in the ESM of MSTN-/- or WT pigs indicating that muscle fiber types in pig ESM was composed of type I and IIA. The mRNA levels of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) including myogenic differentiation (MyoD), myogenin (MyoG), myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) and myogenic regulatory factor 4 (MRF4) in ESM of MSTN-/- pigs showed a significant increase (P < 0.05 at least) when compared to WT pigs while mRNA level of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) displayed a decrease (P < 0.001). Protein expression of myosin heavy chain I (MHC-I) in MSTN-/- ESM was decreased and myosin heavy chain IIA (MHC-IIA) was increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that MSTN plays an important role in esophageal striated muscle development and regulates muscle fiber types.

AB  - Simple Summary The Iberian pig is known for the high quality of its products, mostly due to the unique lipid profile of its meat. There are several studies comparing commercial breeds or crosses with the Iberian pig, but there are only a few that compare different strains within the Iberian breed. The aim of this study was to compare carcass traits, fat deposition and gene expression in muscle, of genes involved in lipogenic metabolism in three different strains of Iberian pig finished in two feeding systems. Torbiscal was the strain with the largest lean body development and, therefore, had the highest prime cuts (ham, foreleg, and L. thoracis) traits; Retinto strain showed the highest intramuscular fat and MUFA content; while Lampino was the strain with the highest SFA, PUFA and lipogenic ratios. On the other hand, animals following a concentrate-based diet had greater ham (posterior limb, mainly composed of semintendinosus, gluteus and biceps femoris muscles), Longissimus thoracis, prime cuts yields and SFA percentage, than animals following an acorn-based diet. In relation to the gene expression, Retinto and animals following a concentrate-based diet showed the highest expression of several genes related to lipid metabolism. These results evidence the differences between the Iberian strains and the effects of the production system in terms of morphology and lipid metabolism.The Iberian pig breed includes several well-differentiated strains. The present study evaluated carcass traits, fat deposition and muscle expression of important lipogenic genes (SCD, ME1, ACACA, FASN, EGR1, ACOX and ACLY) using 65 male pigs of 3 Iberian strains (20 Lampino, 23 Torbiscal, and 22 Retinto) finished either in a conventional, concentrate-based system (CF) or in montanera (MF), a traditional free-range system with acorn feeding. Torbiscal had the highest ham, Longissimus thoracis and prime cuts yields, and the thinnest subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Retinto had the highest monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and percentage of intramuscular fat (IMF), while Lampino had the greatest content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), atherogenic (AI) and thrombogenic (TI) indexes in SAT. Conventionally finished pigs had the highest ham, L. thoracis and prime cuts yields, and SFA. Montanera-finished animals had the highest PUFA and MUFA contents, and the lowest AI, TI and n6/n3 ratio in SAT. In relation to gene expression, Retinto had the greatest SCD, FASN and ACLY levels. Most studied genes were overexpressed in CF pigs. In conclusion, MF pigs had healthier fat than CF pigs, and Retinto had the healthiest fat and the greatest lipogenic trend in muscle, supported by IMF and lipogenic gene expression.

AB  - The high concentrate/low forage (HC/LF) diets cause a dramatic decline in milk fat secretion. Hepatic lipid metabolism is active when ruminant is on lactation period. The aim of this study was to evaluate liver metabolism adaptation to high-concentrate diet-induced milk fat depression (MFD). Six Saanen dairy goats were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed either a high-forage (HF) diet or a high-concentrate (HC) diet. The high-concentrate diet caused lower milk fat content and milk fat yield, namely induced MFD. While, the net hepatic TG production (portal vein -hepatic vein) significant increase in the HC group (P<0.01) and it was positive value. The net hepatic glucose, cholesterol and BHBA productions (portal vein -hepatic vein) were all negative values in the HC group. Expression of hepatic PC and PEPCK mRNA were up-regulated in HC group but had no significant effect (P>0.05). The mRNA expression of hepatic HMGCS2 significantly increased (P< 0.01) in HC group. The high concentrate feeding induced MFD, while fatty acids uptake into liver were stored as TG or incompletely oxidized to ketone body, the excessive consumption of fatty acids reduced the precursors of milk fat synthesis and finally decreased the milk fat content.

AB  - The presence of beta-mannans in feed can produce a futile and chronic immune stimulation in fattening pigs. In this trial, a 1-4-endo-D-beta-mannanase was added to the feed (HC) during growth and fattening (0.03% of Hemicell HT) and physical performance and pathological data were recorded, and intestinal integrity and immune activation were studied by molecular biomarkers, compared to a control group (CON). The treatment diet was reduced in energy content by 40 Kcal/kg NE. From each group, 113 and 112 animals housed in 8 pens were individually identified and weighed three times: at 7th, 63rd and 116th days in feed. The FCR was calculated for groups of two pens and ADG individually. There was no difference in ADG (CON = 0.836, HC = 0.818) nor in FCR between groups (p = 0.486). During growth, there was a higher frequency of normal feces in HC and there were also no differences in the frequency of gastric lesions. A significant increase in Claudin, Occludin, IFN-gamma and IL8 was observed in the CON in feces and a significant decrease in IL-6 in HC. In tissues, there were differences for IL-12p40, TNF-alpha in jejunum (increased CON) and TGF-beta in ileum and jejunum, (decreased HC). The economic performance was EUR 4.7 better in the treated group. In conclusion, the addition of 1-4-endo-D-beta--mannanase to the feed with a 1.6% reduction in net energy compared to the control, allowed the animals to perform as well as the animals on the higher energy diet, with lower prevalence of diarrhea.

AB  - The purpose of this research work is to establish the functionality of the novel ultrasonic non-destructive inspection system and accurate gauging of pipes and to locate and visualize flaws in the form of B-scan cross-sectional view (front-view) of the pipe under test. This paper presents a custom-made perspex inspection head assembly integrated with a stand-alone, Li-ion battery-powered and IP67-grade water-immersible ultrasonic instrumentation and gauging system, which enables an efficient assessment of the condition and health of pipes in stringent environments. Extensive inspection was carried out on six samples of 12 in. inner diameter (ID) type carbon steel (CS) pipes with length of 500 mm and having machined wall thickness to simulate loss of wall thicknesses from 10% over a length 150 mm of pipe, using 5 MHz spherically focused transducers. Further inspection were carried out on a 12 in. CS pipe with four notches and four flat bottom holes (FBHs) machined on the outer diameter (OD) side. Identical flaws were also machined onto 12 in. CS pipe of total length 700 mm containing water inside the pipe in flowing condition with water flowrate of 100 liters per minute (LPM). The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed IP67-grade water-immersible ultrasonic pipe inspection and gauging instrumentation system for assessing the condition and health of long-length carbon steel pipes operating in harsh environments.

AB  - Endometrial receptivity is vital for the successful implantation of embryos in sheep. Insufficient receptivity is a major cause of implantation failure, highlighting the need to understand the underlying mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in the epigenetic regulation of endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation by influencing post-transcriptional processes. However, the specific mechanisms by which various miRNAs contribute to endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation in sheep remain to be fully elucidated. Our research highlights the significant role of oar-miR-29a, which promotes the migration and proliferation of sheep endometrial epithelial cells (sEECs). We found that oar-miR-29a enhances mRNA expression associated with proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in sEECs. Additionally, this miRNA enhances the proliferation and migration capabilities of sheep trophoblast cells (sTCs). Moreover, our findings suggest that the target genes of oar-miR-29a are involved in key biological processes and pathways essential for embryo implantation. Notably, our analysis identifies cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) as a target gene of oar-miR29a. In summary, oar-miR-29a plays a crucial role in promoting endometrial receptivity by targeting CDC42 in sheep. These findings provide insights into the miRNA-based regulatory mechanisms governing uterine physiology during the early stages of pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of this research for improving reproductive outcomes in sheep.

AB  - Cotton has been used as a model plant to study direct and indirect plant defence against herbivorous insects. However, the plant growing conditions could have an important effect on the outcome of such plant defence studies. We examined how common experimental growth conditions influence constitutive and inducible defences in two species of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum and G. herbaceum. We induced plants by applying caterpillar regurgitant to mechanical wounds to compare the induction levels between plants of both species grown in greenhouse or phytotron conditions. For this we measured defence metabolites (gossypol and heliocides) and performance of Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars on different leaves, the emission of plant volatiles, and their attractiveness to parasitic wasps. Induction increased the levels of defence metabolites, which in turn decreased the performance of S. frugiperda larvae. Constitutive and induced defence levels were the highest in plants grown in the phytotron (compared to greenhouse plants), G. hirsutum and young leaves. Defence induction was more pronounced in plants grown in the phytotron and in young leaves. Also, the differences between growing conditions were more evident for metabolites in the youngest leaves, indicating an interaction with plant ontogeny. The composition of emitted volatiles was different between plants from the two growth conditions, with greenhouse-grown plants showing more variation than phytotron-grown plants. Also, G. hirsutum released higher amounts of volatiles and attracted more parasitic wasps than G. herbaceum. Overall, these results highlight the importance of experimental abiotic factors in plant defence induction and ontogeny of defences. We therefore suggest careful consideration in selecting the appropriate experimental growing conditions for studies on plant defences.

AB  - Adults of many mosquito species feed on plants to obtain metabolic energy and to enhance reproduction. Mosquitoes primarily rely on olfaction to locate plants and are known to respond to a range of plant volatiles. We studied the olfactory response of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and cis-jasmone (CiJA), volatile compounds originating from the octadecanoid signaling pathway that plays a key role in plant defense against herbivores. Specifically, we investigated how Ae. aegypti of different ages responded to elevated levels of CiJA in two attractive odor contexts, either derived from Lima bean plants or human skin. Aedes aegypti females landed significantly less often on a surface with CiJA and MeJA compared to the solvent control, CiJA exerting a stronger reduction in landing than MeJA. Odor context (plant or human) had no significant main effect on the olfactory responses of Ae. aegypti females to CiJA. Mosquito age significantly affected the olfactory response, older females (7-9 d) responding more strongly to elevated levels of CiJA than young females (1-3 d) in either odor context. Our results show that avoidance of CiJA by Ae. aegypti is independent of odor background, suggesting that jasmonates are inherently aversive cues to these mosquitoes. We propose that avoidance of plants with elevated levels of jasmonates is adaptive to mosquitoes to reduce the risk of encountering predators that is higher on these plants, i.e. by avoiding 'enemy-dense-space'.

AB  - Ablation of IFNG in the pig conceptus causes conceptus degeneration and endometrial inflammation.
   Establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in the pig is a complex process that relies on conceptus regulation of the maternal proinflammatory response to endometrial attachment. Following elongation, pig conceptuses secrete interferon gamma (IFNG) during attachment to the endometrial luminal epithelium. The objective here was to determine if conceptus production of IFNG is important for early development and establishment of pregnancy. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and somatic cell nuclear transfer technologies were used to create an IFNG loss-of-function study in pigs. Wild-type (IFNG(+/+)) and null (IFNG(-/-)) fibroblast cells were used to create embryos through somatic cell nuclear transfer. IFNG expression was not detected in IFNG(-/-) conceptuses on either day 15 or day 17 of pregnancy. Ablation of conceptus IFNG production resulted in the reduction of stromal CD3(+) and mast cells, which localized to the site of conceptus attachment on day 15. The uteri of recipients with IFNG(-/-) conceptuses were inflamed, hyperemic and there was an abundance of erythrocytes in the uterine lumen associated with the degenerating conceptuses. The endometrial stromal extracellular matrix was altered in the IFNG(-/-) embryo pregnancies and there was an increased endometrial mRNA levels for collagen XVII (COL17A1), matrilin 1 (MATN1), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3), which are involved with repair and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. These results indicate conceptus IFNG production is essential in modulating the endometrial proinflammatory response for conceptus attachment and survival in pigs.

AB  - Palaeolithic sites are complex palimpsests due to the recurrent presence of human groups and carnivores through time, as documented in several European caves and rock shelters. Within these contexts, it can be challenging to identify the main contributors to bone accumulations and interpret human subsistence strategies and the role of carnivores. Consequently, taphonomic analyses are crucial for distinguishing the origins of these occupation episodes. One example of alternating occupations is found at El Castillo cave (Cantabria, Spain), specifically in the so-called Transitional Aurignacian level (-46-42 ka uncal BP). According to a recent study conducted at this level (Luret et al., 2020), the human groups had a hunting specialisation focused on red deer, while carnivores had little influence on the assemblage. However, these interpretations were based only on the faunal assemblage from the recent excavations (1980-2011). A previous excavation phase was conducted on this site from 1910 to 1914, and after that, the faunal remains recovered were separated across several institutions, lacking a complete archaeozoological and taphonomic analysis of the whole level. In this work, a new taxonomic assessment and, for the first time, a taphonomic study of the macrofauna recovered in the Aurignacian Delta level during the initial excavations, stored at Museo Nacional y Centro de Investigaci ' on de Altamira (Cantabria, Spain), is carried out. This work provides new information about the human and carnivore groups that occupied El Castillo, constructing new hypotheses to interpret this relevant archaeological level.

AB  - The carpal bones, which show a notorious specialisation towards flight are poorly studied. These bones have only been the subject of study in 0.2% of all extant bat species. The use of bones from the carpal region has not been extensively investigated in palaeontology, mainly due to the scarcity of osteological studies and the fact that they are rarely collected during excavations. Therefore, we document the identification of a Pleistocene bat using the: scaphocentralunates. The material was collected from sediments associated with the extinct sloth Meizonyx salvadorensis, found in the caves of Sistema Huautla, Oaxaca, Mexico. A combination of qualitative and quantitative morphological characteristics made it possible to identify the scaphocentralunar bones at the generic level, which were subsequently determined to belong to the bat species Sturnira sp. This finding demonstrates that the carpal bones in bats exhibit distinctive diagnostic characteristics for the identification of fossil material. The discovery represents the second record for the genus for the Pleistocene of Mexico and the seventh in the Americas continent. In addition, the significance of collecting sediments associated with megafauna to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of past diversity is underscored.

AB  - Accurate timing of seasonal changes is an essential ability for an animal's survival, and the change in the photoperiod is the key factor affecting reproductive seasonality in mammals. Emerging evidence has suggested that multiple hypothalamic genes participate in the photoperiod-induced regulation of reproductive activities in sheep, but the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we initially examined the plasma level of two major reproductive hormones, namely, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin (PRL), under different photoperiods in ovariectomized and estradiol-treated (OVX + E-2) sheep using radioimmunoassay (RIA). Of the two hormones, the concentration of PRL significantly increased with the extension of the photoperiod, while FSH showed the opposite trend. Subsequently, an examination of the transcriptomic variation between the short photoperiod (SP) and long photoperiod (LP) was conducted. Differential expression analyses and functional annotation showed that several key genes in the insulin secretion (VAMP2, PRKACB, PRKCG, and PLCB1), GnRH (MAPK13, CGA, CDC42, ATF4, and LHB) pathways, and circadian entrainment (KCNJ5, PER1, GNB2, MTNR1A, and RASD1), as well as numerous lncRNAs, including XR_173257.3, XR_173415.3, XR_001435315.1, XR_001024596.2, and XR_001023464.2, were shown potentially vital for the hypothalamic photoperiodic response. Four of the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated by qPCR. The constructed mRNA-mRNA interaction networks further revealed that transcripts potentially participated in hypothalamic thyroid hormone synthesis, endocrine resistance, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. The interactome analysis of lncRNAs and their targets implied that XR_173257.3 and its target arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) and XR_173415.3 and its target TH might participate in the regulation of seasonal reproduction. Together, the changes in reproductive hormones and transcriptome will help to determine the important photoperiod-induced lncRNAs and mRNAs and provide a valuable resource for further research on reproductive seasonality in sheep.

AB  - Melanoma is among the most common malignancies and has recently exhibited increased resistance to treatments, resulting in a more aggressive disease course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete cytokines both in vivo and in vitro, which regulate tumor cell signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor progression. This study investigates the anti-melanogenesis effects of sheep umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (SUCMSCs) to assess their potential application in melanoma treatment. Our findings indicate that, in vitro, SUCMSCs reduce melanin content and tyrosinase activity, inhibit melanoma cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promote melanoma cell apoptosis. Subsequent in vivo experiments confirmed that SUCMSCs effectively suppress tumor growth, and histological analysis via HE staining revealed notable differences. Additionally, transcriptome sequencing analysis indicated that the anti-tumor effects were primarily mediated through autophagy, apoptosis, and the TGF-beta and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. The RT-qPCR validation results aligned with the transcriptome data. In summary, SUCMSCs exert anti-melanogenesis effects through the interaction of multiple signaling pathways and cytokines, demonstrating significant potential for melanoma treatment.

AB  - Silicon (Si) accumulation in plants strengthens tissues and reduces insect herbivore performance. Supplementing plants with Si can enhance the attraction of predators and parasitoids by altering the emissions of herbivore-induced plant volatiles. Herbivores feeding on Si-supplemented plants can exhibit delayed development and compromised anti-predator defenses, such as weakened immune responses. Thus, Si supplementation could potentially enhance the biological control of pest herbivores by attracting more natural enemies and increasing herbivore exposure and susceptibility to predation and parasitism. We critically examine the current understanding of the effects of plant Si defenses on interactions between herbivores and their natural enemies, highlighting key uncertainties that must be addressed to leverage the benefits of Si for the biological control of herbivorous insects.

AB  - Restriction of pollen germination before the pollen grain is pollinated to stigma is essential for successful fertilization in angiosperms. However, the mechanisms underlying the process remain poorly understood. Here, we report functional characterization of the MAPKKK kinases, MAP3K epsilon 1 and MAP3K epsilon 2, involve in control of pollen germination in Arabidopsis. The two genes were expressed in different tissues with higher expression levels in the tricellular pollen grains. The map3k epsilon 1 map3k epsilon 2 double mutation caused abnormal callose accumulation, increasing level of JA and precocious pollen germination, resulting in significantly reduced seed set. Furthermore, the map3k epsilon 1 map3k epsilon 2 double mutations obviously upregulated the expression levels of genes in JA biosynthesis and signaling. The MAP3K epsilon 1/2 interacted with MOB1A/1B which shared homology with the core components of Hippo singling pathway in yeast. The Arabidopsis mob1a mob1b mutant also exhibited a similar phenotype of precocious pollen germination to that in map3k epsilon 1 map3k epsilon 2 mutants. Taken together, these results suggested that the MAP3K epsilon s interacted with MOB1s and played important role in restriction of the precocious pollen germination, possibly through crosstalk with JA signaling and influencing callose accumulation in Arabidopsis.

AB  - This article explores the genetic variability of the gene that encodes telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which plays a key role in maintaining telomere length and, as a result, genome stability in various eukaryotic species. The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines phylogenetic and bioinformatic analysis with molecular -genetic research methods. The research involved the screening of genetic databases to investigate TERT gene orthologues across organisms belonging to different systematic groups. The TERT gene, which is prevalent in a wide range of eukaryotic biological species, exhibits polymorphisms that have the potential to influence TERT enzyme function and, consequently, animal phenotypes. The primary focus of this study centers on the pig TERTgene, selected as a model organism due to its genetic similarity to humans and its importance as a productive agricultural species. The article explores the exon-intron structure of the TERTgene, analyzing the size of the corresponding transcript and protein product. Furthermore, it provides data on polymorphisms in the pig TERT gene, including missense and synonymous variants. The chromosomal localization of these polymorphisms is characterized and correlated with the domain structure of the TERT enzyme. For the evaluation of the impact of polymorphisms on the structural and functional properties of the TERT enzyme, a molecular -genetic system based on the PCR-RFLP method has been developed. This PCR-RFLP system serves as a basis for subsequent experimental analyses of missense and synonymous variants in population and association studies, allowing for an assessment of the prevalence of these polymorphisms and their significance for animal phenotypes. Given the significance of further laboratory investigation of the pig TERT gene, the developed PCR-RFLP system becomes necessary for the assessment of the functional implications of the polymorphisms within this gene and the potential identification of causative ones among them. The synergy of bioinformatics and molecular -genetic methods in this study lays the groundwork for future impactful research in this field. The presented study holds promise for marker -associated selection, as it opens the way for the use of the TERTgene as a marker in the genetic improvement of agricultural animal species.

AB  - Background Numerous studies have shown the effects of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REM-SD) on behavior and brain structures. The impact of REM-SD on learning and memory, thus neurogenesis, has been reported in previous studies. Royal jelly (RJ) is known as the wealthiest biological nutrient with various physiological properties. This study aimed to study the possible effect of RJ on neurogenesis of the rat hippocampus neonates following exposure of mother to REM-SD during pregnancy. Methods Thirty neonate rats from 15 pregnant Wistar rats were used. To induce REM-SD, the flowerpot method was used. The pregnant rats were divided into five groups (n = 3): group 1, no treatment; group 2, REM-SD; groups 3, 4, and 5, REM-SD +RJ. The former group received 72 h REM-SD during pregnancy (days 7, 14, 21), and the latter group received REM-SD + RJ (three trial groups). At week 4, the rat neonates of all groups were sacrificed (n = 6 each group). Their brains were fixed, removed, and prepared for Nissl and Hoechst 33342 staining. By using real time polymerase chain reaction methode the brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF gene expression was studied (RT-PCR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression was studied. The results were analyzed statistically, and the Pv The results showed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampus of neonatal rats of REM-SD mothers compared to the neonates of the mother with REM-SD + RJ. REM-SD also led to an increase in apoptosis reaching the neonates from the REM-SD + RJ animals. High expression of BDNF was observed in the hippocampus of the neonates from REM-SD + RJ treated mothers. Conclusion RJ acts as a neuroprotective agent that could compensate for the effects of REM-SD on learning and memory via restoring neurogenesis.

AB  - Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are the largest extant terrestrial megaherbivores native to Asia, with 60% of their wild population found in India. Despite ecological and cultural importance, their population genetic structure and diversity, demographic history, and ensuing implications for management/conservation remain understudied. We analyzed 34 whole genomes (between 11x and 32x) from most known elephant landscapes in India and identified five management/conservation units corresponding to elephants in Northern (Northwestern/Northeastern), Central, and three in Southern India. Our data reveal signatures of divergence and serial colonization and a potential dilution of genetic diversity from north to south of India. The northern populations diverged from others more than 70,000 years ago, have higher genetic diversity, and have low inbreeding (pi = 0.0016 +/- 0.0001; F-ROH > 1 MB = 0.09 +/- 0.03). Two of three populations in Southern India have low diversity and are inbred, with very low effective population sizes compared with census sizes (pi = 0.0014 +/- 0.00009 and 0.0015 +/- 0.0001; F-ROH > 1 MB = 0.25 +/- 0.09 and 0.17 +/- 0.02). Analyses of genetic load reveal the purging of potentially high-effect insertion/deletion (indel) deleterious alleles in the southern populations and a decreasing number of deleterious alleles from north to south in India. However, despite dilution and purging for the damaging mutation load in Southern India, the load that remains is homozygous. High homozygosity of deleterious alleles, coupled with low neutral genetic diversity, make southernmost populations high priority for conservation attention. Most surprisingly, our study suggests that patterns of genetic diversity and genetic load can correspond to genomic signatures of serial founding events, even in large, highly mobile, endangered mammals.

AB  - Experiments during 4 years examined the diets selected, growth, and responses to N supplements by Bos indicus-cross steers grazing summer-rainfall semi-arid C4 Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) rangelands at a site in north-western Queensland, Australia. Paddock groups of steers were not supplemented (T-NIL), or were fed a non-protein N (T-NPN) or a cottonseed meal (T-CSM) supplement. In Experiment 1, young and older steers were measured during the late dry season (LDS) and the rainy season (RS), while steers in Experiments 2-4 were measured through the annual cycle. Because of severe drought the measurements during Experiment 3 annual cycle were limited to T-NIL steers. Pasture availability and species composition were measured twice annually. Diet was measured at 1-2 week intervals using near infrared spectroscopy of faeces (F.NIRS). Annual rainfalls (1 July-30 June) were 42-68% of the long-term average (471 mm), and the seasonal break ranged from 17 December to 3 March. There was wide variation in pasture, diet (crude protein (CP), DM digestibility (DMD), the CP to metabolisable energy (CP/ME) ratio) and steer liveweight change (LWC) within and between annual cycles. High diet quality and steer liveweight (LW) gain during the RS declined progressively through the transition season (TS) and early dry season (EDS), and often the first part of the LDS. Steers commenced losing LW as the LDS progressed. In Experiments 1 and 2 where forbs comprised <= 15 g/kg of the pasture sward, steers selected strongly for forbs so that they comprised 117-236 g/kg of the diet. However, in Experiments 3 and 4 where forbs comprised substantial proportions of the pasture (173-397 g/kg), there were comparable proportions in the diet (300-396 g/kg). With appropriate stocking rates the annual steer LW gains were acceptable (121-220 kg) despite the low rainfall. The N supplements had no effect on steer LW during the TS and the EDS, but usually reduced steer LW loss by 20-30 kg during the LDS. Thus during low rainfall years in Mitchell grass pastures there were substantial LW responses by steers to N supplements towards the end of the dry season when the diet contained c. c. <7.0 g CP/MJ ME.

AB  - This research aims to evaluate the using the leaves of Psidium guajava L. (PG), Syzygium samarangense (SS), and Camellia sinensis L. (CS) in terms of combination and removing tannin content for in vitro skin whitening activity. The results showed that PG leaves had the best enzyme tyrosinase inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 205.41 mu g/mL, followed by SS and CS leaves with IC50 values of 223.53 and 518.23 mu g/mL, compared to kojic acid with IC50 value of 20.33 mu g/mL. The combination of PG, SS, and CS leaves in a pair indicated that the proportion 1:1 of PG and SS leaves gave the optimal anti-tyrosinase activity (IC50 value of 172.07 mu g/mL). The PGSS extract was reduced the tannin content by using collagen fiber due to side effects with high ingre-dients of tannins. Increasing the collagen content to 1 g can remove more than 90% tannin content, yet the anti-tyrossinase activity of the PGSS can decrease by 60%. The absorption time longer than 24 h could signifi-cantly affect the flavonoid content. The results determined that the appropriate condition for removing 70% tannin content in 1 g extract is 0.5 g collagen for 24 h with anti-tyrosinase activity with IC50 value of 252.01 mu g/mL. Also, the chemical structure changes of these extracts after each treatment step were deter-mined by FTIR analysis. The optimal extract can be considered a potential candidate in cosmeceutical prod-ucts.(c) 2023 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep sperm is extremely sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and can produce a large amount of ROS during chilling storage, leading to a decline in semen quality. Adding antioxidants is an important method to improve semen quality. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a kind of plant extract with an antioxidant capacity, which can effectively eliminate free radicals and improve the antioxidant capacity of semen. However, its role in the chilling storage of Hu ram semen is not clear. Therefore, CGA with different concentrations was added to chilling storage extender to investigate its effect on chilled ram sperm. The results of this study revealed that CGA with proper concentration had a positive effect on chilled Hu ram sperm and 0.8 mg/mL CGA had the best effect. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the addition of chlorogenic acid (CGA) to a sheep semen extender could improve the quality of chilled sheep sperm. Ejaculates (n = 80) were collected from five Hu rams with an artificial vagina. The ejaculates were mixed and divided into five equal parts, diluted with a CGA-free Tris-egg yolk extender (control), or supplemented with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/mL. The sperm kinematic parameters (viability, progressive motility), functional integrity of plasma membrane and acrosome, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and antioxidant parameters (Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), ROS level and Malondialdehyde (MDA) content) were evaluated during storage of the semen. The results indicated that: PM, plasmatic membrane integrity and acrosomal integrity in 0.8 mg/mL CGA were higher (p < 0.05) from day 1 to 5. The ROS level in CGA groups was lower than the control (p < 0.05). CAT, SOD, ATP, and T-AOC were highest at 0.8 mg/mL concentration within 1 to 5 days. The above results indicated that the right concentration of CGA improved the quality of Hu ram sperm during chilling storage.

AB  - Simple Summary: Every year, the consumption of beef cattle increases, as does slaughter waste, including rumen content, blood, and other waste such as ears and cheeks. These can be converted into meals through heat treatment, so it is important to know their nutritional value. In this study, tests were carried out that allowed us to determine the chemical composition, the contribution of available nutrients, and the energy content of this slaughter waste to prepare rations for guinea pigs. After the study, it was verified that flours made from ruminal content, blood, ears, and cheeks are good sources of protein and energy for guinea pigs and are consumed without problems when included as one-fifth of a barley-based diet. This circular economy approach allows this type of waste to be recovered and valued, with the advantage of reducing its polluting power due to inadequate disposal or its disposal into rivers. Biowaste from slaughterhouses can be recovered to benefit food security and reduce contamination potential. More than 3 billion heads of livestock are consumed worldwide, which will increase by 17% by 2028, generating more biowaste, increasing infectious agents, and causing economic losses due to circular economy principles not being applied. This work evaluated the nutritional quality of four types of biowaste from bovine slaughter which were transformed into a meal for guinea pigs (rumen content (RCM), ears (EaM), blood (BM), and cheeks (CM)) according to their chemical composition, digestible components, energy contribution, and voluntary consumption. For the animal model, adult male guinea pigs were arranged in metabolic cages for feces collection without urinary contamination. Nine guinea pigs were used in each digestibility test. First, a direct digestibility test was conducted using a meal of barley as a reference diet (RD), the indigestibility coefficient of which allowed for the estimation of the digestibility of biowaste meals through indirect calculations; for this, diets composed of 80% of the RD and 20% of the corresponding biowaste meals were evaluated. The difference method was suitable for determining the digestibility of beef biowaste using the indigestibility coefficients of the reference diet to calculate the digestibility of ingredients which could not be offered as 100% of the meal but were incorporated as 20%. The digestible protein and metabolizable energy contents of RCM, EaM, BM, and CM were 10.2% and 2853 kcal/kg, 44.5% and 3325 kcal/kg, 70.7% and 2583 kcal/kg, and 80.8% and 3386 kcal/kg, respectively. The CM and BM feeds had the highest contributions of digestible protein due to their higher nitrogen content, and the CM and EaM feeds had the highest ME contents due to their higher fat contents. The biowaste meal consumption in descending order was CM > RCM > EaM > BM, which were consumed without problems. These results are indicative that these components can be part of guinea pigs' diets, and it is recommended to continue studies into guinea pig growth and fattening diets with different levels of these biowaste meals.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a woody oilseed plant native to China, is highly susceptible to anthracnose, a fungal disease that poses a significant threat to its yield and quality. Mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy that specifically targets dysfunctional mitochondria, is crucial for cellular homeostasis, stress response, and pathogenesis in fungi. The proteins that potentially participate in mitophagy in Colletotrichum camelliae were identified herein using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) by screening for the potential protein interactors of the core autophagy-related protein, CaAtg8. Among the identified mitochondria-associated proteins, CaSun1 was selected for further investigation. Phenotypic analyses revealed that CaSun1 is a critical regulator of vegetative growth, conidiation, and pathogenicity. CaSun1 localized to the mitochondria, consistent with the conserved function of SUN family proteins. Notably, the findings revealed that CaSun1 was essential for mitophagy and colocalized with CaAtg8 during nitrogen starvation. Functional analyses demonstrated that CaSun1-mediated mitophagy is vital for the growth of invasive hyphae and pathogenicity in C. camelliae. In summary, our findings indicated that CaSun1 mediates mitophagy by facilitating the recruitment of CaAtg8 in C. camelliae, thereby contributing to the establishment of anthracnose. This study provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of fungal infections and identified a potential target for disease control.

AB  - Plants produce a high diversity of secondary metabolites that are involved in a wide range of different functions, including stress tolerance, signaling molecules for interactions with other species (allelopathy), and protecting plants against herbivores and pathogens. With the rise of more accessible, high-throughput mass spectrometry and new analytical tools, it becomes feasible to identify and validate new secondary metabolites involved in pathogen resistance or assign new roles to previously detected compounds. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the major pathogen defense-associated classes of secondary metabolites, with a focus on those with direct anti-pathogen function. For each class, we highlight one or more typical examples representing the class to give a comprehensive summary of some of the work done to date. In the second part of this review, we highlight how new technological advances and high-throughput experiments in combination with other sources of -omics data, such as genomics and transcriptomics, can accelerate the studies on secondary metabolites and help to link these compounds to genotypes. Employing such approaches will improve our understanding of chemical defenses against plant pathogens and allow for rapid development of markers for resistance breeding.

AB  - Sex and gender differences are seen in cognitive disturbances in a variety of neurological and psychiatry diseases. Men are more likely to have cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia whereas women are more likely to have more severe cognitive symptoms with major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is important to understand sex and gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities with and without disease. Sex differences are noted in performance across various cognitive domains - with males typically outperforming females in spatial tasks and females typically outperforming males in verbal tasks. Furthermore, there are striking sex differences in brain networks that are activated during cognitive tasks and in learning strategies. Although rarely studied, there are also sex differences in the trajectory of cognitive aging. It is important to pay attention to these sex differences as they inform researchers of potential differences in resilience to age-related cognitive decline and underlying mechanisms for both healthy and pathological cognitive aging, depending on sex. We review literature on the progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, as an example of pathological cognitive aging in which human females show greater lifetime risk, neuropathology, and cognitive impairment, compared to human males. Not surprisingly, the relationships between sex and cognition, cognitive aging, and Alzheimer's disease are nuanced and multifaceted. As such, this chapter will end with a discussion of lifestyle factors, like education and diet, as modifiable factors that can alter cognitive aging by sex. Understanding how cognition changes across age and contributing factors, like sex differences, will be essential to improving care for older adults.

AB  - Simple Summary: This work investigated the presence of staphylococci resistant to antibiotics in the raw milk produced in sheep farms, which is intended for human consumption, in an extensive study performed throughout Greece. In 31% of flocks, staphylococci resistant to at least one antibiotic were recovered; in 12% of flocks, staphylococci resistant to at least three different antibiotic classes were found. Factors potentially associated with recovery of resistant isolates were the lack of experience by farmers (< 5 years), the period immediately post lambing, and the intensive management system applied in the flocks.
   The objectives of this work were to study prevalence and characteristics of resistance to antibiotics of staphylococcal isolates from the bulk-tank milk of sheep flocks across Greece, to assess possible associations of the presence of antibiotic resistance with the quality of milk in these flocks and to evaluate flock-related factors potentially associated with antibiotic resistance among these isolates. A cross-sectional study was performed in 325 sheep flocks in Greece. Bulk-tank milk samples were collected for bacteriological examination; staphylococcal isolates were evaluated for resistance to 20 antibiotics. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates, isolates resistant to any antibiotic, and multi-resistant isolates were recovered from 8.0%, 30.5%, and 12.0% of flocks, respectively. Of 232 isolates, 11.6% were resistant to oxacillin, 46.1% were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 16.4% were multi-resistant. Resistance was seen more frequently among coagulase-negative (50.6%) than among Staphylococcus aureus (31.5%) isolates. Resistance was more frequent against penicillin and ampicillin (34.1% of isolates), clindamycin (17.7%), and fosfomycin (14.2%). An association was found between biofilm formation by staphylococci and resistance to fosfomycin. For recovery of oxacillin-resistant isolates, the lack of experience by farmers emerged as a significant factor; respective factors for the isolation of staphylococci resistant to any antibiotic or multi-resistant isolates were the early stage of the lactation period (0th-1st month) and the intensive management system applied in the flocks, respectively.

AB  - Liver X receptors (LXRs) have recently been reported to be novel and potential targets for the reversal of depressive-like behaviors, but the mechanism remains unclear. Hippocampal neuroinflammation and impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia are closely associated with depression. To investigate the effects of LXRs agonist (GW3965) on neuroinflammation and microglia in the hippocampal formation of mice with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral tests, hippocampal LXRs gene expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and cluster of differentiation 206 were estimated by western blotting, modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of microglia in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of activated microglia and the morphology of microglia. We found that GW3965 alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, reversed the decrease in hippocampal LXR alpha and LXR beta induced by CUS, increased the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and decreased the protein expression of antiinflammatory factors induced by CUS. Moreover, CUS intervention significantly increased the number of microglia in the CA1 region, CA2/3 region, and dentate gyrus and the density of activated microglia in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus and significantly decreased the endpoints of microglial branches and process length of microglia in the dentate gyrus, while 4 weeks of injections with GW3965 reversed these changes. These findings suggest that regulating the number, activated state, and morphology of microglia in hippocampal subregions might be an important basis for the antidepressant effects of LXRs.

AB  - Trichomes that originate from plant aerial epidermis act as mechanical and chemical barriers against herbivores. Although several regulators have recently been identified, the regulatory pathway underlying multicellular trichome formation remains largely unknown in tomato. Here, we report a novel HD-ZIP IV transcription factor, Lanata (Ln), a missense mutation which caused the hairy phenotype. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Ln separately interacts with two trichome regulators, Woolly (Wo) and Hair (H). Genetic and molecular evidence demonstrates that Ln directly regulates the expression of H. The interaction between Ln and Wo can increase trichome density by enhancing the expression of SlCycB2 and SlCycB3, which we previously showed are involved in tomato trichome formation. Furthermore, SlCycB2 represses the transactivation of the SlCycB3 gene by Ln and vice versa. Our findings provide new insights into the novel regulatory network controlling multicellular trichome formation in tomato.

AB  - Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a rare infection primarily affecting patients with co-morbidities like immunosuppression and poorly controlled diabetes. Mucormycosis is increasingly being reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). However, reports of coinfection of aspergillosis and mucormycosis involving nose, paranasal sinuses, orbit, and brain are rare in literature. We aimed to evaluate the patient demographics, clinical presentation, and management of cases presenting with mixed infection. We carried out retrospective analysis of 12 patients with confirmed diagnosis of mixed invasive fungal infections post COVID-19 disease out of 70 cases of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) presenting to a tertiary-level hospital in North India from May to June 2021. All patients had diabetes mellitus; the mean age was 48 years. The common presenting features were headache, nasal congestion, palatal ulcer, and vision loss accompanied by facial pain and swelling. Two patients developed cerebral abscess during the course of treatment; three patients had concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received systemic liposomal amphotericin B and serial surgical debridements. The overall mortality rate was 16.7%. Our study demonstrates that mucormycosis and aspergillosis are angioinvasive mycoses that are clinically and radiologically identical. KOH direct mount of clinical sample showing septate hyphae should be extensively searched for aseptate hyphae after digestion and clearing of the tissue. A high index of suspicion of mixed infection post-COVID-19 and early initiation of liposomal amphotericin B followed by prompt surgical intervention can reduce the overall morbidity and mortality among patients with this condition.

AB  - Multiple introductions of tea (Camellia sinensis) to the United States since the 1850s have resulted in US tea germplasm that are currently poorly characterized. To resolve questions concerning the relatedness and regional adaptability of US tea germplasm, 32 domestic individuals were evaluated using 10 InDel markers, and compared with a background population of 30 named and registered Chinese varieties of tea. The marker data were analyzed via a neighbor-joining cladistic tree derived from Nei's genetic distance, STRUCTURE, and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components, which revealed four genetic groups. Nineteen individuals selected from the four groups were assessed for seven leaf traits, two floral descriptors, and leaf yield, to identify plants best adapted to Florida field conditions. Our analyses compared with available historical records led us to estimate the most likely provenance of some of the US individuals, to precisely identify tea plant material and to choose most diverse accessions for breeding tea improved for adaptability, yield and quality.

AB  - Silver in its various forms, including dissolved silver ions (Ag+) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), is a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, largely used in livestock as feed additives and could contribute to the decrease and avoidance of the development of antibiotic resistance. The present study aims to assess the potential ecotoxicity of a silver-based nanomaterial (Ag-kaolin), the feed supplemented with the nanomaterial and the faeces since the latter are the ones that finally reach the environment. To this end, green alga Raphidocellis subcapitata was exposed to the extracts of Ag-kaolin, supplemented feed, and pig faeces for 72 h, along with Ag+ and AgNPs as controls for comparison purposes. Given the complexity of the studied materials, single-cell techniques were used to follow the changes in the cell numbers and chlorophyll fluorescence by flow cytometry, and the accumulation of silver in the exposed cells by single cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SC-ICP-MS). Changes in cell morphology were observed by cell imaging multimode reader. The results revealed a decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence, even at low concentrations of Ag-kaolin (10 mu g L-1) after 48 h of exposure. Additionally, complete growth inhibition was found with this material like the results obtained by exposure to Ag+. For the supplemented feed, a concentration of 50 mu g L-1 was necessary to achieve complete growth inhibition. However, the behaviour differed for the leachate of faeces, which released Ag2S and AgCl

AB  - The protozoan Dientamoeba fragilis is one of the most common parasites in the digestive system of humans worldwide. The host range and transmission routes of D. fragilis, including the role of animals, are still ambiguous with few reports from non-human primates, sheep, rodents, pigs, a cat and a dog. In this study, we used microscopic and TaqMan qPCR analyses to investigate D. fragilisin 150 faecal samples from pet budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. Dientamoeba fragilis DNA was detected in 32 samples, resulting in a mean prevalence of 21.3%. In microscopic examination, trophozoites/cysts of D. fragilis were detected in 13 of 32 qPCR-positive samples. SSU rRNA sequence analyses of the qPCR-positive isolates identified genotype 1 of D. fragilis as predominant in budgerigars. Phylogenetic analyses of the SSU rRNA gene region clustered D. fragilis genotypes, as well as other trichomonads, in separate monophyletic clusters with bootstrap values >= 79.0. Our study provides the first evidence for the natural host status of pet budgerigars for D. fragilisand contributes to the knowledge of the epidemiology of this parasite. The high prevalence of genotype 1 of D. fragilis suggests that pet budgerigars are suitable reservoirs for zoonotic transmission. Our findings contribute to an increased awareness and knowledge of D. fragilis infections in the context of a one-health approach.

AB  - Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) coupled with Dalbergia odorifera (DO) has been used to relieve cardiovascular diseases in China for many years. Our previous studies have integrated that SM-the volatile oil of DO (SM-DOO)-has a cardioprotective effect on chronic myocardial ischemia based on a pharmacological method, but the cardioprotective mechanism has not been elucidated completely in the metabonomic method. In the present study, a metabonomic method based on high-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was performed to evaluate the effects of SM-DOO on chronic myocardial ischemia induced by an ameroid constrictor, which was placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of pigs. Pigs were divided into three groups: sham, model, and SM-DOO group. With multivariate analysis, a clear cluster among the different groups was obtained and the potential biomarkers were recognized. These biomarkers were mainly related to energy metabolism, glucose metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, the protein expressions of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) were significantly upregulated by SM-DOO. The result indicated that SM-DOO could regulate the above biomarkers and metabolic pathways, especially energy metabolism and glucose metabolism. By analyzing and verifying the biomarkers and metabolic pathways, further understanding of the cardioprotective effect of SM-DOO with its mechanism was evaluated. Metabonomic is a reliable system biology approach for understanding the cardioprotective effects of SM-DOO on chronic myocardial ischemia and elucidating the mechanism underlying this protective effect.

AB  - Over one thousand tons of pig hair biowaste (PHB) are produced yearly in Taiwan. The improper disposal of PHB can have a negative impact on the environment, consequently contributing to the spread of diseases. Hydrogen gas can be effectively produced by the catalytic gasification of PHB using a laboratory-scale fixed-bed gasifier, employing 15 wt% NiO/Al2O3 catalysts at 753-913 K. The derived kinetic parameters were obtained and refined using simulation calculations. The central Ni atoms have Ni -O (2.01) and Ni-Ni (2.34) bond distances in the fresh NiO/Al2O3 catalyst. The PHB was converted into hydrogen-rich syngas (CO + H-2, >89.8% dry basis). When PHB (250 kg/h) was catalytically gasified at 753 -913 K, syngas was produced at approximately 5.45 x 10(5) kcal/h of heat recovery with 76.5%-83.5% cold gas efficiency. The simulation of the pilot-scale PHB catalytic gasification demonstrated that the system can provide hydrogen (purity >99.99%) and generate electricity for an internal combustion engine of 100 kW and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell of 175 kW. A projected payback for a PHB catalytic gasification plant with a capacity of 10- or 20-ton per day was around 3.2 or 2.5 years, respectively.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are protective metabolites constitutively produced by Solanaceae species. Genes and enzymes generating the vast structural diversity of SGAs have been largely identified. Yet, mechanisms of hormone pathways coordinating defence (jasmonate; JA) and growth (gibberellin; GA) controlling SGAs metabolism remain unclear.
   We used tomato to decipher the hormonal regulation of SGAs metabolism during growth vs defence tradeoff. This was performed by genetic and biochemical characterisation of different JA and GA pathways components, coupled with in vitro experiments to elucidate the crosstalk between these hormone pathways mediating SGAs metabolism.
   We discovered that reduced active JA results in decreased SGA production, while low levels of GA or its receptor led to elevated SGA accumulation. We showed that MYC1 and MYC2 transcription factors mediate the JA/GA crosstalk by transcriptional activation of SGA biosynthesis and GA catabolism genes. Furthermore, MYC1 and MYC2 transcriptionally regulate the GA signalling suppressor DELLA that by itself interferes in JA-mediated SGA control by modulating MYC activity through protein-protein interaction. Chemical and fungal pathogen treatments reinforced the concept of JA/GA crosstalk during SGA metabolism.
   These findings revealed the mechanism of JA/GA interplay in SGA biosynthesis to balance the cost of chemical defence with growth.

AB  - Estrogen receptor (ER) activation by 17- ss estradiol (E2) can attenuate neuronal injury and behavioral impairments following global cerebral ischemia (GCI) in rodents. This study sought to further examine the discrete roles of ERs through characterization of the effects of selective ER activation on post-ischemic pro -inflammatory microglial activation, hippocampal neuronal injury, and anxiety -like behaviors. Forty-six ovariectomized (OVX) adult female Wistar rats received daily s.c injections (100 mu g/kg/day) of propylpyrazole triol (PPT; ER alpha agonist), diarylpropionitrile (DPN; ER 8 agonist), G-1 (G -protein coupled ER agonist; GPER), E2 (activating all receptors), or vehicle solution (VEH) for 21 days. After final injection, rats underwent GCI via 4 -vessel occlusion (n =8 per group) or sham surgery (n =6, vehicle injections). The Open Field Test (OFT), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and Hole Board Test (HBT) assessed anxiety -like behaviors. Microglial activation (Iba1, CD68, CD86) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), CA1 of the hippocampus, and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) was determined 8 days post-ischemia. Compared to sham rats, Iba1 activation and CA1 neuronal injury were increased in all ischemic groups except DPN-treated rats, with PPT-treated ischemic rats also showing increased PVN Iba1-ir expression. Behaviorally, VEH ischemic rats showed slightly elevated anxiety in the EPM compared to sham counterparts, with no significant effects of agonists. While no changes were observed in the OFT, emotion regulation via grooming in the HBT was increased in G-1 rats compared to E2 rats. Our findings support selective ER activation to regulate post-ischemic microglial activation and coping strategies in the HBT, despite minimal impact on hippocampal injury.

AB  - Simple Summary Increasing female reproductive efficiency, including the litter size and weight of piglets, is one of the biggest challenges in the swine industry. During the gestation period, the umbilical cord facilitates placenta-fetal communication; thus, it plays an indispensable role in intrauterine embryonic development and fitness. Herein, we analyzed the molecular mechanism in declining reproductive potential in high-parity sows by assessing the changes in the umbilical cord blood. Firstly, the best reproductive performance was at parity 3-7, gradually decreasing after parity 8 and angiogenesis was repressed in high-parity sows. Moreover, exosomes derived from multiparous sows exhibited pro-angiogenesis properties but were diminished in exosomes derived from high-parity sows. Additionally, the angiogenesis of sows was significantly decreased, increasing the risk of disease with the increase in parity, greatly limiting the reproductive potential of the sows. At the same time, miR-188-5p expression may play an important role in regulating the lifespan and reproductive potential of sows. These findings demonstrated that miRNAs in umbilical cord blood exosomes play a central role in intrauterine development and suggested novel insights on reproductive potential, which provide a reference for increasing the sow reproductive efficiency. The objective of modern pig breeding is to improve the genetic reproduction performance potential of sows, including the litter size and weight of piglets. During the gestation period, the umbilical cord facilitates placenta-fetal communication; thus, it plays an indispensable role in intrauterine embryonic development and fitness. Herein, we analyzed the molecular mechanism in declining reproductive potential in high-parity sows by assessing the changes in the umbilical cord blood. Firstly, we analyzed the reproductive characteristics data of sows, followed by histological analysis of the umbilical cord phenotype. Next, we evaluated the effect of umbilical cord blood exosomes (UCB-EXO) on angiogenesis. Finally, the miRNA expression in UCB-EXO from high-parity sows with poor reproductive performance (OS) and multiparous sows with excellent reproductive performance (MS) was assessed. Overall, the best reproductive performance was at parity 3-7, gradually decreasing after parity 8 and angiogenesis was repressed in OS. However, exosomes derived from MS (Exo-MS) exhibited pro-angiogenesis properties but were diminished in exosomes derived from OS (Exo-OS). Additionally, the angiogenesis of sows was significantly decreased, increasing the risk of disease with the increase in parity, greatly limiting the reproductive potential of the sows. At the same time, miR-188-5p expression in Exo-OS was significantly higher than in Exo-MS (p < 0.01), implying that it may play an important role in regulating the lifespan and reproductive potential of sows. These findings demonstrated that miRNAs in UCB-EXO play a central role in intrauterine development. Further, the findings suggest novel insights on reproductive potential, which provide a reference for increasing the sow reproductive efficiency.

AB  - Salty areas "Chotts" are very common in the South Highlands of Setif Governorate (northeast of Algeria). In fact, a large part of the sheep population is eventually driven to graze in these areas. However, there is no data on the mineral status of these sheep or on the mineral content of the water and fodder they consume. The present study aims to compare the plasmatic ionogram profiles of Ouled Djellal ewes reared in the Setif Highlands according to feed and water salinity. For this purpose, twenty healthy ewes, aged 2 to 3 years, were selected randomly from two semi-extensive flocks, reared in two distant regions, where they are fed exclusively with locally produced straw, and watered using water with different saltiness levels: sulfated water (S) and soft water (T). Plasmatic concentrations of macroelements (Calcium "Ca", Phosphorus " P", Magnesium "Mg", Sodium "Na", Potassium "K") and trace elements (Iron "Fe", Copper "Cu", Zinc "Zn", and Manganese " Mn") were monitored monthly for one year. Ca, P, Mg, and Fe plasmatic levels were measured using a spectrophotometer, while Na and K levels were measured using flame spectrometry. The plasmatic Cu, Zn and Mn levels were measured using Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy. Results showed that plasmatic values of mineral macro elements change within standard normal ranges, with values slightly higher in Oum Ladjoul region, where the water is sulfated. Regarding the trace elements, sheep of Oum Ladjoul region were not deficient in Cu and Fe, compared to sheep of the witness region (Smara, El-Eulma). The plasmatic Zn levels were low in both regions with regard to the species norms. The absorption of sulfated water (S) seems to have a positive effect on the plasmatic level of the studied minerals. Overall, the consumed water in the study region does not seem to have an undesirable influence on the mineral metabolism. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of drinking water at different physiological stages and over the long term in the study region.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient that is required by all living organisms. However, Cu can also be a potentially toxic metal if excessive dietary supplementation occurs. The current study aimed to investigate the mechanism of Cu toxicity in the cardiomyocytes of large mammal pigs. Here, we used pigs to explore Cu toxicity in the control group (10 mg/kg Cu) and treatment groups (125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg Cu) for a period of 80 days. Consequently, we identified that large amount intake of Cu led to in oxidative damage, and activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-mediated antioxidant pathway, indicating an imbalanced redox status in the myocardium. Furthermore, Cu exposure activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through upregulating levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Additionally, mitochondrial fission and fusion homeostasis was disrupted and the copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was reduced under Cu exposure. Furthermore, Cu exposure could induce apoptosis, evidenced by the increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-d UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive staining, the upregulated expression levels of Cytoplasm-cytochrome C (Cytc), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Cleaved-caspase3, and decreased expression level of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Mitochondrial-cytc. In summary, large amount of Cu could trigger Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-mediated oxidative stress, which promotes ER stress and mitochondrial damage pathways, causing apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Lithosiini (Lepidoptera: Erebidae: Arctiinae) is distinctive in having some species that feed on lichens, whereas the majority of moths feed on vascular plants. However, the larval diet of most Lithosiini species is poorly known. This study examines whether Lithosiini species, collected in a tropical rainforest of Borneo (nine species) and a temperate forest of Japan (eight species), feed on lichens as larvae, based on stable isotope analyses. As a result, the delta N-15 values for eight of nine Lithosiini species collected from Borneo were notably lower than those of nine co-occurring herbivorous non-Lithosiini species, and were similar to those of sympatric, lichen-feeding termites; however, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of one Lithosiini species (Adites sp.) were significantly higher than those of the other moth species and similar to those of humus-feeding termites and predatory insects occurring at the same site. These results have suggested that the Lithosiini in the Southeast Asian tropical rainforests contain some species that feed on lichens as their larval main diet and at least one species whose larvae feed on humus or animal-derived materials. In contrast, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of all examined Lithosiini species (eight species) in the temperate forest have suggested that their larvae fed on plants and not on lichens. Our stable isotope ratio analysis presented quantitative evidence suggesting lichen-feeding by Lithosiini moths in a tropical rainforest without observation of feeding behavior during the larval stages.

AB  - Simple Summary By treating one-month old and adult Hu sheep with superovulation, we found that one-month-old lambs are able to produce more follicles than adult sheep. Nevertheless, our previous study revealed that oocytes derived from juvenile animals tend to be of poor quality, which means that they are less likely to mature and develop into embryos. By treating sheep with exogenous ovulation-inducing hormones, we compared the number of ovulation points and the serum hormone levels in both the lamb and adult groups. In order to reveal the mechanism of abnormal ovulation numbers and oocyte quality induced by hormone treatment in the lamb group, a high-throughput sequencing technique was used to identify the differences in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the ovaries in the lamb and adult groups. The conjoint analysis of lncRNA and mRNA revealed that OaPDGFR, XR_003588840.1, and its target gene OaLRP1, may be the key candidate genes in promoting the number of ovulations in lamb groups. Superovulation technology shows a great potential for shortening breeding time. Using the juvenile superovulation technology, juvenile animals can generate more follicles than adult animals. By sequencing using high-throughput methods, we studied and described differentially expressed (DE) long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the ovaries of young and adult sheep. Herein, 242 DE lncRNAs and 3150 DE mRNAs were screened. Through GO and KEGG analyses, we obtained genes related to ovarian/follicle development and ovulation in DE mRNAs, including OaFSHR, OaLHCGR, OaLDLR, OaZP3, OaSCARB1, and OaPDGFRA; through lncRNA-mRNA correlation analysis, we found that genes associated with ovarian/follicle development or ovulation include: XR_003585520.1, MSTRG.15652.1, XR_003588840.1, and their paired genes PDGFC, LRP5, and LRP1. We observed a synergistic effect between PDGFR and LRP1. PDGFR may play a leading role compared with LRP1. The induced LHCGR in lambs is higher than in adult sheep, showing more sensitivity to LH. The release of the oocytes was stimulated. Among the three lncRNAs, we found that XR_003588840.1 was significantly different and might perform a regulatory role in ovarian/follicle growth or ovulation.

AB  - The optimization and implementation of artificial insemination (AI) in sheep is necessary to increase the livestock productivity through enhanced control of reproductive function. Sperm centrifugation is a common procedure in the ejaculate handling in AI and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART), as part of new methods of sperm analysis, selection or preservation. However, our research group previ-ously established that this simple procedure might cause a large sperm loss and induce deleterious ef-fects on the sperm function of the ovine species when high centrifugation forces are employed. To our knowledge, there are no studies on combined effect of extender and different centrifugal forces on ram sperm yield and quality. Furthermore, evidence of in vivo fertility rate using sperm obtained with various centrifugation forces is also lacking in this species. Thus, the objective of this work was to define the ideal conditions for ram semen centrifugation that will achieve the best quantity and quality sample to ensure unaffected fertilization ability of centrifuged ram sperm. The Experiment 1 evaluated the effect of the centrifugation procedure of two extenders (INRA 96 and Tyrode's) and two cooling protocols (Rapid and Slow Refrigeration-35 degrees C to 15 degrees C-) on sperm recovery rate and quality (motility and kinetic param-eters, viability, apoptosis and mitochondrial activity). INRA 96 combined with Slow Refrigeration and Tyrode's at room temperature registered the highest sperm recovery and quality values (P <= 0.05). In Experiment 2, the influence of three centrifugal forces (600, 1200 and 6000xg for 10 min) was assessed immediately after centrifugation on the technical performance and sperm functionality in diluted samples with INRA 96 and Tyrode's at the conditions set out in Experiment 1. The lowest pellet weight (P <= 0.05) without harmful effect on sperm physiological status (P > 0.05) was achieved at 1200xg, since 6000xg induced sperm motility damage (P <= 0.05) with both extenders. Finally, to ensure the total safety of the centrifugation protocol, Experiment 3 tested in a combined in vitro and in vivo test the effect of these three centrifugal forces on ram sperm quality after dilution (INRA 96) and liquid storage (6-8 h at 15 degrees C). The damage produced by 6000xg on sperm motility (P <= 0.05) was maintained over time, coinciding with a lower fertility (P <= 0.05). In conclusion, ram sperm can be centrifuged in INRA 96 extender up to 1200xg for 10 min at 15 degrees C as secure values with high recovery rates and without detrimental effects on sperm quality and fertility.

AB  - Aims Most human infections with non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) or Campylobacter are zoonotic in nature and acquired though consumption of contaminated food of mainly animal origin. However, individuals may also acquire salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis through non-foodborne transmission pathways, such as those mediated by the environment. This emphasizes the need to consider both direct and indirect exposure to livestock sources as a possible transmission route for NTS and Campylobacter. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing whether salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis incidence is spatially associated with exposure to livestock (i.e. small ruminants, dairy cows, veal calves, laying hens, broiler chickens and pigs) in the Netherlands for the years 2007-2019 and 2014-2019 respectively. Methods and Results Risk factors (population-weighted number of animals) and their population attributable fractions were determined using a Poisson regression model with a log-link function fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximation. The analyses were performed for different hexagonal sizes (90, 50, 25 and 10 km2) and accounted for geographical coverage of the diagnostic laboratory catchment areas. Moreover, serological data were used to look into the possible effects of acquired immunity due to repeated exposure to the pathogen through the environment that would potentially hinder the analyses based on the incidence of reported cases. A linear mixed-effects model was then fitted where the postal code areas were included as a random effect. Livestock was not consistently significantly associated with acquiring salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis in the Netherlands. Conclusions Results showed that living in livestock-rich areas in the Netherlands is not a consistently significant, spatially restricted risk factor for acquiring salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis, thereby supporting current knowledge that human infections with Salmonella and Campylobacter are mainly foodborne.

AB  - Phytoremediation using energy crops offers both environmental and energy-related benefits; however, its effectiveness in soils contaminated with nickel (Ni) and chromium (Cr) due to serpentinite mining requires further investigation. This study aimed to assess the potential of energy crops for the phytoremediation of soil contaminated by serpentinite mining activities. The experiment was conducted using soil from a former chromite mining area in serpentinites, which was operational between 1945 and 2010, in the municipality of Crom & iacute;nia, State of Goi & aacute;s, Brazil. A randomized block design was adopted, comprising five treatments with four replicates: energy cane, sugarcane, capia & ccedil;u grass, elephant grass, and spontaneous flora. The total concentrations of Ni and Cr in the soil were quantified. In plants, shoot and root biomass production, Ni and Cr accumulation, and energy productivity were evaluated. The translocation factor and bioconcentration factor for the metals were determined. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and the Scott-Knott test. Sugarcane exhibited the highest biomass production and energy productivity. Reductions in total Ni and Cr concentrations in the soil were observed at 58% and 22%, respectively, which may be associated with metal retention in the roots through phytostabilization. By ensuring high biomass yields, enabling renewable energy production, preventing metal transfer to other environments and organisms, and providing socioeconomic benefits, the cultivation of energy crops presents a sustainable alternative for the phytoremediation of decommissioned serpentinite mining areas.

AB  - Household well water can be degraded by contaminants from the land's surface, but private well owners lack means to protect the source water from neighboring disturbances. Rural residents of southwestern Wisconsin, USA, rely on private well water, and the combination of land use and fractured carbonate bedrock makes groundwater vulnerable to contamination. To identify the extent, sources, and risk factors of private well contamination, randomly selected wells sampled during two-day periods in fall (n = 301) and spring (n = 529) were analyzed for nitrate and indicator bacteria, and a subset (n = 138) was sampled across four seasonal events for analysis of pathogens and microbial source tracking markers by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Risk factors representing land use, hydrology, geology, and well construction were analyzed for associations with contamination in multivariable models. The importance of risk factors varied by contaminant, illustrating the multifaceted nature of rural groundwater quality. Nitrate contamination was associated with agricultural land use, and wells with casings that extended below a shale aquitard accessed less contaminated water than those drawing water from above it. Human fecal microbes were detected in 64 wells (46%), and rainfall was the key risk factor for contamination, indicating that wastewater from septic systems was available to contaminate wells when transport conditions were favorable. Manure microbes from cattle/ruminants and pigs were detected in 33 and 13 wells, respectively, and concentrations increased with the hectarage of cultivated land near wells. Pathogen genes for viruses, bacteria, and protozoa were detected in 66 wells (48%), including more detections of zoonotic than human-specific pathogens, and human Bacteroides, an indicator of wastewater, was an equivocal predictor of pathogen presence in private wells. Characterizing important elements of the setting, like geology, and identifying sources and risk factors for contaminants can inform landscape-level policies to protect groundwater quality.

AB  - The purpose of this study, carried out in two experiments, was to investigate the antioxidant effect of Prosopis farcta in Experiment 1, and trehalose in Experiment 2 in the freezing extender, on the quality of frozen-thawed goat epididymal spermatozoa. Sperm samples were added to based egg-yolk Tris-extender containing experimental treatments. The first experimental treatments included the following: an extender of the control group without additive and extender containing 50, 100, or 150 mu g/mL of Prosopis farcta ethanolic extract (PEE1, PEE2, and PEE3, respectively). Treatments of the second experiment include an extender of the control group without additive, an extender containing 100 mM of trehalose (Tr), an extender containing 100 mu g/mL PEE2, and 100 mu g/mL PEE2 + 100 mM Tr. The results of the first experiment showed that PEE2 compared with the control group led to a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. Also, PEE1 and PEE2 treatments resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in motility parameters by computer-assisted sperm analysis, and MDA concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in all treatments compared with the control group. In general, the results of the present experiment showed that Prosopis farcta ethanolic extract at the level of 100 <mu>g/mL was effective in improving the quality of frozen-thawed goat epididymal spermatozoa. Also, a combination of Prosopis farcta ethanolic extract and trehalose can be successful in freezing goat epididymal spermatozoa.

AB  - Unveiling the proximate mechanism of caste differentiation is crucial for understanding insect social evolution, and gene function analysis is an important tool in this endeavor. The RNA interference (RNAi) technique is useful in termites, but its knockdown effects may differ among species. One of the most important model species in the field of termite sociogenomics is Reticulitermes speratus Kolbe (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). Presoldier and worker differentiation of this species can be artificially induced by juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdysone application, respectively. However, appropriate RNAi technique of genes expressed during caste differentiation has never been considered. To clarify this issue, first, we injected nine different volumes of nuclease-free water (NFW, 0-404.8 nL) into workers and found that survival and caste differentiation rates were strongly reduced by the application of the top three largest volumes. Second, we injected double-stranded (ds) RNA of ecdysone receptor homolog (RsEcR) (2.0 mu g/151.8 nL NFW) into workers with hormone treatments. The expression levels of RsEcR were significantly reduced at 9 days after dsRNA injection. RsEcR RNAi strongly affected both molting events during presoldier and worker differentiation induced by hormone treatments. The present results highlight the need for caution regarding injection volumes for RNAi experiments using hormone treatments. We suggest that the injection of dsRNA solution (2 mu g; approximately 100-200 nL) is suitable for RNAi experiments during caste differentiation induced by hormone application in R. speratus.

KW  - METABOLISM
KW  - ENZYMES
AB  - Although emerging evidence in mammals reveals that exogenously applied H2 positively regulates numerous physiological and pathological responses, it remains unclear whether and how mammalian cells produce H2 endogenously. Here, we report for the first time that recombinant human (Homo sapiens) and pig (Sus scrofa) nuclear prelamin recognition factor (Narf)-like proteins (also known as H. sapiens iron-only hydrogenase-like protein 1 [HsIOP1] and S. scrofa cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 3 [SsCIAO3], belonging to the [FeFe]-hydrogenase-like protein family), when expressed in a prokaryotic system, can potentially catalyze H2 production in vitro. Anaerobic induction was clearly observed. Further investigation of the transcriptome database revealed the widespread presence of these proteins in human and pig tissues. Sequence and structural analyses revealed that both HsIOP1 and SsCIAO3 may contain four conserved cysteine residues, forming a [4Fe4S] cluster, similar to the known [FeFe]-hydrogenase in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. According to the observed hydrogenase activities of HsIOP1 and SsCIAO3 produced in Escherichia coli and the ubiquitous presence of Narf-like proteins in eukaryotic organisms, we propose that H2 production may be a universal phenomenon in eukaryotic organisms. Based on the results of the evolutionary tree, it was further hypothesized that hydrogen metabolism may have been ignored in the evolution and development of eukaryotic cells for a considerable time.

AB  - The massive use of herbicides, particularly glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), raises several worries, notably their neurotoxic effects. Several studies have explored the consequences of developmental exposure. Our work aims to determine the impact of maternal exposure to GBH on behavioral disorders and memory deficits, as well as the involvement of oxidative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In addition, our study explores the neuroprotective properties of melatonin in male and female offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were injected with GBH 75 mg/kg during gestation and lactation. After weaning, the offspring were treated with melatonin (4 mg/kg) from postnatal days 30-58. Our results show that GBH increases anxiety-like behavior levels in offspring, as well as depression-like behavior. GBH also impairs working memory in progeny. While markers of oxidative stress show a disturbance in lipid peroxidation and catalase activity, with a more pronounced effect in females, on the other hand, melatonin considerably attenuated the neurotoxic impact observed in the offspring, with higher efficacy in females. The oxidative stress results confirm the antioxidant power of melatonin to counteract the damaging effects of exposure to environmental contaminants such as glyphosate-based pesticides. It will then be interesting to further our work to fully understand the sex-dependent effect of melatonin.
   Exposure to GBH during gestation and lactation leads to changes in emotional response and memory function in rat offspring. These changes may be due to the induction of oxidative stress by the pesticide. Melatonin treatment counteracted the GBH-induced deficits. This effect is linked to the neutralization of OS biomarkers.image

AB  - During manure storage (1-6 months), valuable nutrients and organic contents are degraded, emitting substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and odors. Through the application of acidification and cooling -down, the less emissions during storage and beneficial outcomes in further treatment can be expected. However, there is a concern whether these storage technologies really deserve or not. In the present work, at first, a comprehensive review was conducted on (1) the amount of GHGs and odor emissions from manure, (2) the reduction in emitting gases by acidification and cooling-down with mechanisms behind them, and (3) its consequences on the increased biogas production and crop yield. Considering all these, an environmental and economic assessment was performed for three climatic regions (warm, temperate, and cool). It was found that H2SO4-acidification can reduce GHGs emissions by 12.6-97.2 kg CO2 eq/ton manure ( >75 % during the storage process), while the significant reduction was attained in warm region. And, except one case (cool, pH 5.5, and carbon price of 30 USD/kg CO2 eq.), the profit of 0.31-8.69 USD/ton manure was expected. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of "keeping the freshness of manure" to save the planet and get more income.

AB  - In this work, the sustainable valorisation of camel manure has been studied using thermogravimetric analysis. The gasification tests were performed from ambient conditions to 950 ?C at 10, 20, and 50 ?C/min under an O2 environment. The TGA data were applied to determine the kinetics of the O2 gasification. Single-heating rate models (Arrhenius and Coats-Redfern) and multi-heating rate models (Distributed activation energy, Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Starink, and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose) were applied to estimate the kinetics of the process. Between the two single-heating rate models, the Coats-Redfern method fitted best with the experimental data. Among the multi-heating rate models, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa model fitted best with the experimental results. The kinetic parameters-frequency factor, activation energy, and order of reaction were estimated using the FlynnWall-Ozawa model (the best-fitting model) and the estimated kinetic parameters were used to calculate the thermodynamic properties-Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The information on these kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be useful for the design of gasifiers and for optimising the O2 gasification operating conditions.

AB  - Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which is commonly found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is involved in stabilizing ER proteins and inducing the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, GRP78 is expressed on the surface of most common cancer cells, such as cells of breast, lung, liver, and prostate cancers, and plays a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation via the PI3K/PDK1/AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, various trials have been performed for evaluating cancer treatment by inhibiting GRP78. Moreover, GRP78 is expressed on the surface of spermatozoa; however, its role in spermatozoa physiology remains unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of GRP78 on sperm function during capacitation and elucidate the underlying mecha-nisms. Boar spermatozoa were exposed to various concentrations of HA15, a GRP78 antagonist, and sperm ki-nematic parameters, capacitation status, cell viability, levels of PI3K/PDK1/AKT-pathway related proteins, and tyrosine phosphorylation were evaluated. GRP78 inhibition significantly decreased sperm motility, kinematic parameters, capacitated and acrosome-reacted spermatozoa counts, and cell viability. Moreover, GRP78 expression was significantly decreased in HA15-treated spermatozoa compared to that in the control group, and levels of PI3K/PDK1/AKT-pathway related proteins changed significantly. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphoryla-tion was significantly altered in the HA15-treated group. The results of this study suggest that GRP78 inhibition in cancer therapy may negatively affect sperm function. These results lay a strong foundation for future studies aiming to identify the molecular mechanisms related to GRP78 in spermatozoa.

AB  - Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) is a brush border enzyme secreted by enterocytes, playing a crucial role in maintaining gut mucosal defense. This study investigated the expression dynamics of IAP in the small intestine of pigs challenged with Escherichia coli (E. coli) K88, compared to healthy controls. Five-week-old pigs (n = 8) were orally administered E. coli K88 at a concentration of 2 x 108 CFU/mL, with a dose of 2 mL per pig at 0 and 24 h. Five days post-challenge, tissue samples from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were collected for mucosal morphometric analysis and evaluation of IAP expression via immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR. The results revealed the presence of IAP on the apical surface of villi throughout the small intestine, along with significantly upregulated IAP expression in E. coli-challenged pigs compared to controls. These findings suggest that Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli can induce IAP expression, likely through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, thereby enhancing its enzymatic activity as part of the intestinal defense mechanism. This study provides insight into the protective role of IAP and highlights its potential as a biomarker for assessing gut health and diagnosing enteric infections in animals.

AB  - All eukaryotes use sterols as structural components in cell membranes and as precursors for key hormones. However, arthropods are unique among eukaryotes because they cannot synthesize sterols de novo and must acquire sterols through diet. Cholesterol is the dominant sterol in most insects; however, because plants contain little cholesterol, most insect herbivores convert phytosterols to cholesterol. An additional challenge for plant-feeding insects is that only limited types of phytosterols can be converted to cholesterol. In this study, we used RNA interference to modify the plant sterol profile to generate phytosterols that would negatively impact insect herbivores. Specifically, we knocked down the expression of Arabidopsis thaliana & UDelta;(8)-& UDelta;(7)-sterol isomerase gene (HYD1), responsible for the conversion of & UDelta;(8)-sterols into & UDelta;(7)-sterols. Silenced lines with > 95% transcript reduction showed drastically reduced sterol production and approximately half of the total sterols had a & UDelta;(8)-configuration. Importantly, these sterol-modified lines exhibited normal growth compared to controls. In contract, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae reared on sterol-modified plants showed reduced growth and survival, while adults showed significantly decreased egg production. Sterol analysis of P. xylostella adults suggests these negative effects were likely a result of reduced cholesterol and the accumulation of & UDelta;(8)-sterols. Finally, we modeled the effects of sterol-modified plants at the population level using our growth and reproductive data. We observed reduced population size and extended generation time after only two generations. Collectively, our results suggest that modifying plant sterols has potential for management of pest caterpillars, including the globally distributed P. xylostella.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Physiological stress increases the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the secretion of cortisol, which might cross the placenta and affect foetal development. Stress in sows can be affected by management factors such as enrichment, different feed systems of the housing accommodation, and is reflected in the salivary cortisol concentration. It is unclear how stressed the sow must be before there is an impact on foetal growth, but higher levels of cortisol might affect the maturity of piglets at birth as well as their birth weight. Therefore, it could be beneficial to accommodate gestating sows in the least stressful manner, not only for piglet performance but also for sow welfare. Cortisol concentration in sows seems to be influenced by a combination of parity and feed systems, but its connection to those factors, as well as to foetal development, warrants further investigation.
   The aim of this study was to investigate herd cortisol levels as an indicator of stress during gestation in three different feeding systems. Twelve commercial Danish herds with 800 to 3050 sows were included, with either free-access feeding stall (Stall), floor feeding (Floor), or electronic sow feeding (ESF; n = 4 herds per system). Saliva samples were collected from 30 sows/herd in the gestation unit for cortisol analysis with an average of 67.2 gestation days for ESF, 72.4 days for Floor, and 68.6 days for Stall. Data on piglet birth weight (PBW) and the percentage of intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) piglets from 452 litters (9652 piglets, 8677 liveborn) from all 12 herds were obtained on the saliva collection days. The cortisol levels in saliva increased throughout gestation (p < 0.01), and lower concentrations were observed among sows belonging to Stall (4.80 nmol/L), compared to Floor (7.03 nmol/L) and ESF (7.87 nmol/L), and that difference was significant as an independent effect in the case of ESF (p < 0.01). There was no difference between Floor and ESF or Stall and Floor (p > 0.05). An interaction was observed between parity and feeding system, with parities 4-5 in ESF herds having lower levels than other parities within the ESF system (p = 0.02).

AB  - Background: Pig-tailed macaques (PTMs) are commonly used as preclinical models to assess antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention research. Drug toxicities and disease pathologies are often preceded by changes in blood hematology. To better assess the safety profile of pharmaceuticals, we defined normal ranges of hematological values in PTMs using an Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm. Methods: Eighteen female PTMs were evaluated. Blood was collected 1-24 times per animal for a total of 159 samples. Complete blood counts were performed, and iForest was used to analyze the hematology data to detect outliers. Results: Median, IQR, and ranges were calculated for 13 hematology parameters. From all samples, 22 outliers were detected. These outliers were excluded from the reference index. Conclusions: Using iForest, we defined a normal range for hematology parameters in female PTMs. This reference index can be a valuable tool for future studies evaluating drug toxicities in PTMs.

AB  - Resistance (R) proteins are important components of plant innate immunity. Most known R proteins are nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Although a number of signaling components downstream of NLRs have been identified, we lack a general understanding of the signaling pathways. Here, we used the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and Magnaporthe oryzae to study signaling of rice NLRs in response to blast infection. We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3. OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1). Further investigation revealed that the three signaling components also play important roles in disease resistance mediated by the distantly related NLR protein Pig, suggesting that the OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 signaling pathway could be conserved across rice NLR-induced blast resistance. In addition, we observed changes in RAI1 levels during blast infection, which led to identification of OsRPT2a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. OsRPT2a seemed to be responsible for RAI1 turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest a defense signaling route that might be common to NLR proteins in response to blast infection.
