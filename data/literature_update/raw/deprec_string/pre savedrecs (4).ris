AB  - Understanding the composition and dynamics of ecological communities is challenging because of the large number of organisms present and their numerous interactions. Among agricultural systems, intercropping considerably increases the complexity of communities compared to monocultures and alternative host plants can influence insect pest damage. Using literature records, we construct and analyse connectance trophic webs of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) agro-ecosystems, including and excluding intercrops. Estimates of connectance (community complexity) are relatively low and little affected by consideration of intercrops. Plant-herbivore overlap is relatively high, suggesting that herbivores are typically not specialists. Herbivore-natural enemy overlap is greater when intercrops are considered, suggesting that diffuse apparent competition regulates pest populations. We pay particular attention to how trophic web structure might affect Batrachedra amydraula (Lesser date moth), an important economic pest. Records indicate it having 15 species of natural enemies and sharing 9 of these with other herbivores; these may maintain populations of natural enemies when the moth is seasonally rare, contributing to pest suppression. The estimated potential for apparent competition between the lesser date moth and other herbivores is higher when intercrops are considered. The consequent expectation of less severe infestations in plantations that are intercropped compared to monocultures matches empirically derived reports. Further, comparing results obtained from the literature on one country (Oman) and from 15 Middle Eastern countries, we find that community metric estimates are relatively little affected by the geographical scale considered. Overall, our results suggest that literature-based trophic web construction can provide an efficient and robust alternative, or in addition, to direct empirical methodologies and that the presence of intercrops will contribute to major pest suppression via indirect apparent competition.

AB  - Social conflict over rangeland-use priorities, especially near protected areas, has long pitted environmental and biodiversity conservation interests against livestock livelihoods. Social-ecological conflict limits management adaptation and creativity while reinforcing social and disciplinary divisions. It can also reduce rancher access to land and negatively affect wildlife conservation. Communities increasingly expect research organizations to address complex social dynamics to improve opportunities for multiple ecosystem service delivery on rangelands. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), an area of the western US, long-standing disagreements among actors who argue for the use of the land for livestock and those who prioritize wildlife are limiting conservation and ranching livelihoods. Researchers at the USDA-ARS US Sheep Experiment Station (USSES) along with University and societal partners are responding to these challenges using a collaborative adaptive management (CAM) methodology. The USSES Rangeland Collaboratory is a living laboratory project leveraging the resources of a federal range sheep research ranch operating across sagebrush steppe ecosystems in Clark County, Idaho, and montane/subalpine landscapes in Beaverhead County, Montana. The project places stakeholders, including ranchers, conservation groups, and government land managers, in the decision-making seat for a participatory case study. This involves adaptive management planning related to grazing and livestock-wildlife management decisions for two ranch-scale rangeland management scenarios, one modeled after a traditional range sheep operation and the second, a more intensified operation with no use of summer ranges. We discuss the extent to which the CAM approach creates opportunities for multi-directional learning among participants and evaluate trade-offs among preferred management systems through participatory ranch-scale grazing research. In a complex system where the needs and goals of various actors are misaligned across spatiotemporal, disciplinary, and social-ecological scales, CAM creates a structure and methods to focus on social learning and land management knowledge creation.

AB  - Cervids inhabit mosaic landscapes that are strongly influenced by human land use and actions. Forestry and agriculture influence both the foodscape and the risk landscape, thus influencing how cervids respond to resource-risk trade-offs. Furthermore, these land use types interact to shape cervid use of the landscape. For example, cervids can forage in open agricultural fields providing high quality forage during the night, while using nearby forest patches to reduce risk during the day. Hence, actions conducted in one of these land use types will likely influence the use of the other by cervids. In this study, we investigate how agricultural and silvicultural practices interact to shape cervid use of the forest and their impact on commercially valuable trees. More specifically, we investigate the effect of growing nutrient dense crops in mixed forest-agriculture landscapes. We hypothesized that the sowing of such crops may not only attract cervids to the agricultural parts of the landscape, but also lead to increased browsing levels in adjacent forest areas where cervids seek cover. Moreover, such high quality crops may not only influence the number of animals, but also increase the intake rate of fibrous tree saplings of individual cervids to nutritionally balance the high input of easily-digestible macronutrients from the crops. We tested these ideas by conducting a large landscape-scale experiment where we manipulated the foodscape by growing two crop types on 28 fields (14 fields with high-quality oat versus 14 fields with lowerquality grass) and measuring cervid use of tree saplings in the forest patches adjacent these fields. We also investigated how forage availability in the forest patches and the distance from field edge affected browsing on tree saplings. Finally, we compared the effects of crop type and forest forage availability on the browsing pressure on coniferous versus deciduous tree species. We studied this in a multispecies ungulate system, where four cervid species occur sympatrically. We show that the type of crop sown influenced browsing pressure on tree saplings in nearby forests, with higher browsing levels in forests surrounding oat compared to grass fields. Moreover, browsing pressure in these forests was influenced by the availability of young trees in the forest stands, where more young trees led to reduced browsing pressure on individual saplings. Our study emphasizes that human practices that shape features of the foodscape in one land use type will influence the impact cervids have in another land use type. Hence, our study highlights the importance of considering the actions and impacts of different land uses simultaneously for predicting cervid foraging patterns in mixed forest-agriculture landscapes.

AB  - Cold-water coral reefs and sponge grounds are deep-sea biological hotspots, equivalent to shallow-water tropical coral reefs. In tropical ecosystems, biodiversity and productivity are maintained through efficient recycling pathways, such as the sponge loop. In this pathway, encrusting sponges recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM) into particulate detritus. Subsequently, the sponge-produced detritus serves as a food source for other organisms on the reef. Alternatively, the DOM stored in massive sponges was recently hypothesized to be transferred to higher trophic levels through predation of these sponges, instead of detritus production. However, for deep-sea sponges, the existence of all prerequisite, consecutive steps of the sponge loop have not yet been established. Here, we tested whether cold-water deep-sea sponges, similar to their tropical shallow-water counterparts, take up DOM and transfer assimilated DOM to associated fauna via either detritus production or predation. We traced the fate of (13)carbon (C)- and (15)nitrogen (N)-enriched DOM and particulate organic matter (POM) in time using a pulse-chase approach. During the 24-h pulse, the uptake of C-13/N-15-enriched DOM and POM by two deep-sea sponge species, the massive species Geodia barretti and the encrusting species Hymedesmia sp., was assessed. During the subsequent 9-day chase in label-free seawater, we investigated the transfer of the consumed food by sponges into brittle stars via two possible scenarios: (1) the production and subsequent consumption of detrital waste or (2) direct feeding on sponge tissue. We found that particulate detritus released by both sponge species contained C from the previously consumed tracer DOM and POM, and, after 9-day exposure to the labeled sponges and detritus, enrichment of C-13 and N-15 was also detected in the tissue of the brittle stars. These results therefore provide the first evidence of all consecutive steps of a sponge loop pathway via deep-sea sponges. We cannot distinguish at present whether the deep-sea sponge loop is acting through a detrital or predatory pathway, but conclude that both scenarios are feasible. We conclude that sponges could play an important role in the recycling of DOM in the many deep-sea ecosystems where they are abundant, although in situ measurements are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Large-bodied wild ungulates are declining worldwide, while domestic livestock continue to increase in abundance. Such changes in large herbivore communities should have strong effects on the control of ticks and tick-borne disease as they can indirectly modify habitat and directly serve as final hosts for ticks' lifecycles. Numerous studies have now linked changing ungulate communities to changes in tick populations and disease risk. However, the effects of changing large herbivore communities are variable across studies, and the effect of climate as a mediating factor of this variation remains poorly understood. Also, studies to date have largely focused on wildlife loss without considering the extent to which livestock additions may alter tick populations, even though livestock replacement of wildlife is the global norm. In this study, we used a large-scale exclosure experiment replicated along a topo-climatic gradient to examine the effects on tick populations of both large herbivore removal and livestock additions. We found that while questing ticks increased modestly, by 21%, when large herbivores were removed from a system they decreased more substantially, by 50%, when livestock (in the form of cattle) were added. Importantly, in addition to the direct effects of climate on tick populations, climate also mediates the effect of ungulates on questing tick density. Particularly, the addition of livestock under the most arid conditions decreased tick presence, likely due to changes in ground-level microclimates away from those beneficial to ticks. Overall, the work contributes to our understanding of tick population responses to globally common human-induced rangeland alterations under the concurrent effects of climate change.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are one of the most serious threats to global biodiversity and one of the leading causes of federal protection required for native species under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA). Our goal was to document how IAS impact threatened and endangered species (T&ES) under the ESA to improve recovery efforts. We reviewed Federal Register listing decisions for 1,545 T&ES listed under the ESA and found that 58% were impacted by IAS. Pacific Island T&ES (97%) face greater threats from IAS compared to Mainland (38%) and Atlantic Island T&ES (22%), but the number of IAS impacting T&ES has increased over time in all 3 geographic areas, except for animals on Atlantic Islands. On Pacific Islands, we found that IAS impacted T&ES most through adverse habitat modification and competition, mainly through invasive plants. Negative interactions caused by IAS on the Mainland were mainly from invasive fish and plants, while on the Atlantic Islands they were caused by invasive mammals and plants. The IAS causing the greatest number of negative interactions included rats (Rattus), wild pigs (Sus), goats (Capra), fish (e.g., Lepomis and Micropterus), and various genera of plants (e.g., Schinus, Rubus, and Psidium). Based on our findings, immediate actions are needed to protect native biodiversity in the U.S. from IAS, especially on Pacific Islands. Such management actions include eradication of IAS, restoration of native habitat, development of robust policies that aim to prevent the further spread and establishment of IAS, and effective decision support tools. These actions will require coordinated leadership to improve recovery of T&ES, especially given the synergistic impacts of international trade and climate change.

AB  - Parasitic infections in wildlife are influenced by numerous factors, including those related to wildlife management. This includes sup plementary feeding widespread in numerous ungulates, including European bison. In this paper we analysed the influence of sup plementary feeding and winter ranging of European bison herds on the dynamics, prevalence and infection severity of the blood-sucking nematode Ashworthius sidemi in two areas in NE Poland: the Knyszyn Forest (KF) and the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) with diversified management stra-tegies. We found significant differences in A. sidemi abundance and intensity between European bison groups; sup plementary fed European bison from the BPF had higher parasitic load (3020 parasites, on average), than non-fed individuals from the KF (1400) and from the BPF (770). The prevalence was relatively high in all groups (93-96 %). In the KF the highest infection rate was observed 9 years after the first appearance of A. sidemi, with a maximum value of 8,620 nematodes; while in the BPF, after just 6 years with maximal load up to 44,310 A. sidemi. The most plausible mechanism behind the observed pattern is probably the winter ranging behaviour of differently managed herds. We found that increasing winter home range size of European bison was associated with a significant reduction in the A. sidemi abundance. Our study shows that different management strategies may have an impact on animal spatial behaviour and associated spread and dynamics of pathogens in mammalian populations, and stresses the importance of adaptive management in reducing threats to wildlife.

AB  - Leaf toughness is an important functional trait that confers resistance to herbivory and mechanical damage. We sought to determine how species composition, climate, seasonality, and nutrient availability influence leaf toughness in two types of tundra in northern Alaska. We measured leaf toughness as force to punch for 11 species of Arctic plants in tussock tundra and dry heath tundra at 17 sites distributed along a latitudinal gradient. Rubus chamaemorus L. and the graminoids occupied opposite ends of the leaf toughness spectrum, with Rubus chamaemorus requiring the least force to punch, whereas one of the graminoids, Eriophorum vaginatum L., required the most. Leaf toughness increased with mean summer temperature for Eriophorum vaginatum and Betula nana L., whereas it declined with warmer temperatures for the other species. Toughness of mature leaves of Eriophorum vaginatum did not vary through the growing season but declined significantly after senescence. Application of N and P fertilizer in an experimental site decreased leaf toughness in three species but had no effect on four others. Leaf toughness of four out of five species in dry heath was greater than for the same species in tussock tundra, but there was no difference in community-weighted mean toughness between tussock tundra and dry heath.

AB  - Fire is considered a major threat to biodiversity in many habitats and the occurrence of fire has frequently been used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas. Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001-2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter and nutrients released from leaf litter are important cross-ecosystem resources supporting freshwater food webs. Dissolved organic matter supports heterotrophic organisms in freshwater communities. However, the role of nutrients released from leaf litter in the autochthonous production in aquatic ecosystems is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated how dissolved nutrients released from leaf litter affect algal growth, biomass production, and cellular elemental ratios. Specifically, we experimentally examined the response of green algae to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) released from leaf litter of 11 temperate tree species and the degree of deficiency of nutrient elements other than N and P relative to algal demand in these litter leachates by supplementing these elements. We found that algal growth did not significantly increase with dissolved N or P in the leaf leachates. In contrast, algal biomass production increased with dissolved N concentration, regardless of amendment. Algal growth and production limitation by deficiency of elements other than N and P was found only in the leachate of Japanese hemlock, indicating that the concentrations or release efficiencies of these elements in this leaf litter were lower than those of N and P relative to algal requirements. More importantly, leaf litter leachates from different tree species altered algal cell quotas and C:N:P ratios, which would affect secondary production. These results suggest that variations in leaf litter leachate stoichiometry caused by vegetation change would affect the abundance and chemical composition of phytoplankton, and thus the trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton.
   Nutrients released from diverse forest leaf litter lead to different growth, production, and stoichiometry of phytoplankton. Forest vegetation change or succession affect the quantity and quality of autochthonous organic matter and the mass transfer efficiency in the aquatic community by altering the stoichiometry of nutrient input from the leaf litter. image

AB  - Widespread overharvest has led to marine ecosystem degradation and declining fishery catches in many tropical communities. To allow stocks to recover and provide increased flows of food and income, reductions in fishing effort are necessary. The development of Alternative Income Generating Activities can help to reduce the economic reliance of coastal communities on fishing, potentially reducing pressure on fish stocks. Here we assess the local conditions which have enabled the creation of Alternative Income Generating Activities to fishing based on marine ecotourism in Moalboal, Philippines. Importantly, while marine ecotourism typically centers around charismatic megafauna, a combination of nearshore fringing reefs, the establishment of nearshore marine protected areas and the occurrence of a consistently large herring aggregation provide a large tourism draw to this community. Using a combination of regional and local economic statistics and stakeholder surveys, we implement an economic valuation of Moalboal marine ecotourism for 2018 and compare this valuation to an independent estimate of the extractive value of the herring aggregation. The Moalboal case indicates that a combination of strong community engagement in the governance of the ecotourism resource, a network of locally managed marine protected areas and the retention and distribution of economic benefits within the local community have led to a significant marine ecotourism sector. We contextualize these conditions into a set of potential enabling conditions for marine ecotourism as an Alternative Income Generating Activity to fishing to contribute insights to diversifying livelihood opportunities beyond extractive fishing for coastal communities in the tropics.

AB  - Obtaining endocrinological profiles using non-invasive methodologies by the measurement of hormone fecal metabolites is a widely used method to monitor ovarian activity and pregnancy in wild species. These tools allow the obtention of physiological information without causing capture-related stress on the individuals. In this research, we aimed to 1) biologically validate a non-invasive method to assess fecal progestagens and estrogens fluctuations during gestation in guanacos (Lama guanicoe) and 2) apply this technique to assess pregnancy in a wild free-ranging population. Fecal samples were collected through the gestation period (similar to 12 months) of female guanacos in a 6.5-ha paddock. An increase in fecal metabolites of both hormones was detected. Progestagens increased gradually, in contrast to estrogens, which remained at basal values for most of the gestation period and peaked only a few days before calving. To assess pregnancy in wild free-ranging animals, fecal samples were collected from a population of La Payunia provincial reserve (Mendoza, Argentina) during the beginning of gestation and at the end of gestation. Through the first months of possible gestation, pregnant females represented between 40 and 80% of the population; at the end of gestation, only 20-40% of the females had confirmed pregnancies. Our results demonstrated that the polyclonal antisera and sexual hormone metabolite assays used here detect variations in the metabolites excreted through feces in guanacos and provide the possibility of non-invasive hormone monitoring of female reproductive status. Also, the findings in wild conditions suggest that natural abortions could have occurred during the first months of gestation. Although some abortions may be natural, the harsh environmental conditions that challenge the support of such a long gestational process may be another relevant factor to consider. The results obtained here enhance our understanding of the reproductive physiology of one of the most emblematic ungulates in South America.

AB  - Hunting is an increasingly contentious topic. Trophy hunting, whereby people hunt individual animals with desirable characteristics in order to keep body parts (e.g. horns, heads, hides, antlers) as mementos, is especially contested. Political pressure, often in the form of trophy import bans, is being applied in multiple nations, and campaigns to ban trophy hunting, or trophy imports, attract considerable media attention. However, trophy hunting often has conservation value, acting to protect habitat and provide income for local communities. Assuming that media coverage can influence public and political opinion, negative or simplistic media coverage of trophy hunting has the potential to cause adverse outcomes for conservation and local communities. Here, we analyse coverage of trophy hunting from July 2010 - June 2020 (five years before and five years after the death of Cecil the Lion) in the most popular UK media outlets (624 articles in total), assessing the overall sentiment of each article, and the species and countries covered. Ninety percent of all coverage occurred after the death of Cecil the lion, marking this event as a watershed moment in UK mainstream media depiction of trophy hunting. The overall sentiment of articles was largely against trophy hunting (63.1%), and this was more pronounced in tabloids (84.2%) than broadsheets (42.2%). Pro-trophy hunting articles were very uncommon overall (3.5%). Articles that described the complexity of trophy hunting decreased following Cecil and were most common in pre-Cecil broadsheets (35.7%, dropping to 30.6%) and rarest in post-Cecil tabloids (3.1%). Articles focussed mainly on charismatic but rarely hunted species including lion, elephant and rhino, with commonly hunted species (such as impala or Cape buffalo) only rarely being mentioned. When countries were mentioned, southern African nations predominated, with four nations (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Botswana) being named in 68% of qualifying articles. We conclude that simplistic media depiction of trophy hunting has the potential to cause negative outcomes for conservation through its impact on public perception and political opinion.

AB  - Northern herbivore ranges are expanding in response to a warming climate. Forage quality also influences herbivore distributions, but less is known about the effects of climate change on plant biochemical properties. Remote sensing could enable landscape-scale estimations of forage quality, which is of interest to wildlife managers. Despite the importance of integrated forage quality metrics like digestible protein (DP) and digestible dry matter (DDM), few studies investigate remote sensing approaches to estimate these characteristics. We evaluated how well DP and DDM could be estimated using hyperspectral remote sensing and assessed whether incorporating shrub structural metrics affected by browsing would improve our ability to predict DP and DDM. We collected canopy-level spectra, destructive-vegetation samples, and flew unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) in willow (Salix spp.) dominated areas in north central Alaska in July 2019. We derived vegetation canopy structural metrics from 3D point cloud data obtained from UAV imagery using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. The best performing model for DP included a spectral vegetation index (SVI) that used a red-edge and shortwave infrared band, and shrub height variability (hvar; Nagelkerke R (2) = 0.81, root mean square error RMSE = 1.42%, cross validation rho = 0.88). DDM's best model included a SVI with a blue and a red band, the normalized difference red-edge index, and hvar (adjusted R (2) = 0.73, RMSE = 4.16%, cross validation rho = 0.80). Results from our study demonstrate that integrated forage quality metrics may be successfully quantified using hyperspectral remote sensing data, and that models based on those data may be improved by incorporating additional shrub structural metrics such as height variability. Modern airborne sensor platforms such as Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager provide opportunities to fuse data streams from both structural and optical data, which may enhance our ability to estimate and scale important foliar properties.

AB  - Roe deer is a protected species in Iran as its population and distribution in the country have considerably declined. Roe deer are threatened by several factors such as habitat fragmentation and road mortality, so studying their distribution and movement through the increasing habitat destruction and fragmentation is necessary. This will become increasingly important because climate change will transform the species' future habitat and connectivity patterns. We evaluated the roe deer's potential distribution range in northern Iran and, for the first time, developed connectivity models and designed corridors for the present and future to make better conservation plans. We collected 91 points indicating the presence of roe deer in the study region. After developing ensemble models using six species distribution algorithms, we defined high-ranked habitat cores using the concept of landscape suitability prioritization. From these, we designed connectivity and corridors in two time-frames with the help of least-cost paths and circuit theories to predict the potential movement throughout the study area. We estimated that the overall core habitats for roe deer in the present and future periods are, respectively, around 1200 km2 and 2600 km2, corresponding to 2 and 4 percent of the whole area. This suggests that the habitat core will expand in the future as a result of climate change. Similarly, the con-nectivity among the cores will strengthen. We also conclude that the temperature-driven and anthropogenic variables significantly affect the distribution of roe deer in northern Iran. It is necessary that conservationists and managers consider the designed corridors in the present study while planning conservation strategies.

AB  - The Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii) is often classified as a woodland species, but it exhibits marked plasticity by nesting successfully in what was previously thought to be atypical habitat such as urban areas and sparsely wooded grasslands, including the Little Missouri National Grassland in North Dakota. Forest expansion into North Dakota grasslands is likely due to the reduction of natural disturbances such as wildfires and grazing by bison (Bison bison). From the 1970s to 2001, forest cover increased in McKenzie County, North Dakota, by >1000%. From 1950 to 1972 there were two recorded instances of nesting Cooper's Hawks in McKenzie County. In 2001, we recorded 18 active nests, 13 of which were successful, four that failed, and one with unknown fate. Using the 2001 National Landcover Dataset (NLCD), we calculated that the mean proportion of forest cover in circular plots (18.1 km(2)) surrounding nests was 0.21. We found no relationship between nest fate and proportion of forest land cover. Additionally, we found no significant difference in proportion of forest cover between nest sites and randomly selected sites centered on forest land cover, indicating that Cooper's Hawks were using forest land cover in proportion to its availability. Understanding the relationship between the shifting landscape composition of North Dakota and its avifauna is important for monitoring and managing breeding Cooper's Hawks.

AB  - Wild meat hunting is one of the primary threats to biodiversity, and it is important to understand the drivers of hunting by communities residing within biodiverse areas, the methods they employ and their preferences for particular wild meat types. We investigated these aspects of wild meat hunting amongst the Indigenous Naga tribes of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot in Nagaland, north-east India. Local people consumed all 31 species of wild mammals detected on camera traps, but the hunters we surveyed mostly preferred large-bodied wild mammals, particularly barking deer Muntiacus muntjak and bears (Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus, sun bear Helarctos malayanus). Hunting is subsistence driven following the predictions of optimal foraging theory. The traditional hunting weapons, techniques and strategies used varied according to prey, forest habitat type, community and season. The use of guns, however, is widespread and has replaced most traditional methods of hunting. Additionally, subsistence hunting is evolving into an economically driven activity because of the influence of wildlife trafficking. Discussions with local people regarding their perceptions of conservation provided insights into the dependency of these communities on biodiversity and their recognition of biodiversity losses from overhunting. Nevertheless, communities appear not to be motivated to participate in biodiversity conservation. An interdisciplinary approach to conservation, addressing education coupled with integrated policies that could sustain economic and cultural values is needed in communities such as Nagaland, where hunting remains culturally driven and primarily subsistence orientated.

AB  - The Galapagos Archipelago is a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. However, compared to the relatively well-known megafauna, the distribution and ecological significance of marine protists in this system are poorly understood. To gain an understanding of the protistan assemblages across trophic modes, an intensive oceanographic survey was conducted in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) in October of 2018. The Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC)-influenced region had higher chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations than those of the eastern regions of the archipelago, along with higher abundances of protistan grazers. Specifically, proportions of autotrophic and potentially mixotrophic dinoflagellates were higher in the EUC, whereas in the eastern regions, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and chlorophytes dominated. Taxonomic composition and biochemical indicators suggested proportions of micrograzers and their associated heterotrophic biomass was higher in the oligotrophic, low Chl-a regions in the east. We also report observations from a dinoflagellate bloom in the western archipelago, which was heavily influenced by upwelling of the EUC. The red tide-forming dinoflagellate Scrippsiella lachrymosa was highly detected through light microscopy and DNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Polykrikos kofoidii was detected and, based on cell densities observed in this study and grazing rates obtained from the literature, estimated to potentially graze up to 62% of S. lachrymosa bloom population. Our findings thus provide new insights into the composition of micrograzers and their potential roles in structuring protistan communities in the Galapagos Archipelago.

AB  - The study of bison in zoos can provide insights about the behaviour of this species with application for the management of herds held in captivity for both public display and bison farming. The aim of this study was to describe and investigate the behavioural budget of American bison in captivity, specifically focusing on how these behaviours may be influenced by time of day, visitor pressure and weather. Four bison Bison bison (two male and two female) at the Zoo Aquarium Madrid in Spain were video monitored for 27 days (May 2022) by three solar-powered cameras. From the footage collected, five behaviours were hourly annotated: lying, standing, moving, eating and drinking. The corresponding meteorological data (temperature, relative air humidity, temperature humidity index, wind speed, barometric pressure and solar radiation) were also measured. Data analysis examined bison behaviour and its relationship with time of day (diurnal, nocturnal), visitor pressure (low, high) and meteorological data divided in days by range of observed weather conditions (lower, upper). Bison spent most time lying, followed by standing, moving, eating and drinking. Bison spent more time lying at night and ate more during the day. The animals spent more time drinking during high visitor pressure. Behaviour was affected by weather; increased temperatures and humidity reduced movement time, while elevated barometric pressure was related with more drinking time. Lower pressure and increased solar radiation were associated with less moving/standing time and more lying time, respectively. In summary, bison behaviour was influenced by time of day, visitor pressure and weather parameters.

AB  - Introduction: Freshwater ecosystems are susceptible to invasion by alien macrophytes due to their connectivity and various plant dispersal vectors. These ecosystems often experience anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, favouring invasive species that efficiently exploit these resources. Propagule pressure (reflecting the quantity of introduced individuals) and habitat invasibility are key determinants of invasion success. Moreover, the enemy release hypothesis predicts that escape from natural enemies, such as herbivores, allows alien species to invest more resources to growth and reproduction rather than defense, enhancing their invasive potential. Yet, the combined impact of propagule pressure, herbivory, and nutrient enrichment on the competitive dynamics between invasive alien macrophytes and native macrophyte communities is not well understood due to a paucity of studies. Methods: We conducted a full factorial mesocosm experiment to explore the individual and combined effects of herbivory, nutrient levels, propagule pressure, and competition on the invasion success of the alien macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum into a native macrophyte community comprising Vallisneria natans, Hydrilla verticillata, and Myriophyllum spicatum. This setup included varying M. aquaticum densities (low vs. high, simulating low and high propagule pressures), two levels of herbivory by the native snail Lymnaea stagnalis (herbivory vs no-herbivory), and two nutrient conditions (low vs. high). Myriophyllum aquaticum was also grown separately at both densities without competition from native macrophytes. Results: The invasive alien macrophyte M. aquaticum produced the highest shoot and total biomass when simultaneously subjected to conditions of high-density intraspecific competition, no herbivory, and low-nutrient availability treatments. Moreover, a high propagule pressure of M. aquaticum significantly reduced the growth of the native macrophyte community in nutrient-rich conditions, but this effect was not observed in nutrient-poor conditions. Discussion: These findings indicate that M. aquaticum has adaptive traits enabling it to flourish in the absence of herbivory (supporting the enemy release hypothesis) and in challenging environments such as intense intraspecific competition and low nutrient availability. Additionally, the findings demonstrate that when present in large numbers, M. aquaticum can significantly inhibit the growth of native macrophyte communities, particularly in nutrient-rich environments. Consequently, reducing the propagule pressure of M. aquaticum could help control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact. Overall, these findings emphasize that the growth and impacts of invasive alien plants can vary across different habitat conditions and is shaped by the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors.

AB  - Climate change and fisheries exploitation are dramatically changing the abundances, species composition, and size spectra of fish communities. We explore whether variation in 'abundance size spectra', a widely studied ecosystem feature, is influenced by a parameter theorized to govern the shape of size-structured ecosystems-the relationship between the sizes of predators and their prey (predator-prey mass ratios, or PPMRs). PPMR estimates are lacking for avast number of fish species, including at the scale of trophic guilds. Using measurements of 8128 prey items in gut contents of 97 reef fish species, we established predator-prey mass ratios (PPMRs) for four major trophic guilds (piscivores, invertivores, planktivores, and herbivores) using linear mixed effects models. To assess the theoretical predictions that higher community-level PPMRs leads to shallower size spectrum slopes, we compared observations of both ecosystem metrics for similar to 15,000 coastal reef sites distributed around Australia. PPMRs of individual fishes were remarkably high (median similar to 71,000), with significant variation between different trophic guilds (similar to 890 for piscivores; similar to 83,000 for planktivores), and similar to 8700 for whole communities. Community-level PPMRs were positively related to size spectrum slopes, broadly consistent with theory, however, this pattern was also influenced by the latitudinal temperature gradient. Tropical reefs showed a stronger relationship between community-level PPMRs and community size spectrum slopes than temperate reefs. The extent that these patterns apply outside Australia and consequences for community structure and dynamics are key areas for future investigation.

AB  - Recently, the survival of Mycobacterium bovis on livestock mineral blocks has been confirmed, but little is known about its implication in the transmission of animal tuberculosis (TB) under field conditions. The objective of this study was to describe the shared use of mineral supplements in four extensive beef cattle farms from a high TB prevalence area in South Central Spain, to identify the main factors explaining their use, and characterize its potential role for the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTC). This is relevant to design control measures at the wildlife-livestock interface. Animal activity was monitored by camera-trapping at 12 mineral supplementation points during spring and fall. Additionally, swabs were periodically taken from the mineral substrates and analyzed by PCR searching for MTC DNA. Cattle, pig, goat, sheep, wild boar, and red deer were all recorded licking on mineral supplementation points. Livestock species were the main users and presented a diurnal use pattern. Wild ungulates presented a nocturnal-crepuscular use pattern, with scarce overlapping with livestock. Wild boar presence was positively related to cattle presence at mineral supplementation points, whereas red deer presence was higher in supplemental points closer to forested areas and in farms without hunting pressure. We recorded 266 indirect wildlife-livestock interactions (i.e., two consecutive visits that occurred within 78 h), all of them derived from 21 unique wildlife visits. All the analyzed swabs resulted negative to MTC DNA. Comparing to other environmental sources of MTC in our study area, mainly water ponds, this research evidenced that mineral blocks are less attractive to wildlife. However, the potential for interspecific transmission of MTC or other pathogens cannot be discarded. The risk for interaction at mineral supplementation points and further transmission can be prevented by implementing specific measures in the context of integral biosecurity plans at the wildlife-livestock interface, which are proposed.

AB  - Foundation species are spatially dominant species that increase habitat complexity and provide substrate and shelter for many smaller species. Through a mensurative field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that functional aspects of the associated communities are related to structural and functional properties of the foundation species. Specifically, we contrasted invertebrate communities living in mussel (Mytilus) and seaweed (Chondrus) stands from the same rocky intertidal environments in Atlantic Canada. Both stands reach similar heights above the substrate, but they differ structurally (rigid mussel shells vs. flexible seaweed fronds) and functionally (mussels generate biowaste while seaweeds offer food for herbivores). Our data supported the hypothesis in various ways. Detritivory (mostly by oligochaetes) was more prevalent in mussel stands, while herbivory was more prevalent in seaweed stands. Predators were mostly mites and, consequently, they were more prevalent in mussel stands, as mites eat oligochaetes. Functional traits related to body and mobility types were also related to properties of the foundation species. Overall, we conclude that structural and functional properties of foundation species can predict functional aspects of the associated communities. This concept may help to develop effective restoration strategies after the loss of foundation species due to anthropogenic factors.

AB  - The caudal epididymal recovery of spermatozoa has been utilised in game animal species to preserve genetically superior material after trophy hunting or slaughter, due to the difficulties of handling wild animals. Furthermore, the potential application of assisted reproductive techniques using harvested spermatozoa may contribute towards maintaining genetic diversity in isolated captive populations internationally. However, this technique requires clear and ideally simple protocols for the collection and handling of gametes after the death of the male animals, as the point of harvest is usually remote in game ranching. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the effects of time after harvesting sperm under basic field conditions from the caudal epididymides of farmed common eland bulls in terms of their sperm motility and morphological changes. The relationship among these sperm quality parameters was also explored. Six bulls (2-2.5 years old; 203 +/- 20 kg) were slaughtered, and their epididymal sperm were harvested and assessed for sperm motility and kinematics at minutes 0, 35, 70, 100, together with sperm viability, sperm head morphometry, and morphology at minutes 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 using CASA. Sperm quality sharply declined after 35 minutes of slaughter, but no effects were seen in sperm head morphometry. This study brings the first information regarding the quality of sperm retrieval from the cauda epididymides and sperm quality under physiological conditions in a uniform age group of eland. Future work should consider the effect of animal age and other individual animal traits, as well as the use of various media and extenders.

AB  - Large mammals in temperate climates typically display seasonal patterns of habitat use. However, these patterns are often overlooked because large mammals are usually surveyed at annual intervals. In addition, most studies focus on a single species and ignore other species with which the focal species could interact. Knowing seasonal patterns of habitat use in multiple species and understanding factors that cause these patterns can provide further detail on population dynamics and guide effective conservation planning. Here, using dynamic occupancy modeling, we analyze 11 years of camera-trap data collected in northwestern Anatolia, Turkey, to investigate seasonal habitat use of 8 large-mammal species: Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx), Gray Wolf (Canis lupus), Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus), European Hare (Lepus europaeus), and Red Deer (Cervus elaphus). For each species, we study the strength of seasonality in habitat use and its dependence on human population density and elevation, which have been shown to affect distributions of species in the region. Although all species exhibited seasonality in habitat use, the strength of this seasonality varied among species; it was strongest in Wild Boar, Roe Deer, and Brown Bear. Moreover, except for Brown Bear, all species tended to avoid sites close to humans. The species responded differently to changing elevation; increasing elevation had both positive and negative effects on species-specific colonization and desertion probabilities, and these effects were likely related to either feeding habits or tendency to avoid humans. These results indicate that seasonality should be taken into consideration in population studies. However, because species differ, seasonality patterns should be identified separately for each species of interest, as differences in these patterns can explain the underlying dynamics of habitat-use patterns more accurately.
   How does environmental seasonality affect habitat use of 8 large-mammal species in northwestern Anatolia, Turkey? We show that the strength of seasonality in habitat use varies among the species. These variations have direct implications for conservation.

AB  - Bycatch, the incidental capture of non-target species in fishing gear, has been recognised as the most significant global conservation threat affecting seabird species. Geographically, bycatch rates vary widely, depending on local fishing efforts, environmental features, and seabird community composition. Regional and local research is essential due to the complexity of accurately extrapolating general conclusions regarding the impacts of bycatch. Existing European bycatch research predominantly focuses on northern regions, leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea. This work presents findings of wintering diving seabirds as bycatch of small-scale fisheries in a coastal area of the northern Adriatic Sea, based on data collected between 2021 and 2023. Seabird distribution varied along the depth profile. The bathymetric range between 3 m and 5 m was the most exploited by fishermen. Bycatch of seabirds was confirmed in the study area, with five species recorded, i.e. Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis, Red-throated Loon Gavia stellata, Black-throated Loon Gavia arctica, Mediterranean Shag Gulosus aristotelis desmarestii, and Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus. Our results suggest that bathymetry likely plays a strong influence on bycatch occurrence. Incidental captures were not widespread but appeared concentrated in the shallowest depths <5 m and the range <2.5 m was identified as particularly susceptible due to the low associated fishing effort and the majority of bycatch events recorded. We estimate that between 46 and 108 birds were incidentally captured during the research period. This study identifies key factors shaping the areas of bycatch vulnerability and risk, proposing a spatial-temporal mitigation framework within Natura 2000 sites and highlighting the value of local stakeholders' engagement.

AB  - The nitrogen and carbon cycles are fundamental ecosystem processes influenced by several factors including soil type and other abiotic factors, plant species, grazing and soil organisms. Herbivores profoundly influence the functioning of ecosystems and the recycling of nutrients in interaction with plants in natural ecosystems. This study focuses on the effects of livestock on carbon and nitrogen cycling in a grazed savanna in Burkina Faso. Dominant grass species (aerial and root parts) and soil samples were collected under grasses and bare soil patches in 48 plots (24 protected and 24 unprotected plots), 18 months after setting up herbivores exclosures. Soil and grass C-13 and N-15 were used as integrative indicators of carbon and nitrogen cycles. The results revealed no significant effect of livestock on soil total carbon and nitrogen and on soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Moreover, grazing had no significant effect on grass carbon and delta C-13, while it significantly increased grass total nitrogen and delta N-15. Therefore, our hypothesis that grazing would increase soil C-13 and N-15 values and plant biomass was only verified for grass N-15. Grass delta N-15 results suggest that grazing improves the immediate availability of nitrogen but could also increase nitrogen losses.

AB  - ContextThermal conditions can influence animal behavior and predator-prey dynamics. Understanding the effects of temperature on animals and their interactions is of increasing importance given predictions for global warming.ObjectivesWe determined how temperature influenced avoidance of risky areas and habitat selection in a climate generalist, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter "deer"), and how the effect varied between night and day in a system characterized by extreme heat and high predation risk from Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).MethodsWe collected GPS locations of 224 (79 M, 145F) deer from June through September 2015-2018 in southwestern Florida, USA. We fit step-selection functions with interactions between ambient temperature and covariates including landcover and a spatial model of predation risk informed by panther kill sites.ResultsAvoidance of high-risk areas decreased with rising temperatures during night and day, indicating deer were less predation risk averse when balancing higher thermoregulatory costs. As temperatures increased during the day, deer increased avoidance of marshes and hardwood hammocks. However, temperature had weaker effects on habitat selection at night with only a moderate increase in selection of marshes with increasing temperatures.ConclusionsIn systems characterized by extreme heat, thermal conditions can have strong effects on animal behavior and species interactions. While climate generalists like deer have high tolerances to thermal stress, temperature still influenced predation risk tolerance and habitat selection of deer during both day and night periods. These responses are likely even stronger in species with narrower thermal tolerances (i.e., climate specialists). Thermal conditions are an important and potentially underappreciated driver of species interactions that is likely to become more significant with climate change.

AB  - Elevated rates of anthropogenic impacts on land-use regimes have pushed terrestrial megafauna to the brink of extinction. Consequently, it is critical to adopt conservation approaches that safeguard individual populations while retaining connectivity among these populations. Conserving spatially structured populations of imperiled species at large scales is often complex; and the past decades have therefore seen a rise in spatial conservation prioritization exercises aimed at shaping landscape-scale conservation programmes. We present a framework for informing nationwide connectivity conservation, linking ecological and administrative scales, to maximize relevance for management. We assessed connectivity of the endangered dhole Cuon alpinus among 155 potential source populations across India using a data-driven approach combined with graph and circuit theory. We used clustering algorithms to identify ecologically meaningful conservation landscapes; within each landscape, we identified priority source populations based on their connectedness and quantified pixel-specific habitat accessibility. We superimposed administrative boundaries on our findings to provide conservation recommendations at this management-relevant scale. We first mapped potential dhole movement across India. Dhole populations fell within three primary clusters-Western and Eastern Ghats (WEG), Central Indian Landscape (CIL) and North-East India (NEI)-of which NEI had the highest forest cover, most diffuse connectivity and lowest human density, while WEG had the highest protected area coverage and overall connectedness. Within each conservation landscape, we evaluated the relative importance of Protected Areas and accessibility to high-quality patches. Parts of the Eastern Ghats had low habitat accessibility, yet high potential for dhole landscape connectivity. In 114 identified administrative units of priority for habitat restoration, we highlight those with low accessibility, that is, areas where restoration needs to be spatially targeted for maximum benefits. Synthesis and applications. We make recommendations for spatially informed habitat restoration to enhance dhole connectivity in India, highlighting the importance of improving matrix permeability where dhole movement is currently restricted. More broadly, the framework we present is useful across species and management contexts, as it combines spatial and administrative scales to make ecologically informed assessments of high relevance to management. Synergistically integrating species ecology, threats and administrative considerations in connectivity conservation plans can enhance success of species conservation programmes.

AB  - Conservation approaches that efficiently protect multiple values, such as the umbrella species concept, have been widely promoted with expected dramatic ecosystem changes. Due to its social and cultural importance, and recent declining trends, boreal populations of woodland caribou have been suggested as potential umbrella species for other declining taxa, such as boreal landbirds. We propose a generic pixel-based umbrella index that focuses on fine-grained habitat overlaps. In light of ongoing conservation efforts worldwide implementing area-based targets (e.g., 30% by 2030), we used a random neutral model as baseline, as opposed to a no-conservation scenario, which has been used elsewhere. We found that the conservation efficiency of caribou as an umbrella for 71 co-occurring landbirds-three of which are priority species-in the Northwest Territories, Canada, is generally lower than our random model, as 53% of the species presented negative umbrella index medians with the interquartile range not overlapping zero. We conclude that in cases where area-based targets drive decision-making and the issue at stake involves identifying which areas to conserve-not whether to conserve-woodland caribou may be a leaky umbrella for most co-occurring landbird species and these might need complementary conservation actions to be brought in from the rain.

AB  - Interspecific interactions can influence species' activity and movement patterns. In particular, species may avoid or attract each other through reactive responses in space and/or time. However, data and methods to study such reactive interactions have remained scarce and were generally limited to two interacting species. At this time, the deployment of camera traps opens new opportunities but adapted statistical techniques are still required to analyze interaction patterns with such data. We present the multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) and show how it can be used to analyze interactions between several species using camera trap data. Hawkes processes use flexible pairwise interaction functions, allowing us to consider asymmetries and variations over time when depicting reactive temporal interactions. After describing the theoretical foundations of the MHP, we outline how its framework can be used to study interspecific interactions with camera trap data. We design a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the MHP and of another existing method to infer interactions from camera trap-like data. We also use the MHP to infer reactive interactions from real camera trap data for five species from South African savannas (impala Aepyceros melampus, greater kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros, lion Panthera leo, blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Burchell's zebra Equus quagga burchelli). The simulation study shows that the MHP can be used as a tool to benchmark other methods of interspecific interaction inference and that this model can reliably infer interactions when enough data are considered. The analysis of real data highlights evidence of predator avoidance by prey and herbivore-herbivore attraction. Lastly, we present the advantages and limits of the MHP and discuss how it can be improved to infer attraction/avoidance patterns more reliably. As camera traps are increasingly used, the multivariate Hawkes process provides a promising framework to decipher the complexity of interactions structuring ecological communities.

AB  - The global climate and biodiversity crisis has led to extensive restoration initiatives, calling for cost-effective strategies harnessing the potential of natural processes. Natural colonization of target species is a key process in the scaling up of woodland restoration, and effective planning and implementation of restoration strategies requires a mechanistic understanding of colonization processes. In this study, we investigated patterns and processes of natural colonization of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), the only native woodland-forming tree species in Iceland, into adjacent treeless lands under diverse conditions, and its implications for low-intensity restoration strategies. Accordingly, we assessed spatial patterns of seedling densities on transects extending from 10 birch woodlands in Iceland and analyzed the impact of local environments on colonization dynamics. Seedling densities generally decreased rapidly with distance from the seed source to around 40 m. In many study areas, however, birch seedlings were registered at high enough densities to potentially form woodlands, up to 140 m from a standing seed source. We identified a range of biotic and abiotic determinants of colonization, with the largest number affecting the early-establishment phase of birch colonization, including safe site availability, wind speed and dominant direction, and grazing. Our results demonstrate a good potential for natural colonization as a restoration strategy for birch woodlands in subarctic environments, and they can furthermore be used to identify areas where birch colonization is likely to occur naturally and determine appropriate interventions that can facilitate birch colonization in areas where it is less likely.

AB  - Understanding animal distribution is important for management of populations and their habitats. Across the western United States, elk (Cervus canadensis) provide important ecological, cultural, and economic benefits and the sound management of their habitats is of vital importance. In western Montana, National Forest lands are managed in part to provide and protect elk habitat needs, and summer elk habitat is managed with consideration to motorized routes. We evaluated the relative importance of nutritional resources, access routes, and other landscape attributes on elk summer resource selection at multiple spatial scales, and compared resource selection among nine different southwestern Montana elk populations to determine the applicability of generalized regional models for informing habitat management recommendations. First, we developed nine population-specific and two regional summer resource selection models. Second, we evaluated the predictive performance of each model within and among elk populations using cross-validation scores to identify the best model. We found that in all populations nutritional resources, best represented using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics, were the most important factors associated with elk summer resource selection. Access routes affected resource selection in all populations; however, the influence of access routes was relatively modest as compared with nutritional resources. Of the access route covariates we considered, density of all routes (i.e., routes open and closed to motorized use) explained most variation in summer elk resource selection. Validation of population-specific resource selection models among populations revealed that in many cases model predictions extrapolated to areas outside of the development area had modest to poor predictive performance, especially as distance from the modeled population increased. Thus, caution should be used when extrapolating resource selection models based on a single study population to other populations. Regional models of resource selection predicted resource selection across populations better than population-specific models, particularly when constructed by pooling data from multiple populations, and we recommend these types of models be used to inform regional habitat management policies. Our results suggest that managers should expand any current management paradigm for elk summer habitat that is focused on limiting access route density to also consider nutritional resources as an important component of elk summer habitat.

AB  - What would successful deer management look like in Scotland? To some, flourishing populations of native wild deer represent success. But to others, negative impacts such as damage to woodlands and peatlands, agricultural and forestry losses, deer-vehicle collisions, and facilitating Lyme disease spread represent failure. Conflicting interests and incentives among people involved in deer management mean a common definition of success, and therefore clear management targets, remain elusive. While some environmental groups urgently call for an increase in the number of deer culled (shot) each year, other stakeholders aim to maximize deer numbers. Overcoming this governance failure will require clearly articulated, scientifically valid, and socially acceptable socio-ecological objectives to be co-produced by a broad range of stakeholders. Systematic monitoring of deer impacts will also be needed to evaluate the ability of specific management interventions to achieve defined objectives. Reintroducing Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) has been suggested as a means to reduce deer numbers and their negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts. However, evidence of lynx impacts on deer numbers, deer impacts, and social conflicts over deer suggest lynx reintroduction alone would not effectively reduce negative impacts of deer in Scotland, though it could be part of a broader solution. In the short-term, achieving sustainable numbers of deer in Scotland will require a substantial increase in the number of deer culled and effective changes to the way deer management is incentivized, regulated, implemented, and monitored.

AB  - Despite the availability of more and more data on Arctic biotic communities, even the principal course of their transformation remains unclear. Differences in the population dynamics of geese, lemmings, and ruminants covering more than 98% of the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem recycling and competing for common trophic resources on the basis of specialization are of great interest. Comparing 15 species of the taxa, we showed that grades of their morphophysiological adaptation to phytophagy are matched to empirical estimates of their food selectivity, thereby describing their trophic specialization distribution. Thus, in the Arctic herbivore communities, the selectivity distribution is just as stable as specialization. Populations of trophic specialists in these communities, the most glaring examples of which are the muskox and the snow goose, generally exceed in size and/or growth rate the populations of generalists, which include lemmings and the smallest black geese. The specialist populations have mainly higher size and/or growth rate than the generalist populations. It may be concluded that interspecific competition influences the contemporary transformation of the Arctic herbivore communities much more strongly than environmental factors such as global warming and human activity do.

AB  - Litter decomposition plays a critical role in the nutrient cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. According to the homefield advantage (HFA) hypothesis, litter decomposes more rapidly in its home habitat (where it originates) compared to other habitats (referred to as away). Although this hypothesis has been widely tested in natural forests, it remains controversial and lacks support for plantations, especially in dry ecosystems where microbial activities are limited. To clarify it, the present study investigated litter mass loss, nutrient dynamics, and decomposer communities in a 549-day reciprocal transplant experiment of litter decomposition in Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) and Hippophae rhamnoides (HR) pure plantations and their mixed plantations (5:5 and 8:2 ratios) on the Loess Plateau, China. The rate of mass, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss in litter differed depending on litter type of species component and plantation type they were placed in. HR litter lost mass and released C, N, and P fastest, irrespective of plantation type. The overall mass loss of the four litter types were the fastest under 5:5 mixed plantations. However, litter did not decompose more rapidly in its home soil compared to the away soil. The structural equation modeling revealed that initial litter quality played a significant role in regulating the loss of C and N across decomposition stages, while the climate variations and microbial chemistry also contributed to the process. The similarity in soil microbial communities across plantation types, along with the limited interaction between litter and microbes in arid environments, could help elucidate the lack of HFA, with other factors such as the litter type exerting a minor influence. In summary, this study does not substantiate the hypothesis of home-field advantage but supports its context-dependency. Thus, regional heterogeneity should be taken into account when predicting the carbon cycle of forest ecosystems in future studies.

AB  - Our knowledge of sawfishes remains scant for Latin America. Pristis pristis (largetooth sawfish) and Pristis pectinata (smalltooth sawfish) are critically endangered. In the Yucatan Peninsula (YP), P. pristis and P. pectinata inhabit coastal landscapes.A total of 290 surveys of fishers' local ecological knowledge (LEK), including a geospatial component, were collected; 74 literature sources and available archaeological data for the region were reviewed.Interdisciplinary results show the following: the common past presence of sawfishes, their cultural significance for coastal societies, and the contemporary absence of sawfishes in coastal areas where they existed historically; sightings of juveniles were only documented by elder fishers, and only two recent narratives mention sawfishes caught incidentally 5 years ago.Geospatial results provide evidence for 52 geographic sites where sawfishes were common in the YP.Results support the development of research methodologies to study human-nature interactions integrating LEK. This matters in the YP, where sociocultural values and landscapes have changed rapidly through increasing tourism development and human overcrowding.The results can help conservation managers understand the past presence and contemporary loss of sawfishes, and their habitat, and contribute to understanding the defaunation of megafauna in the YP through time. This is critical for tourism and fishery ecosystem services on which communities of the YP rely for their economies.

AB  - Mangrove-saltmarsh ecotones are experiencing rapid alterations due to climate change and human activities, however, the ecological and morphological implications of these shifts remain largely unknown. This study systematically explores how interspecific interactions and herbivory influence the dominant wetland species, as well as the resultant morphological evolution and landscape configuration. To achieve this, we develop a new eco-morphodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamics, sediment transport, bed-level change, and vegetation dynamics. The novelty of the current model lies in newly incorporated modules to simulate biotic interactions between mangroves and saltmarshes, enabling exploration of eco-morphodynamic feedback in mangrove-saltmarsh ecotones in response to tidal flows and species interactions. Our results show that vertical growth rates of coexisting vegetation species are dominant factors in determining wetland dominance. When mangroves and saltmarshes exhibit comparable growth rates, mangroves typically become the dominant wetland species. Conversely, if mangroves grow more slowly than saltmarshes, they are unable to outcompete saltmarshes. Additionally, herbivory can fundamentally alter wetland dominance depending on herbivore food preferences. Our simulations further underline that saltmarsh-dominated wetlands develop channel networks more extensively and rapidly than mangrove-dominated systems. This pattern is also observed during species invasions, with invading saltmarshes extending channel networks, while invading mangroves inhibit ongoing network expansion. This study highlights the pivotal roles of relative growth properties and herbivory in driving ecotone development in respect to wetland dominance and channel network development at the intertidal scale.
   In coastal areas where mangrove trees and saltmarsh grasses exist together, climate change and human activities significantly impact wetland development. This study uses a novel computer model to explore how different plants interact, how plant-eating animals influence plant distribution and how these factors affect the shape of coastal landscapes. Our findings reveal that mangrove trees with growth rates similar to saltmarsh grasses can outcompete saltmarshes and become the dominant wetland species. Additionally, animals that eat plants play a crucial role in determining which plants survive, with their effects highly dependent on their feeding preferences. Wetlands dominated by saltmarshes tend to develop deeper channels. This occurs because saltmarshes spread slowly and grow in patches, which changes water flow and promotes erosion in areas without vegetation. Conversely, wetlands where mangroves are taking over typically feature fewer and shallower channels. Overall, our study suggests that the growth rates of different plants and the presence of plant-eating animals are essential in shaping these coastal environments.
   A new eco-morphodynamic model is developed accounting for facilitation, competition and predation in mangrove-saltmarsh ecotones Ecotone dynamics at intertidal scale are determined by herbivory and the relative growth properties between mangroves and saltmarshes Tidal networks in saltmarsh-dominant ecotones are formed more rapidly and extensively with deeper channels

AB  - In many invaded grasslands, dominant exotic species can produce large amounts of litter that modify local abiotic conditions and species' interactions. These novel conditions can reduce native species abundance and promote the persistence of exotic species, yet the strength of this disparity may be influenced by how consumer pressure interacts with litter accumulation. Consumers may exacerbate this disparity by preferentially targeting native species or by promoting heterogeneity in microhabitats due to their movement and small-scale ground disturbances that favours fast growing exotic species. How species respond to litter accumulation and consumer pressure may depend on either evolutionary differences, whereby exotics species may benefit from a lack natural predators, or by functional differences, in which species' physiological traits may confer fitness advantages to low-light conditions or herbivory or granivory pressure. We examined the impact of litter presence and small mammal herbivory on the establishment and reproduction of functionally diverse exotic versus native species seeded across sites that naturally vary in resource availability in an annual invaded California grassland. We assessed whether seed mass and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) were predictive of successful establishment and reproduction. Litter accumulation affected exotic and native species differently, with litter significantly decreasing native recruitment and reproduction, while exotics were largely unaffected. Small mammals had a slight positive effect on the establishment of native species when litter was present but did not influence exotic species. Regardless of species provenance, larger seeded species established at a higher density while species with lower leaf nitrogen content had a higher density of reproductive individuals. Native species that successfully established and reproduced were functionally different in LNC than the resident community, while successful exotic species were functionally more similar to the resident community in LNC. Our study demonstrates that exotic species outperformed native species regardless of the presence of litter or herbivory pressure. Without the removal or thinning of litter, it is likely that exotic species will continue to dominate, resulting in positive feedback that further favours the persistence of exotic species within this invaded grassland system.

AB  - Coral reefs worldwide are exposed to increased levels of thermal stress due to global warming. A coral reef at the remote island of Kapou (Lisianski) in Papaha over bar naumokua over bar kea experienced an unprecedented level of heat stress in 2014, which resulted in coral bleaching and subsequent mass mortality that resulted in nearly 100 % loss of live coral cover. Here, we describe successional changes in benthic communities occurring on the reef from 2014 to 2021 based on our surveys utilizing underwater photogrammetric techniques. Despite having > 85 % Montipora live coral cover before the bleaching event, the newly available substrata created by the loss of coral were quickly colonized by the green macroalga Halimeda, along with an ephemeral bloom of the green macroalga Boodlea in 2016. While Halimeda continued to increase in benthic cover, other algae (Neomeris, Asparagopsis and uniden-tified filamentous red and green algae) also started colonizing the reef between 2017 and 2021. Erosion of the reef substrata was evident in both in-situ and three-dimensional surveys in 2015 following the bleaching event and has continued to progress through time. The high abundance of Halimeda may indicate a slow process of coral recovery, but the overall benthic diversity increased in 2021 due to the presence of other algae and an increase in hard substrata and turf algal cover. New colonies of Montipora coral were also observed during annual surveys following the bleaching-induced mortality. Future monitoring efforts should continue to track coral and algal communities and survey herbivorous fish and reef binders that play important ecological roles in algal control, reef erosion and sediment binding. Such efforts should reveal interactions among these different ecological processes that enable reef succession following mass coral mortality.

AB  - Temporal autocorrelation in environmental conditions influences population dynamics through its effects on vital rates. However, a comprehensive understanding of how and to what extent temporal autocorrelation shapes population dynamics is still lacking because most empirical studies have unrealistically assumed that environmental conditions are temporally independent. Mast seeding is a biological event characterized by highly fluctuating and synchronized seed production at the tree population scale as well as a marked negative temporal autocorrelation. In the current context of global change, mast seeding events are expected to become more frequent, leading to strengthened negative temporal autocorrelations and thereby amplified cyclicality in mast seeding dynamics. Theory predicts that population growth rates are maximized when the environmental cyclicality of consumer resources and their generation times are closely matched. To test this prediction, we took advantage of the long-term monitoring of a wild boar population, a widespread seed consumer species characterized by a short generation time (similar to 2 years). As expected, simulations indicated that its stochastic population growth rate increased as mast seeding dynamics became more negatively autocorrelated. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for temporal autocorrelations in environmental conditions relative to the generation time of the focal population is required, especially under conditions of global warming, where the cyclicality in resource dynamics is likely to change.

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of seasonal heat stress on the physiological, behavioural and blood bio-chemical profile of adult Ghoongroo pigs (1.5-2 years of age) of different physiological groups. Thirty Ghoongroo pigs (10 boars, 10 non-pregnant sows and 10 pregnant sows) were allotted to individual pens. The study continued for 1 year covering three main seasons, i.e. summer (March-June), rainy (July-October) and winter (November-February) season. Temperature humidity index was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in summer (83.2 +/- 0.47) followed by rainy (68.5 +/- 1.13) and winter (66.8 +/- 0.67) seasons, which indicated that pigs were exposed to heat stress during summer Rectal temperature and pulse rate were not affected by group x season interaction but were affected by group (P = 0.002) and season (P < 0.001), which were usually greater during summer than during winter and in boars than in pregnant sows. Respiration rate was affected by group x season interaction (P = 0.002), which was greater in boars than in non-pregnant and pregnant sows during summer and rainy season but was similar in winter among the groups. Total erythrocytes, leucocytes counts, and cortisol levels were influenced by group (P < 0.001), season (P < 0.001) and group x season interaction (P < 0.001), which increased in summer compared with winter. Sodium and potassium concentrations in serum were not affected by group and group x season interaction but were affected by season (P < 0.001), which were lower in summer than in winter. All behaviour activities (standing, resting and roaming time, urination, fighting and drinking frequency) were affected by group (P < 0.001), season (P < 0.001) and group x season interaction (P < 0.001), except eating time that was only influenced by season. The present study suggested that Ghoongroo pigs experienced heat stress during summer, which was reflected in physiological, blood-biochemical and behavioural alterations.

AB  - Fish communities in the shallow waters (9-20 m depth) of outer Malangen (69 degrees N), Northern Norway was studied to investigate effects of season, bottom substrate associations and population dynamic parameters on the fish assemblages. In four fieldtrips during one year at four locations, fish were sampled by trammel nets and bottom substrate composition was monitored by underwater video. A total of 16 species of fish were caught, including four species from Pleuronectidae and six from the Gadidae family. Cod (Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758) was the most numerous species followed by plaice (Pleuronectes platessa Linnaeus, 1758), lemon sole (Microstomus kitt Walbaum, 1792) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus Linnaeus, 1758). Cod dominated the catches in all months except March, in which plaice and other flatfishes were most dominant. On a community scale, fish species richness was highest in October and lowest in March. Furthermore, the species richness and diversity were generally higher at locations with greater bottom substrate evenness. Cod showed a positive association with large macroalgae coverage and were less numerous at locations dominated by sand and pebble. Plaice and common dab (Limanda limanda Linnaeus, 1758) showed positive associations with sand and pebble coverage, while lemon sole was more associated with maerl beds, cobble and low algae coverage. Only halibut younger than 8 years of age were observed, and the sampling areas are suggested to be nursery area for this species. Von Bertalanffy growth functions were estimated for cod, plaice and lemon sole, and the growth coefficient K of cod and plaice were higher than for populations from adjacent fjords or the North Sea populations. Total mortality rates of cod and plaice were lower than for areas further south, and this may contribute to high and relative stable biomasses in the shallow Malangen area.

AB  - In the current study, different geochemical and biological proxies, including pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, ostracods and molluscs, from an AMS radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Lake Ochaul (54 degrees 14 ' N, 106 degrees 28 ' E; 641 m a.s.l.) are presented and discussed. Ochaul is a fresh-water lake and an archaeological site situated ca. 100 km northwest of Lake Baikal in the upper reaches of the Lena River. The 260-cm-long sedimentary record presented here spans the Lateglacial-Holocene interval, between ca. 13,500 cal yr BP and the present. The reconstructions of the postglacial vegetation and lake system development are discussed along with the regional climate dynamics and the hemispheric-scale environmental changes. During the Allerod interstadial the region around Lake Ochaul was dominated by sparse taiga forests. Cooling during the Younger Dryas led to a more open tundra landscape where trees formed patchy forest stands in climatically favourable environments. This facilitated a rapid spread of forests at the onset of the Early Holocene during which the study region was probably characterized by seasonally dry climate controlled by the interplay of higher insolation, lower global sea levels and remaining ice sheets in the North Atlantic region. After thermal and moisture optimum conditions and a maximum spread of forests during the Middle Holocene, continuous cooling and a trend to more open forests landscapes marked the Late Holocene. These long-term trends were interrupted by several relatively short episodes of change in the vegetation and algal records, which coincide with short-term (centennial-scale) Northern Hemisphere cooling/drying phases. This shows that the regional vegetation reacted sensitively to these climate oscillations. Six AMS radiocarbon dates of bone material of large herbivorous animals from the Ochaul archaeological site located at the northern shore of the lake provide important information about prehistoric hunter-gatherers and indicate that activities at the site took place at ca. 27,780-27,160 cal yr BP (95% probability range) as well as during the Mesolithic (ca. 8850-8450 cal yr BP), Early, Middle and Late Neolithic (between ca. 6840 and 5490 cal yr BP) and the Iron Age (ca. 2120-1930 cal yr BP). Our results demonstrate that despite major environmental transformations following the Last Glacial Maximum, Lake Ochaul and the Malaya Anga River valley remained attractive for large herbivores and for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, even during the Middle Neolithic cultural "hiatus" (ca. 6660-6060 cal yr BP) in Cis-Baikal, as documented by the published archaeological records.

AB  - International and national conservation policies almost exclusively focus on conserving species in their historic native ranges, thus excluding species that have been introduced by people and some of those that have extended their ranges on their own accord. Given that many of such migrants are threatened in their native ranges, conservation goals that explicitly exclude these populations may overlook opportunities to prevent extinctions and respond dynamically to rapidly changing environmental and climatic conditions. Focusing on terrestrial mammals, we quantified the number of threatened mammals that have established new populations through assisted migration (i.e., introduction). We devised 4 alternative scenarios for the inclusion of assisted-migrant populations in mainstream conservation policy with the aim of preventing global species extinctions. We then used spatial prioritization algorithms to simulate how these scenarios could change global spatial conservation priorities. We found that 22% (70 species out of 265) of all identified assisted-migrant mammals were threatened in their native ranges, mirroring the 25% of all mammals that are threatened. Reassessing global threat statuses by combining native and migrant ranges reduced the threat status of 23 species (similar to 33% of threatened assisted migrants). Thus, including migrant populations in threat assessments provides a more accurate assessment of actual global extinction risk among species. Spatial prioritization simulations showed that reimagining the role of assisted-migrant populations in preventing species extinction could increase the importance of overlooked landscapes, particularly in central Australia, Europe, and the southwestern United States. Our results indicated that these various and nonexhaustive ways to consider assisted-migrant populations, with due consideration of potential conservation conflicts with resident taxa, may provide unprecedented opportunities to prevent species extinctions.
   Prevencion de la extincion en una epoca de migracion de especies y cambios planetarios Las politicas de conservacion nacionales e internacionales casi siempre se enfocan en la conservacion de las especies dentro de su distribucion historica y nativa, por lo que se excluyen especies que han sido introducidas por el humano y algunas que se han extendido por cuenta propia mas alla de su distribucion.

AB  - Ungulates in higher latitudes and altitudes experience sharp seasonal changes in forage abundance and quality. In response, ungulates show varying degrees of synchrony in reproduction. Diet type has been hypothesized to be a determinant of differences in reproductive synchrony. Analyses at global scales using proxies of plant phenology such as climate, latitude and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have found no evidence in support because such proxies do not capture differences in phenology among plant taxa at local scales. We compared seasonal variations in diet quality with reproductive synchrony in the Himalayan musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), a browser, and the Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral), a grazer, in mid-altitude Himalaya. We also compared seasonal variations in physiological stress using fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM). We identified different stages of female reproductive cycle using fecal concentrations of metabolites of estradiol, pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG) and testosterone and used fecal crude protein (CP) as an indicator of diet quality. In musk deer, fecal estradiol and PdG concentrations showed a dispersed estrous and parturition, respectively. Goral had a more synchronized estrous and parturition. Estrous cycles in both species occurred when diet quality was poor, but parturition occurred when diet quality was high. Greater seasonality in reproduction in goral is driven by sharp phenological changes in graminoids on which it feeds, compared to slow changes in browse on which musk deer feeds. Thus, we show that diet type drives the differences in reproductive synchrony in these two sympatric species. Spring and summer with highest diet quality were times of highest stress in both the ungulates. We hypothesize predation pressure from feral dogs and resource competition with livestock as plausible explanations for this, which need to be tested in future. Our findings also highlight the need for studying relationships among plant phenology, diet type and reproductive biology of ungulates at local scales if we are to understand species responses to global phenomena such as climate change.

AB  - . The Island of Santa Catarina is the largest island on the Brazilian coast. Within the Atlantic Forest domain, it serves as a model for investigating the decline in biodiversity within this ecosystem. This decline is associated with the loss of a large part of forest cover and mammalian species. Although the forest environment in the island has recovered more in comparison to the rest of the Atlantic Rainforest (66% versus 28%, respectively), the isolation typical of islands has hindered the recolonization of sensitive species, particularly those that are threatened. Two decades after the first publication of the mammal list of the Island of Santa Catarina, we revised past data to identify which species became extinct and which native and exotic species remain, focusing on the inclusion of Chiroptera. Through bibliographical reviews, scientific collections and field surveys, a total of 59 species of native mammals, non-volant and volants, were confirmed. Among these, eight species were determined to be extirpated, all threatened with extinction, including large ungulates and top cats, in addition to the occurrence of nine domestic and exotic invasive species. Studies employing specific methodologies and sampling techniques in inadequately assessed environments have the potential to augment species richness, particularly among rodents, marsupials, and bats.

AB  - The importance of ocean currents in influencing the connectivity and dispersal of marine megafauna, including sea turtles, is becoming increasingly recognized. However, more comprehensive studies are needed on how these currents impact the genetic makeup and connectivity of green turtle Chelonia mydas (Linnaeus, 1758) populations in the Pacific Islands region. To address this gap, our study conducted genetic analyses of green turtles in foraging grounds from four Micronesian sites and predictive modelling of hatchling dispersal patterns based on ocean currents to explore connectivity between foraging grounds and rookeries across Micronesia. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype frequencies from newly collected and published data. We used Bayesian mixed stock analysis (MSA) to estimate the relative proportion of turtles from different Management Units (MUs) within the foraging grounds. Our ocean current simulations predicted hatchling dispersal trajectories, revealing how passive drift may facilitate wide-ranging dispersal and connectivity among distant foraging and nesting sites. Across the four Micronesian foraging grounds, the MSA revealed varying contributions from different rookeries, with some turtles exhibiting rare, long-distance dispersal traits. Our study highlights the intricate relationship between oceanic currents and the spatial dynamics of green turtles across the Pacific. Our findings offer essential insights into the conservation and management of green turtles by highlighting the role of oceanic currents in shaping population connectivity. Future research should focus on expanding genetic analyses and refining ocean drift simulations to enhance our understanding of marine megafauna migration and inform regional conservation strategies effectively.

AB  - Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are the main vectors of livestock diseases such as bluetongue (BT) which mainly affect sheep and cattle. In Spain, bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by several Culicoides taxa, including Culicoides imicola, Obsoletus complex, Culicoides newsteadi and Culicoides pulicaris that vary in seasonality and distribution, affecting the distribution and dynamics of BT outbreaks. Path analysis is useful for separating direct and indirect, biotic and abiotic determinants of species' population performance and is ideal for understanding the sensitivity of adult Culicoides dynamics to multiple environmental drivers. Start, end of season and length of overwintering of adult Culicoides were analysed across 329 sites in Spain sampled from 2005 to 2010 during the National Entomosurveillance Program for BTV with path analysis, to determine the direct and indirect effects of land use, climate and host factor variables. Culicoides taxa had species-specific responses to environmental variables. While the seasonality of adult C. imicola was strongly affected by topography, temperature, cover of agro-forestry and sclerophyllous vegetation, rainfall, livestock density, photoperiod in autumn and the abundance of Culicoides females, Obsoletus complex species seasonality was affected by land-use variables such as cover of natural grassland and broad-leaved forest. Culicoides female abundance was the most explanatory variable for the seasonality of C. newsteadi, while C. pulicaris showed that temperature during winter and the photoperiod in November had a strong effect on the start of the season and the length of overwinter period of this species. These results indicate that the seasonal vector-free period (SVFP) in Spain will vary between competent vector taxa and geographic locations, dependent on the different responses of each taxa to environmental conditions.

AB  - The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a vector of pathogens that cause diseases including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Lyme disease. It is a generalist vector feeding on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. The transmission cycles of these pathogens are affected by the tick's host selection because host species differ in their ability to clear, maintain, or amplify these pathogens. Several generalist parasites exhibit host-associated differentiation (HAD), a process that results in genetically distinct populations associated with different host species. Knowing whether I. scapularis exhibits HAD is important to better understand the ecology of these diseases. To test for HAD in I. scapularis, whole-genome resequencing was performed on ticks collected directly from six hosts in the southern United States (i.e., cotton mice [Cricetidae: Peromyscus gossypinus Le Conte], opossum [Didelphidae: Didelphis virginiana Kerr], raccoon [Procyonidae: Procyon lotor L.], gray fox [Canidae: Urocyon cinereoargenteus Schreber], wild boar or feral hog [Suidae: Sus scrofa L.], and white-tailed deer [Cervidae: Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann]). For the hosts tested, HAD was not found. However, it could not be ruled out if HAD is occurring for ticks associated with lizards in this study. The results of this study contrast with findings from another host generalist, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), that does exhibit HAD. Our results suggest that these two tick species differ in their propensity for HAD. One explanation could be that I. scapularis can mate off-host, maintaining panmixia, whereas D. variabilis mate only on the host. The lack of HAD in I. scapularis should be confirmed by sampling ticks from lizard and rodent hosts. These results will inform control efforts and the use of area-wide tick control strategies.

AB  - The lack of knowledge about the distributional patterns of threatened ungulates hinders the implementation of effective strategies for the conservation of their populations in Neotropical savannas. The Orinoquia is one of those ecoregions with limited data, poorly represented in the Colombian National System of Protected Areas. Nevertheless, the savannas of the Orinoquia serve as the habitat for 70% of the ungulate species reported in the country. The objective of our research was to identify the presence of the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and evaluate its representation in different land cover types and within Protected Areas (PAs) in the department of the Vichada. To accomplish this, we: (i) modeled the ecological niche of the lowland tapir using the MaxEnt algorithm, (ii) classified the potential distribution into three zones of habitat suitability, and (iii) assessed the representativeness of habitat suitability within the land cover of the savanna ecosystem and PAs. The suitable area for the lowland tapir was 134,575 km(2), with the most representative savanna landscapes being: (i) savannas (118,125 km(2), 87.8%) and (ii) evergreen broadleaf forests (12,550 km(2), 9.3%). Furthermore, (2,925 km(2), 2.2%) of the suitable area was reported within of the Natural Reserves of Civil Society. Our results highlight the ecological importance of private conservation initiatives as a complementary strategy to government PAs as well as contributing to functional connectivity on the regional scale. We provide information on the spatial ecology of the lowland tapir as an input for conservation practitioners and land planning in the savanna of eastern Colombia.

AB  - The functional extinction of the herbivorous sea urchin Diadema antillarum in the 1980s has contributed to the degradation of Caribbean coral reefs. In the early 2000s, recovering populations of D. antillarum were observed in several locations with mixed consequences for coral recruitment: D. antillarum improved habitat quality for settling coral larvae and recruits, but also contributed to settler mortality through (incidental) predation. To determine the relative importance of both mechanisms, tiles were deployed in the absence and presence of naturally occurring D. antillarum aggregations (2.0-2.8 sea urchins m(-2)) in Cura & ccedil;ao, after which benthic community composition, ex situ settlement, and long-term (2.5 yr) in situ post-settlement survival of Acropora palmata larvae were quantified. After 3 mo, the presence of D. antillarum resulted in 44% more crustose coralline algae and 52% less turf algae, and a 75% canopy height reduction on the tiles' exposed habitats. On the cryptic undersides of the tiles, the presence of D. antillarum was linked to lower abundances of sessile invertebrates and macroalgae. Larval settlement was almost 2 times higher on tiles conditioned in the presence of D. antillarum, with a strong preference (>70%) for the cryptic sides of tiles. Settlers returned to areas of reef encompassing D. antillarum populations were twice as likely to survive to the age of 2.5 yr. These findings support the beneficial role of D. antillarum in promoting coral recruitment by creating preferred settlement habitat and by increasing settler survival, and could be leveraged to improve coral restoration practices through dual-species conservation and/or co-culture strategies.

AB  - Wild ungulates are a major consumer of agricultural crops in human dominated landscapes. Across Europe, ungulate populations are leading to intensified human-wildlife conflicts. At the same time, ungulates play a vital role in the structuring and functioning of ecosystems, and are highly appreciated for recreational hunting. Thus, managers often face the challenge of maintaining the benefits of having thriving ungulate populations while simultaneously minimizing their negative impacts. Broadcasting playbacks of predator vocalizations (e.g. dogs barking, wolves howling or humans talking) could potentially be used to induce fear and thereby displace or steer behavior of ungulates from conflict-prone sites resulting in reduced visitation and foraging time and consumption. Predator playback experiments in wilderness areas have repeatedly demonstrated to reduce the preys ' resource use and impacts on the surrounding landscape, but this has not been tested in agricultural fields where human-ungulate conflicts are most pronounced. We responded to this need by conducting a predator playback experiment in multiple crop fields in southern Sweden, where multiple ungulate species (fallow deer, roe deer, red deer, moose, wild boar) coexist, using a novel integrated camera trap - speaker system (ABRs) that broadcasts sounds of choice when a camera is triggered by an ungulate. Predator playbacks (wolf, dog, human) reduced deer patch use and crop damage on wheat fields more than playbacks of control sounds (owl, goose, raven). Our results confirm findings from previous studies in wilderness areas, and demonstrate that broadcasting predator playbacks using ABRs may provide an effective tool to reduce crop damage at the scale and duration of our study.

AB  - Dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) is a commercially important finfish, indigenous to South Africa, Australia, and China. Previous studies highlighted differences in genetic composition, life history, and morphology of the species across geographic regions. A draft genome sequence of 0.742 Gb (N50 = 5.49 Mb; BUSCO completeness = 97.8%) and 22,438 predicted protein-coding genes was generated for the South African (SA) conspecific. A comparison with the Chinese (CN) conspecific revealed a core set of 32,068 orthologous protein clusters across both genomes. The SA genome exhibited 440 unique clusters compared to 1928 unique clusters in the CN genome. Transportation and immune response processes were overrepresented among the SA accessory genome, whereas the CN accessory genome was enriched for immune response, DNA transposition, and sensory detection (FDR-adjusted p < 0.01). These unique clusters may represent an adaptive component of the species' pangenome that could explain population divergence due to differential environmental specialisation. Furthermore, 700 single-copy orthologues (SCOs) displayed evidence of positive selection between the SA and CN genomes, and globally these genomes shared only 92% similarity, suggesting they might be distinct species. These genes primarily play roles in metabolism and digestion, illustrating the evolutionary pathways that differentiate the species. Understanding these genomic mechanisms underlying adaptation and evolution within and between species provides valuable insights into growth and maturation of kob, traits that are particularly relevant to commercial aquaculture.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems with grazing pigs are mainly concentrated in Mediterranean regions, for instance in Iberian dehesas and montados. Conversely, in European deciduous forests, outdoor pig farming has almost disappeared, despite it could provide several environmental and socioeconomic benefits. For instance, pig grazing could be used for habitat restoration and conservation, while providing high quality meat products and promoting local breeds. In this study, we investigated (i) the plant species selection and (ii) the impact on tree resprouts (after a silvicultural cut) by semi-free ranging pigs in a degraded oak temperate forest in Northwestern Italy. We monitored pigs foraging behavior by direct observations and discriminated the plant species into three groups: preferred, indifferently consumed and avoided plants. The impact on the resprouts of six tree species was assessed by modeling the percentage of damaged shoots and their height through time using Generalized Linear and Additive Mixed Models. Swine expressed a selective foraging behavior, which was likely influenced by the forage quality and toxicity of plant species. The leaves and resprouts of Corylus avellana and Castanea sativa were highly consumed, whereas Acer and Quercus species and Fraxinus ornus were avoided. Mature leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia were highly preferred while its young resprouts were only slightly impacted, suggesting that pig grazing may not be effective to control this alien invasive species. Contrarily, pigs consumed Rubus sp. abundantly, suggesting they could be used to clear the understory in degraded forests.

AB  - Non-native fish species may generate major ecological impacts on native assemblages. This study aims to assess the potential impact of the introduced Arapaima gigas on native fish assemblages in two oxbow lakes of the Bolivian Amazon. Stable isotope data were used to determine trophic position (TP) and isotopic niche overlap, to evaluate potential predation and competition interactions, respectively. Results suggest that A. gigas is more an omnivore than a top predator, as often claimed. Arapaima gigas occupied an intermediate TP between detritivore/herbivore and piscivore fish species and showed broader isotopic niche compared to most native species analysed. The isotopic niche of A. gigas significantly overlapped with most native fish species in one lake (i.e. Lake Mentiroso), while there was low niche overlap in the second (i.e. Lake Miraflores). Given its omnivorous tendencies, the predation impact of A. gigas on other fish species is likely less than currently claimed and likely varies with the food web structure of the ecosystem. More precise data on resource availability and use are necessary to infer whether niche overlap will have negative impacts on native fish species through potential competitive interactions. Increasing our understanding on the processes generating impact of these introductions on resident communities through food web ecology will pave the way for better resource management and conservation efforts.

AB  - (Puma concolor) is a wide-ranging, large felid species, and site-specific research on its diet is important for local management. Like the diets of other large felids, puma diets may differ between sex due to size dimorphism and between seasons due to changes in prey vulnerability and availability. We investigated the influence of sex and season on puma diet in southwest New Mexico in terms of prey species and size categories. Pumas (10 males, females) were tracked with GPS collars for an average of one year per individual between February 2008 and July 2020. Puma location was recorded every 2 hours between 19:00 and 7:00, and kill sites were identified by a minimum of 2 GPS fixes occurring within 100 m and 100 hours of the first fix. Pumas specialized on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus) but also preyed upon a range of other species of different sizes. The probability of making a medium-sized kill such as a mule deer was higher for females than for males, while the probability of making an extra-large kill, such as an elk, was considerably greater for males than for females. There was substantial variation in prey species and size categories killed by individual pumas, particularly of smaller-sized prey like collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and skunks (e.g., Spilogale gracilis, Mephitis mephitis). Our findings concur with previous research on the importance of mule deer and elk in puma diet, demonstrate individual variation in prey killed, and may have man-agement implications.

AB  - Human activities are transforming landscapes and altering the structure and functioning of ecosystems worldwide and often result in sharp contrasts between human-dominated landscapes and adjacent natural habitats that lead to the creation of hard edges and artificial boundaries. The configuration of these boundaries could influence local biotic interactions and animal behaviours. Here, we investigate whether boundaries of different degrees of 'hardness' affect space utilization by migratory species in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We deployed camera traps along transects perpendicular to the national park boundary at three different locales. The transects were located in areas that consisted of two types of human-wildlife interface: a sudden transition from the national park into agro-pastoral land use (termed a 'hard' boundary) and a more gradual transition mediated by a shared usage area (termed a 'soft' boundary). Camera traps were placed at 2 km intervals along each 10 km transect from the edge towards the core of the park and were programmed to collect images hourly between dawn and dusk between June 2016 and March 2019. We used a deep neural network to detect the presence of wildlife within images and then used a Bayesian model with diffuse priors to estimate parameters of a generalized linear model with a Bernoulli likelihood. We explored the binomial probability of either wildebeest or zebra presence as a function of distance to the boundary, the rate of grass greening or drying (dNDVI) and the concentration of grass protein. There was a strong negative effect of distance to boundary on the probability of detecting wildebeest or zebra; however, this was only observed where the transition from human-dominated landscape to protected areas was sudden. Conversely, soft boundaries had little to no effect on the probability of detecting wildebeest or zebra. The results suggest that boundary type affects migratory species occurrence. The implications of these findings suggest that hard boundaries reduce the effective size of conservation areas; for many species, the area used by wildlife is likely less than the gazetted area under protection. The impacts may be severe especially for narrow protected areas or dispersal corridors.

AB  - The aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) is a Vulnerable bovid endemic of North Africa. Although legally protected in almost every country of its native distribution, the aoudad continues to be hunted for meat and trophy in both North Africa and the countries where it has been introduced. The species was subject to past translocations planned irrespectively of the genetic diversity and local adaptations of source and receiving populations, and no management or conservation units have ever been designed. We aim to provide here important insights on the taxonomy of the aoudad subspecies and the genetic diversity of most of its wild and captive populations. We collected 127 invasive and non-invasive samples from five of the six subspecies of aoudad recognized to date. We could successfully retrieve genetic data for 74 samples. Of those, 36 provided both nuclear (11 microsatellites) and mitochondrial (Cyt-b) data, 31 just nuclear data, and six just mitochondrial data. We implement Bayesian approaches to infer the population structure and phylogenetic relationships between the different populations/subspecies and backtrack the maternal lineages of introduced individuals in European populations. Our results support the presence of four genetically different wild populations, corresponding to three distinct mitochondrial lineages plus a fourth group restricted to Egypt identified by the nuclear markers. We also provide genetic evidence on the affiliation of some introduced European populations with respect to the native ones. The genetic diversity instead of variation within all wild populations was low. This might be a consequence of small effective population size and/or high inbreeding degree, probably related to hunting, decline in habitat availability and quality (i.e. overgrazing, and frequent drought), and high inbreeding degree. Our results provide important information for the aoudad conservation, including reintroductions and reinforcement actions of wild populations, and the exchange of individuals among captive stocks.

AB  - African wild suids consist of several endemic species that represent ancient members of the family Suidae and have colonized diverse habitats on the African continent. However, limited genomic resources for African wild suids hinder our understanding of their evolution and genetic diversity. In this study, we assembled high-quality genomes of a common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), a red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), as well as an East Asian Diannan small-ear pig (Sus scrofa). Phylogenetic analysis showed that common warthog and red river hog diverged from their common ancestor around the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, putatively predating their entry into Africa. We detected species-specific selective signals associated with sensory perception and interferon signaling pathways in common warthog and red river hog, respectively, which contributed to their local adaptation to savannah and tropical rainforest environments, respectively. The structural variation and evolving signals in genes involved in T-cell immunity, viral infection, and lymphoid development were identified in their ancestral lineage. Our results provide new insights into the evolutionary histories and divergent genetic adaptations of African suids.

AB  - We tested the prediction that abundance and composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in Ipomopsis aggregata roots and soils are influenced by ungulate herbivory and drought conditions by examining the effects in a field setting over two years. We used a multi-metric approach to quantify AMF root colonization, AMF reproduction, and AMF community composition in roots and soils. We incorporated complimentary community characterization assays by morphologically identifying spores from trap cultures and the use of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting. Herbivory caused a twofold increase in spore production, an increase in AMF taxa diversity in roots, and a shift in AMF species composition in rhizosphere soils. The impact of herbivory was dependent on water availability, which differed in the two contrasting years. This study demonstrates that both soil water availability and herbivory shape arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities. The changes to mycorrhizal communities may help in understanding mycorrhizal function in changing climates.

AB  - Aim: The microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ; mg CO2- C/mg MBC/h), defined as the amount of microbial CO2 respired (MR; mg CO2- C/kg soil/h) per unit of microbial biomass C (MBC; mg C/kg soil), is a key parameter for understanding the microbial regulation of the carbon (C) cycle, including soil C sequestration. Here, we experimentally tested hypotheses about the individual and interactive effects of multiple nutrient addition (nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium + micronutrients) and herbivore exclusion on MR, MBC and MMQ across 23 sites (five continents). Our sites encompassed a wide range of edaphoclimatic conditions; thus, we assessed which edaphoclimatic variables affected MMQ the most and how they interacted with our treatments.Location: Australia, Asia, Europe, North/South America.Time period: 2015-2016.Major taxa: Soil microbes.Methods: Soils were collected from plots with established experimental treatments. MR was assessed in a 5 week laboratory incubation without glucose addition, MBC via substrate-induced respiration. MMQ was calculated as MR/MBC and corrected for soil temperatures (MMQsoil). Using linear mixed effects models (LMMs) and structural equation models (SEMs), we analysed how edaphoclimatic characteristics and treatments interactively affected MMQsoil.Results: MMQsoil was higher in locations with higher mean annual temperature, lower water holding capacity and lower soil organic C concentration, but did not respond to our treatments across sites as neither MR nor MBC changed. We attributed this relative homeostasis to our treatments to the modulating influence of edaphoclimatic variables. For example, herbivore exclusion, regardless of fertilization, led to greater MMQsoil only at sites with lower soil organic C (< 1.7%).Main conclusions: Our results pinpoint the main variables related to MMQsoil across grasslands and emphasize the importance of the local edaphoclimatic conditions in controlling the response of the C cycle to anthropogenic stressors. By testing hypotheses about MMQsoil across global edaphoclimatic gradients, this work also helps to align the conflicting results of prior studies.

AB  - Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal disease affecting humans and other mammals caused by environmental pathogens of the genus Coccidioides. Human exposure to the pathogen occurs via inhalation of spores aerosolized from soil. Thus, understanding the ecological factors that shape the distribution of Coccidioides in soils is important for minimizing the risk of human exposure, though this task remains challenging due to the pathogen's highly variable spatial distribution. Here, we examined the associations between the soil microbial community and Coccidioides immitis' presence within the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a minimally disturbed grassland ecosystem, and the site of a longitudinal study examining the effects of rodents and their burrows on C. immitis' presence in soils. Using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 16S amplicon sequencing to characterize the soil fungal and bacterial communities, we found over 30 fungal species, including several other members of the Onygenales order, that co-occurred with C. immitis more frequently than would be expected by chance. Coccidioides-positive samples were significantly higher in fungal and bacterial diversity than negative samples, an association partly driven by higher Coccidioides presence within rodent burrows compared to surface soils. Soil source (i.e., rodent burrow versus surface soil) explained the largest amount of variation in bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition, with soils collected from rodent burrows having higher fungal and bacterial diversity than those collected from adjacent surface soils. While prior evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between the presence of Coccidioides and microbial diversity, we find that favorable microhabitats, such as rodent burrows, lead to a positive association between soil microbial diversity and Coccidioides presence, particularly in otherwise resource-limited natural environments.

AB  - Tillering-an important vegetative propagation process in grass whereby new shoots emerge laterally- regulates plant and ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbances, especially for desert steppe ecosystems. However, the response of desert steppe plant tillering to grazing and its related physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of long-term (15 yr) grazing intensity, including no grazing (CK), light grazing (LG), moderate grazing (MG), and heavy grazing (HG) on the tiller number, weight, photosynthesis rate, endogenous hormones, and antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as nutrient storage in tiller node and roots of desert steppe species Stipa breviflora. Compared with the CK, grazing reduced the above-ground biomass of S. breviflora in terms of tiller number and weight. Specifically, the tiller number under HG (33 per plant) was significantly lower than under CK (65 per plant). Tiller weight was significantly lower at each grazing intensity compared to CK. While LG improved the leaf net photosynthetic rate, HG decreased the leaf net photosynthetic rate, reduced sugar content, and increased crude protein. Grazing resulted in increased leaf endogenous auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid. Other measured factors were not affected by grazing disturbance. Structural equation modeling showed that grazing-induced decrease in tiller number can be co-explained by excess endogenous hormones (auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid), and lowered photosynthetic rate and crude protein and sugar content (soluble sugar, and reducing sugar), with standard total effect sizes of 0.51, 0.39 and 0.24, respectively. However, the decrease in tiller weight was only the result of endogenous hormone accumulation, with a standard total effect size of 0.60. Our results demonstrate that grazing negatively impacted tiller number and weight, but highlight different regulatory mechanisms, thus illustrating links between plant physiological characteristics, functional traits, and ecosystem functioning in response to grazing disturbance.

AB  - Simple Summary The water buffalo is found worldwide, but mainly in Asian countries, i.e., India, Pakistan, and China. Buffalo meat can be a viable option to fulfill the future protein demands of the world's population. Presently, very little information is available regarding buffalo meat quality attributes under different packaging types. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of packaging type and aging time on the meat quality characteristics (instrumental color, WBSF, cooking loss, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of longissimus lumborum steaks. The results showed that vacuum packaging and aging were the most effective in decreasing the WBSF values of buffalo meat. The present study determined the effect of the packaging type and aging time on the meat quality of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) bulls. A total of n = 36 longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles from n = 18 buffalo bulls were obtained. Half LL muscles were packed in modified atmosphere packaging (Hi-O-2 MAP), vacuum packaging (VP), and oxygen-permeable packaging (OP) on day 1, while the other half were aged for 7 days. Meat instrumental color, cooking loss, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of the LL steaks were analyzed, both on unaged and aged buffalo meat. Color CIE L* and C* values on all display days and a* on the first 4 days of the simulated retail display under Hi-O-2 MAP packaging were significantly higher than those of the VP and OP. WBSF and TBARS values were also higher under Hi-O-2 MAP as compared to the other packaging. Steaks under OP exhibited lower cooking loss but higher TVB-N values than the MAP and VP. The 7-day-aged buffalo meat indicated higher instrumental color (L*, a* and C*), cooking loss, and lower WBSF values than fresh meat. This study concluded that Hi-O-2 MAP improved the color; however, it negatively influenced the buffalo meat's WBSF and TBAR values. Furthermore, VP and aging were the most effective in decreasing the WBSF values of buffalo meat.

AB  - Monocultural agricultural systems can favour arthropod pests through direct effects, such as promoting pest dispersion, and indirect effects, such as limiting natural pest control. Therefore, promoting the presence of noncrop habitats in agricultural landscapes has the potential to reduce pest damage. However, likely in part due to the trophic complexity surrounding arthropod pests, these effects vary strongly among different pests and crops, and they are rarely consistent on a year-to-year basis. Here, we formulated Generalized Additive Mixed Models with data of 11 years from 25 olive orchards from southern Spain to evaluate the effects of landscape composition at different spatial scales on fruit infestation by the moth Prays oleae, a key Mediterranean olive pest. Then, we evaluated whether these effects were modulated by natural enemies or heterospecific herbivores. Fruit infestation by P. oleae was affected by landscape composition at small spatial scales (100 m radius), but not at medium or large scales (500 m and 1000 m radii). Fruit infestation was negatively affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitats, while it was positively affected by the proportion of olive groves in the landscape. We did not find evidence that these effects were modulated by natural enemies. However, fruit infestation by P. oleae was negatively affected by the presence of Euphyllura olivina, which is considered a secondary olive pest. Overall, this study shows that the negative response of P. oleae to habitat heterogeneity is consistent across years, but these effects were found only at smaller spatial scales. Therefore, we recommend implementing patches of seminatural vegetation within olive groves as it can help reduce crop damage caused by P. oleae. Specifically, our models showed that maintaining 25 % of non-crop vegetation within 100 m radius buffer zones would reduce by half the proportion of fruits infested by P. oleae. Interestingly, this study also suggests that the secondary pest E. olivina can prevent fruit infestation by P. oleae, which in turn could increase crop yield.

AB  - The rediscovery of the silver-backed chevrotain (Tragulus versicolor), an endemic species to Vietnam, in 2019 - after almost 30 years of being lost to science - is a remarkable outcome for conservation. Since its rediscovery, there has been significant concern for the conservation of the species due to hunting for wild meat, a practice deeply rooted in Vietnamese culture. Conservation plans face multiple obstacles as the species has not yet been listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to the lack of data. Given the limited effectiveness of current conservation measures, we propose that local actions, community cooperation, and empathetic values can help conserve the silver-backed chevrotain through integrating modern technologies (e.g. the Internet, crowdfunding platforms, social media, AI, etc.) with citizen and community science. Communicating conservation information to the community, especially children, must stimulate their thinking and imagination about nature, develop their curiosity and desire to protect wildlife, and eventually build conservation and eco-surplus core values in their mindsets. To successfully awaken human values within the community and incorporate them into conservation endeavours, messages referring to 'mouse-deer', 'chevrotain', or the scientific name T. versicolor are largely ineffective as they fail to engender feelings of familiarity. Therefore, we suggest calling the mouse-deer 'cheo cheo', a local name that can create familiarity and closeness, awaken the environmental conscience, and stimulate thinking and imagination. All these factors encourage conservationists, scientists, and the government to support conservation and the community in building a conservation and eco-surplus culture.

AB  - Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is an invasive shrub with major effects on native ecosystems in eastern North America. Over the past decade, major outbreaks of the native honeysuckle leaf blight (Insolibasidium deformans) have been observed on Amur honeysuckle in the Ohio River valley on an annual basis, and there is evidence of decline in honeysuckle stands in that region. Recent work suggests that the leaf death caused by this fungal pathogen has the largest effect on small shrubs, particularly those growing in the open. This study looked at shrub and stem diameter distributions of seven open-grown and three forest-canopy stands in northern Kentucky and southwestern Ohio. Shrub diameters were fit to the two-factor Weibull function. All stands had reverse-J-shaped diameter distributions, and the Weibull shape parameters indicated that shrub abundance decreased with diameter in all stands. Stand densities and basal areas fell within the range seen in previous studies. However, stem distributions showed a higher proportion of small stems (and in some cases small dead stems) than seen in the 1980s. This unexpected production and death of small stems is consistent with mortality caused by honeysuckle leaf blight, which targets small-diameter long shoots.

AB  - Following an incidental observation of captive Clibanarius corallinus () supposedly removing algae from each other's shells, we conducted a feeding experiment over 72 hours to understand its potential role as a mesograzer in coral reef ecosystems. Epiphyte-covered, coral rubble fragments of Acropora spp. were exposed to hermit crab (N = 41) activity for 72 h in a flow-through seawater aquarium system at Heron Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia to understand whether hermit crabs could remove epilithic algae and if so, to what extent. Coral fragments exposed to the hermit crabs had 9.1% less chlorophyll at the end of the experiment. The detritus generated in the experimental set-up had 2.4 times more chlorophyll and 33.4% less organic biomass than the detritus generated in the control environment. The crabs did on average lose 0.11 g of their initial weight, which could have been a consequence of the experimental set-up. These results suggest that C. corallinus has the potential to contribute to the control of epilithic algae in coral reefs, with such effect having hitherto been overlooked as a result of the cryptic behaviour of this hermit crab species.

AB  - BackgroundTraditional ecological knowledge (TEK) helps tribal communities adapt to socio-ecological changes, improving the long-term sustainability of their livelihood strategies and fostering social-ecological resilience. TEK provides thorough understanding of ecosystem dynamics, as well as how they relate to societal norms, practices, and resource use patterns. The integrity of TEK is often in jeopardy due to changes in belief systems, regional languages, traditional ways of subsistence, and disruption of traditional social-ecological systems. Landscape restoration has the ability to promote self-determination while safeguarding the livelihoods, beliefs, cultural, and biodiversity of indigenous peoples. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap on how TEK might aid ecosystem restoration, particularly in elephant corridors.MethodsThe current study focused on gathering traditional ecological knowledge on the woody tree species from the Dering-Dibru Saikhowa Elephant Corridor using semi-structured interviews, group discussions, and direct observations. The acquired data were applied to heat map cluster analysis and ordination techniques using R software version 4.0.0.ResultsTraditional usage information of 31 tree species utilized for food, fodder, timber, fuelwood, medicinal, and livelihood by local people was gathered. Most of the species utilized locally belonged to the families Combretaceae and Fabaceae. The species were classified into single, double, or multi-uses based on the extent of utilization. Azadirachta indica, Phyllanthus emblica, and Syzygium cumini (six each) had the highest utilization, while Mesua ferrea had the lowest. Chionanthus ramiflorus, Artocarpus heterophyllus, and Dillenia indica were among the plants valuable to wildlife, providing both forage and habitat for a wide variety of birds and animals. Artocarpus heterophyllus, Averrhoa carambola, Mangifera indica, P. emblica, Psidium guajava, and S. cumini were among the plants important for the livelihoods of the local community. Our findings demonstrated that local people were knowledgeable about the plant species to use as pioneer species, such as Bombax ceiba, Albizia lebbeck, D. indica, S. cumini, P. emblica, Lagerstroemia speciosa, and Alstonia scholaris, for habitat restoration in a diverse habitat. We classified the habitat of the enlisted species into different categories, and two clusters (clusters 1 and 2) were identified based on the similarity of woody species in different habitats. We prioritized multiple tree species for eco-restoration using the information collected through TEK. We planted 95,582 saplings on 150 hectares in the Dering-Dibru Saikhowa Elephant Corridors' degraded habitat patches, which will serve as future reference site for landscape rehabilitation. Out of total saplings planted, 56% of the species were linked to native communities through ethnobotanical uses, as well as providing connectivity and habitat for elephant movement, 16% of all woody species are pioneer species to colonize a degraded habitat, 15% of all woody species are preferred food and foraging by wildlife, and 13% of the species as a source of livelihood for local people, incorporating social, economic, cultural, and biodiversity benefits into the restoration framework.ConclusionThe current study also provides insights how the TEK can assist with aspects of ecological restoration, from reference ecosystem reconstruction and adaptive management through species selection for restoration, monitoring, and evaluation of restoration effectiveness.

AB  - Sustainable landscape planning in Ramsar site catchments requires data on the historical land use and land cover change (LULCC) and its drivers. Thus, this paper quantifies LULCC from 2002, 2011 and 2020 and its associated drivers. The Maximum Likelihood supervised classification was used to produce land use/land cover (LULC) categories for each year. The Bayesian hierarchical clustering approach (BHCA) and binary logistic regression (BLR) identified and ranked drivers. From 2002 to 2020, forest land exhibited a dramatic decline (25.83%/year) while bare/barren land increased noticeably (3.59%/year) during the same period. Other land use classes, such as marshes and water bodies declined at 8.23%/year and 2.64%/year, respectively. Shrub land, eroded land, irrigated land, cultivated land, and settlement increased at 1.76%/year, 1.15%/year, 1.72%/year, 1.9%/year, and 2.21%/year, suggesting that LULCC is indeed an emerging threat to the Elephant Marsh Ramsar site. Dynamic drivers such as browsing effects, forest fire, dry season farming, irrigation effects, deforestation, policy conflicts, weak governance systems, weak enforcement of registration, unplanned settlements, population growth, economic development, illiteracy levels, poverty levels and food insecurity had a coefficient mean score of >2.0 and were significant (P < 0.01), classifying them as higher risk. The coefficient mean scores for expansion of invasive species, charcoal production, infrastructure development, low household incomes, animal grazing, heat waves, drought, cyclone storms, unsustainable farming systems, lack of awareness, land tenure systems, brick making and sand mining, weak enforcement of registration, mining, water abstraction, strong winds and wetland vegetation-over-exploitation were <2.04 and significant at P <0.05, suggesting risky drivers. However, all drivers interacted with LULCC at multiple scales to produce complex feedback effects, influencing landscape management policies. These findings are critical, because they act as a baseline for managers and policy makers to prioritize integrated land-use planning to safeguard Ramsar site integrity, and account for future environmental and economic uncertainties.

AB  - Records concerning marine megafauna (e.g., cetaceans, pinnipeds, seabirds, and sea turtles) predation and scavenging events by sharks are scarce along the Brazilian coast. Although Brazil is noteworthy as one of the main global hotspots regarding elasmobranch functional diversity, endemism and diversity, studies on the food biology of this group have been carried out for less than a third of this taxonomic group, even though biology and feeding ecology assessments for shark species from the Brazilian coast are extremely valuable from a global perspective and should be encouraged. In this context, this study records unprecedented ecological predation and necrophagy interactions between sharks and different zoological vertebrate groups through the analysis of several marine megafauna carcasses found stranded on the beaches of the southern coast of Bahia, in northeastern Brazil, between 2005 and 2020. The implications of these records in furthering knowledge concerning the life history of the species involved in each interaction are discussed in a context of scarcity of scientific marine ecology data for this Brazilian coast area.

AB  - Microorganisms play important roles in element transformation and display distinct compositional changes during composting. However, little is known about the linkage between nutrient-cycling functional gene diversity and compost ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). This study performed winter composting with pig manure and fallen leaves and evaluated the distribution patterns and ecological roles of multiple functional genes involved in nutrient cycles. Physicochemical properties and enzyme activities presented large fluctuations during composting. Absolute abundance, composition, and diversity of functional genes participating in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles presented distinct dynamic changes. Stronger linkage was found between enzyme activities and temperature than other physicochemical factors, whereas total nitrogen rather than other physicochemical factors displayed closer linkage with functional gene composition and diversity. EMF targeting key nutrient (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) cycles was significantly positively correlated with temperature and notably negatively correlated with functional gene diversity. Enzyme activities rather than functional gene diversity showed a greater potential effect on phosphorus availability. Consequently, the available phosphorus (AP) content increased from initial 0.50 g/kg to final 1.43 g/kg. To our knowledge, this is the first study that deciphered ecological roles of nutrient-cycling functional gene diversity during composting, and the final compost can serve as a potential phosphorus fertilizer.

AB  - Rare or endangered species largely contributing to global biodiversity are essential components of ecosystems. Because genetic diversity depends not only on apparent population size but also demographic processes, the conservation priority of endangered species based on population genetics needs to be assessed by comparison with common congeners and demographic events. In this study, we performed population genetic analysis for Gentiana yakushimensis Makino, a rare and endangered plant species with an isolated distribution on Yakushima Island, Japan. We performed comparison of genetic diversity with the congener (Gentiana triflora Pall. var. japonica [Kusn.] H.Hara), demographic inference, and bottleneck test based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. The result was that G. yakushimensis had an extremely low genetic diversity level and a high inbreeding coefficient level compared with those of the congener. The population of G. yakushimensis was estimated to experience an expansion during the Last Glacial Maximum and a recent bottleneck by the demographic inference and the bottleneck test. Therefore, the low level of genetic diversity of this species might have resulted from the impact of the recent bottleneck and the long-term maintenance of a small population size. Due to the long lifespan of the genus Gentiana, the current level of genetic diversity probably does not reflect a large part of recent demographic events, which requires long-term monitoring of changes in genetic diversity to identify the time lag between the reduction in apparent population size and genetic diversity as a future outlook.

AB  - In a context of rapid global change, one of the key components for the survival of species is their genetic evolutionary potential for adaptation. Many methods have been developed to identify genetic variants underpinning adaptation to climate, but few tools were made available to integrate this knowledge into conservation management. We present here the SPatial Areas of Genotype probability (SPAG), a method to transpose the results of genotype-environment association studies into an evolutionary potential spatial prediction framework. We define a univariate model predicting the spatial distribution of a single-locus adaptive genotype and three multivariate models allowing the integration of several adaptive loci in a composite genotype. Unlike existing methods, SPAGs provide (a) a flexible approach to combine loci under different types of intergenic relationships and (b) a cross-validation framework to assess the pertinence of evolutionary potential predictions. SPAGs can be integrated with climate change projections to forecast the future spatial distribution of genotypes. The analysis of the mismatch between current and future SPAGs ("genomic offset") makes it possible to identify vulnerable populations potentially lacking the adaptive genotypes necessary for future survival. We tested the SPAG approach on a simulated population and applied it to characterize the evolutionary potential of 161 Moroccan goats to bioclimatic conditions. We identified seven regions of the Moroccan goat genome strongly associated with the precipitation seasonality and used the SPAG approach to predict the evolutionary potential. We then forecasted the shift in SPAGs under a strong climate change scenario and uncovered the goat populations likely to be threatened in future conditions. The SPAG methodology is an efficient and flexible tool to characterize the evolutionary potential across a landscape and to transpose evolutionary information into conservation frameworks.

AB  - Chytrid fungal parasites increase herbivory and dietary access to essential molecules, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), at the phytoplankton-zooplankton interface. Warming enhances cyanobacteria blooms and decreases algae-derived PUFA for zooplankton. Whether chytrids could support zooplankton with PUFA under global warming scenarios remains unknown. We tested the combined effect of water temperature (ambient: 18 degrees C, heat: +6 degrees C) and the presence of chytrids with Daphnia magna as the consumer, and Planktothrix rubescens as the main diet. We hypothesized that chytrids would support Daphnia fitness with PUFA, irrespective of water temperature. Heating was detrimental to the fitness of Daphnia when feeding solely on the Planktothrix diet. Chytrid-infected Planktothrix diet alleviated the negative impact of heat and could support Daphnia survival, somatic growth and reproduction. Carbon stable isotopes of fatty acids highlighted a similar to 3x more efficient n-3 than n-6 PUFA conversion by Daphnia feeding on the chytrid-infected diet, irrespective of temperature. The chytrid diet significantly increased eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4n-6) retention in Daphnia. The EPA retention remained unaffected, while ARA retention increased in response to heat. We conclude that chytrids support pelagic ecosystem functioning under cyanobacteria blooms and global warming via chytrids-conveyed PUFA toward higher trophic levels.

AB  - Genetic diversity is critical to a population's ability to overcome gradual environment change. Large-bodied wildlife existing in regions with relatively high human population density are vulnerable to isolation-induced genetic drift, population bottlenecks, and loss of genetic diversity. Moose (Alces americanus americanus) in eastern North America have a complex history of drastic population changes. Current and potential threats to moose populations in this region could be exacerbated by loss of genetic diversity and connectivity among subpopulations. Existing genetic diversity, gene flow, and population clustering and fragmentation of eastern North American moose are not well quantified, while physical and anthropogenic barriers to population connectivity already exist. Here, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of 507 moose spanning five northeastern U.S. states and one southeastern Canadian province indicated low diversity, with a high proportion of the genomes sharing identity-by-state, with no consistent evidence of non-random mating. Gene flow estimates indicated bidirectionality between all pairs of sampled areas, with magnitudes reflecting clustering and differentiation patterns. A Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components analysis indicated that these genotypic data were best described with four clusters and indicated connectivity across the Saint Lawrence River and Seaway, a potential physical barrier to gene flow. Tests for genetic differentiation indicated restricted gene flow between populations across the Saint Lawrence River and Seaway, and between many sampled areas facing expanding human activity. These results document current genetic variation and connectivity of moose populations in eastern North America, highlight potential challenges to current population connectivity, and identify areas for future research and conservation.

AB  - Understanding habitat use and reproductive biology of invasive species is essential to predicting invasions, designing early detection programs, and developing management plans. The rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Linnaeus, 1758) is an omnivorous fish native to Europe and western Asia that has been translocated to several countries in western Europe, New Zealand, North America, and Africa. However, little is known about early life history of rudd, particularly in invaded ecosystems, limiting our ability to predict invasions and create early detection and control programs. The upper Niagara River has the most abundant population of rudd in North America and has been the focus of several ecological investigations. Our study identified critical nursery habitats by determining which nearshore habitat factors were most strongly associated with presence of age-0 rudd. We found that emergent vegetation was the most important habitat characteristic associated with the presence of age-0 rudd. When emergent vegetation was not present, rudd were more likely to be present at sites with abundant submerged aquatic vegetation. Additionally, the odds of rudd presence decreased as distance to the nearest wetland increased. These findings can be used to create habitat-driven predictive models of rudd invasion and guide early detection programs for rudd outside their native range.

AB  - Community-based conservation, despite being more inclusive than fortress conservation, has been criticized for being a top-down implementation of external ideas brought to local communities for conservation's benefit. This is particularly true for Changpas, the pastoral people of Changthang in trans-Himalayan India who live alongside unique wildlife. Our main aim was to co-design conservation interventions through participatory action research. We worked with two Changpa communities, to understand the issues faced by them. Subsequently, we co-designed context-sensitive interventions to facilitate positive human-nature interactions. We did so by integrating the PARTNERS (Presence, Aptness, Respect, Transparency, Empathy, Responsiveness, Strategic Support) principles with the Trinity of Voice (Access, Standing and Influence). In Rupsho, we facilitated focus group discussions (FGDs) led by the community. We found livestock depredation by wildlife was primarily facilitated by the weather. This led to co-designing of a new corral design, which was piloted with seven households, safeguarding 2385 pashmina goats and sheep. Approximating the value of each sheep/goat to be USD125, this intervention amounts to a significant economic protection of USD c. 42,500 for each household. This is along with intangible gains of trust, ownership and improved self-esteem. In Tegazong, a restricted area adjoining the Indo-China border with no previous research records, we worked with 43 Changpa people to co-create research questions of mutual interest. Wildlife presence and reasons for livestock loss were identified as areas of mutual interest. The herders suggested they would record data in a form of their choice, for 6 months, while they live in their winter pastures. This participatory community monitoring revealed nutrition and hypothermia to be a key cause of livestock death. Subsequently, we delimited two previously untested interventions: lamb cribs and provisioning of locally sourced barley as a feed supplement. The wildlife monitoring recorded the first record of Tibetan Gazelle Procapra picticuadata, outside of their known distribution, in Tegazong. We aim to highlight the benefits of co-designing projects with local communities that link research and conservation, while also discussing the challenges faced. Ultimately, such projects are needed to ensure ethical knowledge generation and conservation, which aims to be decolonial and inclusive.

AB  - Biodiversity loss, as driven by anthropogenic global change, imperils biosphere intactness and integrity. Ecosystem services such as top-down regulation (or biological control; BC) are susceptible to loss of extinctionprone taxa at upper trophic levels and secondary 'support' species e.g., herbivores. Here, drawing upon curated open-access interaction data, we structurally analyze trophic networks centered on the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and assess their robustness to species loss. Tri-partite networks link 80 BC organisms (invertebrate or microbial), 512 lepidopteran hosts and 1194 plants (including 147 cultivated crops) in the Neotropics. These comprise threatened herbaceous or woody plants and conservation flagships such as saturniid moths. Treating all interaction partners functionally equivalent, random herbivore loss exerts a respective 26 % or 108 % higher impact on top-down regulation in crop and non-crop settings than that of BC organisms (at 50 % loss). Equally, random loss of BC organisms affects herbivore regulation to a greater extent (13.8 % at 50 % loss) than herbivore loss mediates their preservation (11.4 %). Yet, under moderate biodiversity loss, (non -pest) herbivores prove highly susceptible to loss of BC organisms. Our topological approach spotlights how agriculturally -subsidized BC agents benefit vegetation restoration, while non -pest herbivores uphold biological control in on- and off -farm settings alike. Our work underlines how the on -farm usage of endemic biological control organisms can advance conservation, restoration, and agricultural sustainability imperatives. We discuss how integrative approaches and close interdisciplinary cooperation can spawn desirable outcomes for science, policy and practice.

AB  - The impact of climate fluctuations on the genetic diversity and distribution of species is of particular concern for large mammals that are already at risk of extinction. In this study, we investigated the genetic status of populations, the evolutionary relationships, and the current and future state of population dispersion of the goitered gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa , using 109 mtDNA sequences (cyt b ) and species distribution modeling. We assessed the impact of past (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM: 21 Kya] and MidHolocene [6 Kya]), current, and future (2070) climate on the phylogeography and spatial distribution of the species. Our results indicate evidence of divergence of two main clades ( G. subgutturosa subgutturosa , and G. subgutturosa yarkandensis ) (L052 Mya) and a further split between two clades of G. s. subgutturosa (Middle Eastern and Central Iranian) in the middle Pleistocene. Historical species distribution models suggest the species' range has not changed much across all periods examined, but there has been a decreasing trend from 21k to the current. Future climate projections (BCC-CSM 1 and CCSM 4, RCP s 4.5 and 6 scenarios) predict a contraction of suitable habitat at the northern and southern edges of the species' current distribution, shifting the range to the center of the study area. Biogeographic analyses suggest that vicariance and dispersal events have shaped the genetic structure of G. subgutturosa. Our findings suggest that the current genetic structure of the species is potentially related to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and refuges (Alborz, Zagros, and Kope Dagh Mountains) during cold periods. The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic status of populations and their evolutionary relationships to effectively prevent further declines of species at risk of extinction.

AB  - During the sixth millennium bce, the first farmers of Central Europe rapidly expanded across a varied mosaic of forested environments. Such environments would have offered important sources of mineral-rich animal feed and shelter, prompting the question: to what extent did early farmers exploit forests to raise their herds? Here, to resolve this, we have assembled multi-regional datasets, comprising bulk and compound-specific stable isotope values from zooarchaeological remains and pottery, and conducted cross-correlation analyses within a palaeo-environmental framework. Our findings reveal a diversity of pasturing strategies for cattle employed by early farmers, with a notable emphasis on intensive utilization of forests for grazing and seasonal foddering in some regions. This experimentation with forest-based animal feeds by early farmers would have enhanced animal fertility and milk yields for human consumption, concurrently contributing to the expansion of prehistoric farming settlements and the transformation of forest ecosystems. Our study emphasizes the intricate relationship that existed between early farmers and forested landscapes, shedding light on the adaptive dynamics that shaped humans, animals and environments in the past.
   Stable isotope analysis of zooarchaeological remains and pottery in a palaeo-environmental framework reveals that early Central European farmers utilized diverse regional pasturing strategies for cattle, including the use of forested environments for grazing and seasonal foddering.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study was performed to estimate body weight (BW) from several body measurements, such as tail length (TL), shoulder height (SH), withers height (WH), body length (BL), chest circumference (CC), shank diameter (SD) and birth weight (BiW). The data set was taken from Mus Province of Turkiye. In this respect, 171 Anatolian buffaloes were used. To estimate the BW, different proportions of the training and test sets were used with the MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) algorithm. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the MARS algorithm may allow animal breeders to obtain an elite population and to determine the body measurements affecting BW as indirect selection criteria for describing the breed description of Anatolian buffalo and aiding sustainable meat production and rural development in Turkiye. Anatolian buffalo is an important breed reared for meat and milk in various regions of Turkiye. The present study was performed to estimate body weight (BW) from several body measurements, such as tail length (TL), shoulder height (SH), withers height (WH), body length (BL), chest circumference (CC), shank diameter (SD) and birth weight (BiW). The data set was taken from Mus Province of Turkiye. In this respect, 171 Anatolian buffaloes were used. To estimate the BW, different proportions of the training and test sets were used with the MARS algorithm. The optimal MARS was determined at a proportion of 70-30%. The MARS model displays the heaviest BW that can be produced by Anatolian buffalo according to tail length, body length, chest circumference and shoulder height. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the MARS algorithm may allow animal breeders to obtain an elite population and to determine the body measurements affecting BW as indirect selection criteria for describing the breed description of Anatolian buffalo and aiding sustainable meat production and rural development in Turkiye.

AB  - Identifying the factors shaping dialects can reveal selective pressures and cultural influences on acoustic signals. Translocations of species have been considered the "gold standard" for identifying population differences in vocalizations, including dialects. The North American elk (Cervus canadensis) is a species that has experienced numerous translocations, but no published studies exist on dialects in elk or any other ungulate species. Adult male North American elk utter an iconic vocalization during the breeding season, which is termed the bugle call due to the power, duration, and pitch of the sound. We investigated if dialect differences existed between three populations: a source population in Wyoming (N = 10 bulls, 132 calls) and translocated populations in Colorado (N = 13 bulls, 92 calls) and Pennsylvania (N = 20 bulls, 160 calls). Dialect differences existed between the populations in 9 of 10 measured variables, in both the frequency domain and time domain. Habitat factors (acoustic adaptation hypothesis) affecting sound transmission were inconsistently related to dialects in the populations. Genetic factors may be related to dialects, as the historically bottlenecked Pennsylvania population, with low heterozygosity and low allelic richness, exhibited the least variability in acoustic measures. Cultural transmission and vocal learning may also contribute to dialect development in this highly vocal, social ungulate species.

AB  - The worldwide decline of marine forests, due to human impacts and climate change, emphasizes the need to develop and implement effective and sustainable solutions to restore these endangered habitats and to re-establish the services they provide.
   In this study, the ex situ restoration of Gongolaria barbata (=Treptacantha barbata), a Mediterranean subtidal habitat-forming species of brown seaweed, was for the first time implemented in a marine protected area in the Adriatic Sea. Two restoration efforts were performed in 2019. The first was started in winter, after a marine heatwave that triggered early fertility, and the second in spring, when the species usually reproduces.
   This study aimed to evaluate: (i) the disruptive effects of a thermal anomaly on the reproductive biology and performance in culture of G. barbata; and (ii) the impact of the grazing pressure on juveniles after the outplanting.
   The first cultivation was more productive than the second, in terms of zygote release and germling growth. To mitigate the low efficiency of the second culture and to avoid prolonged highly demanding maintenance in the mesocosms, the cultivation period was extended outdoors using a structure suspended in the water column.
   The modular frames conceived for outplanting G. barbata proved to be effective because of their easy operability and low cost. Controlling for herbivorous fish had significant positive effects on both juvenile survival and growth.
   The outcomes highlighted that an unpredictable climatic event and fish grazing were major threats that impaired the restoration process of G. barbata. These stressors should be considered when developing plans to implement effective large-scale restoration of canopy-forming macroalgae.

AB  - An increase in the sika deer (Cervus nippon) population may result in a rise in the number of patients with tick-borne diseases in Japan, due to the increased questing (host-seeking) tick density. Although previous studies have examined the impact of sika deer on the questing tick density in specific regions, regional differences among tick species remain understudied. To clarify the general and regional effects of sika deer presence on tick species density, we analyzed published and field data using generalized linear mixed models. Regression coefficients for sika deer presence relative to the densities of questing Haemaphysalis kitaokai, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis megaspinosa were positive in most prefectures, suggesting that deer presence is associated with increased densities of these species. In contrast, coefficients for Haemaphysalis flava varied by region, showing no significant, positive, or negative associations depending on location. For Ixodes ovatus, the coefficients were not significant in Niigata Prefecture but were positive in Hokkaido Prefecture, indicating regional variation These findings suggest that the impact of sika deer on the increased density of H. flava and I. ovatus may vary by region. In addition, the risk of human infection caused by tick-borne pathogens transmitted by tick species positively affected by the presence of sika deer may increase due to the expansion of sika deer distribution. In the future, the impact of sika deer on tick density should be considered in various management decisions such as agricultural, environmental and public health departments.

AB  - Concurrent monitoring of multiple species with a single study design can be an efficient use of time and financial resources. Using camera traps to estimate density or abundance of multiple species is only possible if the study design captures photographs of all target species in an unbiased manner. We used camera trap data originally collected for a different purpose and applied the Space to Event (STE) model to estimate density of multiple species simultaneously. We had sufficient data to estimate densities of moose (Alces alces), black bear (Ursus americanus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), wolves (Canis lupus), and deer (white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus] and mule deer [O. hemionus] combined). Our estimated densities were lower than those derived from other methods in the study area, possibly due to the lack of a sampling design specific to STE. However, our estimates were generally comparable to published density estimates from across the species' range. Our approach allowed us to estimate abundance and density for each species with the same effort required to estimate abundance of a single species. Our results suggest that with an appropriate study design, STE could be an effective, efficient, low cost and non-invasive method for estimating densities of multiple unmarked species using a single camera array.

AB  - Marginal hill farmland is a key target for the restoration of temperate indigenous forest, which can help mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. Reliance on natural regeneration and minimum interference management (MIM) is a low-cost restoration strategy for farmers, with the transition from pasture to woody scrub vegetation (whether indigenous or exotic) an important early successional phase. However, few studies have determined the key factors that influence the regeneration of woody vegetation on pastoral farmland, nor the rate at which regeneration occurs. Using a geospatial analysis of a New Zealand pastoral hill farm subject to variable grazing and MIM, this study found that only 3.8% of grassland experienced detectable regeneration of woody vegetation over 16 years. The key factor influencing natural regeneration was proximity to existing woody vegetation, with the probability of regeneration decreasing as distance increased. Cattle grazing had a significant negative impact, with regeneration more likely to occur in areas free from cattle. Sheep grazing exhibited no significant positive or negative relationship with regeneration. To support natural regeneration of woody vegetation, landowners should prioritize areas with a higher presence of existing woody vegetation and exclude cattle. To increase the rate of regeneration, landowners should consider active management regimes and supplemental restoration strategies, such as applied nucleation and the introduction of nurse species. Given the increased cost and complexity of such approaches, effective government incentive programmes may be needed to provide landowners with financial support and expertise.

AB  - Ungulate browsing often impairs tree regeneration, thus preventing the achievement of economic or conservation goals. Forest ungulate management would thus benefit from a practical decision tool that facilitates method selection from a wide range of monitoring methods and indicators currently available. In this study, we first provide an overview of the different browsing-impact monitoring methods and indicators currently applied. We then present a newly developed decision matrix for method evaluation that can assist forest stakeholders in choosing the browsing-impact monitoring method best suited to their needs, based on the selected indicators. The first step involved two separate literature reviews to create an overview of the currently applied methods and to select the indicators best suited for measuring browsing impact. Three types of indicator groups with their respective parameters were considered important for method evaluation: browsing indicators (e.g. regeneration density, browsing incidents), performance indicators (e.g. expense, expertise) and data quality indicators (e.g. susceptibility to measurement errors). Subsequently, all parameters defined within each indicator group were categorised and a grade was assigned to each category. To create the final method-indicator matrix, each browsing-impact monitoring method received a grade for each parameter within all indicator groups, reflecting the specific advantages and disadvantages of implementing the respective parameter within a specific method. The utility of the matrix in selecting the most suitable monitoring method was then demonstrated using the example of Germany's national parks. Based on the weights added to the method-indicator matrix, as defined by national park representatives, and considering local requirements the nearest-tree method was favoured over the other two methods. This newly developed matrix provides a more scientific objectification of ungulate browsing-impact measures and can be easily used by forest managers to address their own requirements, based on a consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of the included methods.

AB  - 1. Freshwater habitats support high levels of biodiversity and provide important habitat for wetland-dependent taxa; however, impairment of aquatic connectivity through wetland loss, stream alterations and light pollution impacts species persistence and community resilience. Quantifying occupancy of these habitats to assess their use by mammals and birds can be challenging, especially for cryptic species.
   2. This study examines wetland habitat use by mammals and birds, and their spatial and temporal relationships within the Beaver Hills Biosphere in Alberta, Canada. As part of a multi-method detection approach, camera boxes, cameras on beaver dams, and camera rafts allowed for multivariate analyses to determine temporal and spatial patterns of habitat use and species associations, while field sampling and environmental DNA (eDNA) provided data on site occupancy by a subset of semi-aquatic mammals.
   3. From similar to 50,000 images, over 84 species were detected, including 52 species of birds and 25 species of mammals. Several species were spatially associated, and although most species of mammals exhibited temporal overlap, there were distinct differences, especially on beaver dams where predators such as coyotes and white-tailed deer shared the same space. Temporally, birds were detected most often during the day and mammals at night. During new moon phases, use of beaver dams by beavers decreased dramatically, and use of camera rafts by muskrats increased.
   4. Winter field surveys allowed for a broad overview of wetland occupancy and abundance of some species, particularly by beavers and muskrats, and occasionally winter use by other semi-aquatic mammals. Where there was limited detection of more cryptic species of semi-aquatic mammals, eDNA analysis successfully detected American water shrew, American mink, North American river otter and northern bog lemming more often than camera and field methods.
   5. Applying a multi-method monitoring approach for mammals and birds in wetland habitats is critical at a time when freshwater systems are experiencing dramatic declines in relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations, with many of these species underrepresented in conventional surveys.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, particularly those in the tropics, the occurrence of rapid transformation impacts the wildlife. Most of the studies on fauna have been conducted on pristine and protected areas, with less consideration of lands and landscapes dedicated to diverse human activities. This is particularly true for medium and large-sized mammals, which perform specific functions that help to maintain ecosystem stability, while supporting ecosystem services. In 1997, the government of Mexico implemented the land policy of management of flora and fauna species through the establishment of Management Units for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Wildlife (UMA, by its Spanish acronym). This land policy allows private and community landowners to benefit directly from the management, use, and conservation of wildlife. This study analyzes the presence of mammals using camera-traps in 17 UMA in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Chiapas, in southeastern Mexico. The total number of mammal species recorded was 27, with a sampling effort of 3067 days/trap in Veracruz (with 19 species), 3238 days/trap in Chiapas (with 22 species) and 1068 days/trap in Tabasco (with 17 species). Six of the following species are in danger of extinction: in Chiapas, the tapir (Tapirus bairdii) was recorded in tropical high evergreen forest and tropical montane cloud forest, and the jaguar (Panthera onca) was recorded in tropical montane cloud forest, the margay (Leopardus wiedii), the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and the tayra (Eira barbara) were recorded in all three states, while the northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) was recorded only in Veracruz and Tabasco.

AB  - Rapidly changing climate is likely to modify the spatial distribution of both flora and fauna. Land use change continues to alter the availability and quality of habitat and further intensifies the effects of climate change on wildlife species. We used an ensemble modeling approach to predict changes in habitat suitability for an iconic wildlife species, greater one-horned rhinoceros due to the combined effects of climate and land use changes. We compiled an extensive database on current rhinoceros distribution and selected nine ecologically meaningful environmental variables for developing ensemble models of habitat suitability using ten different species distribution modeling algorithms in the BIOMOD2 R package; and we did this under current climatic conditions and then projected them onto two possible climate change scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) and two different time frames (2050 and 2070). Out of ten algorithms, random forest performed the best, and five environmental variables-distance from grasslands, mean temperature of driest quarter, distance from wetlands, annual precipitation, and slope, contributed the most in the model. The ensemble model estimated the current suitable habitat of rhinoceros to be 2610 km(2), about 1.77% of the total area of Nepal. The future habitat suitability under the lowest and highest emission scenarios was estimated to be: (1) 2325 and 1904 km(2) in 2050; and (2) 2287 and 1686 km(2) in 2070, respectively. Our results suggest that over one-third of the current rhinoceros habitat would become unsuitable within a period of 50 years, with the predicted declines being influenced to a greater degree by climatic changes than land use changes. We have recommended several measures to moderate these impacts, including relocation of the proposed Nijgad International Airport given that a considerable portion of potential rhinoceros habitat will be lost if the airport is constructed on the currently proposed site.

AB  - Insect herbivores have the potential to consume large amounts of plant tissue in tropical forests, but insectivorous vertebrates effectively control their abundances, indirectly increasing plant fitness accordingly. Despite several studies already sought understanding of the top-down effects on arthropod community structure and herbivory, such studies of trophic cascades in old tropics are underrepresented, and little attention was paid to top-down forces in various habitats. Therefore, we examine how flying insectivorous vertebrates (birds and bats) impact arthropods and, consequently, affect herbivore damage of leaves in forest habitats in Papua New Guinea. In a 3-month long predator exclosure experiment conducted at four study sites across varying elevation and successional stage, we found that vertebrate predators reduced arthropod density by similar to 52%. In addition, vertebrate predators decreased the mean body size of arthropods by 26% in leaf chewers and 47% in non-herbivorous arthropods but had only a small effect on mesopredators and sap suckers. Overall, the exclusion of vertebrate predators resulted in a similar to 41% increase in leaf damage. Our results, across different types of tropical forests in Papua New Guinea, demonstrate that flying vertebrate insectivores have a crucial impact on plant biomass, create a selective pressure on larger and non-predatory prey individuals and they prey partition with mesopredators.

AB  - Simple Summary We used a 1000 km long latitudinal gradient in north-western Russia to study the potential impacts of a changing climate on soil invertebrates visible by a naked eye (insects, spiders, earthworms etc.). We extracted these animals from soil, weighed them and identified them to the species level. We found that the diversity of soil invertebrates decreased towards the north, whereas the latitudinal pattern in biomass depended on the animal's feeding habit. The biomass of species feeding on live plant roots and fungal mycelia decreased towards the north, whereas the biomass of species feeding on dead plant tissues and live invertebrates showed no significant latitudinal changes. The discovery of this variation in latitudinal biomass patterns suggests that soil invertebrates from different feeding guilds may respond differently to climate change. As a result, the biomass ratio between consumers and their food resources (e.g., herbivores and plants, predators and prey) may change. We poorly understood how this change will affect the future structure and functions of boreal forest ecosystems. Latitudinal gradients allow insights into the factors that shape ecosystem structure and delimit ecosystem processes, particularly climate. We asked whether the biomass and diversity of soil macrofauna in boreal forests change systematically along a latitudinal gradient spanning from 60 degrees N to 69 degrees N. Invertebrates (3697 individuals) were extracted from 400 soil samples (20 x 20 cm, 30 cm depth) collected at ten sites in 2015-2016 and then weighed and identified. We discovered 265 species living in soil and on the soil surface; their average density was 0.486 g d center dot w center dot m(-2). The species-level diversity decreased from low to high latitudes. The biomass of soil macrofauna showed no latitudinal changes in early summer but decreased towards the north in late summer. This variation among study sites was associated with the decrease in mean annual temperature by ca 5 degrees C and with variation in fine root biomass. The biomass of herbivores and fungivores decreased towards the north, whereas the biomass of detritivores and predators showed no significant latitudinal changes. This variation in latitudinal biomass patterns among the soil macrofauna feeding guilds suggests that these guilds may respond differently to climate change, with poorly understood consequences for ecosystem structure and functions.

AB  - Urbanization alters abiotic conditions, vegetation, and wildlife populations in ways that affect tick abundance and tick-borne disease prevalence. Likely due to such changes, tick abundance has increased in many US urban areas. Despite growing public health importance of tick-borne diseases, little is known about how ticks are influenced by urbanization in North America, especially in the central United States where several pathogens occur at or near their highest incidences. To identify factors influencing tick abundance across a gradient of urbanization intensity, we used CO2 traps and flagging to sample ticks at 16 parks across Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA over 2 yr, conducted vegetation surveys, and used trail cameras to estimate a deer abundance index. Our results indicate there is a risk of encountering ticks across the entire urbanization gradient from exurban areas to the urban core, although some species (Dermacentor variabilis (Say)) appear less-common in heavily-urbanized areas. Vegetation variables were also associated with tick abundance. For example, Amblyomma maculatum Koch decreased with increasing woody plant and leaf litter cover, and there was a weak positive relationship between D. variabilis abundance and cover of understory eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.), indicating this native encroaching tree may increase tick populations in urban areas of the Great Plains. The deer abundance index was positively correlated with A. maculatum and D. variabilis abundance but unrelated to A. americanum (L.) abundance. Public health officials and land managers can use such information about parks/greenspaces and their surroundings to focus public education and land management efforts designed to reduce tick-borne disease prevalence.

AB  - Understanding the heterogeneity of agricultural production systems is important both for the design of targeted and tailored policies and for providing effective extension services. In Switzerland, seasonal grazing of alpine pastures during summer is important for many farms, but also for biodiversity conservation. However, these so-called alpine summer farms are threatened by water scarcity due to climate change, the lack of skilled labor, and human-wolf conflict, resulting in the abandonment of farms and loss of biodiversity. Swiss agricultural policies govern alpine summer farms with uniform policy interventions through direct payments to address these challenges. However, these farms are highly heterogeneous in terms of socioeconomic and biophysical conditions, and we lack an understanding of their structure. We investigate the heterogeneous structure of Swiss alpine summer farms by using census data (N 5 5900) and a mixed-methods approach combining unsupervised clustering techniques and expert assessment to generate a farm typology. Our methodological approach enriches the existing socioeconomic farm-level data with spatial data to depict the farms' infrastructure and biophysical environment. Our results suggest 6 types that differ in terms of organizational structure, herd composition, biophysical environment, and accessibility: (1) private dairy farms; (2) communal mixed cattle and dairy farms; (3) communal cattle farms; (4) remote farms; (5) small, private cattle farms; and (6) sheep farms. We also anticipate challenges for each cluster and discuss optimization and policy measures. This will help develop targeted policies tailored to specific alpine farm types, addressing both climate and farm structural change.

AB  - Aim Animal migration is often explained as the result of resource tracking in seasonally dynamic environments. Therefore, resource availability should influence both the distributions of migratory animals and their seasonal abundance. We examined the relationship between primary productivity and the spatio-temporal distributions of migratory birds to assess the role of energy availability in avian migration. Location North America. Time period Full annual cycle, 2011-2016. Major taxa studied Nocturnally migrating landbirds. Methods We used observations of nocturnally migrating landbirds from the eBird community-science programme to estimate weekly spatial distributions of total biomass, abundance and species richness. We related these patterns to primary productivity and seasonal productivity surplus estimated using a remotely sensed measure of vegetation greenness. Results All three avian metrics showed positive spatial associations with primary productivity, and this was more pronounced with seasonal productivity surplus. Surprisingly, biomass showed a weaker association than did abundance and richness, despite being a better indicator of energetic requirements. The strength of associations varied across seasons, being the weakest during migration. During spring migration, avian biomass increased ahead of vegetation green-up in temperate regions, a pattern also previously described for herbivorous waterfowl. In the south-eastern USA, spring green-up was instead associated with a net decrease in biomass, and winter biomass greatly exceeded that of summer, highlighting the region as a winter refuge for short-distance migrants. Main conclusions Although instantaneous energy availability is important in shaping the distribution of migratory birds, the stronger association of productivity with abundance and richness than with biomass suggests the role of additional drivers unrelated to energetic requirements that are nonetheless correlated with productivity. Given recent reports of widespread North American avifaunal declines, including many common species that winter in the south-eastern USA, understanding how anthropogenic activities are impacting winter bird populations in the region should be a research priority.

AB  - There are 28 invasive termite species, most belong to two families, the Kalotermitidae (esp. Cryptotermes spp.) and Rhinotermitidae (esp. Coptotermes spp.). Six invasive termite species are known to have spread into natural habitats, but little direct research has been conducted into their ecological impacts. Predictions based on indirect research (natural durability of commercial wood species) suggest fast-growing, pioneer tree species with low density wood, perhaps notably legumes, are most vulnerable to invasive termites, but even slow growing climax tree species may succumb. Cryptotermes will likely have less ecological impact, due to small colonies attacking dead branch stubs in the canopy. Coptotermes will likely have greater impact, due to large colony sizes and nesting in living trees, which they hollow out and can kill. There are no studies of invasive termites on native termites, other wood eating insects, or predators, such as ants, showing considerable scope for future research.

AB  - In Latvia, livestock depredation by wolves has increased during the last two decades. Most of the attacks occur in summer and autumn during wolf hunting season. Use of effective preventive measures in Latvia is low, and farmers primarily rely on wolf hunting as a depredation reduction measure. The total numbers of wolf attacks and number of affected sheep per year in regional forest management units were analyzed in relation to the estimated wolf density, extent of culling, and proportion of juveniles, as well as the sheep density and estimated number of wild prey animals. The response variables (number of attacks and affected sheep per year) were modelled using a negative binomial regression, testing the effects of every covariate separately and building models from the significant covariates. The depredation level was related to sheep density and estimated wolf population size. No reducing effect was found for culling, and an even greater depredation rate was expected when the proportion of culled wolves increased. In addition, no significant effect was associated with the other covariates. However, greater numbers of affected sheep were expected at higher red deer density, suggesting increased opportunistic livestock depredation when red deer locally outcompete roe deer, the preferred wolf prey in Latvia.

AB  - Self-organized forest communities (FCs) have governed common forests in a sustainable way in Europe for centuries. In most CEE countries, this tradition was interrupted by the communist regime in the second half of the 20th century. The social demand for non-provisioning forest ecosystem services (FES) is increasing nowadays and FCs could play a significant role in their provision. However, FCs are currently facing many challenges, e.g., climate change, loss of income or changing social values. The paper investigates (i) the role of self-organized FCs in innovative forest governance and sustainable FES provision and (ii) specific conditions and fostering/hindering factors affecting implementation of innovative forest governance schemes by FCs in CEE. Factors influencing forest governance innovations in two FCs in Czechia and Slovakia were identified and discussed during workshops, focus groups and semi-structured interviews with their members and stakeholders. It was shown that self-organized FCs could play a pioneering role in implementation of innovations as they are open to novel solutions and have the ability to flexibly and collectively respond to new challenges. Emphasis on non-provisioning FES, cooperation of actors, strong leadership and introduction of financial compensations are key fostering factors. In contrast, factors related to institutional settings (e.g., current legislative environment) are perceived as hindering.

AB  - In the early 1990s, the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii underwent an eastward shift in distribution into an area known as East of Cape Hangklip, where they had previously been rare. This shift has also been termed an in-vasion and resulted in a complete change in the benthic community structure, changing from a state dominated by herbivores and encrusting algae, to another state dominated by lobsters, sessile species, kelp and understory algae. Using the trophic modelling software Ecopath with Ecosim, baseline models of the pre-and post-invasion systems were created to better understand trophic pathways between the two different states and assess how fishing pressure may have driven the shift in ecosystem state. Using the baseline models, different fishing management strategies were tested to see whether the post lobster-invaded ecosystem could be shifted back or close to the pre-invasion state. Baseline models that were developed to describe the shift in ecosystem state reflected an increase in the presence of kelp, sessile species and lobsters, and the decline of encrusting algae and herbivores. Furthermore, the post-invasion system was more productive and less diverse than the pre -invasion system. Simulations using an Ecosim model showed that, with a reduction in fishing pressure on reef fish and abalone, and a simulated increase in fishing pressure on rock lobster, reef fish recovered to pre -invasion levels, but juvenile abalone, adult abalone and urchin biomass did not recover, probably due to the dif-ficulty in capturing non-trophic interactions in the trophic models. Further functional groups such as sessile spe-cies, turf and foliose algae, also did not return to the pre-invasion state. This study concluded that a reduction in fishing pressure on abalone and reef fish, and the removal of rock lobster through increased fishing pressure, would allow the post-invasion ecosystem to partially recover to the pre-invasion state, but not completely, sug-gesting a hysteresis effect. Further exploration of management strategies through model simulations is needed, including those that can account for non-trophic processes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration enhances the stability and productivity of agricultural ecosystems. Organic material application is a direct and effective way to maintain and improve SOC sequestration. However, currently, there is little knowledge on efficient practices for combined organic material application to improve SOC sequestration. In this study, we evaluated the effect of three organic materials alone or in combination on SOC sequestration in a 4-year field experiment. Eight treatments were included: control (CK, conventional chemical fertilizer), green manure (G), straw (S), decomposed sheep manure (M), green manure plus straw (GS), green manure plus sheep manure (GM), straw plus sheep manure (SM), green manure, and straw plus sheep manure (GSM). In 2020, decomposed sheep manure application (M, SM, GM and GSM) resulted in the greatest cumulative SOC sequestration (9.5 - 10.8 Mg C ha -1 ), followed by those in treatments S (6.1 Mg C ha -1 ) and GS (6.9 Mg C ha -1 ). The SOC sequestration efficiency in the M treatment (44.8 %) was greater than that in the others (15.2 - 34.8 %). A random forest model revealed that organic material quantity and quality, enzyme activity, and microbial community composition were the primary factors determining SOC sequestration. Sheep manure application increased SOC sequestration by increasing lignin quantity and proportion. Incorporating green manure and straw return enhanced SOC sequestration by promoting microbial growth and increasing soil C-acquiring enzyme activity. However, interactions between sheep manure and plant residues resulted in decreases in SOC sequestration efficiency compared with sheep manure application alone. This is because combined fertilization stimulated microbial growth and enzyme activity, causing changes in microbial community structure and accelerating organic material and SOC decomposition. Thus, we do not recommend combining livestock manure with straw or green manure to improve SOC sequestration and soil quality in the southern Loess Plateau.

AB  - Aim Ongoing climate warming has been widely reported to delay autumn phenology, which in turn impacts carbon, water, energy and nutrient balances at regional and global scales. However, the underlying mechanisms of autumn phenology responses to climate change have not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine whether brightening that was defined as the increase of surface solar radiation and warming during recent decades affect autumn phenology in opposite directions and explore the underlying mechanisms. Location Central Europe. Time period 1950-2016. Major taxa studied Four dominant European tree species in central Europe: Aesculus hippocastanum, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur. Methods We investigated the temporal trends of leaf senescence, preseason temperature and radiation by separating the period of 1950-2016 into two sub-periods (1950-1982 and 1983-2016) and determined the relationship between temperature, radiation and leaf senescence using partial correlation analysis. Results We found a significant warming and brightening trend after the 1980s in central Europe, yet this led to only slight delays in leaf senescence that cannot be explained by the well-known positive correlation between leaf senescence and autumn warming. Interestingly, we found opposite effects between warming (partial correlation coefficient, r = .37) and brightening (r = -.23) on leaf senescence. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of leaf senescence decreased with increasing radiation (-5.08 days/celcius/10(8) J/m(2)). Main conclusions The results suggested that brightening accelerated the leaf senescence dates, counteracting the warming-induced delays in leaf senescence, which may be attributed to photooxidative stress and/or sink limitation. This emphasizes the need to consider radiation to improve the performance of autumn phenology models.

AB  - Burkina Faso's W National Park (WNPB) is one of the country's biodiversity hotspots. Despite this Park's protection, illegal human activities threaten its vegetation, and little information about the on-site causes of degradation is available. Here we explored the extent and drivers of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the WNPB. For this purpose, we used Landsat (1988, 2001 and 2016), and ancillary data to determine the spatial structure and changes in LULC with a random forest classifier. We identified socio-economic factors influencing LULC by conducting household surveys, focus groups, and field observations. We used the ranking and binary logistic regression methods to analyze the socio-economic data. A logistic regression model assessed the relationship between land cover change and socio-economic factors. The results showed that multi-temporal classification performed significantly better than mono-temporal one in the study area. However, the combination of mono-temporal reflectances and vegetation indices for LULC classification significantly enhanced the accuracy to the level of multi-temporal classification. This result in-dicates that this combination is an efficient alternative to multi-temporal classification in the study area where cloud-free imagery is rare. In the WNPB, LULC dynamics from 1988 to 2001 was mainly characterized by reduction of tree savannas (9.4%) and woodland (8.8%) and expansion of bare soil (0.1%) and mixed vegetation (18.1%). From 2001 to 2016, croplands increased by 102.1%. Bush fire (77.19%), wood harvesting (48.25%), lack of rain (48.25%) and elephants' impact (20.18%) were the leading direct causes of LULC change. In general, the perceptions of local populations about vegetation trends were in line with the observations from remote sensing. Altogether, the tree vegetation in the study area decreased significantly between 2001 and 2016, and the cause of this change appears to be unsustainable land-use rather than rainfall conditions. According to these findings, land-use management practices in this park should be more sus-tainable and provide education (and changing habits) to the surrounding population. It is therefore suggested that the government regulate illegal activities through forest law enforcement to protect the WNPB from over-exploitation.

AB  - Background Throughout their range, red deer are a well-studied species. In Italy, this species occupies two ecologically different ranges: the Alps and the Apennines. Although several studies have described the spatial behaviour of red deer in the Italian Alps, no data are available for the Apennine population. Results The spatial behaviours of 13 deer from the Northern Apennines range were analysed for the first time using GPS-GSM telemetry from 2011 to 2017. Red deer displayed two coexisting strategies, i.e., migratory and stationary. In our sample, females tended to migrate more than males. We found a high level of interindividual variability in the date of migration/return, while each migratory deer was very conservative during the study period. The migration ranges were on average 12 +/- 4.2 km from the resident range. Both migratory and resident deer displayed high site fidelity. No switch from the migratory to stationary strategy was observed for any deer during the study period; however, the period could have been too short to detect any switch. At the management level, over 18 management cycles occurred during the study period, and a spatial mismatch was found between deer range and management units (districts) in 38.9% (7) of the cases. Merging the districts belonging to each province to obtain an area of approximately 1000 km(2) would partially address such spatial mismatch, reducing its occurrence to 22%. Conclusions Despite the small sample size, these results can guide future management actions. However, an in-depth study with a larger sample size is required to better understand and manage the red deer Apennines population.

AB  - 1. Cover crops are multifunctional tools that mitigate environmental impacts of agriculture, enhance resilience to weather extremes and suppress weeds and arthropod pests. Cover crops provide non-crop food and habitat resources that attract natural enemies of pests, but their outcomes for pest management are less clear in regions where keystone mutualisms between red imported fire ants and aphids dominate.
   2. Here, we manipulate ant exclusion treatments and cover crop treatments (living mulches and terminated cover crops) that vary in food/habitat resources and examine responses of ants, aphids, other herbivores and predators in a cotton agroecosystem.
   3. Living mulches reduced both ants and aphids in the crop canopy by 97% and 93%, respectively, relative to bare soil treatments, and terminated cover crops reduced them as well by a lesser degree (similar to 50%).
   4. Non-aphid herbivores occurred in low densities system-wide and increased in living mulches, whilst native predators had variable responses to cover crops and ant exclusion.
   5. Cover crops had no effect on prey removal in the crop canopy, but living mulches tripled rates of weed seed biocontrol, relative to bare soils.
   6. Cover crops elicited a shift in fire ant foraging from cotton foliage downward to the soil-surface, preventing competitive exclusion by keystone ant/aphid mutualists that dominate crop monocultures.
   7. Cover crops altered the system-wide impacts of fire ants: reducing ecosystem disservices (i.e. aphid tending) and enhancing ecosystem services (i.e. weed seed biocontrol). These results provide incentives for cover crop adoption as a regenerative practice in large-scale commercial agriculture.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic factors' impact on habitat loss is a growing problem that is influencing unsustainable wildlife local-population home range shifts and triggering an increase in human-wildlife conflict (HWC). Yet, keystone species involved in HWC such as elephants play a vital role in nature-based ecosystem services and have important economic and cultural value to the people that are living with them. To understand how climate change and anthropogenic factors affect habitat loss and elephants' home range shift, the movement of Namib desert-dwelling elephants was monitored and observed in the Ugab River basin between February 2018 and November 2020 at fortnight intervals. There are 87 elephants in the Ugab River basin that are distributed into two subpopulations: desert-dwelling elephants (N = 28) and semi-desert-dwelling elephants (N = 59). To achieve the objective of the study, land cover change, elephant movement, rainfall, and temperature data were analysed using ArcGIS spatial and statistical tools, such as image analysis, optimised hot spot analysis (OHSA), and cost distance analysis, to distinguish habitat vegetation changes and home range shifts and how these link to emerging human-elephant conflict (HEC) hot spots. Human farming activities, poor rainfall, and frequent droughts are responsible for the loss of habitat of around 73.0% in the lower catchment of the ephemeral river streams; therefore, the urgency of conserving and sustaining these habitats and desert-dwelling elephants is discussed here.

AB  - Proboscidea is a group of large mammals abundant in the fossil record and in Brazil it is represented by Notiomastodon platensis (Ameghino, 1888). To improve the understanding on its taxonomy, chronology, annual diet, and habitats paleoenvironmental aspects, we conducted a morphological description, absolute dating, and analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen (513C and 518O) in Notiomastodon' remains from the northern (Norte de Minas) and western (Triangulo Mineiro) mesoregions of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The material includes isolated teeth, mandibular portions, and postcranial bones at different levels of fragmentation, associated with at least eight adults and one juvenile. The only individual from Triangulo, found in Campina Verde municipality, was dated at 27,715-27,903 Cal yr BP. It presented a mixed diet based on C4 plants (piC4 = 90 %; 513C = 0.5 %o), which implies the occupation of an open environment, mostly pasture. The region was relatively humid (518O = 24.7 %o), which is supported by the existence of humidity corridors in the Amazon region. A similar phytophysiognomy was inferred for the Norte de Minas region between at least 21,966-22,279 Cal yr BP and 18,944-19,157 Cal yr BP. However, one specimen showed a different 513C value (piC3 = 0.87 %; 513C = -10.2 %o). This indicates it lived in a transitional environment between low-density forest and arboreal savannah. This likely occurred during a period that favored the expansion of trees and shrubs. The region underwent climate change, from relatively humid conditions (518O = 25.6 +/- 0.2 %o) to expressively dry (518O = 34.6 %o) between the dated periods, a change corroborated by some palynological data. The multiannual paleoecological analysis, based on sequential sampling of three dentin layers of an incisor, indicated the relative stability of vegetation and climate despite fluctuations in hydrology. The perceived disassociation between vegetation dynamics and local hydrology corroborates the idea that factors other than precipitation may play a significant role in the environmental dynamics of the Cerrado biome.

AB  - Under the background of global climate change, climate warming has led to an increase in insect herbivory, which significantly affects the growth, survival, and regeneration of forest plants in the warm temperate zone of China. Plants can adopt defense responses to adapt to insect defoliation. Therefore, field experiments were conducted on five common warm temperate species, Quercus acutissima, Quercus serrata, Quercus aliena, Quercus dentata, and Robinia pseudoacacia. We measured the leaf traits of healthy trees and insect defoliated trees, to explore the response strategies of common species in warm temperate zones to insect defoliation. Our results showed that native species stored more carbon in extreme environments for survival rather than growth, while the alien species R. pseudoacacia tended to adopt active resource acquisition strategies and were more inclined towards growth. The content of tannins and flavonoids in the alien species R. pseudoacacia did not significantly increase after leaf damage, while the content of secondary metabolites such as tannins, flavonoids, and total phenols in the native species Q. acutissima, Q. serrata, Q. aliena, Q. dentata increased significantly after leaf damage. This indicated that compared to alien species, native species invested more resources in defense, which might reduce resource allocation for growth. Thus, the native Quercus species have stronger resistance than the alien species R. pseudoacacia after insect defoliation.

AB  - Animal dung holds an important role in the nutrient cycle of nearly every ecosystem on Earth. It also acts as an ephemeral resource for invertebrate communities and has facilitated the specialization of many life history strategies. Most ecosystem functions associated with dung are linked to burial - a process most often attributed to dung beetles. However, identifying other organisms that contribute to dung burial is important to understand how communities provide this ecosystem service. During a trail camera experiment intended to monitor dung beetle behavior, we observed an unidentified species of cricket burying dung pellets underground. We were unable to find previous documentation of dung-burying behavior for this animal group, raising questions of how common or extensive this behavior is. Particularly under the threat of global insect declines, understanding which species are responsible for key processes may be crucial to maintaining ecosystem function and resilience. Additionally, this experiment exemplifies how camera traps can be used in nontraditional applications to observe and monitor unique events, behaviors, and processes, such as the decay of ephemeral resource patches and insect behavior.

AB  - In the current era of global change, the emergence of infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock interface poses risks to biodiversity, agricultural economies, and public health. Driven by anthropogenic influence, increased sharing of resources between wildlife and livestock can promote cross-species transmission, the consequences of which are challenging to predict. Mycoplasma bovis , an economically important bacterial pathogen in cattle, has recently emerged as a threat to other ungulate species. This study reports on a case of M. bovis in an intensively monitored free-ranging mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus ) in Colorado, USA, which presented an opportunity to describe the disease in a novel host and infer transmission and infection dynamics from GPS collar data. Following a mortality signal from a GPS-collared adult female mule deer, field investigation revealed predation while postmortem examination further revealed severe, acute, fibrinosuppurative and necrotizing pleuropneumonia. Histopathological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR confirmed M. bovis as the etiology. GPS collar data demonstrated spatial overlap with dairy cattle in the 50 days prior to death, implicating potential spillover from cattle as the transmission pathway. Reduced movement was identified 19 days prior to death, indicative of sickness behavior due to acute pneumonia. This case underscores the potential for M. bovis to cause severe disease in wild ungulates and highlights the value of thorough postmortem investigations as a routine component of studies involving wildlife tracking. The retrospective use of GPS collar data provides valuable insights into the movement ecology of wildlife exposed to novel pathogens, aiding in the understanding of cross-species transmission and informing management strategies to reduce the potential for spillover.

AB  - Animals in urban areas can be exposed to human-mediated land use change and radiant heat (called urban heat island effect). Few studies have empirically evaluated the effects of urban heat on wild vertebrates. We live-trapped desert wild rodents from a large metropolitan area in the Sonoran Desert, USA, across seven field sites spanning three strata of land surface temperatures. During the summers of 2019 and 2020, we captured 116 adult pocket mice (Chaetodipus spp. and Perognathus spp.) and Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) in mountainous urban parks and open spaces. We measured body condition, proxy for health, using percent body fat (i.e., fat mass divided by body mass). For mammals, this parameter estimates the storage of energy-rich fat, which is important for growth, survival, and reproduction. We measured body condition using a noninvasive quantitative magnetic resonance instrument. Site-level surface temperatures were measured using data loggers and long-term climate data. Results supported the prediction that body condition was greatest in cooler temperature strata compared to the hottest areas. To relate body condition to resource availability, we evaluated vegetation cover and degree of urbanization. Body fat of adult pocket mice was greater in areas with more vegetation cover and where nighttime temperatures and surface temperatures were lower and urbanization was greater. Kangaroo rats had more fat in areas with the lowest strata of surface temperature. These results demonstrate that extreme heat negatively covaries with small mammal body condition, which indicates that urbanization and climate change have the potential to reduce rodent fitness.

AB  - The rostral epidural rete mirabile appears in many studies on cerebral vascularisation; however, its exact characteristics are poorly understood. Its structure and location have a mechanism of selective cooling of the brain, protecting the animal from hyperthermia and affecting the body water balance. The aim of this study was to analyse the structure of the rostral epidural rete mirabile along with its tributaries. The study material consisted of a total of 61 specimens from the deer family belonging to the European roe deer, red deer and fallow deer species and those belonging to the beef family: domestic cattle, European bison, domestic sheep and domestic goat. The rostral epidural rete mirabile in the families of this study is well developed. It is formed of many small arteries anastomosing with each other and its main tributary is the maxillary artery, which is an extension of the external carotid artery. Additionally, in cervids, blood is supplied by the condylar artery. Within the families analysed, there was considerable similarity in the plan of construction within the rostral epidural rete mirabile, with minor differences among individual taxa.

AB  - A key question in insect community ecology is whether parasitoid assemblages are structured by the food plants of their herbivore hosts. Tritrophic communities centred on oak-feeding cynipid gallwasps are one of the best-studied tritrophic insect communities. Previous work suggests that host plant identity is a much stronger predictor of oak-cynipid interactions than of cynipid-parasitoid interactions. However, these relationships have not been formally quantified. We reason that the potential for 'bottom-up' effects should increase with host plant phylogenetic diversity. We, therefore, generated quantified interaction network data for previously unstudied tritrophic cynipid communities in Sichuan, China, where, in addition to Quercus, cynipid host plants include Castanea, Castanopsis and Lithocarpus. We characterise these communities taxonomically and compare the extent to which host plant taxonomy predicts plant-herbivore and plant-parasitoid associations. We sampled 42,620 cynipid galls of 176 morphotypes from 23 host plant species, yielding over 4500 specimens of 64 parasitoid morphospecies. Many parasitoids were identifiable to chalcidoid taxa present in other Holarctic oak cynipid communities, with the addition of Cynipencyrtus (Cynipencyrtidae). As elsewhere, Sichuan parasitoid assemblages were dominated by generalists. Gallwasp-plant interaction networks were significantly more modular than parasitoid-plant association networks. Gallwasps were significantly more specialised to host plants (i.e. had higher mean d' values) than parasitoids. Parasitoid assemblages nevertheless showed significant plant-associated beta diversity, with a dominant turnover component. We summarise parallels between our study and other Fagaceae-associated cynipid communities and discuss our findings in light of the processes thought to structure tritrophic interactions centred on endophytic insect herbivores.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions are generally assumed to negatively impact biodiversity of recipient communities. However, experimental evidence for this assumption is little, especially in developing countries. In addition, there is hardly applicable method to control invasive plants. Enemy release is often hypothesized to facilitate exotic plant invasions, thus re-association with natural enemies of invasive ranges may inhibit invasions of exotic plants, and these enemies may have the potential to be used as biological control agents for these invaders. To address above problems, we determined abundance of the invasive plant Xanthium strumarium, its impacts on cooccurring native plants, and abundances of three herbivores and their impacts on the invader at five sites in the rice tract of Punjab, Pakistan. Relative abundance of the invader varied greatly among the study sites, ranging from 3.5% to 50.4%. The invader significantly reduced abundance of co-occurring native plants at all study sites, and their richness and evenness at some sites with high abundances of the invader. The polyphagous insects Phenacoccus solenopsis, Podisus maculiventris and Spodoptera frugiperda were all found on the invader (not on crops) at all study sites, which significantly reduced growth of the invader. The abundance of P. solenopsis on the invader was much higher than those of P. maculiventris and S. frugiperda. The abundances of the herbivores were significantly higher at sites with high relative to low relative abundances of the invader. Our study indicates that natural enemies may accumulate on invasive plants with the increase of their abundance and/or invasion time, inhibiting further invasions, and provides evidence for enemy release hypothesis. More studies are needed to determine whether these herbivores, especially P. solenopsis, could be used as biological control agents for the invader.

AB  - Medium and large-sized mammals of Jorgo-Wato Protected Forest have not yet been documented though the forest established before four decades. Hence, this study aims to document medium and large mammals and the behavioral responses of selected mammals toward anthropogenic activities in the study area. The study was conducted from February 2015 to June 2016, encompassing the wet and dry seasons. Data were collected mainly through camera traps, indirect and direct evidence. The study revealed about 23 medium and large-sized mammals that belong to seven orders namely Bovidae, Carnivora, Primates, Rodentia, Tubulidentata, Lagomorpha, and Hyracoidea. Papio anubis, C. guereza, and C. aethiops were the most abundant large mammals in JWPF. Because of high anthropogenic activities, African buffalo shifted its activity period from diurnal into crepuscular and nocturnal. African buffalo traveled longer distances during the wet season (mean = 14.33 km, SD = 1.25 km) than during the dry season (mean = 9.00 km, SD = 2.16 km). This could be due to the fact that the local people were less likely to go to the forest for resource exploitation during the wet season as they are fully engaged in agricultural activities. However, low agricultural activities during the dry season allow the local people to extract resources and involve in bushmeat hunting which could limit the movement of mammals to their refugia. African buffalo preferred to rest on and adjacent to a gravel road (22.1%) in the forest, followed by on open rocky hilltops (14.7%) at night time, but rest in the bottomland thicket vegetation during the dry daytime. Regardless of high human pressure in the area, this study has revealed a good number of medium and large-sized mammals that could be used as baseline information to design a sound conservation and management action plan of large mammals and their habitat in Jorgo-Wato Protected Forest.

AB  - Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations have declined steadily across their geographic range due to a multitude of factors including habitat degradation associated with the encroachment of invasive annual grasses including cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and North Africa grass (Ventenata dubia). These grasses can drive changes in vegetation composition that significantly reduce the quantity and quality of summer mule deer forage. Application of annual grass selective herbicides is a management tool being used in effort s to restore invaded grasslands. We assessed the effect of an imazapic application on mule deer use, home range size, and proportional overlap with treatment areas. We evaluated differences in summer (June-August) use between fifteen 8 -ha paired control and treatment plots, comparing responses among pretreatment, 1 yr post treatment, and 2 yr post treatment. Results from tests were statistically insignificant but suggest a weak positive response by mule deer to imazapic-treated areas. Proportional use of treatment plots in the first summer post treatment was 4.4% higher than use of control plots and was greater than pretreatment use of the same plots. In the second summer post application, use of treatment plots decreased and returned to pretreatment levels. Mule deer increased use of treatment plots in alignment with improvements in crude protein and digestible energy content of forage. As annual grasses began reinvading and nutritional quality of forage was no longer higher than the control, use of treatment plots declined and returned to pretreatment levels.

AB  - The sea urchin Pseudechinus magellanicus is commonly found in tide pools of central Patagonia, Argentina. This study investigates its grazing effects on macroalgal assemblages through a series of removal experiments conducted over 3 years. The reduction in herbivory significantly influenced macroalgal biomass and community structure, altering species composition and abundance in the lower midlittoral and upper infralittoral zones. While species richness did not differ significantly between experimental treatments within intertidal zones, it varied markedly across shore levels. K-dominance curves consistently exhibited lower values in the sea urchin removal treatment at both shore levels, indicating reduced macroalgal dominance. The biomass of articulated coralline algae, along with various epiphytic filamentous and foliose species, increased in the absence of sea urchins, highlighting the critical role of P. magellanicus in structuring tide pool seaweed assemblages. The decline in the biomass of the most dominant Corallina morphotype in tide pools where P. magellanicus was present may be attributed to multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms: direct consumption through intense grazing, incidental removal during epiphytic algae scraping, and indirect effects stemming from the destabilization of macroalgal structures. Additionally, the findings indicate that P. magellanicus exerts a negative influence on species typically associated with later successional stages, such as Dictyota dichotoma, Adenocystis utricularis, Codium fragile, and Chondria macrocarpa. These results highlight the role of P. magellanicus as a structuring herbivore in intertidal communities, influencing macroalgal composition in tide pools habitats of central Patagonia.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a widely distributed environmental pollutant in agroecosystems, causes negative effects on crops and herbivores through bottom-up processes. The gut microbial community of an insect can play a critical role in response to metal stress. To understand how microbiota affect the stress responses of organisms to heavy metals in agroecosystems, we initially used 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the larval gut microbiota of Chilo suppressalis, an important agricultural pest, exposed to a diet containing Cd. The species richness, diversity, and composition of the gut microbial community was then analyzed. Results revealed that while the richness (Chao1 and ACE) of gut microbiota in larvae exposed to Cd was not significantly affected, diversity (Shannon and Simpson) was reduced due to changes in species distribution and relative abundance. Overall, the most abundant genus was Enterococcus, while the abundance of the genera Micrococcaceae and Faecalibaculum in the control significantly superior to that in Cd-exposed pests. Phylogenetic investigation of microbial communities by the reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) showed that the intestinal microorganisms appear to participate in 34 pathways, especially those used in environmental information processing and the metabolism of the organism. This study suggests that the gut microbiota of C. suppressalis are significantly impacted by Cd exposure and highlights the importance of the gut microbiome in host stress responses and negative effects of Cd pollution in agroecosystems.

AB  - Wildlife are hosts of ectoparasites, such as fleas and ticks that may transmit human and animal pathogens. Little is known about the ecology of many ectoparasite species native to southern Texas, or their role in pathogen maintenance and transmission. Much attention has been given to the role of nonnative nilgai antelope as cattle fever tick hosts and agents of dispersal, but little attention has been given to other ectoparasites that may utilize nilgai antelope as hosts. As southern Texas is a hot-spot for flea-borne (murine) typhus, it is important to examine flea species presence, abundance, and host use in this region. Fleas were opportunistically collected during wildlife depredation activities, from hunter-harvested animals, or during handling in the course of other research activities in several southern Texas counties. A total of 9 wildlife species were sampled, from which 3 flea species were identified. A total of 83 Pulex porcinus (Jordan and Rothschild) were collected from nilgai, coyotes, bobcats, javelina, feral swine, and a black-tailed jackrabbit. In total, 9 Euhoplopsyllus glacialis affinis (Baker) were collected from cottontail rabbits, and 1 Echidnophaga gallinacea (Westwood) was collected from a raccoon. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of fleas from nilgai antelope. Pulex porcinus, although often considered a specialist species, was collected from a wide range of hosts, including 2 (nilgai antelope and black-tailed jackrabbit) that represent new host records for this species. The role of P. porcinus as a pathogen vector is unknown, but its apparent abundance in this region warrants further investigation.

AB  - Termite mounds are keystone structures in African savannas, affecting multiple ecosystem processes. Despite the large size of termite mounds having the potential to modify conditions around them, patterns of mound-induced ecosystem effects have been assumed to be isotropic, with little attention given to how effects might vary around mounds. We measured soil nitrogen content, grass species composition, and mammalian grazing on and off termite mounds in the four cardinal directions, and across wet and dry seasons at three savanna sites varying in mean annual rainfall in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Evidence of directional effects (anisotropy) on ecosystem properties around termite mounds varied with site. Grass species composition differed between north- and south-facing slopes at the two drier sites where mounds were taller. However, differences in grazing extent and soil nitrogen content around mounds were only present at the intermediate rainfall site where mammalian herbivore biomass was highest, and mounds were of medium height. Our results suggest that termite mound effects display significant variation with direction, but that the emergence of directional effects is context dependent. Our results further suggest that such context-dependent directional effects can lead to positive feedback loops between termites, abiotic conditions, and mammalian herbivores.

AB  - Strategies are desperately needed for restoring the millions of hectares of degraded grasslands which have been simultaneously impacted by overgrazing and Caragana shrub encroachment in arid and semiarid areas of northern China. This study evaluated using different combinations of manure amendments and shrub branch shelters for their impacts on soil moisture, nutrient availability, and plant growth over two growing seasons in a degraded grassland in Ningxia, China. A two-factor experiment was conducted, with three concentrations of 1.2 g m(-2), 442 g m(-2), and 884 g m(-2) native Tan sheep manure as the main plots. Cut caragana (Caragana intermedia) branches were used to create branch shelters covering 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% of ground area, and these acted as sub-main plots. Soil water storage, soil temperature, manure decomposition, branch decomposition, soil nutrients, and plant growth were monitored for 2 years. Results indicated that soil water storage was significantly increased, and soil temperature decreased, under the 40% and 60% branch shelters. Decomposition rate of manure and shrub branches also increased with increasing soil water availability associated with the higher branch sheltering effects, although soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations were primarily driven by the decomposing manure. The combination of high levels of shrub branch shelter and manure application significantly enhanced plant production, although the bulk of the biomass was concentrated in one species, Artemis scoparia. In conclusion, our study successfully demonstrated feasible and inexpensive solution for the restoration of degraded grasslands, which takes advantage of resources associated with overgrazing Tan sheep and Caragana shrub encroachment in arid and semiarid areas.

AB  - Spatiotemporal habitat selection by wildlife is an important strategy for adapting to fear of humans and their activities. However, information on the factors that influence the daily activity patterns of herbivores is lacking, especially in areas where there are few lethal human activities (e.g., where there is little hunting pressure). We investigated factors affecting the daily activity patterns of forest-dwelling sika deer (Cervus nippon) in an agricultural landscape with little hunting pressure in Hokkaido, Japan, to determine the mechanisms of wildlife adaptation to non-lethal human activities (defined here as area of farmland and road length). We found that non-lethal human activities did not influence the daily activity patterns of deer in this area. However, daytime activity increased with increasing area of each forest and tended to increase with total tree basal area, and it was greatest in summer Our results suggest that an understanding of the background lethal human activity status within an area is necessary for estimating the influence of non-lethal human activities on the adaptation strategies of wildlife.

AB  - Cisco (Coregonus artedi) once dominated fish communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Restoring the abundance and distribution of this species has emerged as a management priority, yet our understanding of Cisco spawning habitat use is insufficient to characterise habitat needs for these populations and assess whether availability of suitable spawning habitat could be a constraint to recovery. We characterised the distribution of incubating Cisco eggs in situ across gradients of depth and substrate types to describe the spawning habitat used by three Great Lakes populations. In Chaumont Bay, Lake Ontario, eggs were concentrated on shallow bedrock shoals and not found on deeper silt or sand substrate. In contrast, eggs in Thunder Bay, Lake Superior, and Elk Rapids, Lake Michigan, were found on deeper fine grain sediments with low utilisation of shallow rocky and cobble habitats. These patterns of egg incubation habitat use suggest a broad spawning habitat niche at the species level but distinct spawning habitat preferences at the population level. While our results indicate some historical diversity in spawning habitat use has been maintained across the species' range in the Great Lakes, comparisons of contemporary spawning habitat utilisation against historical accounts raise questions as to whether some spawning habitat use behaviours may no longer be prevalent within specific lakes. Thus, characterising the portfolio of spawning strategies remaining within lakes may improve our understanding of habitat needs and identify opportunities to maintain population diversity while supporting Cisco rehabilitation.

AB  - Marine herbivores face rapid changes in the coastal ecosystems where they forage. In the Caribbean, the recent and fast expansion of the invasive phanerogam species Halophila stipulacea is threatening native seagrass ecosystems. So far, H. stipulacea is escaping most Caribbean herbivores, certainly because of its recent introduction or lower nutritional value. We investigated the impact of H. stipulacea invasion on fine-scale foraging habitat selection and food resource selection of immature green turtles at critical foraging sites in Les Anses d'Arlet, Martinique. The analysis of seagrass distribution and nutritional content, together with turtle behaviour and resource selection, showed that H. stipulacea may be of contrasting interest to green turtles. Compositional analysis confirmed the lower nutritional value of H. stipulacea compared to the native species, but the invasive species showed higher digestibility than native ones, which calls into question the energetic advantage of consuming the native plants over the exotic plant. Thus, although green turtles mostly selected the native seagrass Thalassia testudinum in multispecies seagrass beds, some individuals fed on H. stipulacea. Accordingly, in bays entirely invaded by H. stipulacea, one possibility for resident green turtles is to increase foraging on this species, but, if so, the consequences on their growth and survival still remain to be determined. As the expansion of H. stipulacea may have been facilitated by factors such as shipping, anchor scarring and fishing activities, protection of native seagrass beds and immature green turtles from human disturbances is urgently required to ensure the long-term adaptation of green turtles to this new foraging environment.

AB  - Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are a destructive and widespread invasive pest in Australia. An understanding of feral pig movement is required to develop management strategies to control feral pigs in Australia. Because landscape structure can have a strong influence on animal movement, it is important to determine how landscape features facilitate or impede the movement of feral pigs. Consequently, we conducted a landscape genetic analysis of feral pig populations in the Herbert region of far north Queensland, Australia, to determine management units and provide recommendations to better inform feral pig population control strategies. Using microsatellite data obtained from 256 feral pig samples from 44 sites, we examined feral pig population structure at multiple spatial scales for univariate and multivariate landscape resistance surfaces to determine the optimal spatial scale and to identify which of the nine landscape features tested impede or facilitate feral pig gene flow. Only weak genetic structure was found among the 44 sampling sites, but major waterways were identified as a minor barrier to gene flow, and an isolation by distance model was supported. We also found that highways facilitated gene flow across the study area, and this suggests that they may act as movement corridors or indicate translocation of feral pigs. Additionally, incorporating a second spatial scale enhanced the ability of our landscape genetics analysis to detect the influence of landscape structure on gene flow. We identified three management units based on natural barriers to gene flow and future targeted control should be undertaken in these management units to deliver sustained reduction of feral pig populations in the Herbert region. This study demonstrates how a landscape genetic approach can be used to gain insight into the ecology of an invasive pest species and be used to develop population control strategies which utilise natural barriers to movement.

AB  - AimPlants allocate sodium (Na) to leaves and roots as an adaptation to salinity and drought, potentially modulating herbivory and ecosystem carbon cycling. However, large-scale spatial patterns and environmental drivers of plant Na allocation remain unclear.LocationChina and the world.Time PeriodField data were collected between 2013 and 2019. Literature data were collected between 1970 and 2024.Major Taxa StudiedVascular plants.MethodsWe compiled a global database of paired leaf Na (NaLeaf) and root Na (NaRoot) content, combining field observations from 2183 species across 72 Chinese ecosystems with globally synthesised literature records.ResultsThe spatial pattern of plant Na allocation between leaves and roots is primarily regulated by aridity. Generally, plants allocate more Na to roots in humid zones but more to leaves in arid zones. Furthermore, aridification leads to abrupt and non-linear increases in the NaLeaf to NaRoot ratio (NaLeaf:Root) when aridity exceeds the critical threshold (0.814 for the Chinese plant species and 0.774 for the Chinese plant community). Importantly, the threshold response is consistently observed from species to community levels and from China to global biomes.Main ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the flexible allocation of plant Na in response to salinity and drought on a large scale. Projected aridification could amplify leaf Na allocation in threshold-exceeding regions, possibly enhancing the activity of herbivores and decomposers and triggering cascading impacts on plant community structure and carbon cycling rate.

AB  - Scattered oaks in traditional silvopastoral systems (i.e., "dehesas") provide important ecological services. However, livestock intensification applied to these systems over the last century has affected the architecture of young oak plants. This unsuitable rangeland management practice jeopardizes the long-term system sustainability. Here we examine the alterations in architecture of regenerating oak plants in Mediterranean dehesas under three representative management regimes: (1) traditional management with extensive sheep grazing; (2) commercially driven management with extensive cattle grazing, and (3) native deer grazing at moderate stocking rates (<0.11 livestock units x ha(-1)). Plant architecture was considerably altered in cattle-grazed "dehesas", finding a 50% reduction in plant height-diameter ratios, compared to sheep-grazed dehesas where plants with higher height-diameter ratios predominated. Young oak plants, however, showed less altered architecture and less probability of damage on shoot apex (0.20-fold difference) in areas with deer grazing at moderate stocking rates. In addition, those young oak plants with multi-stemmed individual architecture were more stunted (lower values of crown height-diameter ratio) in areas with livestock grazing than wildlife areas (0.78-fold difference). Shrub presence, under all management schemes, helped to increase in plant height, except when shrubs were located under tree canopies. Conversely, plants without shrub protection showed stunted architecture with well-developed basal diameters but short stature. Appropriate sustainable practices should include cattle stocking rate reduction, traditional sheep grazing promotion, nurse shrub preservation and fencing stunted individuals along with pruning basal sprouts. Our study indicates that management may have important consequences on dehesa regeneration via alterations of plant architecture and therefore on system sustainability.

AB  - The protobranch Aequiyoldia eightsii is one of the most common bivalves in Antarctica and for the first time, its population structure was studied in Admiralty Bay, an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), to establish a baseline for future monitoring. Density, size structure, length-weight relationship, condition index, and shell morphometry were evaluated at the shallow coastal zone of the bay. High abundance values of A. eightsii were related to sites with greater contributions of mud particles and total organic carbon contents in the sediment, while the condition indexes were higher in Martel Inlet, possibly due to higher food availability. Individuals obtained from gravel-rich sediments were significantly larger than compressed, while rounded forms were observed in sandy and muddy bottoms of the bay. Positive allometric growth was reported in most sites, except Botany Point, where specimens presented an isometric growth. The results demonstrated that the sediment composition and its organic content influence the population structure of A. eightsii as well as biological factors such as predation and recruitment rates. It is also worth noting that the phenotypic shell variability observed for this protobranch species in geographically close sites (hundreds of meters) highlights the importance of local-scale heterogeneity to be considered in future monitoring programmes for Antarctic marine ecosystems.

AB  - Poaching poses a significant threat to wildlife and ecosystems in southeast Angola, yet comprehensive studies to inform effective conservation strategies have been lacking. This novel study systematically assesses the spatial distribution and influencing factors of poaching activities in the region. Utilizing data from extensive patrolling efforts and predictive modeling, the hotspots and risk zones for wire-snares, gin traps, elephant poaching, and poaching camps are delineated. Our findings reveal distinctive socio-political and geo-ecological patterns governing each type of illegal activity. Wire-snares and gin traps display clear socio-political correlates, with proximity to towns and villages influencing their prevalence. These findings advocate for strategic placement of patrol stations and underscore the need for expanded law enforcement efforts to mitigate these threats. Conversely, elephant poaching for ivory exhibits transboundary influences, with heightened risk zones along international borders. This highlights the urgency of collaborative, transboundary management strategies to counteract external drivers of elephant poaching. Geo-ecologically, closed habitats dominated by woody vegetation, such as shrublands and closed woodlands, are favored for wire-snares and gin traps, likely due to reduced detection risk. Riparian habitats emerge as high-risk areas for elephant poaching and fishing camps, highlighting their importance for targeted conservation interventions. The fine-scale spatial analysis guides resource allocation and law enforcement strategies, while the identification of distinct threat sources informs proactive measures. To curb local demand-driven poaching, community-based conservation and alternative livelihood initiatives are recommended.

AB  - ObjectiveWe used two approaches, fish hard-part microchemistry and genetics, to quantify effects of low-use lock-and-dam structures on riverine fish movement. Each approach varied in temporal scope, with microchemistry addressing effects within a lifetime and genetics addressing effects across generations.MethodsWater samples and individuals of two species (Paddlefish Polyodon spathula and Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus) were collected from four river sections that were separated by three low-use lock-and-dam structures on the Alabama River. Quarterly water samples were collected from 15 sites during 2017-2018, and concentrations of Sr, Ba, Mn, Mg, and Ca were quantified using mass spectrometry.ResultWater elemental signatures were spatially variable but temporally consistent. The Sr:Ca ratios in fish hard parts differed significantly among river sections for both species. Additionally, discriminant function analyses classified fish to their river capture section with accuracy between 55% and 74% for Paddlefish (errors nearly always assigned individuals to adjacent river sections) and 37-47% for Smallmouth Buffalo. Population genetic analyses included fish from each river section, as well as from Alabama River tributaries and a neighboring watershed. Genotyping-by-sequence techniques identified 1,889 and 3,737 single nucleotide polymorphisms postfiltering in Paddlefish and Smallmouth Buffalo, respectively, which we used to estimate population diversity indices and conduct differentiation analyses. Analysis of molecular variance, discriminant analysis of principal components, Bayesian clustering, and pairwise comparisons of F-ST values indicated no strong evidence for genetic divergence in either species among river sections.ConclusionWithin-lifespan results based on hard-part microchemistry suggested a potential for population isolation. However, longer-term genetic effects were not apparent, possibly because the life span of these large and relatively long-lived species means that few generations have passed since dam construction, and there could be sufficient mixing or population connectivity to prevent genetic divergence across river sections, particularly at the most downstream structure.

AB  - Quantifying the consequences of winter ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) on the body condition and life-history traits of moose (Alces alces) is a challenge due to several confounding factors. We experimentally reduced tick load on moose calves by testing the effectiveness of 2 acaricide treatments: one using topical permethrin (5%) alone and the other a combination of a more concentrated topical permethrin (44%) and orally administered fluralaner (25 mg/kg). We evaluated changes in tick load, body mass, hematocrit, and hair loss severity and occurrence, from recaptured or resighted moose calves over winter in Qu & eacute;bec and New Brunswick, Canada. Nearly all untreated moose (94%, n = 41) experienced hair loss compared to calves that received the combination of permethrin (44%) and fluralaner (41%, n = 37). Of treated moose that exhibited hair loss, only 22% had more than 5% damage and some already had hair loss at capture. Capturing moose later likely increased the probability of observing hair loss when resighting treated moose, although hair loss essentially remained lower for treated calves than for untreated calves. In untreated moose, tick load at capture tended to drive hair loss, but calendar date mostly drove hair loss severity, especially during April. There was no clear effect of topical permethrin (5%) on tick load, body mass, and hematocrit. Body condition simply decreased from January captures to spring recaptures, regardless of treatment. Our results suggested that combining permethrin (44%) and fluralaner effectively reduced tick load based on hair loss severity and occurrence. We cannot, however, disentangle the individual effects of permethrin (44%) and fluralaner. We discuss research implications and considerations of using such a treatment for reducing winter tick load.

AB  - The decomposition of animal bodies is a process defined by specific stages, described by the state of the body and participation of certain guilds of invertebrates and microorganisms. While the participation of invertebrates in decomposing is well-studied and actively used in crime scene investigations, information on bacteria and fungi from the scene is rarely collected or used in the identification of important factors such as estimated time of death. Modern molecular techniques such as DNA metabarcoding allow the identification and quantification of the composition of microbial communities. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding to monitor fungal succession during the decomposition of juvenile pigs in grasslands of New Jersey, USA. Our findings show that decomposition stages differ in a diversity of fungal communities. In particular, we noted increased fungal species richness in the more advanced stages of decomposition (e.g., bloat and decay stages), with unique fungal taxa becoming active with the progression of decay. Overall, our findings improve knowledge of how fungi contribute to forensically relevant decomposition and could help with the assessment of crime scenes.

AB  - Introduction: In tropical forests, populations of medium and large mammals are being impacted by human activities. Understanding how species respond to land use conversion, fragmentation, and the encroachment of roads density and settlements is of conservation interest in highly biodiverse regions. Objetive: To assess the effect of human disturbance and environmental variables on trophic guilds of medium and large mammals in the tropical forests of the Sierra Negra-Mazateca in southern Mexico. Methods: We characterized the landscape (land use and vegetation, number of fragments, and edge density) through supervised classification of Landsat 8 images. We recorded species using camera-trap stations and evaluated the relationship between the presence and relative abundance of species with human disturbance variables using zero-inflated regression models. Results: The landscape of the Sierra Negra-Mazateca is dominated by fragments of secondary forests (48.6 %) with a small proportion of primary forests (9.6 %). We found no differences in the overall relative abundance of species between primary and secondary forests, but differences were observed for omnivore and carnivore guilds. Human disturbances had a disparate effect among guilds, negatively affecting carnivores and positively herbivores. Conclusions: Secondary forests are refuges for tolerant species. Nevertheless, we emphasize the need to conserve primary forests and safeguard medium and large mammals, especially the carnivore guild. Extensive management in secondary forests is recommended to conserve remaining primary forests, alongside community awareness and empowerment for coexistence with wildlife.

AB  - Aboveground and belowground invertebrates play a key role in decomposition of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. Dung beetles are well known for their functions in breaking down and transporting ungulate dung into soils thus promoting dung decomposition. However, the effects of functionally different dung beetles on the decomposition processes of the dung from different ungulates remain less explored. We did an in situ experiment using the 'dung and soil' mesocosm to investigate the separate and combined effects of two functionally contrasting dung beetle species, a dweller Aphodius sordecens and a tunneler Onthophagus gibbulus, on the decom-position processes of the dung from horse and cattle. We determined the changes in dung mass, dung C and N contents, microbial respiration from the 'dung and soil' mesocosm or from the soil beneath the dung pats, and examined the amount of dung balls transferred by beetles into different soil layers, under five dung beetle treatments (C - soil, no dung nor beetles; D - dung on soil with no beetles; DB - dung on soil with dweller beetles; TB - dung on soil with tunneler beetles; DTB - dung on soil with dweller and tunneler beetles) were applied to the dung of two major grazers with different digestive systems in native steppes in northern China, over a two-month period following dung deposition. We found that (1) tunneler beetles (in TB and DTB) significantly enhanced the dry mass loss of cattle dung but not horse dung. (2) Dung C and N contents declined more rapidly with the presence of any dung beetle species (DB-DTB) than that without (D); and dung N content showed different decreasing rates between horse and cattle dung in different decomposition periods. (3) The presence of the two functionally contrasting dung beetle species together had a synergistic, positive effect on soil microbial respiration and thus on the decomposition rate of soil organic matter; however, no significant effects of beetles on net microbial respiration was detected in the 'dung + soil' mesocosm. (4) The direct effect of dung beetles on dung mass loss was stronger for cattle dung than for horse dung. In contrast, the decline in moisture content of horse dung with decomposition time affected the microbial respiration in dung, and thus indirectly affected the dry mass loss and the C and N contents. Our results suggest it critically important to incorporate the functions of soil invertebrates into nutrient cycling models to improve their accuracy, and to promote invertebrate diversity in grazed grassland to maintain ecosystem health and services.

AB  - Soil acidification is common in some Chinese tea plantations, which seriously affected growth of tea trees. Hence, it is essential to explore soil remediation in acidified tea plantations for sustainable development of the tea industry. We sought to determine how different fertilizers affect acidified soil and their N transformation in tea plantations.Different fertilizers were used on acidified tea plantation soils for 4 years (2017-2021), and changes in soil pH, indices related to soil N transformation and tea yield were analysed to construct interaction networks of these indices and find which had the largest influence on fertilization.Long-term use of sheep manure reduced soil acidification, increased soil pH, enhanced the number and intensity of N-fixing and ammonifying bacteria, urease, protease, asparaginase and N-acetamide glucose ribosidase activity and nifH gene expression. This treatment reduced the number and intensity of soil nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase activity, while the expression of amoA-AOA, nirK, nirS, narG and nosZ in turn increased ammonium N content of the soil, reduced nitrate N content, and enhanced tea yield. Topsis index weight analysis showed that ammonium N content in the soil had the largest impact among fertilization effects.Long-term use of sheep manure was beneficial in restoring the balance of the micro-ecosystem in acidified soil. This study provides an important practical basis for soil remediation and fertilizer management in acidified tea plantation soils.

AB  - The rapid decline of species is an alarming issue that needs immediate attention. With this in mind, the Red List and Green List were introduced by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to provide baseline information concerning the statuses of wildlife in their range. In this study, field and participatory surveys spanning two decades were combined to reassess priorities, threats, and risks for marine species in Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia. Briefly, 11 marine species were recorded, with a total of 561 geo-tagged records. The only difference between the field surveys and the respondent estimates was the projected number of individuals for each species. Although the diversity and evenness values were relatively high in the marine zone, they indicated stability within populations because the species were distributed uniformly. In contrast, the results of the InVEST HRA model indicated a greater risk from fishing (65.72%) and coastal development (54.68%) when approaching the interior of the river in the riverine zone. These human activities may have been responsible for the declining-absence of dugong populations from 2001-2019. Overall, the reality of this threat is severe and much more alarming than the dugong's 'vulnerable' status on the IUCN Red List. Although spatial planning enhances local and global species recoveries, the existing conservation strategies seem outdated. Revision is needed, and the pace could increase with proposals of regular monitoring. Timely modifications could be made with these strategies until satisfaction (i.e., species recovery) is reached at Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) are major conservation concerns that threaten both wildlife and rural livelihoods, and can vary spatially and temporally in diverse environments. A better un-derstanding of HWC enhances mitigation strategies and promotes human-wildlife coexistence. We gathered HWC incidents from 2012 to 2021 in Longyang District, Yunnan Province, China, to assess their spatial-temporal patterns and determinants. We found that HWC were distributed unevenly, with more occurring near the protected area and away from densely populated areas. Poisson regression indicated that forests and croplands were the key factors influencing the spatial patterns of HWC for Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), but shrubs for rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Furthermore, the HWC occurrences fluctuated across time, peaking in August -October. These conflicts intensified between 2012 and 2021, mainly involving wild boars (Sus scrofa) and rhesus monkeys, while HWC involving Asiatic black bears declined slightly. We suggest a multi-faceted strategy with compensation, prevention, and conservation awareness to mitigate HWC in this region.

AB  - Spatial neophobia and exploration are often assessed in nonhuman animals by measuring behavioral responses to novel environments. These traits may especially affect the performance of individuals translocated to novel environments for conservation purposes. Here, we present methods to administer and analyze a minimally invasive novel environment test that accounts for the social context of focal individuals. We used an aerial platform to capture video footage of a captive herd of scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) entering an unfamiliar enclosure. We analyzed footage for seven individually identifiable oryx, scoring their behavioral responses (i.e., latency to enter the enclosure, and movement and posture after entering the enclosure) and social context (i.e., relative position and number of nearby animals). We performed a principal components analysis (PCA) to explore individual traits and responses, and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to determine the effect of individual traits and social context on individual posture and movement behaviors. Both PCA and GLMMs supported our expectation that social context affects individual behavior: high neighbor density and relative position were negatively related to individual movement, and variation in social context was positively related with head-up postures and movement. Oryx were well differentiated along two principal components that reflected (1) vigilance or caution, and (2) changing social context and age. These methods provide a framework for assessing individual responses to a novel environment in a group setting, which can inform reintroduction and wildlife management efforts, while minimizing interference with animal behavior and management operations.

AB  - Slaughterhouses in The Gambia serve as critical feeding sites for diverse vertebrate scavenger communities, including hooded vultures, domestic dogs, pigs and avian species such as pied crows, black kites and cattle egrets. This study investigated how the quantity and type of organic waste influence the composition and competitive interactions of scavengers across five slaughterhouses. Using multivariate statistical models, we found that waste quantity was the strongest predictor of scavenger community composition, explaining 32.7% of the variation, with hooded vultures being most abundant at high-waste sites. Specific waste types influenced feeding behaviour, suggesting niche differentiation among species; for instance, cattle egrets focused on blood and insects, while vultures dominated meat-based resources. Competitive interactions varied by species, with domestic dogs frequently displacing vultures without physical conflict, whereas hooded vultures dominated interactions against other birds. Activity patterns revealed temporal separation, with vultures and dogs active primarily in the morning, and other avian scavengers more active in the afternoon, reducing interspecific competition. The study highlights the essential role of hooded vultures in waste management and disease mitigation but also emphasises how poor fencing facilitates mammalian access, intensifying competition and potentially threatening obligate scavengers. Improving fencing, controlling feeding, and incorporating targeted waste management strategies are recommended to support scavenger conservation and enhance ecosystem services in urbanised environments.

AB  - In Australia, livestock predation by dingoes (Canis familiaris) has contributed to what some livestock producers consider a dire situation for rangeland pastoralism, driving demand for cooperative regional-scale exclusion ('cell') fencing (i.e. pest-proof fences that encompass one or more individual properties) and landscape-scale predator control. The present case study predicted the effect of four cell-fences in the state of Western Australia (WA) on the gross margin of sheep (for meat or meat and wool) and cattle pastoral enterprises. We modelled the potential effects of the following four key variables: (1) four levels of commodity prices, (2) five levels of livestock weaning rate (based on livestock records collected 1985-1995; weaning rate is defined as number of lambs or calves that are born and survive to weaning, expressed as percentage of total mated females), (3) three predicted levels of time required to remove dingoes from within the fenced area, and (4) five levels of macropod (mainly kangaroo) response as competitive grazers, with a total of 3600 scenarios representing all combinations of these factors. Each scenario was assessed for profitability (i.e. net present value (NPV) over 25 years) and benefit of fencing (i.e. NPV compared with an unfenced enterprise of the same livestock type, region, and commodity prices). Finally, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of investment in cell fencing was calculated for each fenced scenario. The majority (67%) of scenarios representing continuation of current management (i.e. no cell fencing) returned a negative NPV (i.e. livestock enterprises were projected to make a loss). However, only 37.4% of cell-fenced scenarios returned a positive NPV, meaning that even with a cell-fence and successful removal of dingoes, the enterprise was still unlikely to be profitable. Only 43.4% of cell-fenced scenarios returned a BCR of cell fencing greater than one. Weaning rate following dingo removal was the most important factor determining return on investment for cell-fencing. Survival and reproduction of small livestock, particularly wool sheep, benefit most from cell-fencing, whereas cell-fencing and dingo removal did not result in greater profits for cattle enterprises. Running sheep for wool and meat within cell fencing coupled with removal of dingoes would maximise the likelihood of achieving a positive return on investment in cell fencing (although the enterprise may remain unprofitable overall); otherwise, unfenced enterprises affected by dingoes should run cattle as this will be more profitable.

AB  - Biological repellents have been used as a control method to mitigate human-wildlife conflict worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the effect of jaguar (Panthera onca) feces as a repellent for a free-living urban population of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), which are considered a vertebrate pest in some regions of their range. Observational data were collected during two consecutive 5-day periods: control and treatment. Scan samples within a 2-h observational session were carried out, recording capybara incursions into a 15 m x 15 m marked perimeter and alertness behavioral state. During the treatment period, 30 g of jaguar feces were added daily every 5.0 m around the perimeter in four selected areas (around Lake Paranoa, Brasilia, Brazil) frequented by capybara. The presence of predator feces induced changes in capybaras' behavior as there was a decrease in actual presence at the sites as a whole with the presence of jaguar feces. Of those capybaras that did continue to visit a site, incursions into the marked perimeter were initially greatly reduced, but did rebound relatively rapidly over the trial period. Although our results showed that capybaras recognize jaguar's feces as a predator threat, odor habituation may limit the repellent's efficacy at a local level, but appeared to have a longer term effect on the overall numbers of capybara visiting a site in general. Improvements in this technique will be required for it to become practicable, to reinforce capybaras' aversion to predators, to decrease their habituation to predator's feces, and to provide more humanitarian control.

AB  - Seeds and seedlings are the most critical stages of cacti life cycles. From the thousands of seeds produced in a reproductive season, only a small fraction successfully germinate, the rest are lost to predation, go dormant, and remain viable in the seed bank, or lose viability. These early stages often depend on facilitation by nurse plants for germination and seedling recruitment. We aim to prescribe actions for the conservation of Cephalocereus polylophus by improving recruitment in the population. The viability of seeds with different storage times was evaluated as an indicator of their potential to form a short-term seed bank. Through the analysis of seed germination and seedling survival under the canopy of two nurse plant species and open areas, we assessed the importance of facilitation for recruitment. A predator exclusion experiment evaluated the intensity of granivory and herbivory on seedlings of different ages. Seeds had germination rates above 90% under laboratory conditions, even after 2 years of storage. Seed germination was only registered under one of the two nurses and after 2 years, up to 4% of the seedlings planted under both nurse plants survived. Age and protection against herbivores increased seedlings survival. Facilitation and age are crucial for the recruitment of C. polylophus, and future conservation programs should include the protection of plant communities and the introduction of seedlings instead of seeds.

AB  - This paper presents two new pollen records and quantitative climate reconstructions from northern Chukotka documenting environmental changes over the last 27.9 ka. Open tundra- and steppe-like habitats dominated between 27.9 and 18.7 cal. ka BP. Betula and Alnus shrubs might have grown in sheltered microhabitats but disappeared after 18.7 cal. ka BP. Although the climate was rather harsh, local herb-dominated communities supported herbivores as is evident by the presence of coprophilous spores in the sediments. The increase in Salix and Cyperaceae similar to 16.1 cal. ka BP suggests climate amelioration. Shrub Betula appeared similar to 15.9 cal. ka BP, and became dominant after similar to 15.52 cal. ka BP, whilst typical steppe communities drastically reduced. Very high presence of Botryococcus in the Lateglacial sediments reflects widespread shallow habitats, probably due to lake level increase. Shrub Alnus became common after similar to 13 cal. ka BP reflecting further climate amelioration. Simultaneously, herb communities gradually decreased in the vegetation reaching a minimum similar to 11.8 cal. ka BP. A gradual decrease of algae remains suggests a reduction of shallow-water habitats. Shrubby and graminoid tundra was dominant similar to 11.8-11.1 cal. ka BP, later Salix stands significantly decreased. The forest-tundra ecotone established in the Early Holocene, shortly after 11.1 cal. ka BP. Low contents of green algae in the Early Holocene sediments likely reflect deeper aquatic conditions. The most favourable climate conditions were between similar to 10.6 and 7 cal. ka BP. Vegetation became similar to the modern after similar to 7 cal. ka BP but Pinus pumila came to the Ilirney area at about 1.2 cal. ka BP. It is important to emphasize that the study area provided refugia for Betula and Alnus during MIS 2. It is also notable that our records do not reflect evidence of Younger Dryas cooling, which is inconsistent with some regional environmental records but in good accordance with some others.

AB  - Aim Many species experienced population turnover and local extinction during the Late Pleistocene. In the case of megafauna, it remains challenging to disentangle climate change and the activities of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers as the main cause. In contrast, the impact of humans on rodent populations is likely to be negligible. This study investigated which climatic and/or environmental factors affect the population dynamics of the common vole. This temperate rodent is widespread across Europe and was one of the most abundant small mammal species throughout the Late Pleistocene. Location Europe. Taxon Common vole (Microtus arvalis). Methods We generated a dataset comprised of 4.2 kb long fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 148 ancient and 51 modern specimens sampled from multiple localities across Europe and covering the last 60 thousand years (ka). We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and to estimate the age of the specimens that were not directly dated. Results We estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor of all last glacial and extant common vole lineages to be 90 ka ago and the divergence of the main mtDNA lineages present in extant populations to between 55 and 40 ka ago, which is earlier than most previous estimates. We detected several lineage turnovers in Europe during the period of high climate variability at the end of Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3; 57-29 ka ago) in addition to those found previously around the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In contrast, data from the Western Carpathians suggest continuity throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) even at high latitudes. Main Conclusions The main factor affecting the common vole populations during the last glacial period was the decrease in open habitat during the interstadials, whereas climate deterioration during the LGM had little impact on population dynamics. This suggests that the rapid environmental change rather than other factors was the major force shaping the histories of the Late Pleistocene faunas.

AB  - Aim Mechanistic general ecosystem models are used to explore fundamental ecological dynamics and to assess possible consequences of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on ecosystems. The Madingley model is a mechanistic general ecosystem model (GEM) that simulates a coherent global ecosystem, consisting of photo-autotrophic and heterotrophic life, based on fundamental ecological processes. The C++ implementation of the Madingley model delivers fast computational performance, but it (a) limits the userbase to researchers that are familiar with the intricacies of C++ programming, (b) has limited possibility to change model settings and provide model outputs required to address specific research questions, and (c) has limited reproducibility of simulation experiments. The aim of this paper is to present an R package of the Madingley model to aid with increasing the accessibility and flexibility of the model. Innovation The MadingleyR R package streamlines the installation procedure and supports all major operating systems. MadingleyR enables users to combine multiple consecutive simulations, making case study specific modifications to MadingleyR objects along the way. Default input files are available from the package and study-specific inputs can be easily loaded from the R environment. MadingleyR also provides functions to plot and summarize MadingleyR outputs. We provide a comprehensive description of the MadingleyR functions and workflow. We also demonstrate the applicability of the MadingleyR package using three case studies: (a) simulating the cascading effects of the loss of mega-herbivores on food-web structure, (b) simulating the impacts of increased land-use intensity on the total biomass of different feeding guilds by restricting the total vegetation biomass available for feeding and (c) simulating the impacts of an intensive land-use scenario on a continental scale. Main conclusions The MadingleyR package provides direct accessibility to simulations with the mechanistic ecosystem model Madingley and is flexible in its application without a loss in performance.

AB  - A central debate in ecology has been the long-running discussion on the role of apex predators in affecting the abundance and dynamics of their prey. In terrestrial systems, research has primarily relied on correlational approaches, due to the challenge of implementing robust experiments with replication and appropriate controls. A consequence of this is that we largely suffer from a lack of mechanistic understanding of the population dynamics of interacting species, which can be surprisingly complex. Mechanistic models offer an opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of some of this complexity. We present a bioenergetic mechanistic model of a tritrophic system where the primary vegetation resource follows a seasonal growth function, and the herbivore and carnivore species are modeled using two integral projection models (IPMs) with body mass as the phenotypic trait. Within each IPM, the demographic functions are structured according to bioenergetic principles, describing how animals acquire and transform resources into body mass, energy reserves, and breeding potential. We parameterize this model to reproduce the population dynamics of grass, elk, and wolves in northern Yellowstone National Park (USA) and investigate the impact of wolf reintroduction on the system. Our model generated predictions that closely matched the observed population sizes of elk and wolf in Yellowstone prior to and following wolf reintroduction. The introduction of wolves into our basal grass-elk bioenergetic model resulted in a population of 99 wolves and a reduction in elk numbers by 61% (from 14,948 to 5823) at equilibrium. In turn, vegetation biomass increased by approximately 25% in the growing season and more than threefold in the nongrowing season. The addition of wolves to the model caused the elk population to switch from being food-limited to being predator-limited and had a stabilizing effect on elk numbers across different years. Wolf predation also led to a shift in the phenotypic composition of the elk population via a small increase in elk average body mass. Our model represents a novel approach to the study of predator-prey interactions, and demonstrates that explicitly considering and linking bioenergetics, population demography and body mass phenotypes can provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind complex ecosystem processes.

AB  - Understanding the linkages within complex and evolving marine food webs is essential to comprehend marine ecosystem structure and dynamics. Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope signatures are recognized to be powerful descriptors of the trophic ecology and trophic relationships within marine communities. Apex predators such as seabirds can influence the structure of communities by predating in lower trophic levels. They also convey information both over a range of spatial and temporal scales due to their high mobility and longevity, respectively. For this reason, here, we studied the trophic ecology of northern gannets and the extent of niche overlap with other apex predators within the Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic), a key feeding area for numerous predatory species. Mixing models indicated that northern gannets fed primarily on European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and on a mixed group composed of European sardine Sardina pilchardus, European sprat Sprattus sprattus, juvenile hake Merluccius merluccius, Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus and Atlantic horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus. Within the apex predator community, the northern gannets trophic niche overlapped the most with common guillemots Uria aalge (15.58%, based on Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses (SIBER)) and overlapped to a lesser extent with cetacean species occupying shelf habitats (i.e., the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena (9.99%) and the short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis (10.37%)). Overall, the overlap found was moderate indicating trophic similarities and dissimilarities between these species. Information on trophic interactions between co-existing species is necessary for holistic environmental management, particularly in areas where several megafauna species share their foraging grounds with fisheries activity.

AB  - Simple Summary We proposed a pragmatic method for quantifying the grazing density (GD) and herding proximities (HP) based on unmanned aerial vehicles. We further tested its feasibility at three typical household pastures on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. The proposed method is ideal for studying animal behavior and determining the correlation between the distribution of pastoral livestock and resource usability.Abstract Grazing management is one of the most widely practiced land uses globally. Quantifying the spatiotemporal distribution of livestock is critical for effective management of livestock-grassland grazing ecosystem. However, to date, there are few convincing solutions for livestock dynamic monitor and key parameters quantification under actual grazing situations. In this study, we proposed a pragmatic method for quantifying the grazing density (GD) and herding proximities (HP) based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We further tested its feasibility at three typical household pastures on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. We found that: (1) yak herds grazing followed a rotational grazing pattern spontaneously within the pastures, (2) Dispersion Index of yak herds varied as an M-shaped curve within one day, and it was the lowest in July and August, and (3) the average distance between the yak herd and the campsites in the cold season was significantly shorter than that in the warm season. In this study, we developed a method to characterize the dynamic GD and HP of yak herds precisely and effectively. This method is ideal for studying animal behavior and determining the correlation between the distribution of pastoral livestock and resource usability, delivering critical information for the development of grassland ecosystem and the implementation of sustainable grassland management.

AB  - Military training areas can host important biodiversity, due to the preservation of diverse, nutrient-poor historical cultural landscapes and an insect-friendly disturbance regime. In Europe, many training areas were abandoned after the end of the cold war in 1991 and the withdrawal of the Allied and Soviet forces. Many of these are now protected areas, and current management strategies vary from rewilding to active habitat management such as grazing or mowing. In a capture-release-recapture approach, marking 2418 individuals, we assessed the population size and movement patterns of the dry ecotype of the Marsh Fritillary Euphydryas aurinia Rottemburg 1775 on three former military training areas in Germany that varied in size and management (natural succession, mowing, and sheep-/goat grazing). Euphydryas aurinia is a rare and declining butterfly species listed in Annex II of the European Union Habitats Directive. Jolly-Seber models revealed a large population of ca. 19,000 individuals on the largest study site and a smaller population at a second site, whereas recapture rates were too low to predict the population size reliably at a third site. Population densities were 190-194 butterflies ha(-1) at the unmanaged, large site and 56-71 butterflies ha(-1) at a smaller site grazed with sheep. Thirty-nine percent of the recapture events occurred within the same 1-ha-study plot. The average minimum flight distance between the study plots was 313 m for males and 328 m for females. The maximum lifetime flight distance was 1237 m within 3 days. No dispersal was detected between study sites. Thirty years after cessation of the military use, the large former training site still held what likely is one of the largest populations of the species dry ecotype in Central Europe, including in areas where management ceased already in 1991. This suggests remarkable persistence of the species in areas without regular management, contrary to current opinion. However, regular flight distances seem not to be sufficient to connect the isolated habitat patches. It remains unknown how long the large population at the abandoned military area will persist without active habitat management. Careful, but active habitat management and restoration of habitat connectivity should thus be considered.

AB  - Stoneworts (Charales) are green algae that represent an important food resource for many waterbird species in Europe and elsewhere. Browsing avian herbivores (e.g. swan, goose, duck and coot species) consume Charales plant vegetative parts, by head-dipping, up-ending or diving. A lower fibre content and longer growing season may make Charales as attractive to such herbivores as sympatric submerged higher plant species in some circumstances. Charales respond to environmental stress (e.g. drought) by producing abundant diaspores, in the form of oospores (sexual) and bulbils (asexual), both rich in starch, generating abundant food for waterbirds at critical stages in their annual migratory cycles. Waterbirds feed on these by diving (e.g. common pochard Aythya ferina and red-crested pochard Netta rufina) or by filtering from the water column (e.g. dabbling duck species), ensuring dispersal of sexually produced and vegetative diaspores locally (because of predator swamping) and remotely (through endo- and ectozoochorous dispersal by long-distance migratory waterbirds). Greater invertebrate density and diversity associated with Charales canopies enhances their attractiveness over other submerged macrophyte beds to diving predators [e.g. tufted duck Aythya fuligula, common pochard and Eurasian coot Fulica atra (hereafter coot)]. Fish fry preying on these invertebrates use such vegetation as predator cover, in turn providing prey for avian piscivores such as grebes and cormorants. Abundant Charales contribute to maintaining a transparent water column due to canopy density, nutrient effects, dampening of sedimentation/remobilisation of suspended matter and nutrients and allelopathic effects on other plants (especially phytoplankton). Shallow, relatively eutrophic waters can flip between clear-water high-biodiversity (where Charales thrive) and turbid species-poor depauperate stable states (lacking Charales). Shifts between turbid conditions and rich submerged Charales beds have profound elevating effects on aquatic diversity, to which waterbirds show rapid aggregative responses, making them ideal indicator species of ecological change; in the case of Charales specialists (such as red-crested and common pochard), indicators of the presence and abundance of these plants. Large-bodied colonial nesting birds (e.g. cormorants, gulls, heron and egrets) aggregating along lake shores contribute high N and P loadings to water bodies sensitive to such external and internal inputs and can cause local eutrophication and potential loss of Charales. Despite variation from complete seasonal removal of Charales biomass to undetectable grazing effects by herbivorous birds, evidence suggests little effect of avian grazing on biomass accumulation or the stability of community composition (under otherwise stable conditions), but we urge more research on this under-researched topic. We also lack investigations of the relative foraging profitability of different Charales organs to waterbirds and the degree of viability of gyrogonites (fertilised and calcified oospores), vegetative bulbils and plant fragments after passage through the guts of waterbirds. We especially need to understand better how much the carbonate armour of these organs affects their viability/dispersal via waterbirds and urge more research on these neglected plants and their relationships and interactions with other organisms in the aquatic biota.

AB  - Pesticides have well-documented negative consequences to control crop pests, and natural predators are alternatives and can provide an ecosystem service as biological control agents. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding whether such biological control can be a widely applicable solution, especially given ongoing climatic variation and climate change. Here, we performed a meta-analysis focused on field studies with natural predators to explore broadly whether and how predators might control pests and in turn increase yield. We also contrasted across studies pest suppression by a single and multiple predators and how climate influence biological control. Predators reduced pest populations by 73% on average, and increased crop yield by 25% on average. Surprisingly, the impact of predators did not depend on whether there were many or a single predator species. Precipitation seasonality was a key climatic influence on biological control: as seasonality increased, the impact of predators on pest populations increased. Taken together, the positive contribution of predators in controlling pests and increasing yield, and the consistency of such responses in the face of precipitation variability, suggest that biocontrol has the potential to be an important part of pest management and increasing food supplies as the planet precipitation patterns become increasingly variable.

AB  - Large terrestrial mammals increasingly rely on human-modified landscapes as anthropogenic footprints expand. Land management activities such as timber harvest, agriculture, and roads can influence prey population dynamics by altering forage resources and predation risk via changes in habitat, but these effects are not well understood in regions with diverse and changing predator guilds. In northeastern Washington state, USA, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are vulnerable to multiple carnivores, including recently returned gray wolves (Canis lupus), within a highly human-modified landscape. To understand the factors governing predator-prey dynamics in a human context, we radio-collared 280 white-tailed deer, 33 bobcats (Lynx rufus), 50 cougars (Puma concolor), 28 coyotes (C. latrans), and 14 wolves between 2016 and 2021. We first estimated deer vital rates and used a stage-structured matrix model to estimate their population growth rate. During the study, we observed a stable to declining deer population (lambda = 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.88, 1.05), with 74% of Monte Carlo simulations indicating population decrease and 26% of simulations indicating population increase. We then fit Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate how predator exposure, use of human-modified landscapes, and winter severity influenced deer survival and used these relationships to evaluate impacts on overall population growth. We found that the population growth rate was dually influenced by a negative direct effect of apex predators and a positive effect of timber harvest and agricultural areas. Cougars had a stronger effect on deer population dynamics than wolves, and mesopredators had little influence on the deer population growth rate. Areas of recent timber harvest had 55% more forage biomass than older forests, but horizontal visibility did not differ, suggesting that timber harvest did not influence predation risk. Although proximity to roads did not affect the overall population growth rate, vehicle collisions caused a substantial proportion of deer mortalities, and reducing these collisions could be a win-win for deer and humans. The influence of apex predators and forage indicates a dual limitation by top-down and bottom-up factors in this highly human-modified system, suggesting that a reduction in apex predators would intensify density-dependent regulation of the deer population owing to limited forage availability.

AB  - Spermatozoa collected from the cauda epididymis of wild ruminants are more cryoresistant than are ejaculated spermatozoa. This work examines the effects of lactoferrin (LF) and phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), which are abundant in the epididymal sperm of wild ruminants, as additives in Iberian ibex and mouflon sperm extenders. In addition, LF was added to a vitrification medium to determine whether it also provided protection during the cryopreservation of testicular tissue. Epididymal sperm samples and testes were recovered post-mortem from ibexes (n = 13) and mouflons (n = 8) during the breeding season. Ejaculates were collected from both species (n = 10 each) using the transrectal ultrasound-guided massage technique. Four aliquots were taken from each sample, diluted in the appropriate freezing extender for each species, and subjected to the following treatments: control, LF (100 mu g/ml), PGAM2 (25 mu g/ml), and LF + PGAM2. Testicular tissue was cut into small pieces and cryopreserved by needle-immersed vitrification in a medium with or without LF. In vivo fertilization capacity was assessed using frozen-thawed ejaculated sperm from the ibexes. Supplementation of extenders with LF or PGAM2, and their combination, had no beneficial or harmful effect on any sperm variable after freezing-thawing. Artificial insemination of ibexes showed that the fertility rate in controls was 62.5 %, but this fell to 20 % in females inseminated with sperm treated with LF (p = 0.06), suggesting a putative negative effect of LF on fertility. The viability of elongated spermatids and spermatozoa from mouflon testes was greater (p < 0.05) in samples that were vitrified-warmed with LF. Thus, the hypothesis that supplementing ejaculated sperm with LF and/or PGAM2 improves sperm quality after freeze-thawing was not upheld. However, LF would seem an appropriate additive when vitrifying mouflon testicular tissue.

AB  - Monitoring ecosystem processes resulting in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is crucial in agricultural ecosystems. Traditionally, ESs/EDs provided by arthropods have been estimated indirectly by measuring arthropod abundance and diversity, overlooking the recognised limitations of such approach. Using a consistent methodology based on the sentinel approach, we quantified the intensity of five ecological processes leading to four ESs and two EDs in vineyards and citrus orchards on Terceira Island, Azores. We assessed herbivory rates on lettuce plants (ED), predation rates on green plasticine caterpillars by vertebrates and invertebrates (ES), the intensity of insect pollination on strawberry plants (ES), the rates of predation on wheat and dandelion seeds (ED and ES, respectively) by rodents and invertebrates, and decomposition rates using tea and rooibos leaves (ES). Herbivory rates after 2 weeks were significantly lower in vineyards (mean +/- SD; 0.5 +/- 0.6%) than in citrus orchards (3.6 +/- 2.9%). Vertebrate predation rates in vineyards (4.0 +/- 13.6% d(-1)) were significantly higher than in citrus orchards (2.4 +/- 10.7% d(-1)), while no differences were observed for overall and invertebrate predation rates. Pollination efficiency in vineyards (214.5 +/- 23.9 seeds/fruit) was significantly higher than in citrus orchards (162.0 +/- 14.7 seeds/fruit). Seed predation rates were higher, although not significantly so, in citrus orchards (2.0 +/- 5.8% d(-1)) than in vineyards (0.3 +/- 0.8% d(-1)). Decomposition was significantly higher on tea than on rooibos leaves, both in vineyards (1.15 +/- 0.11 g vs. 0.72 +/- 0.16 g) and citrus orchards (1.34 +/- 0.06 g vs. 0.78 +/- 0.13 g); no differences between mass loss in the two habitats were observed. Our results demonstrated the suitability of simple, direct monitoring tools for a quantitative comparison of agricultural habitats, confirm that landscape complexity does not always support ESs, and that the same agro-ecosystem characteristics that support ESs could occasionally also favour EDs.

AB  - Historically, 23 freshwater mussel species have been documented from the Buffalo National River (BNR), a 246 km, free-flowing river in northern Arkansas. The potential threats to BNR include land use/land cover changes, eutrophication, recreation, physical habitat changes, and various climate change-related effects. Twelve quantitative mussel bed sites were established and then sampled using a stratified random sampling protocol to evaluate the long-term changes between 2006 and 2020-2021 in population and assemblage characteristics. We compared (1) overall mussel bed persistence, sampling confidence levels and study-wide relative abundances, and compared species' size and size-frequency distributions; (2) 10 overall site assemblage variables using paired t-tests; (3) site-level mean density, richness, and diversity indices using pair-wise Mann-Whitney U statistics; and (4) assemblage composition using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling. The major findings included the following: (1) sampling efforts based on a targeted 80% confidence level appears relatively robust, (2) BNR mussel assemblage composition and structure were relatively stable (however, small mussel bed persistence is a concern), (3) 7 of 23 sites were outliers based on freshwater mussel composition and habitat characteristics, and (4) assemblage composition changed with three species declining (Actinonaias ligamentina, Lasmigona costata, and Ptychobranchus occidentalis) and four species increasing (Cambarunio hesperus, Cyclonaias tuberculata, Eurynia dilatata, and Venustaconcha pleasii) between monitoring events.

AB  - This study aims to survey mammal diversity on Ko Pha-ngan, located 80 km off the east peninsular coast of Surat Thani province, Thailand. Thirteen camera trap sites, 32 transects, six drift line fence traps, five mist net trap sites, and nine live trap sites placed in human settlement, human-disturbed forest, and national park forest from February 2021 to September 2023 were utilized. A total of 28 mammal species of eight orders, 17 families, and 21 genera were found. Among them, 11 species are flying mammals while the remaining are terrestrial. Of the species detected, Manis javanica (pangolin) is critically endangered, while Nycticebus coucang (slow loris monkey) is endange by IUCN Red List. Additionally, Rusa unicolor (sambar deer) is vulnerable and Pteropus cf. hypomelanus (island flying fox), Trachypithecus obscurus (dusky leaf monkey), and Ratufa bicolor (giant black squirrel) are near threatened. These findings highlight the need to conserve and protect both national park forest and human-disturbed forest from anthropogenic pressures due to the finite area of an island, in which potential local extinction risk is higher.

AB  - Commercial thinning and prescribed fire can improve habitat quality for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands by increasing coverage of forage plants. However, the relationships among thinning intensity, prescribed fire, and deer forage have not been quantified. We estimated percent cover of deer forage plants in five loblolly pine stands thinned to basal areas of 11 m(2).ha(-1) (low), 14 m(2).ha(-1) (medium), and 18 (high) m(2).ha(-1) in 2017 in Georgia, USA. We applied prescribed fire in 2018. From years 1 to 2 post-treatment, cover of total deer forage increased 26% and 29% in the low and medium basal area treatments, respectively, compared with 19% in the high basal area treatment. Similarly, the increase in forb coverage was greater for the medium (13%) and low (11%) basal area treatments than for the high (6%) basal area treatment. Increases in vine and bramble coverage were greater in unburned medium basal area units. Woody browse was not affected by any treatment. Our results suggest that thinning loblolly pine stands to 14 m(2).ha(-1) can increase coverage of deer forage plants during the first two growing seasons post-thinning, but deer forage was not greater in stands thinned to <14 m(2).ha(-1) 2 years post- thinning.

AB  - Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) plays an important role in ecosystems. Inventories of SAV spatial distribution and composition are important for monitoring changes in SAV. In this study, we compared three common SAV sampling methods to quantify SAV in western Lake Erie. Aerial imagery of near-shore areas in western Lake Erie was classified using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and evaluated against field-based surveys using single-beam sonar or rake samples. To assess variation among methods, data were assigned either vegetation 'presence' or 'absence' and compared for simple correspondence and agreement (Cohen's Kappa, kappa). The two field-based methods had the highest correspondence at 78% (n = 782) and the highest kappa = 0.545. Correspondence between OBIA and rake surveys was 69% (n = 245) and kappa = 0.36. Correspondence between OBIA and hydroacoustics was the lowest of 54% (n = 30,768) with an agreement of kappa = 0.17. Environmental factors such as water turbidity may have played a role in reduced agreement between OBIA and field methods. Determining the optimal method or combination of methods will depend upon research goals, effort, and cost, but each method can provide reliable SAV information for resource management.

AB  - The Northern kelp crab (Pugettia producta) is a common omnivore that inhabits bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) beds in the Salish Sea (Washington, USA). Rising ocean temperatures associated with ongoing environmental changes have the potential to alter organismal physiology and consequently change their feeding strategies, especially in organisms with high feeding flexibility such as omnivores. In this study, we performed feeding trials with P. producta at ambient and elevated temperatures to determine if elevated temperatures characteristic of short-term heat waves induce changes in feeding rate or preferred food type. We offered crabs N. luetkeana blades, Lacuna vincta snails, or a combination of both as food options in choice and no- choice feeding trials. Our results showed that elevated temperatures did not change crab feeding rates or their preference for algal tissue versus animal tissue. When offered the two food options in choice feeding trials, crabs consistently chose to incorporate both into their diet, demonstrating that they are opportunistic consumers across a range of temperatures. The feeding behaviors of grazers and omnivores in kelp beds are impactful in shaping the habitat around them. Thus, studies such as this are essential to improving our understanding of how elevated temperatures may affect trophic interactions among kelp forest inhabitants and ecosystems. Further work to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on P. producta feeding, including how diet may shift across ontogeny, is needed to understand and accurately predict how elevated temperatures will affect future trophic interactions within Salish Sea bull kelp ecosystems.

AB  - In degraded dry environments, a promising restoration strategy involves nurse plants and their microsites, which facilitate species recruitment. Different nurse plant species might provide different microclimatic and soil conditions under their canopy as well as diverse herbivory protection strategies. Seed provenance of target species is also relevant to restoration success. We evaluated the effectiveness of two native woody species (Parkinsonia praecox and Larrea divaricata) as nurse plants for Prosopis flexuosa establishment to be used in restoration programs in semiarid Chaco forests of central Argentina. We conducted a field experiment in a degraded site to analyze microclimatic and soil characteristics under the canopy of the nurse species and in bare soil. In these microsites we planted 240 P. flexuosa saplings to evaluate their performance during two years, including local and non-local provenances. Both nurse species were safer sites for recruitment than bare soil, because under their canopies microclimatic characteristics were ameliorated and soil nutrient availability was increased, with the best sapling performance being under P. praecox crown. Of the total plants that survived (42%), most of them did so under the nurses (74%). Height of P. flexuosa saplings decreased regarding initial height, in the three microsites. Herbivory greatly limited sapling establishment success in bare soil; therefore, both nurses would have an important role in providing shelter. P. flexuosa performance was not influenced by provenance. Including P. praecox and L. divaricata as nurse plants in restoration strategies would promote the use of established vegetation in recovering the semi-arid Chaco forest.

AB  - As human visitation to recreational areas increases, wildlife can alter their space use or activity periods to avoid humans. Short-term or gradual variation in human visitation within and across years makes it challenging to assess species responses. We used data from 156 cameras deployed on and off trails (within 50 m) in Isle Royale National Park (IRNP), Michigan, USA, during 2020-2021 to assess diel activity, temporal overlap, and space use of four wildlife species in response to human visitation and wolves. While visitation in both years was greatest in June-August, there were 338 % more human visitors in 2021 than when COVID-19 pandemic visitor restrictions were active in 2020. Space use for all species decreased within and between years as human visitation increased. From 2020-2021, on-trail animal detections decreased while off-trail detections remained constant. As visitation declined late season, red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and wolf (Canis lupus) detection rates increased on trails while snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and moose (Alces alces) remained low or declined further. Moose, snowshoe hare, and red fox diel overlap with humans decreased with increasing visitation as animals became more nocturnal. Red fox and moose overlap with humans and wolves decreased from 2020 to 2021. On-trail detections declined when human activity intensity increased while off-trail detections remained relatively constant, suggesting human activity influenced species' space use along trails only. Reducing visitation during the peak visitor season or redistributing the number of visitors across the overall visitor season could reduce mammalian responses to human visitation.

AB  - On large management units where terrain allows observation of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the air, helicopter surveys may provide managers with cost-effective and accurate estimates of population abundance; however, imperfect detection of deer introduces negative bias. This can result in potentially inappropriate management recommendations (e.g., harvest prescriptions). Sightability estimators are designed to model detection heterogeneity based on factors that affect observer detection of target animals. Sightability models are widely used to estimate ungulate abundance; however, previous researchers have developed sightability models using radio-collared animals, potentially introducing bias during model development attributed to unaccounted for movement between initial and follow-up flights. Therefore, our objectives were to model detection probability using surrogates of white-tailed deer as a function of covariates including distance from transect, vegetative obstruction, and light conditions to improve population estimates derived from helicopter surveys and apply our final sightability model in operational helicopter surveys. We conducted our study in 2019 on a 399.4-km(2) study area within a 1,210-km(2) cattle ranch in central Florida, USA. We placed 3-dimensional archery targets as surrogates for white-tailed deer at assigned locations unknown to observers across a combination of stratified bins of vegetative obstruction and distances from the transect. Our top model indicated that distance from the transect and vegetative obstruction negatively affected detection of deer. Detection probability on the flight transect ranged from 0.95 (95% CI = 0.89-0.98) for vegetative obstruction 0-25% and distance from transect 0-25 m to 0.05 (95% CI = 0.01-0.18) for vegetative obstruction 76-100% and distance from transect 100-125 m. We applied our sightability model to operational surveys on 3 units, which produced population estimates averaging 26% higher than those derived from uncorrected counts. Observers simultaneously recorded live deer during operational flights, of which 60% of deer groups were observed while stationary. Our methods using stationary surrogates to develop region-specific sightability models could be used in other study areas to account for imperfect detection of white-tailed deer.

AB  - There are reports suggesting that leaf-cutting ants can act as a biotic filter, selecting plant traits according to foraging preferences, and consequently affecting the species composition of plant communities. In order to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the relationship between the floristic and functional diversity of woody plants in fragments of Semideciduous Seasonal Atlantic Forest (SAF) with the presence or absence of Atta sexdens (Linnaeus, 1758) nests. We expected that, in places where A. sexdens nests is present, 1) floristic diversity is lower and 2) the plant community is dominated by species characterized by greater investment in anti-herbivore defenses and lower nutritional content. For this, we sampled nine SAF fragments in the north of Paran & aacute; state, in Brazil. The diversity of woody regenerants (> 1 m in height, < 2 cm diameter) was estimated and 10 functional traits were evaluated: gap dependence, deciduousness, leaf nitrogen and carbon content, leaf C/N ratio, presence of leaf trichomes, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, presence of latex and condensed tannins, for the 28 most abundant woody species. Contrary to expectations, there were no differences in floristic diversity between sites with or without A. sexdens, and functional diversity was also similar, reflecting the floristic similarity. We suggest that the herbivory pressure by A. sexdens on the woody regenerants of SAF fragments is not strong enough to cause significant mortality in individual species and, consequently, affect plant diversity and composition. This may in part be related to the fact that most nests of A. sexdens were established in the edges of the fragments and that ants from these nests forage not only in the forest but also in the agricultural matrix where food resources are abundant. We also suggest that longer-term studies are still needed to fully elucidate the effects of A. sexdens on the plant community of Atlantic Forest fragments.

AB  - Climate and land management are important environmental drivers that affect the structure of terrestrial plant communities worldwide. Demographic studies allow a mechanistic understanding of the pathways in which environmental factors change population size. Climate and land management might interactively influence vital rates and growth rates of populations, however, demographic studies have not heretofore considered both factors in combination. We used the Global Change Experimental Facility as a platform to study the effect of climate (ambient climate conditions vs. future climate conditions) and land management (sheep grazing vs. mowing) on the demography of the common grass, Bromus erectus growing in semi-natural grassland communities. Using an integral projection model, we found positive population growth rates for B. erectus under all treatment combinations, and an interactive effect of climate and land management. Under ambient climate conditions, population growth of B. erectus was higher in mowed than grazed grassland plots, while population growth rates were similar across both management types under future climatic conditions. This interaction was primarily due to between-treatment changes in seedling recruitment, a vital rate to which the population growth rate is particularly sensitive. The interaction found in this study highlights the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers in demographic studies, to better predict future plant population dynamics and ultimately changes in community structure.

AB  - Human migration in response to past climate change has been recorded globally. The pastoralist Todas are believed to have colonised the higher elevations (>2000 m asl) of the Nilgiris, Western Ghats, India, after similar to 2000 cal. yr BP. During the late Quaternary, climate-induced vegetation shifts in tropical montane forest-grassland mosaic of the Nilgiris have been well-documented using stable carbon isotopes and pollen, but there have been no corresponding investigations of human activity. We used several proxies to infer the human ecology of this region. Radiocarbon-dated (similar to 22,000 cal. yr BP to the present) peat from Sandynallah (2200 m asl) was used to reconstruct fire history, animal abundance, and human presence since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). While macro-charcoal records fires at the LGM, macro- and micro-charcoal indicate intense fire at similar to 3500 cal. yr BP, coprophilous fungal spores indicate abundant herbivorous mammals, n-alkane signatures point to arid grassland vegetation, and steroid biomarkers show human faecal remains for the first time. We infer that a pastoralist people, most likely the Todas, migrated to the montane Nilgiris along with their buffaloes in response to prolonged or abrupt climate change in peninsular India similar to 3500 cal yr BP or similar to 1500 years prior to what historical accounts assume.

AB  - Estimates of the distribution and density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana, 1850) were derived from a large-scale survey conducted during the austral summer in the Southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean and across the Scotia Sea in 2018-19, the '2018-19 Area 48 Survey'. Survey vessels were provided by Norway, the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies and Aker BioMarine AS, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Republic of Korea, and China. Survey design followed the transects of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources synoptic survey, carried out in 2000 and from regular national surveys performed in the South Atlantic sector by the U.S., China, Republic of Korea, Norway, and the U.K. The 2018-19 Area 48 Survey represents only the second large-scale survey performed in the area and this joint effort resulted in the largest ever total transect line (19,500 km) coverage carried out as one single exercise in the Southern Ocean. We delineated and integrated acoustic backscatter arising from krill swarms to produce distribution maps of krill areal biomass density and standing stock (biomass) estimates. Krill standing stock for the Area 48 was estimated to be 62.6 megatonnes (mean density of 30 g m(-)(2) over 2 million km(2)) with a sampling coefficient variation of 13%. The highest mean krill densities were found in the South Orkney Islands stratum (93.2 g m(-2)) and the lowest in the South Georgia Island stratum (6.4 g m(-2)). The krill densities across the strata compared to those found during the previous survey indicate some regional differences in distribution and biomass. It is currently not possible to assign any such differences or lack of differences between the two survey datasets to longer term trends in the environment, krill stocks or fishing pressure.

AB  - Retention of plastics in estuaries and storage in sediments likely contributes to the mass imbalance between the amount of ocean plastic debris and input from land. A sediment transport model, coupled with a hydrodynamic and wave model, was employed to analyze how microplastics of varying settling velocities behave under non-storm conditions and during extreme storm events in Galveston Bay, USA. The model was informed by measured concentrations of microplastics in a main tributary (Buffalo Bayou), which flows through the highly populated Houston-metro area. Under non-storm conditions, concentrations of neutrally buoyant particles are highest near the source location. In contrast, negatively buoyant particles are highest near the bay mouth where bed shear stress, and thus the potential for erosion/resuspension, is highest. Simulation of Hurricane Harvey, an unpreceded 1000-year flood event, shows a drastic increase of overall microplastic levels in Galveston Bay, approximately 5x that of non-storm conditions, and an increase in corresponding flux of microplastics to the Gulf of Mexico. The differences are attributed both to increases in microplastic loading and erosion of microplastics from bed sediments during Harvey. Differences in concentration between storm and non-storm conditions are most clear in the upper bay, where shear stress is low under normal conditions but shows a significant increase during storms due to wave-enhanced stress. Following Harvey, negatively buoyant particles levels return to normal in less than a week, but neutrally buoyant particle concentrations remain elevated over several months. Use of a sediment transport model that simulates erosion/resuspension to understand particle behavior lends further understanding of processes of microplastics not explored through previous use of particle tracking models that do not account for erosion/resuspension. This is of upmost importance for simulation of negatively buoyant particles, which have more potential to interact with the sediment bed layer. Variation of critical shear stress for erosion, erosion rate, and use of a wave model, all show significant impacts on particle behavior. Future parameterization of microplastic behavior in sediments will enhance our understanding of estuarine retention and export ability.

AB  - Monitoring is essential for evidence-based wildlife conservation and management. Conventional distance sampling (CDS) represents a methodology of election for population assessment of large herbivores. CDS requires that (1) animals' distribution is uniform around the transects and (2) transects must be randomly distributed over the study area. Monitoring costs are usually lower by using cars moving along dirty roads, instead of walking randomly located transects, but this choice may introduce biases in the estimate, as ungulates may avoid roads, which in their turn are not randomly distributed across the landscape. To address both problems, we used bivariate distance sampling (collecting both forward and perpendicular distances) to estimate detection probability, thus correcting for road avoidance. The resulting detection function is used as input for Density Surface Models to correct for non-random line placement. We demonstrate this methodology by considering a pilot survey of impala (Aepyceros melampus) and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) in the Sandwe GMA (Zambia). Potentially, this approach can mitigate biases and increase the precision of estimates. We discuss the possibility of applying the proposed methodology for routine wildlife monitoring in underfunded areas, in Africa and elsewhere. To assist practitioners, we provide an easy-to-use R script which implements statistical procedures.

AB  - To understand how nutrient cycling and sequestration are influenced by different grazing periods, the C:N:P stoichiometry features of the plant-soil interface in the desert steppe were measured and evaluated. The 5-year seasonal grazing experiment employed four grazing period treatments: traditional time of grazing (TG), early termination of grazing (EG), delayed start of grazing (DG), and delayed start and early termination of grazing (DEG). Additionally, fenced off desert steppe served as the control. The grazing periods each had a differing impact on the C:N:P stoichiometry in both plant functional group and soil depth comparisons. Compared to the EG, DG, and DEG treatments, the TG treatment had a more significant impact on the C, N, and P pools of grass, as well as the C:P and N:P ratios of forbs, but had a reduced effect on the C:P and N:P ratios of legumes. In contrast to plants, the DG treatment exhibited greater advantages in increasing C pools within the 0-40 cm soil layer. Furthermore, in the 10-20 cm soil layer, the C:P and N:P ratios under the EG treatment were significantly higher, ranging from 8.88% to 53.41% and 72.34%-121.79%, respectively, compared to the other treatments (TG, DG, and DGE). The primary drivers of the C, N, and P pools during different grazing periods were above-ground biomass (AGB) and litter biomass (LB). Both lowering the plant C:P and N:P ratios and considerably raising the plant P pool during different grazing periods greatly weakened the P limitation of the desert steppe environment. It is predicted that delayed start grazing might be a management strategy for long-term ecosystem sustainability, as it regulates above-ground nutrient allocation and has a positive effect on soil C and N pools.

AB  - Hunters can affect the behavior of wildlife by inducing a landscape of fear, selecting individuals with specific traits, or altering resource availability across the landscape. Most research investigating the influence of hunting on wildlife resource selection has focused on target species and less attention has been devoted to nontarget species, such as scavengers that can be both attracted or repelled by hunting activities. We used resource selection functions to identify areas where hunters were most likely to kill moose (Alces alces) in south-central Sweden during the fall. Then, we used step-selection functions to determine whether female brown bears (Ursus arctos) selected or avoided these areas and specific resources during the moose hunting season. We found that, during both day and nighttime, female brown bears avoided areas where hunters were more likely to kill moose. We found evidence that resource selection by brown bears varied substantially during the fall and that some behavioral changes were consistent with disturbance associated with moose hunters. Brown bears were more likely to select concealed locations in young (i.e., regenerating) and coniferous forests and areas further away from roads during the moose hunting season. Our results suggest that brown bears react to both spatial and temporal variations in apparent risk during the fall: moose hunters create a landscape of fear and trigger an antipredator response in a large carnivore even if bears are not specifically targeted during the moose hunting season. Such antipredator responses might lead to indirect habitat loss and lower foraging efficiency and the resulting consequences should be considered when planning hunting seasons.

AB  - The Stipa breviflora desert steppe is an important component of the Eurasian steppe, and its ecosystem functions are directly affected by changes in the individual functional traits of S. breviflora. Based on 14 years of data from the grazing experiment in S. breviflora desert steppe, we investigated changes in the individual tillering traits of S. breviflora in response to four levels (none, light, moderate, heavy) of long-term grazing. The results showed that: (i) long-term grazing resulted in a greater decrease in species richness and increased biomass contribution of S. breviflora in the communities; (ii) long-term grazing resulted in significant differences in aboveground/belowground plant tillering functional traits and their relationships under different grazing intensities; (iii) the leaf biomass of S. breviflora tillering individuals was strongly dependent on leaf number, while the change in root biomass was strongly dependent on the total root length, specific root length, root furcation number, and root crossing number. The response of S. breviflora biomass to grazing intensity and its relation to tillering individual traits revealed that long-term grazing leads to vast tillering in S. breviflora tussock and significant changes in S. breviflora tillering traits, which will have a profound influence on the function of the desert grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Species at their warm range margin are potentially threatened by higher temperatures, but may persist in microrefugia. Whether such microsites occur due to more suitable microclimate or due to lower biotic pressure from, for example competitive species, is still not fully resolved. We examined whether boreal bryophytes and lichens show signs of direct climate limitation, that is whether they perform better in cold and/or humid microclimates at their warm range margin. We transplanted a moss, a liverwort and a lichen to 58 boreal forest sites with different microclimates at the species' southern range margin in central Sweden. Species were grown in garden soil patches to control the effects of competitive exclusion and soil quality. We followed the transplanted species over three growing seasons (2016-2018) and modelled growth and vitality for each species as a function of subcanopy temperature, soil moisture, air humidity and forest type. In 2018, we also recorded the cover of other plants having recolonized the garden soil patches and modelled this potential future competition with the same environmental variables plus litter. Species performance increased with warmer temperatures, which was often conditional on high soil moisture, and at sites with more conifers. Soil moisture had a positive effect, especially on the moss in the last year 2018, when the growing season was exceptionally hot and dry. The lichen was mostly affected by gastropod grazing. Recolonization of other plants was also faster at warmer and moister sites. The results indicate that competition, herbivory, shading leaf litter and water scarcity might be more important than the direct effects of temperature for performance at the species' warm range margin. Synthesis. In a transplant experiment with three boreal understorey species, we did not find signs of direct temperature limitation towards the south. Forest microrefugia, that is habitats where these species could persist regional warming, may instead be sites with fewer competitors and enemies, and with sufficient moisture and more conifers in the overstorey.

AB  - Sex differences in large mammals with sexual dimorphism are important ecological and evolutionary issues and key factors for wildlife management. To examine the potential use of drone (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) observation using thermal infrared images for sex ratio monitoring of deer, we conducted UAV surveys at night in a sparse forest located on the distribution periphery of sika deer Cervus nippon and wild boar Sus scrofa local populations during summer and winter. Of the 163 thermal infrared images of large mammals detected, 132 (81.0%) and 16 (9.8%) were identified for deer and wild boar, respectively. In addition, velvet antlers of deer were visually recognized during summer, and 92% of the detected deer were antlered. This biased sex ratio would be a characteristic in the distribution periphery of local deer populations. Therefore, monitoring abundance and sex ratio using thermal infrared sensors on UAVs can improve deer management especially in the distribution periphery of local populations.

AB  - Sarcoptic mange, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is a highly contagious and potentially fatal skin disease that affects a wide range of mammals, including South American Camelids (SAC). Although the presence of mange has been described in vicunas and llamas in northwestern Argentina, there are no previous records documenting its presence in guanacos (Lama guanicoe) of this region. We here describe a case of S. scabiei in a free-ranging guanaco in the Department of Tilcara, Jujuy Province. The animal presented alopecic, erythematous and hyperkeratotic lesions with abundant crusts in the ventral region of the body and limbs. Histopathology revealed periadnexal dermatitis with inflammatory infiltrate, severe hyperemia, orthokeratotic and parakeratotic epidermal hyperplasia, and stratum corneum thickening. The etiological agent was identified as S. scabiei by microscopic examination of adult mites. This result was confirmed by sequencing of a cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene fragment, that showed 100 % identity with sequences of isolates from SAC and other mammals. Genotyping of three mites isolated from different parts of the guanaco's body using a set of ten microsatellite markers indicated the infection with a single genetic variant that showed a similar profile to those found in S. scabiei isolates from vicunas and llamas of the same region. However, genetic differences with guanaco isolates from midwestern Argentina were observed. This work presents the first record of sarcoptic mange in a guanaco in Jujuy Province and in the northwestern region of Argentina, as well as the molecular characterization of the etiological agent. The case highlights an uncertain scenario regarding the health situation of the guanaco population in this region, which is small, fragmented, and locally categorized as endangered. Epidemiological surveillance programs for guanacos and further research on the impact of sarcoptic mange on the conservation of this species are needed.

AB  - Deep-sea coral ecosystems represent oases of life in the deep ocean, often hosting abundant and diverse faunal communities. Although mounting evidence indicates that deep-sea benthic communities are highly dynamic and can change over scales of a few hours to seasons or years, such dynamics have never been characterized in deepsea coral ecosystems. We used a time-lapse camera deployed for a year at a depth of 1230 m on Sur Ridge (Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary) to characterize hourly changes in megafaunal abundance and diversity in a deep-sea coral assemblage. The response of community dynamics to variation in environmental factors, including surface net primary production as well as current speed/direction, temperature and acoustic backscatter (a proxy for particle and zooplankton density) at depth, was also evaluated. Overall, 33 taxa from 6 phyla, including multiple commercially valuable species, were observed throughout the study period. The strong seasonal pattern and periodicities in the occurrence of the most abundant taxa likely drove the observed temporal trends in overall abundance and diversity. Fluctuations in food availability may have, at least partially, driven these trends, as indicated by the significant relationship between community dynamics, surface net primary production and acoustic backscatter at depth. However, the low explanatory power of environmental parameters tested here suggest that biotic factors such as individual behaviors and species interactions had a strong influence on community dynamics. This study emphasizes the role of deep-sea coral as habitat and the need for monitoring to better understand how environmental and biological processes interact to shape associated faunal communities.

AB  - The knowledge regarding the spatial ecology of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in different environments is crucial if effective management actions are to be designed. However, this knowledge continues to be scarce in the complex contexts of mixed land use and management circumstances. This study describes the spatial ecology of red deer monitored using GPS collars in Mediterranean ecosystems of South-Central Spain, considering the effect of individual and seasonal (food shortage period, rut, hunting season and food abundance period) factors on different land use and management scenarios, namely protected areas, mixed farms and fenced hunting estates. Our results showed less activity (ACT), a shorter daily range (DR) and a smaller home range (HR) during the food shortage period: ACT: 0.38 +/- (SD) 0.12; DR: 3010.9 +/- 727.3 m; and weekly HR: 122.2 +/- 59.6 ha. With regard to land use, individuals were less ACT and had a smaller DR on fenced hunting estates (ACT: 0.24 +/- 0.12; DR: 1946.3 +/- 706.7 m) than in protected areas (ACT: 0.59 +/- 0.12; DR: 4071.4 +/- 1068.2 m) or on mixed farms (ACT: 0.57 +/- 0.29; DR: 5431.1 +/- 1939.5 m) in all the periods studied. Red deer selected land cover with forage and shelter when foraging and resting, respectively. When drive hunt events occurred (mixed farms and fenced hunting estates), the deer were more prone to select safer habitats (scrublands) and avoid open areas (crops or grasslands) than were their counterparts in protected areas. The patterns observed can be explained by sexual and seasonal differences as regards requirements, the response to disturbances and, interestingly, population management. Our results provide useful information with which to design scientifically-based species adaptive management in response to relevant and timely situations in Europe, such as the potential transmission of shared infections, vehicle collisions, and damage to crops and ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change has altered precipitation regimes with concomitant influences in hydrology. For a complex assemblage of ungulates, these water-level fluctuations might alter habitat partitioning thought to be crucial for coexistence in response to livestock introduction. We placed camera traps in three habitat types along the Mayanja River in central Uganda to evaluate space use by native and domestic ungulates. For each species, we assessed the difference in the proportion of days with camera-trap detections during three water-level conditions (low in 2017, normal in 2015, and high in 2016). Sitatunga was the only species regularly using wetlands; their use of remote wetlands remained consistent regardless of water-level conditions, and their use of forest habitats decreased during the study. In the forest, warthogs showed no change in use, while proportion of days with detections increased over time for all other ungulates. Our results indicate that ungulate community space use appears to be independent of hydrologic condition, and that risk for competitive exclusion between native and domestic ungulates is tempered by dietary and habitat use differences. Adaptations to dynamic hydrology appears to buffer consequences for ungulate communities; more serious are habitat losses to agriculture and development.

AB  - Limited information exists on the diet of snow leopards (SL), factors affecting livestock mortality, and local attitudes toward SL conservation in the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA), Nepal. Therefore, we aim to investigate the dietary preferences of SL, the factors influencing livestock mortality, and local conservation attitudes. From November 2021 to January 2022, 23 SL scats were collected along 24 transects (total length: 21.6 km) in MCA. Camera traps, set within 4 km x 4 km grids at 28 stations for 661 trap nights, were used to assess prey availability. Jacobs' index calculated prey preference, while a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) assessed factors linked to livestock depredation. Additionally, 65 households from two villages were randomly selected in a survey on depredation and conservation attitudes. Scat analysis identified six wild prey species, including pika (Ochotona sp.), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), as well as three domestic species: ox/cow, yak, and horse. Himalayan tahr had the highest presence in the SL diet (40%). Despite pika having the highest Relative Abundance Index (RAI), SL strongly preferred horses and avoided pika. Larger prey, such as horses, Himalayan tahr, and blue sheep, were highly preferred. Households with more livestock experienced higher depredation rates. Local attitudes toward SL conservation were generally positive, with an average score of 2.59. We recommend an integrated SL conservation plan in MCA, incorporating local participation, income diversification, and employment programs to mitigate conflicts and promote coexistence.

AB  - Whether the distribution of species can track future changes in climate will ultimately determine their survival. However, traditional predictions of species distributions in response to climate change often ignore the effects of biotic interactions. Here, we incorporated interspecific competition into SDMs (Species distribution models) to assess the distribution of two species endemic to China, namely the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellanae) and Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana), in response to climate change. Due to overlap areas in the distributions of both species, niche competition between the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey and Tibetan macaque was observed, and the former was less competitive in terms of theirability to source food and their reproductive capacity. The area where niche overlap between the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey and Tibetan macaque occurs accounts for half of the suitable habitat for the former, suggesting that the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey cannot use this habitat effectively. Both species are predicted to lose more than 70 % of their suitable habitat by the 2050s, and the altitude of suitable habitat will likely decrease. Bio3 (Isothermality) and Bio13 (Precipitation of Wettest Month) were the most important climatic variables affecting the distribution of the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey and Tibetan macaque, respectively. The suitable habitat of the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey and Tibetan macaque was fragmented into several isolated pieces, which requires that ecological restoration should be carried out in advance. We demonstrated that the incorporation of interspecific competition into SDMs can accurately assess the response of species to future climate change, as less competitive species cannot effectively use their suitable habitat.

AB  - Resource heterogeneity governs a multitude of ecological processes, but the mechanisms by which heterogeneity influences population performance are not fully resolved. Because optimizing behavior is challenging in heterogeneous landscapes, individual variation in foraging and movement strategies is common, and understanding the consequences of that variation is one of the most pressing challenges in modern ecology. In theory, such consequences should be modulated at least in part by nutrition, which directly influences discretionary energy available for growth and reproduction. We developed a series of linked dynamic models for predicting (1) spatiotemporal variation in the foodscapes available to seven distinct populations of elk (Cervus canadensis) in Idaho, USA, and (2) variation in pregnancy rates among those populations as a function of foodscape use and availability. Foodscape models, which predicted variation in suitable forage biomass (biomass of forage that met or exceeded requirements of female elk at peak lactation), generally performed well, with adjusted R-2 values ranging from 0.34 to 0.51. Patterns of foodscape use differed among populations and years, with some populations showing selection for the foodscape and others exhibiting indifference or even avoidance of high-quality forage resources. Pregnancy rates ranged from 66% to 100%, and our top model relating pregnancy to metrics of forage availability explained 41% of the variation among 20 elk population-years. Our top model relating pregnancy to foodscape use by elk explained 57% of the variation in pregnancy rates among 12 population-years. Pregnancy rates were influenced more strongly by heterogeneity in foodscape use and availability than by differences in mean or maximum suitable biomass among populations. Our results suggest that population performance of elk was modulated both by the availability of high-quality forage and by factors that constrained use of the foodscape by elk. The dynamic modeling approach we developed for linking nutritional resources to herbivore performance is generalizable to many other species and systems and can be used by wildlife managers to assess whether herbivore populations might be limited by bottom-up factors.

AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in livestock and poultry manure is a severe threat to human health. However, the comprehensive characterization of antibiotic resistance in swine, workers, and the receiving environment is still lacking in the actual breeding environment. Hence, the ARG profile and the potential bacterial hosts producing among swine manure (including sows, piglets, finishing pigs, and nursery pigs), worker feces, and the receiving environment (including sediment and vegetable soil) were comprehensively analyzed based on the metagenomic method. The results showed that swine manure exhibited the high levels of richness and diversity of ARGs. Inactivating tetracycline resistance genes such as tet(X), tet(X1), and tet(X10) were prevalent on swine farms. Workers and the environment were the primary recipients of ARGs, and shared ARGs accounted for at least 90% of their ARG abundances. Network analysis revealed that Escherichia, Acinetobacter, and Erysipelothrix were the most dominant genera co-occurring with specific shared ARGs. The abundance of coexisting ARGs in swine at different developmental stages accounted for 76.4% to 90.8% of the shared ARGs in swine, workers, and environmental samples. The Mantel test revealed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria had a significant correlation with the ARG profiles. In addition, variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that the joint effects of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities accounted for 24.7% of the resistome variation and played a significant role in the ARG profiles. These results improve our understanding of the transmission and persistence of ARGs in the actual breeding environment.

AB  - Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) is a wild Eurasian brassica that produces the secondary compound sinigrin, a type of glucosinolate, that defends against herbivores and pathogens and is toxic to native plants and butterflies outside of garlic mustard's home range. While it is well-established that sinigrin produced by garlic mustard negatively impacts native species in North America, whether and how different growing conditions affect sinigrin concentration is not well understood. Here, we conducted field surveys and greenhouse experiments with garlic mustard to evaluate sinigrin concentration and growth in response to intraspecific density and abiotic environmental conditions. We found greater levels of sinigrin in smaller individual plants regardless of intraspecific density, soil fertility or light conditions. Our findings suggest that leaf concentrations of sinigrin are not controlled directly by abiotic factors but rather by plant size.

AB  - 1. The authors analysed the potential effects of interspecific competition on spatial distribution of two gall-inducing insects, Bystracoccus mataybae (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae) and Lopesia mataybae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), that co-occurring simultaneously in Matayba guianensis. Overall, the authors hypothesised that spatial gall distribution between and within leaflets is shaped by interspecific competition.
   2. The authors determine: i) the B. mataybae distribution between two different habitats; ii) the B. mataybae and L. mataybae distribution in the same habitat; and iii) the B. mataybae distribution when L. mataybae is present and absent in the habitat. For all experimental designs, the authors measured gall abundance along leaflet sizes, as well used a new Cartesian plane technique to map spatial gall distribution within the leaflet to obtain gall density.
   3. In Campo-cerrado, B. mataybae induced galls on small leaflets and in Cerrado on large leaflets, with similar spatial distribution within leaflets. Within the same habitat, B. mataybae induced galls on small leaflets, with higher gall density in the right basal of the blade, and L. mataybae on large leaflets, occupying the right apical area. In habitat with interspecific competition pressure (L. mataybae present), B. mataybae selected small leaflets with higher gall density on the right basal area, and in habitat without interspecific competition (L. mataybae absent), B. mataybae selected larger leaflets with broader distribution over within the blade.
   4. The study's findings confirm that both gall-inducing insect species diverge in their distribution, avoiding overlapping niches confirming that the spatial gall distribution of both gall-inducing species are driven by interspecific competition.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in winter limnology, few studies have examined under-ice zooplankton communities and the factors shaping them in different types of temperate lakes. To better understand drivers of zooplankton community structure in winter and summer, we sampled 13 lakes across a large trophic status gradient for crustacean zooplankton abundance, taxonomic and functional community composition and C/N stable isotopes. Average winter zooplankton densities were one-third of summer densities across the study lakes. Proportionally, cladocerans were more abundant in summer than winter, with the opposite pattern for calanoids and cyclopoids. In green (eutrophic) lakes, zooplankton densities were higher under the ice than in brown (dystrophic) and blue (oligotrophic) lakes, suggesting better conditions for zooplankton in productive lakes during winter. Overall, zooplankton communities were more similar across lakes under the ice than during the open water season. Feeding group classification showed a decrease in herbivore abundance and an increase in predators from summer to winter. C/N stable isotope results suggested higher lipid content in overwintering zooplankton and potentially increased reliance on the microbial loop by winter zooplankton. Our results show substantial variation in the seasonality of zooplankton communities in different lake types and identify some of the factors responsible for this variation.

AB  - Applying organic amendments enhances agroecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), yet its mechanisms via soil food-web energetics remain unclear. A field experiment was conducted on China's Loess Plateau in a winter wheat system, comparing mineral fertilizer with straw, biochar, and liquid organic fertilizer to assess their impacts on nematode communities and EMF (plant performance and carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycling). Using high-throughput sequencing and energy flux modeling, we found that straw and biochar enhanced nematode diversity and co-occurrence network complexity, while liquid organic fertilizer reduced network complexity. Straw balanced fungal- and bacterial-driven energy pathways, enhancing energy flow uniformity (1.05) and EMF. However, its high C:N ratio requires mineral fertilizers to alleviate nitrogen limitations, ensuring stable bacterial energy fluxes and preventing functional trade-offs. Biochar elevated total energy flux but prioritized bacterial- and herbivore-driven pathways, reducing energy flow uniformity (0.76) and functional balance. Liquid organic fertilizer favored omnivores-predators, destabilizing lower trophic functions with minimal functional gains. Amendment properties (C:N ratio, pH) shaped nematode-mediated energy distribution, linking biodiversity to multifunctionality. Overall, straw is optimal for supporting EMF when combined with mineral fertilizers, while biochar and liquid fertilizer require tailored management to mitigate functional trade-offs. These findings advance sustainable strategies for dryland agroecosystems in the Loess Plateau region and similar environments.

AB  - The late Middle Eocene Pondaung Fm. is a window to understand the environment and ecosystem dynamics of a past greenhouse world and the paleoenvironments where modern mammal clades such as anthropoid primates originated. Previous studies focused on the overall climate and vegetation of this Eocene habitat and provided first evidence for an early monsoon onset before the orogenesis of the Himalayan-Tibetan range. Here, we wanted to investigate how the mammal fauna used this habitat and which different ecological niches and microhabitats they occupied. We analyzed the carbonate fraction of dental enamel of a fossil mammal assemblage from various localities of the Pondaung Fm. in Myanmar. Bayesian niche modelling of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values allowed us to quantify aspects of the ecological core niches occupied by these taxa, to calculate niche overlap and to use these data to infer directional competition potential in this mammal assemblage. Furthermore, comparison of different areas of the Pondaung Fm. revealed two different microhabitats whose distribution is consistent with existing vegetation models. Most primate taxa were found in both described environments, which gives a first indication about their ecological flexibility.

AB  - PremiseTheories of plant-herbivore interactions hold that seedlings are more vulnerable to herbivory in warmer and more stable climates at lower elevations. Hypotheses of plant apparency, resource concentration, and resource availability have been proposed to explain variability in leaf herbivory. However, seasonal differences in the effects of these hypotheses on leaf herbivory on seedlings remain unclear.MethodsWe evaluated the three herbivory hypotheses by comparing the percentage and frequency of leaf herbivory in understory broadleaf seedlings in a subtropical forest in May (spring) and October (autumn) along an elevational gradient (290-1370 m a.s.l.). In total, we measured 2890 leaves across 696 seedlings belonging to 95 species and used beta regressions to test the effects of plant apparency (e.g., leaf area, seedling height), resource concentration (e.g., plant species diversity), and resource availability (e.g., canopy openness, soil available N and P) on leaf herbivory.ResultsSeedlings exhibited unimodal patterns of leaf herbivory along elevation, with drivers of leaf herbivory varying by the month. Variation in the frequency of leaf herbivory was best explained by the resource concentration hypothesis (e.g., plant species diversity) in both months, and herbivory was lower on seedlings in sites with higher plant diversity. Plant apparency hypothesis (e.g., leaf area, seedling height) was weakly supported only in spring, and the evidence for resource availability hypothesis (e.g., canopy openness, soil nutrients) was mixed.ConclusionsThis study supports the resource concentration hypothesis and reveals the importance of seasonal difference on understanding leaf herbivory patterns and the drivers of plant diversity in subtropical forests.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems across the planet continue to be invaded by the New Zealand mudsnail (NZMS) (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), but factors that control their individual growth rates-a key predictor of a species' invasion success-have yet to be fully elucidated. NZMS are often categorized as herbivore-detritivores; there is a lack of empirical evidence, however, regarding their consumption of detritus and related processes, such as rates of organic-matter decomposition. To help fill this gap, we reared individual NZMS on leaves of four species (eastern cottonwood, Populus deltoides; green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica; red maple, Acer saccharum; and red oak, Quercus rubra) that are changing in their abundance due to anthropogenic factors. We assigned replicate microcosms containing one live juvenile NZMS to each litter species, as well as microcosms that contained no leaves as a control, and determined NZMS growth rates. To evaluate the effect of snail presence on leaf decomposition, we established control microcosms with no snails for each litter species. We found a significant difference in individual NZMS growth rates among litter species, with snails reared on cottonwood and ash leaves having higher growth rates than snails reared on maple and oak leaves. Decomposition rates differed among leaf species, and there was a significant interaction between NZMS presence and leaf decomposition, indicating the effect of NZMS on decomposition rates depended on leaf species. Snails had the greatest effect on ash leaves, increasing decomposition rates by 200% relative to controls without snails, followed by a 100% increase in the decomposition rate of cottonwood leaves. These results, to our knowledge, are the first evidence that NZMS consume leaf litter (either intentionally, or incidentally while scraping/grazing) and that the litter species on which they feed can influence their growth rates, with potential consequences for their success as invaders. Moreover, these results highlight the potential for NZMS to impact detrital pathways in stream ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the fine-scale behavioural and feeding ecology of marine megafauna is imperative for effective management of their habitat areas; however, obtaining the relevant data can be both costly and challenging. Here we integrate the use of small drones for dugong surveys with underwater benthic habitat assessment techniques at the local spatial scale (similar to 30 km(2)), to determine the drivers of dugong (Dugong dugon) distribution across three locations in the Pilbara, Western Australia. Paired assessment data was collected three times over two years. Benthic habitat (percent cover), seagrass nutritional quality and environmental parameters (temperature, water clarity, water current, water depth) were tested as predictor variables using generalised linear models, to examine drivers of both dugong presence/absence and abundance. We found that low cover (typical for this region; 2-10 %) of colonising seagrass is a key driver of the presence and abundance of dugongs. Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis were the main predictors of dugong presence and abundance across the three locations surveyed. Where both seagrass species simultaneously occurred, the likelihood of dugongs being present increased by over 60 times. The presence of H. uninervis alone was predicted to increase the abundance of dugongs by 1.4 times across all locations and by 6.8 times in one location, Exmouth Gulf, compared to when no seagrass was present. This study provided evidence of critical seagrass habitat, which is important knowledge for the protection and conservation of dugongs and their foraging habitat. The methods developed in this study could be employed in environmental impact assessments to predict and confirm potential seagrass forage habitat.

AB  - In streams, unionoid mussels and fish form aggregations that exert bottom-up and top-down effects on food webs, but the magnitude and spatial extent of their effects are controlled by species traits. Sedentary mussels live burrowed in the sediment in patchily distributed dense aggregations (mussel beds) where they filter seston and provide a local, relatively constant nutrient subsidy. In contrast, fish move on and off mussel beds, and thus comprise a transient nutrient subsidy. We asked how overlap between fish and mussels influences nutrient recycling and resource distribution in streams. We conducted an 8-week study in experimental streams where we created mussel beds (comprised of two species, Actinonaias ligamentina and Amblema plicata), manipulated the occurrence of a grazing minnow (Campostoma anomalum), and tracked nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) and resource (algae, detritus, and chironomids) abundance up and downstream of the mussel beds. In general, neither consumer had strong effects on the concentration or spatial distribution of nutrients. Water turnover time in our experimental streams may have diluted fish and mussel nutrient excretion effects, making it difficult to detect spatial patterns during a given sampling period. Fish controlled the abundance and productivity of algae. In treatments without fish, large mats of filamentous algae formed early in the experiment. These algae senesced, decomposed, and were not replaced. When fish were present, algae consisted of attached biofilms with consistent biomass and spatial distribution over time. Although previous work has shown that mussels can have strong, seasonal bottom-up effects on both primary and secondary production, our results suggested that adding grazing mobile fishes, led to a more consistent and homogenous supply of algal resources. Because mussels rarely occur in the absence of fish, considering their combined influence on ecosystem dynamics is likely to be important.

AB  - Context. Studies of distribution and habitat utilisation of sympatric animals, especially those experiencing population increases, are useful for understanding their specialised habitat niches and interspecies relationships, in addition to developing effective protection strategies. Aims. As a species that lives within the range of the giant panda, the sambar population has been increasing in the past few decades in Southwest China. In this paper, we aimed to analyse the overlap in habitat area and habitat suitability between giant panda and sambar in Wolong National Nature Reserve to examine potential sympatric species competition in the context of wildlife conservation. Methods. We ran MaxEnt models based on giant panda occurrence sign locations (n = 316) and sambar presence locations (n = 598). In addition, we predicted the core and secondary habitat for the two species to assess the degree of competition across a gradient of habitat conditions. Key results. Our analysis detected significant habitat overlap between the two species - up to 75.96% in their potential habitat, with suitability overlap indices reaching 0.74. Conclusions. These results indicate that the similarity of habitat requirements of the two species is high in our study area. In addition, the competition over space utilisation between the two species' populations could intensify in the future as the sambar population increases. Implications. Our results suggest that habitat restoration and corridor construction could be recommended as conservation strategies for future wildlife conservation in China's Giant Panda National Park. Moreover, future wildlife conservation should pay greater attention to the niche overlap and interspecific competition among sympatric species. We suggest strengthening habitat restoration and corridors for all key species in the region, not just giant pandas, to alleviate the increased competition associated with niche overlap among sympatric species.

AB  - Ants, a prominent insect group, play important roles in various terrestrial ecosystems, by engaging in diverse biotic interactions, such as those involving plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). This study investigates the seasonal dynamics of this interaction throughout the dry and rainy seasons in a southern Sonoran Desert site. Results indicate that despite a relatively low coverage of EFN-bearing plants (4.97% +/- 4.60), interactions between ants, and these plants are frequent, involving 31% of the perennial plant community (35 species) and 54% of the ant community (35 species). The cactus family exhibited the highest species richness (7 of 11 species) with EFNs in the study area. The location of EFNs varied among plant species and were associated with both vegetative and reproductive organs. Employing selective trapping for ants that forage on plants bearing EFNs, a higher ant species richness was recorded during the rainy season (19 vs 12 spp.). The network's topology is associated with plant phenology, and slight seasonal differences in network structure parameters were observed. Seasonal variation in the interaction align with the phenology of EFN-bearing plants. Factors such as water availability could influence competition and, consequently, the inter-season variation in the number and dependencies of ant-plant interactions. Only two species were consistently recorded in both seasons within the core of generalists: the cactus Cylindropuntia fulgida and the ant Forelius pruinosus. Given the substantial involvement of ants with EFN-bearing plants, this association emerges as a fundamental component within the community of this desert site.

AB  - Background Caribou and reindeer across the Arctic spend more than two thirds of their lives moving in snow. Yet snow-specific mechanisms driving their winter ecology and potentially influencing herd health and movement patterns are not well known. Integrative research coupling snow and wildlife sciences using observations, models, and wildlife tracking technologies can help fill this knowledge void. Methods Here, we quantified the effects of snow depth on caribou winter range selection and movement. We used location data of Central Arctic Herd (CAH) caribou in Arctic Alaska collected from 2014 to 2020 and spatially distributed and temporally evolving snow depth data produced by SnowModel. These landscape-scale (90 m), daily snow depth data reproduced the observed spatial snow-depth variability across typical areal extents occupied by a wintering caribou during a 24-h period. Results We found that fall snow depths encountered by the herd north of the Brooks Range exerted a strong influence on selection of two distinct winter range locations. In winters with relatively shallow fall snow depth (2016/17, 2018/19, and 2019/20), the majority of the CAH wintered on the tundra north of the Brooks Range mountains. In contrast, during the winters with relatively deep fall snow depth (2014/15, 2015/16, and 2017/18), the majority of the CAH caribou wintered in the mountainous boreal forest south of the Brooks Range. Long-term (19 winters; 2001-2020) monitoring of CAH caribou winter distributions confirmed this relationship. Additionally, snow depth affected movement and selection differently within these two habitats: in the mountainous boreal forest, caribou avoided areas with deeper snow, but when on the tundra, snow depth did not trigger significant deep-snow avoidance. In both wintering habitats, CAH caribou selected areas with higher lichen abundance, and they moved significantly slower when encountering deeper snow. Conclusions In general, our findings indicate that regional-scale selection of winter range is influenced by snow depth at or prior to fall migration. During winter, daily decision-making within the winter range is driven largely by snow depth. This integrative approach of coupling snow and wildlife observations with snow-evolution and caribou-movement modeling to quantify the multi-facetted effects of snow on wildlife ecology is applicable to caribou and reindeer herds throughout the Arctic.

AB  - Plants usually respond to environmental shifts with morpho-physiological adjustments, which trickles down to biotic interac-tions in the insect-plant system. We evaluate how Copaifera langsdorffii, a widespread tree species adapted to multiple ecosys-tems, responds to shifts in nutrient and water availability through experimental supplementation and how it affects its insect communities. We also evaluate how the presence of extrafloral nectaries (EFN) exudates modifies galling insect diversity and herbivory rates. Such experimental approach is scarce, as we simultaneously evaluate biotic and abiotic factors and cover the entire reproductive cycle of a species in natural environments, bringing important contributions to better understand how bot-tom-up factors drive species interactions and possibly community assembly. The experiment was set in an ironstone outcrop vegetation, where we deployed supplementation treatments in 80 plant individuals divided into the following field treatments: (T1 = Fertilizer, T2 = EFN simulation (Eppendorf tubes with a 20% sugar solution), T3 = fertilizer + EFN simulation, T4 = water spray, T5 = EFN control (microtube with water), and T6 = Control. We observed lower sclerophylly and greater leaf area in plant individuals that were supplemented with nutrients and water. Herbivory rates were lower and ant abundance was higher in plants with artificial EFNs available. While we did not observe variations in richness and abundance of galling insects, the patterns of co-occurrence of galls varied with the availability of resources (nesting space) in the plant. This study illustrates how variations in nutrient availability to plants modify interactions with insect communities. Ant-plant interactions can have a negative impact on general herbivory rates, however ants seem to have a more harmonious relationship with the galling insects. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Vertical stratification of forests results in the occurrence of different arthropod assemblages between the vertical layers. Fallen arthropods from the canopy layers (i.e., "arthropod rain") are additional food sources for predators thriving on the forest floor (FF). However, the abundances of arthropods are strongly affected by weather conditions and vertical stratification. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the vertical distribution of arthropod assemblages and effects of temperature and precipitation on the arthropod rain in a temperate conifer (Cryptomeria japonica) forest. Arthropods were collected by water-pan traps and trunk-sticky traps in the upper canopy (UC; 16 m), lower canopy (10 m), and FF (0.5 m). Among the fallen arthropods collected by water-pan traps, wandering detritivores, and herbivores were more abundant ranging from the FF to the UC, whereas the abundance of wandering predators (mainly spiders) was similar in the upper and lower canopies. However, detritivores, herbivores, and predators showed the highest abundance in the UC among the flying arthropods. Wandering arthropods moved upward from the FF toward the tree trunks more frequently than downward, indicating the importance of arthropod immigration from the ground to arboreal habitats. Temperature and precipitation had different effects on fallen and moving arthropods among different taxonomic groups. Flying arthropods were affected only by temperature, while wandering detritivores and herbivores were affected by precipitation and temperature. Thus, the abundance of wandering and flying arthropods differed among the vertical layers of a temperate conifer forest; additionally, arthropod rain was closely associated with weather conditions.

AB  - The diversity and population structure of woody species at Maun Educational Park (MEP) was investigated from June to July 2018. A total of 23, 18 and 30 quadrats of 20 x 20 m size were laid down at 50 m intervals along a transect line at riparian, seasonal floodplain and upland habitat, respectively. The Shannon diversity index and evenness were 1.87 and 1.54 in the riparian habitat, 2.01 and 0.77 in the seasonal floodplain habitat, 0.71 and 0.80 in the upland habitat. The species richness was 22, 14 and 19 in riparian, seasonal floodplain and upland habitat, respectively. The patterns of population structures of the woody species revealed that 32% and 21% of the woody species recorded in riparian and upland habitat, respectively, had a "reverse J-shaped" distribution, indicating a healthy or good regeneration. Vachellia tortilis and Combretum imberbe showed healthy regeneration in both riparian and upland habitat. Healthy regeneration in these species was attributable to their adaptive and defence mechanisms to herbivory. Most of the woody species showed either hampered seedling recruitment or hampered regeneration as a result of anthropogenic disturbance and herbivory. Almost all of the woody species (86%) in the seasonal floodplain habitat exhibited relatively good seedling recruitment and discontinued regeneration in the subsequent middle and higher diameter classes, suggesting that flooding inhibited regeneration of woody species.

AB  - Simple Summary A critical issue is the significant decrease in productivity and heightened consumer awareness caused by the inadequate welfare of confined lactating water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Providing supplementary feeding during milking (SFAM) helps alleviate the adverse effects of stall confinement on milk quality by enhancing welfare indicators like udder hygiene, body condition and milking behaviour. Additionally, SFAM has comparable benefits for second and third-calving buffalo cows. Implementing SFAM for barn-confined buffalo cows improves production outcomes, regardless of parity, positively impacting consumer perception.Abstract This study aimed to evaluate whether supplemental feeding at milking (SFAM) positively influences the quantitative-qualitative milk parameters due to improving some welfare assessment traits of multiparous Anatolian buffalo cows confined in semi-open free-stall barns. A total of 76 Anatolian buffalo cows at approximately 90 days in milk were selected to encompass four groups (OSF-2nd, NSF-2nd, OSF->= 3rd and NSF->= 3rd), considering offering (OSF) or not (NSF) supplemental feed at milking and the parity (2nd) and (>= 3rd). Data of evaluated variables such as the following ones-(i) subjectively scored welfare assessment traits (temperament, udder hygiene and body condition), (ii) milk yield per milking (MYM), (iii) milk components, and (iv) milk physical traits-were analysed using a linear mixed model and principal component (PC) analysis. The OSF improved the temperament, udder hygiene and body condition scores compared to the NSF. The MYM, the fat content and the fat-to-protein ratio of the OSF were higher than those of the NSF, but milk mineral and electrical conductivity of the OSF were lower than those of the NSF. The parity of cows did not affect the evaluated variables. Four parameters (milk density value and lactose, solids-not-fat and protein contents) could be identified in the PC2 versus PC1 plot. In conclusion, the SFAM enhanced the milk yield and qualitative milk parameters due to improving the welfare status of indoor buffalo cows, regardless of parity.

AB  - Conservation and management efforts have resulted in population increases and range expansions for some apex predators, potentially changing trophic cascades and foraging behavior. Changes in sympatric carnivore and dominant scavenger populations provide opportunities to assess how carnivores affect one another. Cougars (Puma concolor) were the apex predator in the Great Basin of Nevada, USA, for over 80 years. Black bears (Ursus americanus) have recently recolonized the area and are known to heavily scavenge on cougar kills. To evaluate the impacts of sympatric, recolonizing bears on cougar foraging behavior in the Great Basin, we investigated kill sites of 31 cougars between 2009 and 2017 across a range of bear densities. We modeled the variation in feeding bout duration (number of nights spent feeding on a prey item) and the proportion of primary prey, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), in cougar diets using mixed-effects models. We found that feeding bout duration was driven primarily by the size of the prey item being consumed, local bear density, and the presence of dependent kittens. The proportion of mule deer in cougar diet across all study areas declined over time, was lower for male cougars, increased with the presence of dependent kittens, and increased with higher bear densities. In sites with feral horses (Equus ferus), a novel large prey, cougar consumption of feral horses increased over time. Our results suggest that higher bear densities over time may reduce cougar feeding bout durations and influence the prey selection trade-off for cougars when alternative, but more dangerous, large prey are available. Shifts in foraging behavior in multicarnivore systems can have cascading effects on prey selection. This study highlights the importance of measuring the impacts of sympatric apex predators and dominant scavengers on a shared resource base, providing a foundation for monitoring dynamic multipredator/scavenger systems.

AB  - Free-living soil nematodes span several trophic levels and play a key role in soil food webs. As such, the relative abundances and diversity of nematode feeding groups, along with nematode body size that is correlated with trophic transfer efficiency may provide useful information in understanding carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil systems. Yet, despite their role in soil carbon dynamics, there is a lack of knowledge regarding nematode trophic diversity in high carbon storage systems such as boreal peatlands. Here we assessed nematode communities using feeding groups (bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores, omnivores, and predators) based on mouthpart morphology, and their body sizes (length and mass) in two contrasting boreal peatlands in Northern Ontario, Canada that differ in vegetation (Sphagnum vs Carex), hydrology, nutrient availability, and microbial decomposition. We found that nematode trophic diversity was higher in the Sphagnum-dominated fen, and that the dominant nematode group corresponded to the dominant microbial group at each site. Predatory nematodes were significantly more abundant and larger in the Sphagnum-dominated fen, consistent with greater food web complexity, but the average body size of nematodes (all feeding groups included) was not significantly different between the fens. Taken together, these observed trends in nematode feeding groups and body sizes, along with higher microbial biomass in the Sphagnum-dominated fen supports the idea that the two sites may differ ecologically, and generally follow differences in microbial communities. Our study provides important baseline information for understanding peatland soil food web dynamics and their implications for carbon and nutrient dynamics.

AB  - The success of invasive macrophytes can depend on local nutrient availability and consumer pressure, which may interact. We therefore experimentally investigated the interacting effects of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) addition, the exclusion of large herbivorous fishes and mimicked grazing on the expansion rates of the invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea. The experiments were established on Bonaire and Aruba, two islands in the southern Caribbean, which differ in fish community structure. We observed that multiple Caribbean fish species feed on H. stipulacea. At both study sites, nutrient enrichment decreased invasive leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios. However only on Bonaire, where herbivore fish abundance was 7 times higher and diversity was 4.5 times higher, did nutrient enrichment result in a significant reduction of H. stipulacea expansion into native Thalassia testudinum meadows. This effect was likely due to increased herbivory on nutrient enriched seagrass leaves, as we found that excluding large herbivorous fish (e.g. parrotfish) doubled invasive expansion rates in bare patches on Bonaire. On Aruba, H. stipulacea expansion rates were higher overall, which coincided with lower abundances and diversity of native fishes, and were limited by mimicked fish grazing. We suggest that top-down control by the native fish community may counteract eutrophication effects by increased grazing pressure on nutrient-rich invasive seagrass leaves. We conclude that diverse and abundant herbivore communities likely play an important role in limiting invasion success and their conservation and restoration may serve as a tool to slow down seagrass invasions.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity imposes increasing pressure on wildlife populations globally; these pressures can affect habitat suitability and function, modify wildlife space use, and influence population viability. Native mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations can be negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance and modify their space use in response to land development and recreational activity. From 2018 to 2020, we studied space use of mountain goats northeast of Smithers, British Columbia, Canada, an area that is subject to increasing anthropogenic development and yearlong recreational activities. We aimed to generate models that would improve our ability to identify habitat for mountain goats relative to existing survey data and established ungulate winter ranges. Using resource selection function (RSF) analyses generated from global positioning system (GPS) collar data, we identified influential habitat covariates and compared these covariates and RSF values to existing habitat models. Additionally, we compared the extent to which our models were congruent with existing resource selection probability functions, were congruent with aerial survey data, and overlapped existing ungulate winter ranges previously derived from predictive models inside and outside of the study area. Overall, our models noted higher RSF values among GPS data relative to aerial survey data for winter months, while results for summer habitats were comparable. In extending our RSFs outside of the study area and evaluating the overlap with ungulate winter ranges in adjacent areas, values were similar, albeit lower, as is expected given that the models were developed elsewhere. Ultimately, these models, combined with existing methods, improve the accuracy and reliability of identified, important areas of habitat for mountain goats. We recommend that the RSF models generated here be used in conjunction with aerial survey data and existing methods to delineate ungulate winter ranges for mountain goats in similar eco-regions in British Columbia. The models developed here support existing methods that have been used to delineate or validate ungulate winter ranges for mountain goats in British Columbia and help facilitate mitigation measures to support the continued use of important winter habitat and significant landscape features that play a role in ensuring population viability and resilience through time.

AB  - Livestock farming, which produces milk and meat, is practised by nearly all cultures. But in addition to this, grazing livestock fulfils other fundamentally important roles, one of which is the maintenance of open landscapes, which in turn provides habitat for many rare plant and animal species. Whether wild large herbivores, such as red deer (Cervus elaphus), benefit from the management of the open landscapes is unknown, and there are conflicting views on the nature of the interaction between livestock and wildlife. To investigate this question, we studied interactions in space and time between red deer and livestock in an 787 ha fenced pasture in eastern Germany. First, we used faecal pellet counts to determine whether red deer were using the fenced pasture and whether livestock were using the entire available pasture. Second, we fitted ten red deer, as well as eight Konik horses (Equus ferus caballus) and eight Heck cattle (Bos taurus) with GPS-collars. These data allowed us to perform analyses of space-time interactions. The faecal pellet data showed that red deer did indeed use the fenced pasture and that livestock used the entire extent of the pasture. Further, we verified a neutral space-time interaction between red deer and livestock within the pasture. Thus, there was no indication of a negative effect of the presence of livestock on red deer inside the pasture. For these reasons, we recommend that low-intensity grazing by cattle and horses can maintain open landscapes without detrimental effects on the use of the area by red deer.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) colonized the southeastern United States over the last century as large predators, including the red wolf (Canis rufus) and eastern cougar (Puma concolor), were extirpated from the region. As a generalist carnivore, the coyote preys on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and various smaller mammals, birds, and vegetation. While resource selection by coyotes has been well documented at the home-range scale, little is known about their foraging behavior, which is an important factor in thoroughly understanding influences of coyotes on prey and sympatric carnivores. We assessed third-order resource selection of coyotes at sites across Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina during 2015-2016. Using GPS collars, we tracked 41 resident coyotes across four calendar seasons and identified suspected foraging areas using recursive analysis where individuals repeatedly returned to known locations. We found that resident coyotes selected for open landcover types throughout the year, while avoiding primary and secondary roads. Additionally, resident coyotes avoided forested landcover types while selecting for forest edges except from April to June when they foraged within interior forest away from edges. Previous studies have documented substantive predation rates on white-tailed deer neonates by coyotes, and that fawn mortality may increase in forested landscapes away from forest edge. Our findings indicate that foraging coyotes may select forest cover types during spring where fawns are more vulnerable to predation. Additionally, there has been debate in the literature as to how coyotes obtain consistent levels of deer in their diets outside of fawning and fall hunting seasons. Our study indicates that use of road-kill carcasses by coyotes was an unlikely explanation for the presence of deer in coyote diets throughout the year, as coyotes in our study were not observed using roads during foraging excursions.

AB  - Assessments of the adaptive potential in natural populations are essential for understanding and predicting responses to environmental stressors like climate change and infectious disease. Species face a range of stressors in human-dominated landscapes, often with contrasting effects. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) are expanding in the northern part of their range following decreasing winter severity and increasing forage availability. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease affecting deer, is likewise expanding and represents a major threat to deer and other cervids. We obtained tissue samples from free-ranging deer across their native range in Ontario, Canada, which has yet to detect CWD in wild populations. We used high-throughput sequencing to assess neutral genomic variation and variation in the prion protein gene (PRNP) that is partly responsible for the protein misfolding when deer contract CWD. Neutral variation revealed a high number of rare alleles and no population structure, and demographic models suggested a rapid historical population expansion. Allele frequencies of PRNP variants associated with CWD susceptibility and disease progression were evenly distributed across the landscape and consistent with deer populations not infected with CWD. We estimated the selection coefficient of CWD, with simulations showing an observable and rapid shift in PRNP allele frequencies that coincides with the start of a novel CWD outbreak. Sustained surveillance of genomic and PRNP variation can be a useful tool for guiding management practices, which is especially important for CWD-free regions where deer are managed for ecological and economic benefits.

AB  - Yak herding, a market -based tradition, is vanishing gradually. The changing environment such as climate change, policy context, and socioeconomic change is not in favor of yak herding. Using a choice experiment survey approach, this study determines the yak herders' preferences to improve yak herding in Kanchenjunga Landscape, Nepal. The results of the choice response analysis indicate that yak herders prefer to improve yak herding by improving rangeland management, infrastructure, and health and safety services. Herders have a high preference for yak insurance (US dollar [USD] 6.82/yak), followed by cultivating an improved variety of grass in rangeland (USD 6.71/yak), improved health services (USD 5.68/yak), allowing controlled burning (USD 4.72/yak), and permanent structure of shed (USD 4.39/yak). Additionally, this analysis suggests that a policy is required to allow controlled burning to improve the condition of rangeland, which can contribute to reducing the encroachment of shrubs. Similarly, there is also a need to further explore the appropriate insurance mechanism for yaks to involve all yak herders and reduce their risk. (c) 2024 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The study was carried out to compare the in vitro and in vivo heat shock responses of cattle and buffaloes. The expression of heat responsive genes (HSP70 and HSF family) were studied in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cattle and buffalo. In vivo observations on animals were carried out to investigate the physiological responses of cattle and buffalo at different THI over a period of 14 months. The study indicated that onset and severity of heat stress at different THI varied significantly between cattle and buffalo. Rectal temperature (RT) showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase at THI 67 in buffaloes and at THI 68 in cattle. Significant (p < 0.01) differences in RT between the species were observed at THI 71, 72, and 73. Respiration rate (RR) significantly (p < 0.05) increased at THI 70 in both the species and significant (p < 0.05) differences in RR were observed between the species at THI 65, 68, 69, and 74. THI had significant (p < 0.05) effect on blood glucose and blood electrolytes of the species with increased levels at higher THI. Serum AST and ALT levels showed less pronounced changes over increasing THI. Heat stress-associated expressions of HSP 70 genes followed temporal changes with incremental THI. The expression of HSPA8 was consistent at lower THI whereas upregulation of HSPA1A and HSPA1L was evident at higher THI. The study concludes that changes in physiological parameters such as RT and RR occur in a phasic pattern in both species and onset of heat stress was early in buffalo as compared to cattle.

AB  - The synergy of pollution control and carbon reduction is conducive to promoting the green transformation of the economy. Based on China's 30 provincial administrative panel data from 2002 to 2020, using the elastic concept to measure the synergy index and the panel fixed effect model to carry out empirical analysis, we analyzed the relation between environmental regulation and the synergy of pollution control and carbon reduction. The results revealed that: (1) Environmental regulation positively influenced the synergy of pollution control and carbon reduction in hog breeding. (2) Different types of pollution and carbon reduction had different synergistic effects. Compared with chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen, the positive effect of environmental regulation on the synergy of total phosphorus and carbon reduction was relatively weaker. (3) From the perspective of impact mechanisms, environmental regulation mainly achieved synergies through the "production constraint effect" and the "innovation compensation effect". (4) Further analysis showed that environmental regulation had a significant scale threshold effect on the synergy of pollution control and carbon reduction in hog breeding. Therefore, the heterogeneity of pollutants and industrial scale should be considered in the optimization of environmental regulation policies.

AB  - In northern California, Roosevelt (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) and Rocky Mountain (C. c. nelsoni) elk occupy a wide variety of habitats over a large extent, including the Marble Mountains Elk Management Unit (MM EMU). Dense forest canopy and steep, mountainous terrain present significant challenges for monitoring elk populations using traditional aerial and ground-based methods. These constraints have resulted in inadequate spatial and temporal research and monitoring. To address the need for comprehensive and reliable elk abundance estimates, we implemented a landscape-level camera trap study within the MM EMU. We deployed 180 cameras and applied a time-to-event model to estimate elk latency time to detection for a given species. Analysis yielded an estimate of 1,415 (95% CI: continued recreational, ecological, and economic benefits of elk and wildlife in general.

AB  - Adaptive genetic and neutral variations are essential for maintaining population viability in changing environmental conditions. Habitat loss and fragmentation can be reflected in the patterns of genetic variation in the populations. White-lipped peccaries (WLPs, Tayassu pecari) are wide-ranging Neotropical ungulates with important ecological roles in the ecosystem suffering local extinctions worldwide. Here, we used a RAD-seq protocol to genotype 192 individuals. After filtering, we identified sets of SNP markers (ranging from 147 to 151,792 SNPs) to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of WLPs from Pantanal, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest in Brazil. We found signals of loss (theta w < theta pi) and lower genetic diversity (allelic richness, nucleotide diversity, and observed and expected heterozygosities) in the Central Cerrado and Atlantic Forest populations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and admixture analyses (NGSAdmix) using genome-wide and neutral SNP data sets showed three major genetic clusters according to the biomes. Multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) analysis found an isolation-by-distance pattern explaining the neutral genetic differentiation. We used Latent Factor Mixed Models (LFMM) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to identify candidate SNPs involved in different biological processes, such as metabolism and immune and neuronal responses, mainly associated with temperature and precipitation variables. We found an adaptive population genetic structure, suggesting three adaptive units with significant patterns of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment. Our results highlighted the importance of conservation strategies for maintaining the genetic diversity of WLP populations. Furthermore, conservation plans and translocation programs should preserve and consider the adaptive variation.

AB  - Nearly every terrestrial ecosystem hosts invasive ant species, and many of those ant species construct underground nests near roots and/or tend phloem-feeding hemipterans on plants. We have a limited understanding of how these invasive ant behaviours change photosynthesis, carbohydrate availability and growth of woody plants. We measured photosynthesis, water relations, carbohydrate concentrations and growth for screenhouse-reared Acacia drepanolobium saplings on which we had manipulated invasive Pheidole megacephala ants and native Ceroplastes sp. hemipterans to determine whether and how soil nesting and hemipteran tending by ants affect plant carbon dynamics. In a field study, we also compared leaf counts of vertebrate herbivore-excluded and -exposed saplings in invaded and non-invaded savannas to examine how ant invasion and vertebrate herbivory are associated with differences in sapling photosynthetic crown size. Though hemipteran infestations are often linked to declines in plant performance, our screenhouse experiment did not find an association between hemipteran presence and differences in plant physiology. However, we did find that soil nesting by P. megacephala around screenhouse plants was associated with >58% lower whole-crown photosynthesis, >31% lower pre-dawn leaf water potential, >29% lower sucrose concentrations in woody tissues and >29% smaller leaf areas. In the field, sapling crowns were 29% smaller in invaded savannas than in non-invaded savannas, mimicking screenhouse results. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil nesting near roots, a common behaviour by Pheidole megacephala and other invasive ants, can directly reduce carbon fixation and storage of Acacia drepanolobium saplings. This mechanism is distinct from the disruption of a native ant mutualism by P. megacephala, which causes similar large declines in carbon fixation for mature A. drepanolobium trees. Acacia drepanolobium already has extremely low natural rates of recruitment from the sapling to mature stage, and we infer that these negative effects of invasion on saplings potentially curtail recruitment and reduce population growth in invaded areas. Our results suggest that direct interactions between invasive ants and plant roots in other ecosystems may strongly influence plant carbon fixation and storage.

AB  - Mexican islands are an important biodiversity reservoir that is threatened by the introduction of invasive exotic species. In recent times, Socorro island, Revillagigedo Archipelago, has experienced significant environmental disturbances including population outbreaks from the Centro American locust (Schistocerca piceifrons). Since S. piceifrons can cause significant damage on native plants, the present study evaluated the population status of S. piceifrons at Socorro island and its effect upon native vegetation. Also, we evaluated historic annual locust abundance in relation to climatic variables in the island. We sampled S. piceifrons in 25 island sites with different vegetation types, once during the dry season and once in the rainy season of 2018. We also evaluated herbivory on most common plants. We did not observe any S. piceifrons gregarious behavior and solitary locusts were more abundant during the rainy season. Herbivory levels were low (< 7%). We detected that locust abundance was associated to moderate temperature years with high atmospheric humidity. Since outbreaks have been reported previously, we recommend continuing locust monitoring, however current situation does not suggest to start any control measures on S. piceifrons populations.

AB  - Understanding where consumers control plant reproduction in a time of changing plant-consumer interactions with environmental change can inform conservation. A seminal hypothesis-the environmental stress model (the ESM)-posits that consumer control of plants varies predictably with environmental stress. The ESM has been tested often along gradients of an abiotic stressor, yielding highly mixed support, although plants and consumers are often differently affected by a stressor.Here, to provide a conciliation, we introduced and tested a new ESM-the ESM in plants' versus consumers' perspectives. In field exclusion experiments conducted at three marsh sites that varied broadly in plant productivity, crab abundance and salinity within a coastal landscape, we tested the new ESM in predicting the impact of crab herbivores on the sexual reproduction of Phragmites australis. We analysed how their impact varied with plant productivity and crab abundance-proxies for environmental stresses in plants' and consumers' perspectives, respectively.We found that environmental stresses in plants' and consumers' perspectives were uncoupled across this coastal landscape. Neither crab abundance nor crab grazing intensity was correlated with plant productivity. Plant productivity and crab abundance were inconsistently related to key abiotic stressors including soil salinity.Depending on site, crab herbivores substantially suppressed Phragmites sexual reproductive effort (by >90%, by regulating a series of population- and individual-level reproductive processes) or had little effect. Where crab herbivores had stronger impacts was not predicted by plant productivity, but largely by crab abundance via a threshold model. Above an abundance threshold, crabs increasingly suppressed Phragmites sexual reproductive effort.Synthesis. Our study revealed that consumer control of plant reproduction may be highly variable, even within a coastal landscape and for the same species, and that consumer abundance, rather than plant productivity, was a key predictor of this variation. As plants and consumers become increasingly uncoupled in many ecosystems under environmental change, the newly introduced ESM in plants' versus consumers' perspectives may be more versatile than previously recognized to inform conservation actions.

AB  - Snow conditions are changing rapidly across our planet, which has important implications for wildlife managers. In Alaska, USA, the later arrival of snow is challenging wildlife managers' ability to conduct aerial fall (autumn) moose (Alces alces) surveys. Complete snow cover is required to reliably detect and count moose using visual observation from an aircraft. With inadequate snow to help generate high-quality moose survey data, it is difficult for managers to determine if they are effectively meeting population goals and optimizing hunting opportunities. We quantified past relationships and projected future trends between snow conditions and moose survey success across 7 different moose management areas in Alaska using 32 years (1987-2019) of moose survey data and modeled snow data. We found that modeled mean snow depth was 15 cm (SD = 11) when moose surveys were initiated, and snow depths were greater in years when surveys were completed compared to years when surveys were canceled. Further, we found that mean snow depth toward the beginning of the survey season (1 November) was the best predictor of whether a survey was completed in any given year. Based on modeled conditions, the trend in mean snow depth on 1 November declined from 1980 to 2020 in 5 out of 7 survey areas. These findings, coupled with future projections, indicated that by 2055, the delayed onset of adequate snow accumulation in the fall will prevent the completion of moose surveys over roughly 60% of Alaska's managed moose areas at this time of the year. Our findings can be used by wildlife managers to guide decisions related to the future reliability of aerial fall moose surveys and help to identify timelines for development of alternate measurement and monitoring methods.

AB  - Chromosomal inversions are an important form of structural variation that can affect recombination, chromosome structure and fitness. However, because inversions can be challenging to detect, the prevalence and hence the significance of inversions segregating within species remains largely unknown, especially in natural populations of mammals. Here, by combining population-genomic and long-read sequencing analyses in a single, widespread species of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), we identified 21 polymorphic inversions that are large (1.5-43.8 Mb) and cause near-complete suppression of recombination when heterozygous (0-0.03 cM Mb(-1)). We found that inversion breakpoints frequently occur in centromeric and telomeric regions and are often flanked by long inverted repeats (0.5-50 kb), suggesting that they probably arose via ectopic recombination. By genotyping inversions in populations across the species' range, we found that the inversions are often widespread and do not harbour deleterious mutational loads, and many are likely to be maintained as polymorphisms by divergent selection. Comparisons of forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice revealed 13 inversions that contribute to differentiation between populations, of which five exhibit significant associations with traits implicated in local adaptation. Taken together, these results show that inversion polymorphisms have a significant impact on recombination, genome structure and genetic diversity in deer mice and likely facilitate local adaptation across the widespread range of this species.
   The identification of 21 large inversion polymorphisms in populations of deer mice shows that they are widespread, important for patterns of recombination and likely to be involved in local adaptation.

AB  - Predicting the effects of future global changes on species requires a better understanding of the ecological niche dynamics in response to climate; the large climatic fluctuations of the last 50,000 years can be used as a natural experiment to that aim. Here we test whether the realized niche of horse, aurochs, red deer, and wild boar changed between 47,000 and 7500 years ago using paleoecological modelling over an extensive archaeological database. We show that they all changed their niche, with species-specific responses to climate fluctuations. We also suggest that they survived the climatic turnovers thanks to their flexibility and by expanding their niche in response to the extinction of competitors and predators. Irrespective of the mechanism behind such processes, the fact that species with long generation times can change their niche over thousands of years cautions against assuming it to stay constant both when reconstructing the past and predicting the future.

AB  - Crop expansion is generally followed by an increase of herbivores. Some of these herbivore species can be favoured by mutualisms with ants that can also colonise introduced crops. Here, we hypothesized that the invasive mealybug Pseudococcus longispinus has established mutualistic relationships with native or exotic ants in Mediterranean persimmon crop. This relationship could negatively impact mealybug natural enemies and facilitate the colonisation of this new crop by the mealybug. To test this hypothesis, we sampled 17 persimmon orchards from the main producing area of the Mediterranean basin across two consecutive years and three different seasons. We identified the ant complex attending Ps. longispinus, calculated the ant attendance ratios and assessed the density dependence between tending ants and Ps. longispinus at mealybug colony level. Finally, we evaluated the effect of ants on the density of Ps. longispinus and its natural enemies at tree level. Fifteen ant species were found foraging in persimmon trees, out of which 11 attended Ps. longispinus colonies. The Mediterranean native species Lasius grandis, Pheidole pallidula and Plagiolepis spp. were the most abundant ant species in the canopies, and La. grandis was the most abundant species attending Ps. longispinus. This ant tended to attend large colonies of the mealybug in spring and summer. Pseudococcus longispinus density was positively correlated with ant activity in persimmon trees, which can be partially explained by the negative effect of ants on the mealybug parasitism and the density of potential predators. This study suggests that the density and damage caused by Ps. longispinus in Mediterranean persimmon are exacerbated by the attendance of native ants that disrupt mealybug biological control. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that ant attendance is a driving factor determining the density of honeydew-producing herbivores and highlight that native ant species may facilitate the establishment and spread of exotic honeydew-producing pests in new crops.

AB  - Exploring the response between benthic community changes and environmental variables has significance for restoring the health of river ecosystems. However, little is known of the impact on communities of interactions between multiple environmental factors, and frequent changes in the flow of mountain rivers are different from those in the flow of plain river networks, which also impact differently the benthic community. Thus, there is a need for research on the response of benthic communities to environmental changes in mountain rivers under flow regulation. In this study, we collected samples from the Jiangshan River in the dry season (November 2021) and the wet season (July 2022) to investigate the aquatic ecology and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the watershed. Multi-dimension analyses were used to analyze the spatial variation in the community structure and response of benthic macroinvertebrates to multiple environmental factors. In addition, the explanatory power of the interaction between multiple factors on the spatial variation of communities, and the distribution characteristics of benthic community and their causes were investigated. The results showed that herbivores are the most abundant forms in the benthic community of mountain rivers. The structure of benthic community in Jiangshan River was significantly affected by water quality and substrate, whereas the overall community structure was affected by river flow conditions. Furthermore, nitrite nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were the key environmental factors impacting the spatial heterogeneity of communities during the dry and wet season, respectively. Meanwhile, the interaction between these environmental factors showed a synergistic effect, enhancing the influence of these environmental factors on community structure. Thus, controlling urban and agricultural pollution and releasing ecological flow would be effective strategies to improve benthic biodiversity. Our study showed that using the interaction of environmental factors was a suitable way to evaluate the asso-ciation between environmental variables and variation in benthic macroinvertebrate community structure in river ecosystems.

AB  - Key message Habitat fragmentation influences leaf morphology, quantity and quality of plant resources to herbivores, which in turn affects the patterns of fluctuating asymmetry and herbivory in Quercus deserticola. Forest fragmentation has negative effects on biodiversity by modifying environmental conditions, ecological processes and biotic interactions. We analyzed the effects of forest fragment size and habitat type (forest edge x interior) on the amount of plant resources and their quality for herbivores, leaf morphology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and herbivory on Quercus deserticola at the Cuitzeo Basin in Mexico. Six forest fragments, where Q. deserticola occurs were classified as (i) small (<= 10 ha); (ii) medium (>= 25 ha); and (iii) large (>= 65 ha). In each forest fragment, four parallel transects of 5 x 50 m were sampled, two located at the edge and two in the interior of the fragments. Chlorophyll content, leaf area, canopy cover and tree size were greater in small than in larger fragments. Leaves of individuals in small fragments and in forest edges were more elongated and wider than in large and in the interior of fragments. Our results also showed higher levels of FA and insect herbivory in the small fragments and forest edges. Insect herbivory was positively correlated with FA in small forest fragments, indicating that the mechanisms driving their interaction are scale-dependent and vary among habitat types according to fragment size. Our findings do not support the idea that the fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable biomarker to detect environmental stress in Q. deserticola in fragmented habitats, but FA may be a good biomarker of plant stress caused by the amount of herbivory damage.

AB  - Being plastic in face of environmental changes that negatively affect communities can increase the average fitness within populations and alter the resilience of the ecological system. Understanding this effect is important for making predictions about future landscapes. We used simulation studies to assess the effects of dispersal behaviour plasticity on community resilience, in the context of disturbance (habitat loss and fragmentation) caused by humans. We also evaluated how resilience is affected by the cost of plasticity, trophic level and specialisation, and by the extent and clustering of the disturbance, through an agent-based model with 10 model species and 3 trophic levels. We found that community resilience is best explained by plasticity, plasticity cost, disturbance extent, and disturbance clustering, with increased community resilience when the individuals have plasticity. This effect increases with disturbance extent - the resilience increases as the degree of plasticity in-creases. Herbivores and generalists were more resilient than carnivores and specialists. We conclude that all explanatory variables used in this study are relevant to resilience in a world suffering rapid changes caused by humans.

AB  - Determining barriers to tree regeneration along elevational gradients is important to predict shifts in regeneration patterns under climate change scenarios. The stress-gradient hypothesis predicts that facilitation predominates at high elevations and competition at low elevations. Invertebrate herbivory may also play an important, yet hardly recognized role, in low elevation and degraded areas. Our objective was to understand the relative changes in facilitation, competition and invertebrate herbivory along an elevational gradient degraded by long-term livestock rearing and repeated wildfires. Our study area was a seasonally dry ecosystem in central Argentina subjected to forest restoration activities. We planted 3000 saplings of the dominant early and late successional tree species in a full factorial design that included elevation (3 levels: low, 1300; intermediate, 1800; and high, 2300 m a.s.l.), microsite treatment, where we manipulated facilitation and competition (4 levels: tussock grasses mowed to the ground, tussock grasses mowed to 15 cm above the ground, unmowed tussock grasses with an average height of 70 cm, and tussock grasses mowed to the ground near rock outcrops) and 5 blocks per elevation. We monitored sapling survival, change in height, and damage by invertebrate herbivores during one year. For both species, sapling survival significantly increased with elevation, while sapling change in height decreased. Survival and change in height for microsite treatments suggest weak competition for the early successional species and facilitation for the late successional species. Notably, we did not find the elevation and microsite treatment interaction predicted by the stress-gradient hypothesis. The main invertebrate herbivores were leaf-cutting ants, which damaged 42, 33 and 0%, and 25, 27 and 0% of the saplings according to species, for the low, intermediate and high elevations, respectively. Damage did not differ significantly between microsite treatments for either species. Survival for saplings with evidence of damage by leaf-cutting ants was 2.5 and 3.4 times lower as compared saplings with no evidences, according to species. Our findings imply that under a climate warming scenario, future facilitation and competition effects will be similar to current effects, whereas leaf-cutting ants rather than competition may increasingly limit tree regeneration.

AB  - Changes in vegetation phenology related to global warming are having alarming effects on the life history traits of many herbivore species. Such changes are particularly critical in alpine ecosystems, where strong climate limitations on plant growth make seasonal synchronization imperative for the growth, reproduction and survival of herbivores. However, despite the pivotal role of resource-use strategies on the performances of such species, few studies have explicitly assessed the mechanistic impact of climate change on their diets. We aimed to fill this gap by studying the effect of spring onset on the dietary composition and quality of a medium-size alpine herbivore while considering density-dependent processes and age- and sex-specific differences in foraging behavior. Using an exceptional, long-term (24 years) direct individual-based dietary monitoring of a Pyrenean chamois population (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica), we showed that ongoing earlier onsets of spring are leading to an earlier access to high-quality forage and therefore a higher diet quality at a fixed date, without apparent changes in diet composition. We also showed that at high densities, intraspecific competition reduced diet quality by driving animals to feed more on woody plants and less on nutritious forbs and graminoids. By assessing the mechanistic effects of global warming on the dietary patterns of species at the center of trophic networks, this study is an essential step for predictive models aiming at understanding the ongoing ecosystem consequences of the global climatic crisis.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the Water Footprint (WF) for buffalo mozzarella production and consumption relative to an area in central Italy with a high concentration of buffalo farms. Using the Water Footprint Network (WFN) methodology, the consumption of green, blue, and grey water fractions (Wfc) throughout the supply chain has been examined. The study encompassed nine buffalo dairy farms, two cheese factories, four retail outlets, and a cohort of 243 consumers, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire process from raw milk production and mozzarella cheese making to the final stage of home consumption. The results of the study were expressed as litres of water per kg of consumed buffalo mozzarella cheese. The total WF was 6820 +/- 1490 L per kg of mozzarella, with green, blue, and grey Wfc contributing for 59%, 12%, and 29%, respectively. The green Wfc was predominantly influenced (88%) by off-farm feed. The blue Wfc was also primarily affected by off-farm feed (61%), followed by on-farm crop irrigation, buffalos' drinking water and cheese factory operations. Home consumption had a negligible impact on the overall WF. The grey Wfc brought to light environmental concerns, primarily due to nitrate leaching. Although off-farm crops had a remarkable effect on the grey Wfc, the cultivation of on-farm crops was responsible for 69% of this fraction. In particular, a significant part of the grey Wfc originated from on-farm areas left fallow for parts of the year, leading to no uptake of residual nitrogen by crops. Adhering to WFN guidelines, this research not only expands knowledge on the WF of buffalo mozzarella, but also highlights critical water hotspots. It underscores the necessity for dairy farmers to refine irrigation and soil management, incorporating precise irrigation and crop rotation strategies, to mitigate the impacts on Wfc efficiently.

AB  - Tropical forests are facing several impacts from anthropogenic disturbances, climate change, and extreme climate events, with potentially severe consequences for ecological functions, such as predation on folivorous invertebrates. Folivory has a major influence on tropical forests by affecting plant fitness and overall seedling performance. However, we do not know whether the predation of folivorous arthropods by birds, mammals, reptiles, and other arthropods is affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as selective logging and forest fires. We investigated the impacts of both pre-El Nino human disturbances and the 2015-2016 El Nino understorey fires on the predation of 4500 artificial caterpillars across 30 Amazonian forest plots. Plots were distributed in four pre-El Nino forest classes: undisturbed, logged, logged-and-burned, and secondary forests, of which 14 burned in 2015-16. We found a higher predation incidence in forests that burned during the El Nino in comparison with unburned ones. Moreover, logged-and-burned forests that burned again in 2015-16 were found to have significantly higher predation incidence by vertebrates than other forest classes. However, overall predation incidence in pre-El Nino forest disturbance classes was similar to undisturbed forests. Arthropods were the dominant predators of artificial caterpillars, accounting for 91.5% of total predation attempts. Our results highlight the resilience of predation incidence in human-modified forests, although the mechanisms underpinning this resilience remain unclear.

AB  - Conservation of marine biodiversity requires an understanding of the habitats needed to support and replenish species of interest. It also requires knowledge about the abundance and diversity of multispecies assemblages. Variation in the distribution and composition of kelp forests, one of the most productive marine coastal habitats globally, can have major influences on reef fishes-a group of ecologically and socioeconomically important species. In the face of widespread and escalating loss of kelp forests, quantification of these effects is urgently needed to assess and project cascading impacts on biodiversity. Here, we evaluate relationships between kelp forests and associated reef fish populations using a global meta-analysis of experimental kelp removals and comparative surveys of kelp and adjacent non-kelp habitats. These analyses show that kelp forests increase the abundance of reef fishes, though the significance of this effect varied depending on the structural complexity of kelp forests. In experimental studies, kelp forests have a significant positive effect on fish species richness, revealing that kelp act as true foundation species by supporting the diversity of associated multispecies assemblages. Importantly, regardless of kelp forest morphology and type of study (observational or experimental studies), kelp forests enhance the recruitment of early life history stages suggesting they are nursery habitats for many reef fish taxa. Lastly, kelp forests differentially affected species with different functional traits; small body size fishes from low trophic levels (e.g., herbivore and detritivores, micropredators, and mesopredators) and large body size fish from higher trophic level (e.g., piscivores, general carnivores) were both facilitated by kelp forests. Taken together, these results indicate that the loss of kelp forest, particularly those with more complex morphology, can reduce total abundance and diversity of fish, with possible cascading consequences for coastal ecosystem function.

AB  - Background The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L. 1758) was introduced into different regions of the world, generating significant trade-offs that critically impacted native vegetation. Here, we evaluate the rabbit's forage intakes in three vegetation types (forests, shrublands, and grasslands) along the four seasons in a temperate forest landscape in Southern Patagonia and discuss the potential threats over native vegetation. We formulated the following questions: (i) what is the forage offer at each vegetation type? (ii) what is the rabbit's forage intake and how it varied across the seasons along the year? and (iii) which vegetation types and plant life forms were more used according to the rabbit's forage intakes? Methods We censused understory vegetation to characterize the forage offer at each vegetation type and determined seasonal dietary intakes using microhistological analysis of pellets. The plant species identified in the field were grouped according to life form classes (tree regeneration, shrubs, forbs, graminoids, orchids, ferns, bryophytes, and hemiparasites). Data were analysed through uni- and multi-variate analyses, determining relationships between forage offer and the rabbit's forage intakes. Results Forage intakes revealed changes in plant life form consumption across vegetation types, where intake pressure was considerably different for tree regeneration (p = 0.001), graminoids (p = 0.001), and hemiparasites (p = 0.001). Besides, significant changes in consumption among seasons were detected for shrubs (p = 0.001), ferns (p = 0.030), and hemiparasites (p = 0.002). Although many species play an important role in the rabbit's forage intake networks (e.g., Chiliotrichum diffusum, Holcus lanatus), the strongest intake linkages were found in exotic grasses (e.g., Poa pratensis and Festuca sp.), native hemiparasites (e.g., Misodendrum sp.), native shrubs (e.g., Empetrum rubrum), and native trees (e.g., Nothofagus sp.). The summer and autumn seasons presented higher intake compared to the winter and spring seasons. Furthermore, hemiparasites intake (e.g., Misodendrum sp.) suggests that rabbits utilize different forage sources depending on the vegetation types. Conclusions Rabbits regularly inhabit the forest, even though it is not their preferred vegetation type to live. Rabbit management entails isolating regions that are more favourable to intake and emphasizing the year's season for rabbit control efforts.

AB  - Terrestrial plant diversity plays a pivotal role in influencing the abundance, diversity, and impacts of herbivores and pathogens (collectively, plant consumers). However, it is unclear whether the relationships between biodiversity and herbivory reflect the same underlying ecological mechanisms as the relationships between biodiversity and disease. This uncertainty results in part from decades of independent, siloed research on each consumer group. We propose that, across herbivores and pathogens, plant diversity-consumer relationships arise from five fundamental factors: (1) density of a focal plant, (2) total plant biomass, (3) plant neighborhood quality, (4) resource diversity, and (5) structural complexity. By matching established hypotheses to these five fundamental factors, we highlight opportunities for growth in the rapidly developing field of plant-consumer interactions.

AB  - The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) is a recently signed protocol by the conference of the parties (COP 15) with an aim to protect biodiversity from risks imposed by biological threats such as invasive alien species (IAS). The present work is an effort to meet target 6 of GBF which directly deals with IAS by assessing the current and future distribution of Ageratum species in regions of the Eastern Ghats of India. Prediction of Ageratum distribution was done based on greenhouse gas emission levels, namely RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 for the climatic years 2030, 2050 and 2080. Of a total of 23 environmental parameters (19 bioclimatic, 1 land use land cover (LULC) and 3 topographic) seven were selected for species distribution modeling (SDM) considering value inflation factor (VIF) scores <3 by using maximum entropy. In the current climatic scenario, 40.09% of the geographical area (TGA) is covered by Ageratum species which will reach 76.51%, 77.44%, 82.58% for RCP 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 respectively by the end of 2100. Both the AUC value (0.884) and Jackknife test have shown a good model performance. The Eastern Ghats, being a biodiversity-rich zone, needs efficient conservation and management strategies to decrease the extent of invaded areas to maximize biodiversity returns.

AB  - Biodiversity is declining at a rapid pace and, with it, the ecosystem functions that support ecosystem services. To counter this, ecosystem restoration is necessary. While the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been studied in depth, the relationship between ecosystem restoration and ecosystem functioning is studied less. We performed an observational study in grasslands undergoing restoration management toward Nardus grassland. Eight ecosystem functions, representing flows of energy, matter or information between functional compartments, were measured across five successive restoration phases along the restoration gradient. The levels of functioning were then compared along the gradient for both the individual functions and a multifunctionality index. We hypothesized that plant richness increases when grasslands are more restored and this increase in biodiversity is paralleled by an increase in ecosystem functioning. In our study, the degraded grasslands, generally occurring on more nutrient-rich soils, were dominated by competitive fast-growing species, resulting in higher process rates and thus in higher, faster functioning. Likewise, more restored grasslands exhibited slower process rates and, thus, lower functioning. When studying ecosystem functioning, value judgments are easily made. Especially in a restoration context, high functioning does not necessarily equals well functioning, as this depends on the stakeholder perspective. We need to ask ourselves if a high functioning ecosystem is most desirable, especially in a restoration or conservation context. Policy frameworks will need to balance these goals.

AB  - BackgroundRapidly expanding human activities have profoundly changed the habitat use of both large carnivores and their prey, but whether and how human activities affect the interactions between them has received relatively less attention. In this study, we conducted a systematically designed camera-trapping survey on an endangered large carnivore (North Chinese leopard Panthera pardus japonensis) and its wild ungulate prey (Siberian roe deer Capreolus pygargus and wild boar Sus scrofa) in the Taihang Mountains of central North China. Using conditional two-species occupancy model based on data derived from the extensive sampling effort (15,654 camera-days at 102 camera sites), we examined the relationship of spatial use between leopards and each prey species under the effects of human presence, free-ranging cattle, roads and settlements.ResultsHumans and cattle had contrasting effects on the relationship of spatial use between leopard and roe deer, with higher and lower spatial segregation between them at human and cattle-frequented sites, respectively. Roads might create a shelter for wild boar from leopard predation, with less spatial segregation between them at sites close to the roads.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that human activities are reshaping the spatial overlap between large carnivores and their prey, and have non-equivalent effects among different types of human activity. Such effects may further alter the strength of interspecific interactions between predator and prey, with far-reaching influences on the community and ecosystem that require more research.

AB  - Due to human activities and climate change, the habitats of ungulate species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have been greatly affected in recent decades. In this study, the distribution patterns of 19 ungulate species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were identified based on MaxEnt model in the past (1960-1990) and current periods (2000-2015). Then the changes of their habitat distribution and the species richness in different periods were compared. Finally, the Zonation model was used to identify the key protected areas of ungulate species. The results show that the MaxEnt model can well predict the distribution of ungulate species. Most ungulate species are mainly distributed in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The distance to lakes and precipitation are the main factors affecting the distribution of most ungulate species. The habitats originally located in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have mainly extended northeastwards, while the habitats originally located in the northwest has been largely lost. The changes in the habitats of ungulate species in the southeast and northwest are diametrically opposite. The key protected areas identified by Zonation model are mainly located in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The existing nature reserves can effectively protect the suitable habitats of the Tibetan antelope, Tibetan wild ass and wild yak. This research can provide scientific basis for coordinating the contradiction between development and protection and promoting the biodiversity conservation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Livestock grazing have been observed to influence plant productivity and community composition in a variety of grassland ecosystems. However, it is still unclear how the influence of grazing might be exaggerated or mediated by the environment, and particularly by annual precipitation. We conducted a fourteen-year grazing experiment to compare the influence of traditional grazing regime against a no grazing treatment on previously grazed plots. Removing grazing pressure increased plant aboveground net primary productivity [ANPP] across the whole community. This increase was driven by increases in productivity in forbs, potentially due to relaxing herbivory pressure normally brought on by grazing. On average, net primary productivity increased across the entire plant community when grazing pressures were released, though there was not a significant increase in productivity of graminoids. We did observe, however, that a lack of grazing could decrease the ANPP of graminoids, potentially by allowing for a greater competitive influence of forbs. Removing grazing increased the logarithmic response ratios [LRRs] of both the whole community and forbs, regardless of precipitation. Current-year community-wide ANPP [ANPPn] was positively associated with current-year precipitation [PPTn] in both grazed and un-grazed fields, and we considered this to be largely driven by a positive relationship between rainfall and forb productivity. Interestingly, grazing alone did not influence the LRRs of graminoids over time, potentially suggesting that the long-term legacy influence of past grazing regimes is of greater importance than the acute grazing conducted during the experiment. We did find, however, that precipitation had variable influence on the relationship between grazing and LRR of graminoids. The removal of grazing was a more powerful influence on graminoid LRR during wetter years. We also found that the ANPPn of graminoids was positively associated with both PPTn and prior-year ANPP [ANPP (n-1)] of graminoids in both grazed and un-grazed fields, potentially due to its asexual reproduction via belowground meristems. Our results suggest that forbs are more sensitive to grazing and precipitation variability than graminoids, and cessation of grazing may be an appropriate management regime to increase community productivity and potentially associated ecosystem functions to prevent further grassland degradation.

AB  - Megafauna, such as cold-water corals, can promote diversity through various processes, such as predation, bioturbation, competition, and facilitation as habitat engineers. Further investigation into their ecology and role in epifaunal community structure in the deep sea is needed. Diversity, abundance, and spatial patterns of epibenthic megafauna (>= 2 cm) were quantified at regional-scales (100 s m - 100 s km) using high-resolution imagery from 15 stations in the Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area, Canada. A patchy community structure was significantly associated with station and benthoscape class, which in turn was based on geological factors. Three types of assemblages included: (1) dominated by corals Pennatula sp. 2 and/or Hexacorallia (SC.) spp. in shallow eastern benthoscape classes with high abundance and low diversity; (2) a diverse mix of taxa (e.g. sea pens Anthoptilum spp. and Kophobelemnon spp., anemones/cerianthids, etc.) in deeper (>400 m) western benthoscape classes, with low abundance and high diversity; and (3) a unique community dominated by sponges. Overall, eight taxa contributed to most dissimilarities between stations, and communities were similar within 10 km but could differ at greater distances. Benthoscape classes captured environmental factors (e.g. depth and substrate) that may be responsible for changes in diversity and abundance, and are used as a proxy for different habitats. Our study advanced the understanding of regional spatial patterns in the abundance, composition, and diversity of epibenthic communities, by identifying spatial patterns particularly in the Laurentian Channel where data were limited, adding to interpretations of spatial ecology in a previous fine-scale study. Additionally, these spatial patterns reflect various underlying ecological processes that are mostly unknown. Our community analysis and observed changes in abundance and diversity have implications that can help inform future monitoring designs to promote representative and meaningful spatial assessments.

AB  - In southern Africa, archaeobotanical studies are intrinsically linked to prehistoric investigation and the discipline of anthracology has already proved its potential for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological reconstructions. While the region benefits from particularly good preservation of macro charcoal remains in its sites, anthracological studies remain underexplored and the methodological framework still needs to be developed and adapted to the diverse southern African ecological contexts. Here we provide a review of sampling methods and sample representativeness and we compare it with wood charcoal analyses performed in southern Africa. We used the charcoal-rich layers from the Later Stone Age sequence of Bushman Rock Shelter (BRS) to elaborate a sampling strategy producing samples that can both be analysed in a timely manner and that are statistically representative of the whole assemblage. In light of our results, we discuss the relevance of applying anthracological methods developed in European contexts. The evaluation of the taxa richness, diversity and size distribution at BRS leads to the recommendation of the identification of at least 500 charcoal fragments per stratigraphic unit. Thick layers should be split into two distinct samples, one comprising the top half and the other one the bottom half of the layer. The analysis of thin layers with limited charcoal abundance necessitates increasing the surface of sampling. All size-classes should be analysed to avoid any sampling bias.

AB  - Dispersal by grazing and browsing animals has the potential to structure plant-associated microbes in plant communities. Bison are one of the largest grazing animals in North America and charismatic symbols of the Great Plains. They have an important role in maintaining plant communities in tallgrass prairie and may have played a significant role in microbial dispersal across the Great Plains, along with other grazers and herbivores in general. To determine whether bison saliva could maintain viable fungal propagules, we sampled saliva from bison at Konza Prairie Biological Station. Fifty-nine internal transcribed spacer sequences were recovered from distinct fungal colonies on media selective for Fusarium species and Macrophomina phaseolina, representing at least 26 fungal species. Most sequences were identified as originating from potential plant pathogens, indicating that bison may play a role in spreading plant pathogens throughout the prairie. Given their historic numbers and extensive migration across North America, bison may have had a role in establishing the current structure of the prairie microbiome.Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Wildlife diseases, such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) are growing in prevalence in ungulates in western Canada with many questions being asked about the impact on ecosystems and peoples. A collaborative research project involving a university and a regional Indigenous organization was initiated in 2007 to explore how CWD risk is being communicated to Indigenous peoples, how associated risk is being interpreted and the extent to which information about CWD and perceived risk is affecting harvest and food security. Data collected between 2008-2018 with 105 harvesters from 22 northern Alberta communities reporting about hunting in roughly 61 management units (WMU) confirm previous research about the importance of moose, white-tailed deer and mule deer to the diets of Indigenous peoples. Findings affirm the significance of ungulates to the food security of Indigenous peoples in western Canada with over 97 % of respondents reporting their motivation for harvest of moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) being food. Insights about risk communication and perception of CWD are also highlighted with the most significant finding being the high level of concern of harvesters in all areas and all years of the study. A second key finding relates to the relationship between information received about CWD which declined from 2008 to 2018 despite significant increases in the number of positive cases of CWD in Alberta. A third key finding is the importance of Indigenous Knowledge; over 97 % of respondents shared indicators of healthy moose and deer which they use to assess animals in hunting. This high degree of confidence in their own knowledge may suggest Indigenous knowledge is a mediator of risk perception (i.e., hunters are confident they can find and harvest a health animal despite the rising number of CWD cases). Although Indigenous right to lands and resources including wildlife harvesting have been little respected in the past, recognition of such rights, as well as Indigenous knowledge, is key to moving forward and developing more collaborative approaches to monitoring and managing the growing threat of CWD and other wildlife disease.

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems around the world, gobies comprise one of the most diverse groups of fishes in estuaries. The Yangtze River estuary, the biggest estuary in the western Pacific, is a major habitat for larval gobies, with the peak spawning and breeding season occurring during late spring and summer. To investigate the adaptation mechanism of larval gobies to environmental factors, three models (a global generalized linear model, a generalized additive model, and a geographically weighted Poisson regression) were used to simulate and forecast the major habitat distributions of larval gobies based on the survey data from 2018 to 2020. Six species of gobies were studied: Rhinogobius giurinu, Odontamblyopus rubicundus, Tridentiger barbatus, Parachaeturichthys polynema, Tridentiger trigonocephalus, and Trypauchen vagina. The habitats for brackish species T. barbatus were mainly in freshwater (where, using the practical salinity scale, salinity is 0-1) of the south branch, whereas the marine species P. polynema was mainly caught in oligohaline waters (where salinity is 1-5) of the north branch. The other euryhaline species were near the exit of the north branch or dispersed throughout the surveyed region. Year, season, salinity, and sample location had significant effects (P < 0.001) on determining the habitat distributions of larval gobies. The geographically weighted Poisson regression identified that the temperature, depth, distance from the coast, and chlorophyll a had a significant effect (P < 0.001) on the local distribution of habitats. This work supplements information about the distribution of major habitats and their interactions with the environment for the ecologically important species of goby in the Yangtze estuary during the larval stage, and the conclusions provide a basis for the management of aquatic ecosystems and biological habitats.

AB  - In recent years, the habitat distribution of wild boar has expanded in Japan, and the damage caused by wild boar has been significantly increased. In Bingo Sports Park, a regional park, wild boar damage has also been increasingly severe. To take effective measures, it is necessary to understand where wild boars enter the park, how they move through it, and where the damage is caused. Therefore, this study examines both environmental characteristics inside and outside the park and behavioral characteristics of wild boar using drones, sensor technology and GIS, and then clarifies the main factors contributing to wild boar damage based the logistic regression analysis. In addition, countermeasures such as installing electric fences and repellents were taken, and their effectiveness was verified. There were three main findings. First, the behavioral pattern of wild boars was found to be likely to enter from valleys and usually move on roads in the park. Second, the probability of occurring wild boar damage is higher in areas closer to roads and valleys with more natural cover. Third, the countermeasures have a significant effect on reducing wild boar damage since the amount of damage in the Multi-purposed square installed countermeasure was too small.

AB  - Soil depth, slope position, and different plantations can influence bacterial community composition in Camellia oleifera forests. However, prior studies have focused on the impacts of different depths, slope positions, and forest types on bacterial diversity independently, without comparing their combined impacts. This study aimed to assess variation in soil bacterial community structures according to soil depth and slope position and different forest types in the same plot. The composition of soil bacterial communities was evaluated using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results indicate that the soil organic carbon, humus, and total organic content increased, and the bacterial composition and structure were significantly altered in response to the G. jasminoides + C. oleifera low-yielding forest in comparison to the other three forest types. The highest soil bacteria numbers, alpha and beta diversity, which improved the soil microecological environment, were associated with the G. jasminoides + C. oleifera forests and not the depth or slope position treatments. The slope position did not have a significant influence on the soil physicochemical and bacterial properties. Structural equation modeling suggested that G. jasminoides + C. oleifera significantly affected the soil bacterial community diversity by mediating the soil pH and NH4+-N. The effects of forest type on soil bacterial diversity were more important than soil depth and slope position. This specific intercropping system was found to be an effective strategy to improve soil health.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) shapes carbon cycling and climate. Grassland degradation has greatly reduced the SOC of these biomes. However, vegetation restoration is effective at improving the SOC of degraded grasslands, the sustainability of the outcomes of which is unclear. Therefore, we studied the effects of vegetation restoration on SOC and its stability in perspective of three restoration practices (i.e. Hippophae rhamnoides Linn., Elymus nutans Griseb., Avena nuda, and their combinations) in Zoige, a climatically sensitive area located at the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Topsoil samples (0-10 cm) were collected within each restoration practice to analyze SOC and its fraction contents, soil aggregates, and aggregate-associated SOC content. Results showed that SOC in the control (CK) was 2.77 g kg(-1), and vegetation restoration increased the SOC contents by 10.12, 73.00, and 15.81%, respectively. Vegetation restoration significantly increased the easily oxidizable carbon (EOC) and decreased recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC), highlighting different responses of SOC fractions to vegetation restoration. Soil macroaggregate was 8.74% in CK, which was significantly lower than that after vegetation restoration (57.08-81.01%). Vegetation restoration had no impact on non-aggregated silt + clay fraction-associated SOC and significantly increased macroaggregate-associated SOC content, which was the major contributor of total SOC. These findings suggest that vegetation restoration may affect SOC stability by increasing SOC and EOC, decreasing ROC, and changing the compositions of aggregates and aggregate-associated SOC. However, our study was conducted 3 years after vegetation restoration, which maybe too short of a period to accurately determine SOC stability.

AB  - Toxic baiting of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is a potential new tool for population control and damage reduction in the United States. Use of toxic bait sites by non-target species is concerning because of the risks posed from exposure to a toxic bait. A 2018 field trial in northern Texas, USA, examining the efficacy of a prototype toxic bait (HOGGONE (R), containing 10% sodium nitrite) revealed unexpected hazards to non-target species, primarily passerine birds, from consuming toxic bait spilled outside of bait stations by wild pigs. The hazards jeopardize the ability to register HOGGONE as a tool for controlling wild pigs. We conducted a post hoc analysis from that 2018 trial to identify how daily and landscape factors influenced the use of bait sites by non-target species, and subsequent hazards from consuming the toxic bait. We discovered that no single strategy can eliminate visitations by all non-target species, but offering the toxic bait at night, in wild-pig specific bait stations, and in more homogeneous landscapes appeared to be the best strategy for minimizing visits by passerine birds. We also found that use of bait sites by wild pigs were temporally clustered, and more pigs visited bait sites along linear features of the landscape (e.g., agricultural edges or riparian corridors). We recommend a baiting strategy where applicators do not place bait stations directly at sites where remnant particles of grain (from prebaiting) are available on the ground. Published 2021.

AB  - Context Predation-risk and ecological disturbance regimes can both influence behavioral decisions by prey, yet few studies have simultaneously considered responses to these ecological pressures. Elucidating relationships between predation risk and the costs and benefits associated with multiple natural disturbances can contribute to a better understanding of how prey adapt to varied predator and disturbance regimes.
   Objectives We quantified spatial variation in predation risk and resource selection strategies of female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with different fate outcomes during the fawning season across a landscape with poor-quality, heterogeneous food resources.
   Methods We quantified resource selection relative to ecological disturbance regimes and vulnerability to Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) predation and linked these behavioral patterns to mortality outcomes.
   Results We found that female deer that were killed by panthers selected flooded areas that contained higher quality forage, but these areas also conferred higher relative predation risk. Females that survived the fawning season selected frequently and recently burned areas that had both high-quality forage and lower panther predation risk.
   Conclusions The interplay between predation risk and ecological disturbance regimes appeared to drive behavioral strategies by deer. Females exhibited different strategies relative to the forage-predation risk trade-off, which led to different fitness outcomes. These behavioral strategies may affect maternal care, adding additional complexity to tradeoffs involving adult survival and recruitment.

AB  - Efficient fertiliser nitrogen (N) management is critical to global food production and ecosystem health. Considering sheep grazing systems as whole ecosystems, and quantifying key ecosystem services provided by the soil microbial community, including plant N supply and N pollution mitigation, is essential in assessments of N use efficiency (NUE). Using a systems approach, we disassembled a low-intensity sheep (>5 ewe ha-1) grazed grassland, dominated by Lolium perenne, into a series of interlinked 15N-tracer experiments in North Wales during a summer growing season to assess fertiliser-N partitioning. 15N was traced into soil microbial protein-N via compound-specific amino acid 15N-stable isotope probing, with subsequent integration to provide a wholesystem perspective. Retention of feed-N into sheep was low (11 %), despite high grass 15N-fertiliser uptake (58 %). The majority of grazed-N re-entered the soil N-cycle as excreta (47 % of total 15N) during the peak growing season. Quantifying 15N-assimilation into soil microbial protein (0-15 cm) demonstrated the central role soil microbes occupy in capturing excess fertiliser (16 %) and urinary-N (8 %) of the total 15N-fertiliser applied, thereby reducing N losses and subsequently supporting plant N supply. This approach emphasises how future management of moderate intensity grazing systems should target sheep NUE, alongside the role of the soil microbial community to retain, and later recycle N, for plant supply, optimising essential ecosystem service provisioning.

AB  - Extensive breeding of farmed cervids, similarly to other livestock, affects the vegetation of grasslands in different seasons. For this reason, the impact of the rotational grazing of fallow deer on the chemical and species composition of the pasture sward was assessed, along with the possibility of using these animals for grasslands conservation. The species composition of the pastures was analysed through the botanical-weight method. A quality index and mineral concentration test by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to evaluate the feed. The highest proportion of valuable grasses, such as Dactylis glomerata, Poa pratensis and Lolium perenne, was recorded in the summer pens (65.7-66.1%), while the smallest proportion was recorded in the control area (46.1%). The estimated yield potential was relatively large, from 5.74 to 7.02 t ha(-1) dry matter. The lowest total protein content occurred in the control area in the spring and autumn. The summer pens, including the sown one, had a better fodder quality, depending on the species composition. All pens were characterised by a high production potential and similar floristic composition, without the participation of undesirable plant species, which confirms the hypothesis that, under extensive grazing conditions, fallow deer can be used for grassland conservation.

AB  - There is a little understanding of how apex carnivores partition their diet to coexist. We studied food habit and trophic niche overlap of two apex carnivores, tiger and leopard in the tropical forest of Similipal tiger reserve, eastern India. We used line transect and scat analysis method, to estimate the prey availability and determine the diet and prey selection of two apex carnivores. Tigers consumed mostly large and medium-sized prey, whereas leopards mostly consumed medium and small-sized prey. Both carnivores were not random in their consumption of prey, sambar and wild pigs were selectively consumed by tigers, whereas leopards selectively consumed wild pigs, barking deer and mouse deer. Dietary overlap between two carnivore species was moderate (Pianka's niche overlap index: 0.55), and trophic niche breadth (Levin's standardized niche breadth) of the leopard (0.52) was greater than that of the tiger (0.37). Overall, tigers exhibited specialized feeding habits, whereas leopards showed generalist feeding habits. Our study highlights the opportunistic nature of leopards and probably a reason for the species successfully coexist with tigers.

AB  - Losses in freshwater fish diversity might produce a loss in important ecological services provided by fishes in particular habitats. An important gap in our understanding of ecosystem services by fishes is the influence of individuals from different size classes, which is predicted based on known ontogenetic shifts in metabolic demand and diet. I used 20 experimental stream mesocosms located at Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS), KS, USA, to assess the influence of fish size on ecosystem properties. Mesocosms included two macrohabitats: one riffle upstream from one pool filled with consistent pebble and gravel substrate. There were four experimental and one control treatment, each replicated four times (N = 20). I used two size classes of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) and southern redbelly dace (Chrosomus erythrogaster). Five ecosystem properties were assessed: algal filament length (cm), benthic chlorophyll a (mu g/cm(2)), benthic organic matter (g/m(2)), macroinvertebrate biomass (g/m(2)), and stream metabolism (g O-2/m(2)/day(-1)). Size structure of fish populations affected some, but not all, ecosystem properties, and these effects were dependent upon species identity. Size structure of both species had effects on algal filament lengths where stonerollers of both size classes reduced algal filaments, but only small redbelly dace kept filaments short. A better understanding of the relationship between these prairie stream minnows and their small stream habitats could be useful to both predict changes in stream properties if species are lost (redbelly dace are a Species In Need of Conservation) or size structure shifts.

AB  - High latitude wetlands are ecologically important ecosystems due to their large carbon (C) storage capacity and because they serve as breeding and nesting habitat for large populations of migratory birds. Goose herbivory in wetland meadows affects leaf chemical and morphological traits and also influences soil properties by increasing soil temperature and depositing faeces. Grazing-induced changes to above-ground traits and soil properties impact C cycling, but the influence of grazing on root-mediated C and nitrogen (N) cycling has not been explored. We investigated how goose herbivory in a low-Arctic coastal wetland in western Alaska affected root morphological, physiological and chemical traits of a dominant graminoid by assessing plant traits in ungrazed versus heavily grazed sedge meadows. We also performed a 11-week lab-based root incubation experiment to determine how grazing affects CO2-C efflux, the size and decay rate of the fast-cycling C pool (i.e. C with a mean residence time of days to weeks, determined via CO2-C efflux), and patterns of N mineralization during root decomposition. Goose grazing altered root chemical traits by increasing root N by 7%, cellulose by 12%, and ash content by 17%, indicating that grazing shifted root chemical traits towards a resource-acquisition strategy. Grazing did not alter root biomass, morphology or bulk C exudation. In our root incubation, soils that included the roots of grazed plants tended to exhibit greater CO2-C efflux than those containing ungrazed plant roots due to a larger fast-cycling C pool. Additionally, grazing-induced increases in soil temperature led to greater CO2-C efflux due to a faster decay rate of the fast-cycling C pool. Finally, compared with ungrazed roots, we found that the decomposition of grazed roots resulted in more N being transferred to root necromass from the surrounding soil, suggesting that microbial communities decomposing grazed roots immobilized N. Synthesis. Overall, our results indicate that goose grazing increased C-cycling rates by influencing soil environmental conditions and by altering the ecological strategy of grazed plants. In contrast, grazing decreased net N mineralization by promoting N immobilization. These results suggest that changing patterns and abundances of herbivores can have substantial effects on elemental cycles.

AB  - Private landowners are key partners in chronic wasting disease (CWD) management, especially in landscapes where there is limited public ownership. In this study, we evaluated landowners' preferences for alternative hypothetical CWD management programs using a stated choice experiment. We were particularly interested in understanding preferences for the use of financial incentives to motivate white-tailed deer harvest and facilitate hunter access to private lands as potential CWD management tools. We used latent class analysis to characterize preference heterogeneity among landowners stemming from patterns of choice. We compared means and distributions of auxiliary variables related to landowners' perceived risks, trust, attitudes toward management, and sociodemographics across latent classes stemming from choice model results. The pooled model demonstrated that reducing deer population density, providing payments to landowners for CWD-positive deer taken from their property, the form of incentives for public access, and banning recreational deer feeding had a small positive effect on respondents' choice of CWD management program. However, providing financial payments to hunters for harvesting CWD-positive deer and the use of targeted culling had the opposite effect on choice. Latent class models revealed that a majority of respondents exhibited a pattern of preference where all forms of incentives exerted a negative effect on choice, but smaller subsets of landowners positively evaluate the use of some incentives. Post-hoc contrasts revealed relationships between patterns of preferences and trust, risk, and attitudes toward CWD management with small to medium effects. Results demonstrated limited support for the use of financial incentives as a tool to manage access and harvest in the southeast Minnesota CWD management zone.

AB  - This study investigated whether lead (Pb), at concentrations allowed for soil, affects the community of insects that live in the aerial part of plants. We evaluated the effect of Pb concentrations on accumulated species richness, composition, and abundance of different functional groups of insects. Kale plants were grown in soil experimentally contaminated with four concentrations of lead nitrate: 0 (control), 144 (T1), 360 (T2), and 600 (T3) mg/kg of soil. The experiment was conducted in an open greenhouse for the natural colonization of insects. Insects were collected twice using trap bags attached to the plant leaf and by direct removal. The concentration of Pb in the stem and leaf samples increased with the increased soil contamination, even showing values above the limit allowed by the legislation for this plant species. Control plants showed a higher richness of accumulated insect species. In addition, the treatments had an effect on the community composition, in which Diaeretiella rapae (primary parasitoid) was found as an indicator of the control + T1 treatments and the top species Pachyneuron sp. (parasitoid of predators) was associated with the control. The abundance of chewing and sucking herbivores, their respective parasitoids, predators, and parasitoids of predators were negatively affected. Hyperparasitoid abundance was not affected, but their accumulated species richness was. This study was innovative in demonstrating that soil contamination by different concentrations of a heavy metal (Pb) can negatively affect the community of plant-associated insects, even at concentrations allowed for soil, reflecting possible damage to the ecosystem.

AB  - Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti) have historically populated the Pacific Northwest from the Olympic Peninsula to the south of San Francisco Bay, and several management actions have supported restoring elk into parts of this historic range. In 1982, 17 Roosevelt elk were translocated from Gold Bluffs Beach State Park to Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. In 2020, the Sinkyone elk herd was observed to have lower body condition scores and poor coat conditions in comparison to the Gold Bluffs Beach elk herd. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the difference in health between the two herds. Fecal samples were collected (n = 20) from each herd to measure species richness and abundance of parasites. We determined there was a significant difference in species richness and abundance of parasite eggs between the two herds. The Sinkyone herd's overall higher endoparasite load may be attributed to a low immune response due to low nutrition but, causation is unknown.

AB  - There has been a recent rise in the number of medicinal plant users in Southern Africa, with approximately a million users reported to utilize these plants for various health conditions. Unfortunately, some of these plants are reportedly endangered and facing extinction due to harvesting pressure. In addition, climate change is likely to negatively affect the geographical distribution of these medicinal plants. In the current study, future greenhouse gas emission scenarios of the representative concentration pathways, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, for future projections to 2050 and 2080 were used to simulate the effect of climate change on three medicinal plants' (Aloe ferox, Bowiea volubilis, and Dioscorea elephantipes) distribution in South Africa. We studied these plant species as the International Union for Conservation of Nature stated that A. ferox is currently of least concern in South Africa, while B. volubilis and D. elephantipes are categorised as declining and vulnerable, respectively. Specifically, we utilised a species distribution model (i.e., the maximum entropy: MaxEnt) to investigate the effect of climate change on the future spatial distribution of medicinal plants in South Africa. In 2050 and 2080, under both RCP scenarios, the suitable habitat of the studied plant species will reduce in the country's northern parts. Specifically, the habitat for D. elephantipes will totally disappear in the country's northern parts. However, there will be slight additions of suitable habitats for the species in the country's southern parts. Model validation indicated that the area under curve (AUC) for A. ferox was 0.924 +/- 0.004, while for B. volubilis and D. elephantipes it was 0.884 +/- 0.050 and 0.944 +/- 0.030, respectively. Using the results from this study, there is a need for the long-term in situ and ex situ conservation of these medicinal plants. The results of the present study could guide the development of effective and efficient policies and strategies for managing and conserving medicinal plants in South Africa.

AB  - Managing crop damage by wildlife is a complex challenge in agrarian-wildlife landscapes. Losses to farmers and their negative attitude towards crop-raiding wildlife, compromise wildlife conservation and farmer-wildlife coexistence. Priority crop types, crop-raiding wildlife and socio-ecological factors are highly integrated. Here we use cross-sectional network analysis as a conservation planning tool to simultaneously identify the crop types used by crop-raiding wildlife, and evaluate the importance of these crop-wildlife interactions relative to the socio-ecological factors that affect these interactions. The most vulnerable crops were maize, millet and fruit trees, while the most problematic crop-raiding wildlife were African elephant, bushpig, hippo, warthog and red-billed quelea. Crop damage declined with countermeasure effectiveness, farm size, and distance from river to farm, but increased with richness of attractive crops. Undamaged crops included cash crops, such as chili, onion, ginger, lemon grass and garlic. Applying network analysis to different crops and damage scenarios enables identification of the most important and influential crops, crop-raiding wildlife and socio-ecological factors needed to develop effective crop protection strategies.

AB  - Drone platforms are increasingly used for aerial wildlife surveys, but the validity of population counts has not been fully evaluated in all environments. Aerial surveys generally undercount the true population size and one must estimate detection probability (p) to correct for missed individuals. Detection probability for visual observers is influenced by vegetation and terrain characteristics, but the use of thermal cameras as the observer may also introduce additional factors influencing detection probability. We conducted diurnal, thermal-based drone surveys for ungulates during February-April 2020 in South Texas, USA, on sites with varying degrees of woody cover and terrain. We examined histograms of georeferenced perpendicular distances to determine the effect of habitat on detection probabilities. We also examined precision in population estimates and variation in repeated surveys. Finally, we compared drone population estimates to independent estimates derived from helicopter, spotlight, and trail-camera surveys. Distributions of perpendicular distances from the transect were affected by habitat characteristics. A flat grassland site had relatively few detections near the transect because thermal (solar) reflectance in the center of the footage obscured detections. A hilly brushy site had a uniform p (1.00) but resulted in a severe undercount due to the inability of the drone to follow contours of hills. The flat brushy site had a lower p (0.63), indicating visibility bias. Two additional flat, brushy sites were surveyed repeatedly (n = 5 and 9 surveys, respectively). All combinations of up to 3 repeated surveys were pooled to meet the recommended minimum number of detections for distance sampling analyses (>= 60 detections). Population estimates had acceptable precision (CV <= 20%) 80.7% of the time and variation among repeated surveys was acceptable (CV = 9% and 23%, respectively). Drone-based population estimates were comparable with estimates generated from corrected helicopter, spotlight, and trail-camera surveys. Overall, diurnal drone surveys can generate population estimates for large ungulates on southwestern rangelands after accounting for visibility bias, but may be limited by terrain and thermal conditions.
   Drones equipped with thermal cameras are being used to survey wildlife, but reliability of population estimates are untested. Repeated drone surveys of white-tailed deer yielded repeatable and precise estimates that were comparable with other estimators. Future work is needed to evaluate the role of habitat characteristics influencing detectability of wildlife. image

AB  - Climate change poses a very serious threat to woody plants, and it is important to study its impact on the distribution dynamics of woody plants in China. However, there are no comprehensive quantitative studies on which factors influence the changes in the area of woody plant habitats in China under climate change. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the future suitable habitat area changes of 114 woody plant species in 85 studies based on MaxEnt model predictions to summarize the future climate change impacts on woody plant habitat area changes in China. It was found that climate change will result in a 3.66% increase in the overall woody plant suitable areas and a 31.33% decrease in the highly suitable areas in China. The mean temperature of the coldest quarter is the most important climatic factor, and greenhouse gas concentrations were inversely related to the area of future woody plant suitable areas. Meanwhile, shrubs are more climate-responsive than trees, drought-tolerant plants (e.g., Dalbergia, Cupressus, and Xanthoceras) and plants that can adapt quickly (e.g., Camellia, Cassia, and Fokienia) and their appearance will increase in the future. Old World temperate, Trop. Asia and Trop. Amer. disjuncted, and the Sino-Himalaya Floristic region are more vulnerable. Quantitative analysis of the possible risks to future climate change in areas suitable for woody plants in China is important for global woody plant diversity conservation.

AB  - Intensive livestock management impacts forest and trees in different ways. Pig manure is a major source of nitrogen (N) pollution of surface and ground waters in some European regions such as north-eastern Spain, but it is understudied how manure application impacts agroforestry systems. How pig manure affects tree radial growth and the N cycle was assessed by measuring N concentrations in soil, leaves and wood and delta N-15 in tree-ring wood in two tree species widely planted for agricultural (Prunus dulcis) and reforestation (Pinus halepensis) purposes in the study area. Soil physicochemical characteristics and the biomass and structure of major soil microbial groups were also measured. Trees irrigated with pig effluent (manure application) and control trees not subjected to manure application were compared. Soil N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations of fertilized trees increased, but soil microbiota biomass decreased. Similar growth between fertilized and non-fertilized pine trees was found, but lower growth in fertilized almond trees was observed. Leaf N concentrations decreased but delta N-15 wood increased in trees subjected to pig manure application. Pig manure application alters the N cycling in the soil and within trees.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly implemented to facilitate the conservation of marine biodiversity and key habitats. However, these areas are often less effective to conserve mobile marine species like elasmobranchs (i.e., sharks and rays). Industrial fishing near MPA borders possibly impacts vulnerable species utilizing these protected areas. Hence, we aimed to study spatiotemporal patterns of industrial fisheries near MPAs, in relation to the bycatch of elasmobranchs. Specifically, we analyzed the spatiotemporal fishing effort within the West African region, mapped fishing effort in the direct vicinity of the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (PNBA, Mauritania) and the Bijagos Archipelago (BA, Guinea Bissau), and compared the seasonal overlap between elasmobranch bycatch and fishing effort near these MPAs. We combined Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and local fisheries observer data, and determined fishing effort for each gear type and compared this with bycatch of elasmobranchs. We found that industrial fishing effort was dominated by trawling, drifting longlines, and fixed gear types. Although no industrial fishing was observed within both MPAs, 72 and 78% of the buffer zones surrounding the MPAs were fished for the Banc d'Arguin and Bijagos, respectively. Within the Banc d'Arguin buffer zone, trawling and drifting longlines dominated, with longlines mainly being deployed in fall. In the Bijagos buffer zone, trawling and fixed gears were most prevalent. Fisheries observer data for Mauritania showed that elasmobranch catches increased during the most recent sampling years (2016-2018). Elasmobranch catches within the waters of Guinea Bissau peaked in 2016 and decreased in the following two years. Seasonal patterns in elasmobranch bycatch within the waters of both countries are likely caused by increased catches of migratory species. Catches of rays peaked in May and June for Mauritania, and in October for Guinea Bissau. Shark catches were highest in February and July in Mauritanian waters, and in May and October in the waters of Guinea Bissau. Our study indicates that industrial fisheries near the border of ecologically important MPAs may have potentially major implications for ecosystem functioning by the removal of (migratory) predatory species.

AB  - The urine of yaks (Bos grunniens) and Tibetan sheep (Pantholops hodgsoni) represents a vital source of nutrients in the alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, and its crucial role in affecting soil properties and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cannot be underestimated. However, few in-situ experiments examining the impacts of yak and Tibetan sheep urine deposition on the alpine grassland nutrient dynamics and GHG fluxes, and the underlying mechanisms and influential factors associated with GHG emissions in urine deposited grasslands are still not well understood. This study conducted a 33-day simulated urine deposition experiment that include the treatments of yak urine (YU), Tibetan sheep urine (TSU), and a control (CK) without any application in an alpine steppe of northern Xizang Plateau. We collected soil samples at depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm after 11, 21, 33 days of experimental treatments to explore its physicochemical and microbial properties. The GHG samples were collected respectively at 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 18, 27, and 33 d of the experiment by using the method of artificial static closed chamber and determined the nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) concentration by using a gas chromatograph. The gene abundance of 0-10 cm soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), membrane-bound nitrate reductase (NarG), nitrite reductase encoding gene (NirS), nitric oxide reductase gene (NorB), and nitrous oxide reductase encoding gene (NosZ) were determined using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results showed that cumulative N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions for YU treatment across the 33-day experimental period amounted to 49.6 g N ha(- 1), 73.8 kg C ha(- 1), and - 176 g C ha(- 1), respectively, with the values significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the emissions for CK treatment (36.4 g N ha(- 1), 23.5 kg C ha(- 1), and - 232 g C ha(- 1)). The deposition of YU and TSU immediately increased soil nutrient availability, anaerobic conditions, and microbial activity, which led to increasing N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions to vary degrees, and reduced CH4 uptake. Soil CO2 flux for YU treatment exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation with NO3--N concentration, while soil CH4 flux exhibited extremely significant (P < 0.01) negative correlation with SOC concentration. Soil N2O flux for TSU treatment was negatively correlated with soil NifH, AOB, AOA, and NirS gene abundances (P < 0.05). In contrast, the cumulative N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions during the initial 13 days for YU and TSU treatments accounted for a significantly (P < 0.05) higher proportion (49.9% and 46.6%, 66.1% and 64.9%, 40.2% and 49.0%, respectively) of the total emissions compared to the CK treatment (43.8%, 40.7%, and 31.0%). Urine application resulted in 0-10 cm soil AOA, AOB, NirS, NarG, and NosZ gene abundances for YU treatment were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that for CK treatment. The significant enhancement of 0-10 cm soil functional gene abundance (NirS, NorB, and NosZ), as well as increased levels of NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations for YU and TSU treatments during the early stage of the experiment (P < 0.
   05), proving the strengthen of denitrification activity and soil respiration and therefore resulted in a higher proportion of N2O and CO2 emissions. The conclusions would contribute to a better understanding of the short-term effects and functional mechanisms of urine deposition on alpine steppe GHG emissions, and provide scientific insights for optimising livestock urine management model and facilitating the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies in pastoral areas.

AB  - The energy used by animals is influenced by intrinsic (e.g. physiological) and extrinsic (e.g. environmental) factors. Accelerometers within biologging devices have proven useful for assessing energy expenditures and their behavioural context in free-ranging animals. However, certain assumptions are frequently made when acceleration is used as a proxy for energy expenditure, with factors, such as environmental variation (e.g. ambient temperature or slope of terrain), seldom accounted for. To determine the possible interactions between behaviour, energy expenditure and the environment (ambient temperature and terrain slope), the rate of oxygen consumption ((V)over dotO(2)) was measured in pygmy goats (Capra hircus aegarus) using open-flow indirect calorimetry. The effect of temperature (9.7-31.5 degrees C) on resting energy expenditure was measured. The relationship between (V)over dotO(2) and dynamic body acceleration (DBA) was measured at different walking speeds (0.8-3.0 km h(-1)) and on different inclines (0,+ 15 degrees, - 15 degrees). The daily behaviour of individuals was measured in two enclosures: enclosure A (level terrain during summer) and enclosure B (sloped terrain during winter) and per diem energy expenditures of behaviours estimated using behaviour, DBA, temperature, terrain slope and (V)over dotO(2). During rest, energy expenditure increased below 22 degrees C and above 30.5 degrees C. (V)over dotO(2) (ml min(-1)) increased with DBA when walking on the level. Walking uphill (+ 15 degrees) increased energetic costs three-fold, whereas walking downhill (- 15 degrees) increased energetic costs by one third. Based on these results, although activity levels were higher in animals in enclosure A during summer, energy expenditure was found to be significantly higher in the sloped enclosure B in winter (means of enclosures A and B: 485.3 +/- 103.6 kJ day(-1) and 744.5 +/- 132.4 kJ day(-1)).We show that it is essential to account for extrinsic factors when calculating animal energy budgets. Our estimates of the impacts of extrinsic factors should be applicable to other free ranging ungulates.

AB  - This study highlights the importance of coupling the typology of planktonic food webs and their emerging properties to better describe the ecological status of an ecosystem under permanent disturbance mainly caused by phosphate industry. Linear inverse models were built to describe four stations under various levels of nutrient pressure, using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate known and unknown carbon flows, later used to calculate food web typology ratios. Ecological network analysis (ENA) was used to describe the structural and functional properties of each food web. Based on the food web typology ratios, three planktonic trophic pathways (PTP) with different functional indices were distinguished according to nutrient stress. The microbial food web dominated in the least nutrient-rich environment. It mainly relied on phytoplankton production (picophyto-plankton <2 mu m) that was mainly transferred by the high microbivory of protozooplankton. In contrast, the herbivorous food web developed in the most nutrient-rich environment, where biogenic carbon was mainly produced by large phytoplankton (microphytoplankton >10 mu m) and channeled to higher trophic levels by herbivorous protozooplankton and metazooplankton. In the other two stations - moderately nutrient-rich sys-tems - the PTP acted as a multivorous food web. Phytoplankton (small and large size fractions) and non-living components (detritus and dissolved organic carbon) played a significant role in carbon production, and competed with protozooplankton and metazooplankton for its transport. ENA indices revealed that the herbivorous food web, with the highest total system throughput and lowest relative Ascendency and cycling, was the most active but the least organized and stable system. In contrast, the microbial food web, with the lowest total system flux and highest Ascendency, was least active but more organized than the herbivorous food web. The multivorous food web displayed the most recycling and most organized system, with high values of the detritivory-to-herbivory ratio, cycling and Ascendency. In addition to ENA indices, which are considered effective tools for studying the structural and functional properties of food webs, marine ecosystem management efforts heavily focus on using the "marine food web" as a descriptor of the system's ecological status. However, we suggest that the combination of food web typology and ecological indices could be used as an effective tool for the man-agement and assessment of ecosystem health wherever possible, as well as for the study of anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - The Northern Highlands of northwest Namibia are a particularly remote and arid landscape, where wildlife, habitats and local communities are increasingly at risk from future climate change events. There has previously been minimal research on the population of African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in these Highlands. The Highlands are located just to the west of Etosha National Park. One potential factor influencing the movement of elephants from the Park into the Highlands is their food preferences. The aim of this study was to determine the preferred forage species for elephants in the Highlands. The study benefited from local ecological knowledge of community game guards, and extensive field patrols to assess the most preferred trees of elephants. Our findings indicate clear selection preference for African star chestnut (Sterculia africana), and Commiphora species such as blue-leaved corkwood (Commiphora glaucescens). These species grow on steep mountain slopes and elephants are climbing slopes to browse those trees. Our results indicate that some tree species are much less preferred, most of which tend to be located in valleys or lower slopes. This suggests that a major factor in the increase in elephant population in the Northern Highlands is the preferred vegetation available on the mountain slopes compared to the vegetation on the flat landscape of Etosha.

AB  - The most species-rich grasslands worldwide are known from the Carpathian Mts and their periphery in East-Central Europe. They occur in forest-steppe regions, transitional between temperate forest and arid steppe biomes. Their climate, largely suitable for forests, raises questions about the origin of these grasslands. Have they been forested in the past, or locally maintained through a disturbance regime? We addressed these questions to contribute to the broader understanding of Holocene dynamics of open habitats in temperate Europe. We employed soil charcoal analysis and soil morphology to reconstruct past representation of woody species with fine spatial resolution. Our study area was Romanian Transylvania, a region renowned for a well-developed forest-steppe. Six soil profiles along a climatic gradient were assessed: four in forest-steppe grasslands, two in grasslands in adjacent forest region (forest grasslands). The results revealed profound differences between forest-steppe and forest grasslands. Forest-steppe profiles showed Phaeozems with low specific anthracomass of woody species and continuous dominance by Juniperus, suggesting a long-term presence of grasslands. Forest grasslands showed Luvisols with higher anthracomass and abundant charcoal of broad-leaved trees, indicating establishment after deforestation. The high radiocarbon ages of charcoals in basal soil horizons point to a glacial origin of soils and the link of forest-steppe grasslands to glacial forests. Siberian hemiboreal forests and related grasslands may be modern analogues of the reconstructed ecosystems, sharing many species with present day forest-steppe. We suggest that disturbances such as fire, herbivore grazing, and human activities have played an important role in shaping the forest-steppe over time, contributing to the formation of today's richest grasslands.

AB  - Phenological shifts, induced by global warming, can lead to mismatch between closely interacting species. The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, an important outbreaking insect defoliator in North America, mainly feeds on balsam fir, Abies balsamea, which has historically been well synchronized with the insect. But as climate change pushes the northern range limit of the budworm further north into the boreal forest, the highly valuable black spruce, Picea mariana, historically protected against the budworm by its late budburst phenology, is suffering increased defoliation during the current outbreak. We tested the hypothesis that rising temperatures can lead, not to a mismatch, but to an improved match between the budworm and black spruce through differential phenological advancement. For 3 years, eastern spruce budworm larvae were reared from instar 2 to pupae, on both black spruce and balsam fir, in a temperature free-air controlled enhancement experiment (T-FACE) consisting in 24 field plots, half of which were heated at +2 degrees C from March to October. Our results show that every year, larval development was faster on heated trees and pupation was earlier than on unheated trees. Bud development was also accelerated in heated trees of both species. However, there was no difference in mass between pupae that developed at +2 degrees C and controls at the end of the season. Finally, we found no difference either in development rate or pupal mass between larvae reared on black spruce and those reared on balsam fir. This suggests that under higher temperature regimes, eastern spruce budworm will be as successful on black spruce as on balsam fir, as black spruce budburst becomes better synchronized with the insect's emergence from diapause. This could lead to critical changes in outbreak dynamics and severity with important ecological state shifts at the landscape level.

The contents of the forestomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum), abomasum, and small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were taken in this investigation from six Tarim wapiti. The objective was to assess the content of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and microbiological diversity through 16S rDNA. The results showed that acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate concentrations were much higher in the forestomach compared to the small intestine. The communities of bacteria were abundant and diversified in the forestomach and abomasum compared to the small intestine. Bacteroidetes were significantly more abundant in the forestomach and abomasum than in the small intestine, but Firmicutes were the reverse. The predominant bacterial genera identified in the forestomach and abomasum were Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Prevotella and F082; Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Acetitomaculum, Paeniclostridium, and Romboutsia were the main bacterial genera in the small intestine. The relative abundance of genes for microbial energy metabolism functions was substantially reduced across the rumen to the reticulum, across the abomasum to the duodenum for carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism functions, and across the jejunum to the ileum for lipid metabolism and energy metabolism functions. In addition, VFAs were found to be positively correlated with dominant bacteria in forestomach and abomasum, and negatively correlated with dominant bacteria in small intestine. According to the study, Tarim wapiti have developed a unique and distinct dominant bacterial community in its forestomach, abomasum, and intestines.
   This is the first report that provides a detailed analysis of the microbial communities present in different segments of the forestomach, abomasum, and small intestine of the Tarim wapiti.The study established baseline data on the Tarim wapiti, which is the only red deer species that can survive in desert environments.

AB  - Assessing the spatiotemporal behaviour of alien species is pivotal to designing effective management plans. Interspecific niche partitioning among ungulates is reported as a strategy to avoid direct interactions. The Mediterranean mouflon and wild boar are two ungulates introduced to Elba island for hunting and aesthetic purposes. We used intensive camera trapping to test whether species occupancy and temporal activity rhythms would vary in response to the presence or absence of the co-occurring species through multi-species occupancy modelling. Our findings report a lack of spatial and temporal segregation between the two species for the late spring-summer and late summer-autumn seasons. In contrast, results for the winter-early spring period suggest that spatial partitioning between wild boar and mouflon is present in areas with high artificial cover (e.g., paved roads). Animals may indeed exploit roads to move more rapidly in search of food; however, their occurrence in these areas seems to be influenced by the presence of the other species.

AB  - This article examines livelihood practices among Indigenous Aymara pastoral communities in Sajama National Park (SNP) on the Bolivian Altiplano. Pastoralist livelihoods within SNP are based on the management of Andean camelids-llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Vicugna pacos)-and the high-elevation peatlands, known locally as bofedales, that provide essential pasture. Aymara pastoralists employ a variety of practices to manage bofedales, including the use of fences to control herd movements and demarcate grazing parcels, known as saya & ntilde;as. Temporary labor migration, within Bolivia or internationally, represents another important livelihood strategy. Fencing facilitates temporary migration by allowing pastoralists to leave their herds unattended and seek wage work. Community-based institutions that govern land tenure and communal obligations incentivize pastoralists to return to their communities. Migration and fences positively impact pastoralists' quality of life, but carry potentially negative consequences for bofedal quality in the form of overgrazing and bofedal degradation. Community-based institutions, fences, and temporary migration together contribute to adaptive livelihoods among pastoralists in SNP.

AB  - Climate change is a significant threat to people living in mountainous regions. It is essential to understand how montane communities currently depend especially on the provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and the ways in which climate change will impact these services, so that people can develop relevant adaptation strategies. The ES in the Gurez Valley, in the Western Himalayas of Pakistan, provide a unique opportunity to explore these questions. This understudied area is increasingly exposed not only to climate change but also to the over exploitation of resources. Hence, this study aimed to (a) identify and value provisioning ES in the region; (b) delineate indigenous communities' reliance on ES based on valuation; and (c) measure the perceptions of indigenous communities of the impact of climate change on the ES in Gurez Valley. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were used to classify the provisioning ES by using the 'Common International Classification on Ecosystem Services' (CICES) table and applying the 'Total Economic Valuation (TEV)' Framework. Results indicate that the indigenous communities are highly dependent on ES, worth 6730 & PLUSMN; 520 USD/ Household (HH)/yr, and perceive climate change as a looming threat to water, crops, and rearing livestock ESS in the Gurez Valley. The total economic value of the provisioning ES is 3.1 times higher than a household's average income. Medicinal plant collection is a significant source of revenue in the Valley for some households, i.e., worth 766 +/- 134.8 USD/HH/yr. The benefits of the sustainable use of ES and of climate change adaptation and mitigation, are culturally, economically, and ecologically substantial for the Western Himalayans.

AB  - Assisted migration is a tree-planting method where tree species or populations are translocated with the aim of establishing more climate-resilient forests. However, this might potentially increase the susceptibility of translocated trees to herbivory. Stand diversification through planting trees in species or genotypic mixtures may reduce the amount of damage by insect pests, but its effectiveness in mitigation of excess herbivory on climate-matched trees has seldom been explored. Using the Climate Match Experiment which manipulates both tree climatic provenance and stand diversity, we compared growth, insect herbivory and leaf traits of pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur) of local and Italian provenances in monocultures, provenance mixtures or species mixtures. Additionally, we investigated whether tree apparency and light availability cause variation in leaf traits and herbivory and tested whether these factors were influenced by stand diversity. We found that Italian oaks were subject to greater herbivore damage than those of local English provenance regardless of stand diversity and that insect herbivory in Italian oaks was higher on more apparent trees. Italian oaks also had lower concentrations of hydrolysable tannins than English oaks, but tannin concentrations were poor predictors of herbivory. Additionally, we show that leaf trait variation is strongly associated with differences in light availability.

AB  - Hunting has important social, cultural, economic, and conservation benefits. Information on hunters' motivations and expectations for a hunting experience can help support decision-making by state and federal wildlife managers. We surveyed deer (Odocoileus spp.) and elk (Cervus canadensis) hunters participating in controlled hunts in eastern Oregon to describe hunter characteristics and experiences, including the importance of hunting motivational factors and specific setting attributes (2017-2019; n = 501). We compared differences between hunters' ratings of importance and satisfaction and identified factors of particular importance for hunters with different characteristics. Survey response rates were high, ranging from 97% in 2017 to 81% in 2019. We found that the intangible benefits of hunting were most important to hunters, with enjoyment and spending time with friends and family emerging as the top-ranked hunting motivations by importance. Motivations differed by gender, age and hunting avidity. Women rated getting meat for themselves and family higher than did men ((x) over bar = 4.67 vs. 4.26). Frequent hunters ranked many experiential elements of a hunt higher in importance than less frequent hunters (e.g., Seeing animals in the wild, (x) over bar = 4.52 vs. 4.19; Fun and enjoyment, (x) over bar = 4.50 vs. 4.21; Thrill of the chase, (x) over bar = 4.34 vs. 3.97). Older hunters considered learning experiences less important than younger hunters (New experience, developing new skills, x (x) over bar = 2.72 vs. 3.52; Gaining knowledge about the outdoors, x (x) over bar = 3.14 vs. 3.83). We also found that the attributes of the specific hunt setting were less important than the broad factors that motivate hunting participation. Our results provide context for hunting retention and reactivation efforts and can be used to identify opportunities to recruit new hunters whose diversity reflects that of background populations in the U.S.

AB  - Hunting has an ambivalent relationship with conservation: it can deplete and threaten vulnerable wildlife but can also motivate protection and good stewardship. Here we advance the understanding of this relationship by examining the different forms of hunting in one community with a particular focus on the motivations and implications surrounding the use of dogs. We present a case study from Indonesian New Guinea. We use self-reported information concerning the hunting activities and success of thirty-three hunters who frequent the lowland costal forest of Tambrauw in West Papua Province. The hunters identified 301 successful kills in a total of 654 hours of hunting over a 7-month period. Five different prey species were reported. In declining order of kills there were the Timor deer (Cervus timorensis), Wild pig (Sus scrofa), Common spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus maculatus), Dusky pademelon (Thylogale brunii) and Grizzled tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus inustus). While hunting with guns was the least frequently used method it was the most effective while passive methods (traps and snares) was the least efficient in terms of time (49 hours with 50 kills), but also the most commonly employed (352 hours with 123 kills) Interestingly, active hunting without dogs or guns yielded more kills per hour than hunting with them (0.70 versus 0.38 kills per hour), especially for deer, but hunting with dogs is the only method that seems to favour pigs over deer. Hunting in the daytime was more effective for pigs and less effective for all other species regardless of method. Dogs are also valued for guarding hunters and their families (from animals, enemies and spirits). We find that dogs sometimes provoke conflicts and cause other problems. Hunting method impacts the quantity and composition of the hunt, but as we see for dog ownership and use also relates to other practices. More attention should be given to local hunting and the methods used.

AB  - Physiographic and hydrologic complexities play major role in determining the habitat suitability for river dolphins. However, dams and other water development structures alter hydrologic regimes that degrade habitat conditions. For the three extant species of obligate freshwater dolphins, namely: Amazon dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), Ganges dolphin (Platanista gangetica), and Indus dolphin (Platanista minor), the threat is high as dams and water-based infrastructure dotted throughout their distribution range impact dolphin populations by restricting their movement. But there is also evidence of localized increase in dolphin population in certain segments of habitats affected by such hydrologic alterations. Hence, the impacts of hydrologic alterations on dolphin distribution are not as binary as it seems. We aimed to ascertain the role of hydrologic and physiographic complexities in determining the distribution of the dolphins in their geographic ranges using density plot analysis and also to understand how hydrologic alterations in the rivers affect their distribution using a combination of density plot analysis and review of literature. The influence of some of the study variables such as distance to confluence and sinuosity was similar across species-for instance, all three dolphin species preferred slightly sinuous river segments and habitats near confluences. However, varying influences across species were observed for some other variables such as river order and river discharge. We assessed 147 cases of impacts of hydrological alterations on dolphin distribution by categorizing the reported impacts in nine broad types out of which habitat fragmentation accounted for the majority of the impacts (35%) followed by habitat reduction (24%). These endangered species of freshwater megafauna will experience further intensified pressures as more large-scale hydrologic modifications such as damming and diversion of rivers are underway. In this context, basin-scale water-based infrastructural development planning should take into consideration the salient ecological requirements of these species to ensure their long-term survival.

AB  - Regeneration of mixed mountain forests after disturbances frequently fails due to causes like seed limitation, unfavorable microclimate, competition and ungulate browsing. Due to water and nutrient limitations, shallow soils on dolomite and limestone bedrock constitute a challenge for artificial regeneration. A thorough understanding of the interaction between substrate and tree ecophysiology and the suitability of various tree species for such unfavorable sites is of ultimate importance for post-disturbance regeneration management of protective forests, which have faced dramatically accelerated disturbance regimes during recent decades. Hence, this study compares the effect of soil substrate on the performance of young silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) by analyzing the interaction between tree ecophysiology and soil conditions at two windthrow sites on dolomite and limestone. On both sites, silver fir and Norway spruce suffered from foliar nutrient deficiencies. For both species, soil nutrient content as well as photosynthetic and growth rates were higher on limestone than on dolomite. Silver fir showed lower photosynthetic rates on both dolomite and limestone. While fir stayed smaller than spruce on limestone, it showed slightly better recent shoot growth on dolomite. Mycorrhization was higher on limestone. There was a tendency of higher fine root mass density and higher ectomycorrhizal root colonization of silver fir in the mineral soil developed from dolomite, compared to Norway spruce. These results reflect the central role of substrate and nutrition for tree growth and development and indicate better ecophysiological performance for both species on limestone than on dolomite. Our findings suggest better adaption of silver fir to unfavorable soil conditions due to different root characteristics.

AB  - Elephant Marsh is among the Ramsar sites in Africa that exist in complex conditions where its ecosystem services and functions (ESFs) have changed in time and space. The past 24 years have seen it being exposed to various threats instigated by land use/land cover changes (LULCC). Assessing its vulnerabilities under LULCC scenarios is essential in understanding the trajectory of its ESFs and for framing practical policy responses. This paper characterizes the Elephant Marsh ESF threats (drivers), pressures, state, impact, and the effectiveness of responses. The integration of the Fuzzy Delph method and analytical hierarchy process ranked the threats. The vulnerability assessment results revealed that demographic indicators (0.92) posed the most critical threats, followed by socio-economic (0.84) and ecological indicators (0.76). LULCC that occurred in eight-year intervals (1998, 2006, 2014, and 2022) driven by human and environmental dynamics reduced Elephant Marsh ESFs evidenced by a decline in the cumulative resilience coefficient (0.57 to 0.15), and increase in extreme weather events cumulative coefficient (0.3 to 0.8), indicating vulnerability state. The most impacted ESFs include regulatory, supporting, provisioning, and cultural ESFs. The study further showed that the effort to restore these most vulnerable ESFs under the current changing climatic scenarios mismatched the demand for ecosystem provisioning services, evidenced by the expansion of cultivated and irrigated land at the expense of areas covered by water, marshes, and forests. This study recommends integrating climate change mitigation efforts and community resilience planning in the development and implementation of wetland policy, management plans, and restoration strategies.

AB  - Background and Aims There is ongoing debate about whether offspring perform best next to phylogenetically distantly related adult neighbours (due to the scarcity of enemies and competitors) or next to closely related adults (due to the abundance of mutualists). Here we hypothesize that relatedness of adult neighbours affects which traits confer performance rather than performance itself. Methods We studied seed removal, seed germination and sapling growth in sessile oaks (Quercus petraea and hybrids) and how they depend on size, shape and other traits, under both closely and distantly related canopies, manipulating offspring density, presence of insects and fungi, and spatial proximity to oaks. Key Results We found that phylogenetic distance of adult neighbours affects only little the performance of offspring but strongly affects which traits confer performance on offspring, in particular the size and shape of seeds and saplings. Differences in trait-performance relationships mostly disappear once insects or conspecific competitors are excluded (albeit exclusion of fungi reinforced these differences). Effects of phylogenetic distance of neighbours were not replaceable by the percentage of gymnosperms among neighbours or by the environmental conditions considered. Conclusions We suggest that, by responding to a biotic micro-mosaic of selection pressures, sessile oak flexibly succeeds in diverse neighbourhoods. Sessile oak might maintain the potential for both convergence with and divergence from phylogenetically distantly related species, thereby reinforcing or eroding phylogenetic signal of niches.

AB  - Milk from cows and buffaloes represents the major source of dairy products worldwide. Cheese is consumed fresh, ripened, cooked, or as recipe ingredient in many different types. Using Paneer and Tosella/Schiz model cheeses as a case study of cooked cheeses, in this short communication we evaluated the cheese yield and quality of fresh cheese before and after cooking comparing the two major dairy species (cows and buffaloes). A total of 75 model cheeses (37 Paneer and 38 Tosella/Schiz) were made. Slices of all the cheeses were cooked on a griddle at 130 degrees C. Milk, whey, and cheese composition traits, cheese-making efficiency traits, and cooked cheese quality traits were evaluated using a mixed model that included the fixed effects of cheese type and animal species, and their interaction, and the random effects of session, animal within species, and the residual. Higher cheese yields are obtained from the buffalo milk not only because more concentrated in nutrients, but also for the greater recovery of nutrients in cheese. There was a greater recovery of protein with the acid/heat Paneer procedure than the rennet Tosella/Schiz procedure, but we found a species x cheese type interaction for fresh cheese yield. The interaction was related mainly to the higher water retained in the Tosella/Schiz curd rather than to total solids. This led also to greater cooking weight-loss compared with Paneer. The qualitative traits of cheese were highly affected by griddling. Future research on the sensorial perception of cooked cheeses from the two major dairy species is needed to predict consumer response.

AB  - Mangrove forests are increasingly threatened by plant invasions worldwide, but some mangrove species are invasive and threaten salt marsh and native mangrove ecosystems. The southern coast of China is invaded by the cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, and the mangrove Sonneratia apetala, providing a model system for studying the processes and mechanisms through which non-native species establish and spread. We used a transplant experiment to test the overarching hypothesis that native herbivores and plants provided biotic resistance against invasion by S. apetala, and that the importance of these factors would vary geographically. Survival of transplanted mangrove seedlings was lower in Zhangjiang Estuary (23 degrees 55 ' N) than in Leizhou Bay (20 degrees 56 ' N), and varied with species and habitats. S. apetala had higher survival and growth rates than native mangroves at both sites, and S. apetala grew taller than the S. alterniflora canopy at Leizhou Bay in only two growing seasons. In contrast, native mangroves grew poorly in S. alterniflora. Grazing by rodents and insects suppressed the growth and survival of Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina in Zhangjiang Estuary and Leizhou Bay, but had little effect on S. apetala. Competition with vegetation (S. alterniflora and native mangroves) exacerbated the reduced survival of native mangroves, and these effects varied across study sites. Low survival of non-native S. apetala in vegetated habitats at Zhangjiang Estuary was likely due to a synergistic effect of low winter temperatures and low light intensity. Escape from herbivory (the opposite to biotic resistance) and fast growth may drive the quick expansion of non-native S. apetala in China. Rapid encroachment of S. apetala may transform the native mangrove forests and monospecific intertidal Spartina grasslands into non-native mangrove forests in the southern coast of China.

AB  - Human-centered, active-learning approaches can help students develop core competencies in biology and other STEM fields, including the ability to conduct research, use quantitative reasoning, communicate across disciplinary boundaries, and connect science education to pressing social and environmental challenges. Promising approaches for incorporating active learning into biology courses include the use of course-based research, community engagement, and international experiences. Disruption to higher education due to the COVID-19 pandemic made each of these approaches more challenging or impossible to execute. Here, we describe a scalable course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for an animal behavior course that integrates research and community engagement in a remote international experience. Students in courses at two U.S. universities worked with community partners to analyze the behavior of African goats grazing near informal settlements in Western Cape, South Africa. Partners established a relationship with goat herders, and then created 2-min videos of individual goats that differed in criteria (goat sex and time of day) specified by students. Students worked in small groups to choose dependent variables, and then compared goat behavior across criteria using a factorial design. In postcourse surveys, students from both universities indicated overall enthusiasm for the experience. In general, students indicated that the laboratory provided them with "somewhat more " of a research-based experience compared with biology laboratories they had taken of similar length, and "somewhat more " to "much more " of a community-engagement and international experience. Educational benefits were complemented by the fact that international educational partners facing economic hardship due to the pandemic received payment for services. Future iterations of the CURE can focus on goat behavior differences across ecological conditions to help herders increase production in the face of continued environmental and social challenges. More generally, applying the structure of this CURE could facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations with residents of under-resourced areas around the world.

AB  - Mammal faunas from northern French Guiana (in northeastern Amazonia) and the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve (in southwestern Amazonia) are the first Amazonian mammal faunas to be comprehensively described in terms of taxonomic composition and community structure. Bats are the most speciose group in each fauna, followed in order of decreasing species richness by rodents, didelphimorphians, carnivorans, xenarthrans or primates, and ungulates. A total of 180 species are known from northern French Guiana and 199 species from the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve, but an additional 25 species are possibly missing ("pseudoabsent") from the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial inventory; therefore, the increment by which species richness in northeastern Peru exceeds that of northern French Guiana is on the order of 10-25%. Complementarity (dissimilarity) between these faunas is high (79%-89%) for opossums, primates, and rodents, but complementarity is substantially lower for other groups (especially bats, carnivorans, and ungulates), suggesting taxonomic differences in geographic filtering. Most species in both faunas are nocturnal, as might be expected from the abundance of bats, but even among nonflying mammals nocturnal species outnumber diurnal species by about 2:1. Approximately equal numbers of nonflying species in both faunas are arboreal or terrestrial, whereas much smaller numbers are scansorial or semiaquatic; with one possible exception, none is fossorial. Despite such behavioral similarities, these faunas differ in trophic composition and guild membership: substantially more primary consumers are present in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve than in northern French Guiana, whereas numbers of secondary consumers and omnivores are similar. Higher primary productivity in western Amazonia, a geomorphologically dynamic landscape with fertile soils and phenologically diverse habitats, could explain faunal differences in both species richness and trophic structure.

AB  - Fronts play an important role in ecological processes, having multiple effects on the structure of plankton communities. The Argentine Sea is characterized by the presence of the large and very productive Patagonian shelf-break front (PSBF). This is a permanent front, with high thermohaline gradients defined between the relatively warmer and fresher shelf waters and those of the Malvinas Current. We studied the effects of the PSBF in the vertical and horizontal structure of the copepod community along two transects crossing the front. For all the variables studied, the outer shelf plus the front behaves as a unity, different of the offshore oceanic region. The highest copepod abundances were recorded on the outer shelf and shelf-break front, while the highest di-versity was verified in the oceanic regime. Three copepod assemblages were identified associated to different regions: outer shelf and front (OS-PSBF), upper (UMW) and deeper (DMW) Malvinas waters, each one charac-terized by its own set of indicator species, having different reproductive and feeding strategies. Sac-spawners, ambush or cruise-feeders, and detritivore or omnivore species, occurred in DMW, while broadcasters, filter-feeders and mainly herbivores dominated at UMW and OS-PSBF. The PSBF acts as a leaky boundary between the oceanic regime (UMW and DMW) and the outer shelf-front regime (OS-PSBF), the first one characterized by higher copepod diversity and several functional groups, and the last one depicted by higher copepod abundance and only one functional group. In addition to its high primary production, the PSBF and surroundings are important to provide diversity of pelagic habitats that promote the existence of different assemblages, which are characterized by species having similar functional traits and that could play a similar role in the ecosystem.

AB  - In the last three decades, DNA sequencing of ancient animal osteological assemblages has become an important tool complementing standard archaeozoological approaches to reconstruct the history of animal domestication. However, osteological assemblages of key archaeological contexts are not always available or do not necessarily preserve enough ancient DNA for a cost-effective genetic analysis. Here, we develop an in-solution target-enrichment approach, based on 80-mer species-specific RNA probes (ranging from 306 to 1686 per species) to characterise (in single experiments) the mitochondrial genetic variation from eight domesticated animal species of major economic interest: cattle, chickens, dogs, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. We also illustrate how our design can be adapted to enrich DNA library content and map the Y-chromosomal diversity within Equus caballus. By applying our target-enrichment assay to an extensive panel of ancient osteological remains, farm soil, and cave sediments spanning the last 43 kyrs, we demonstrate that minimal sequencing efforts are necessary to exhaust the DNA library complexity and to characterise mitogenomes to an average depth-of-coverage of 19.4 to 2003.7-fold. Our assay further retrieved horse mitogenome and Y-chromosome data from Late Pleistocene coprolites, as well as bona fide mitochondrial sequences from species that were not part of the probe design, such as bison and cave hyena. Our methodology will prove especially useful to minimise costs related to the genetic analyses of maternal and paternal lineages of a wide range of domesticated and wild animal species, and for mapping their diversity changes over space and time, including from environmental samples.

AB  - At present, climate change is a direct threat to biodiversity and its effects are evidenced by an increasingly accelerated loss of biodiversity. This study identified the main threats presently facing the Tapirus pinchaque species in Ecuador, generated predictive models regarding its distribution, and analyzed the protected areas as a conservation tool. The methodology was based on a literature review and the application of binary predictive models to achieve these objectives. The main results indicate that the T. pinchaque is seriously threatened, mainly by changes in land use. In addition, three models were selected that show current and future suitable areas for the conservation of the species. Its current distribution amounts to 67,805 km(2), 33% (22,872 km(2)) of which is located in 31 of the 61 protected areas. Finally, it is important to take timely actions focused on biodiversity conservation, considering the importance of balance in ecosystems to the humans dependent thereof, and the results regarding the changes in the current and future distribution areas of the mountain tapir are a great contribution to be used as a management tool for its conservation.</p>

AB  - Temperate reefs are being tropicalized worldwide. In temperate Western Australia, a marine heatwave led to a regime shift from kelp (Ecklonia radiata) dominated to canopy-free reefs, together with an increase in tropical herbivorous fishes that contribute to keeping low kelp abundances and even prevent kelp reestablishment in northern regions. However, whether tropical herbivorous fishes prefer kelps over other seaweeds and/or whether this preference changes with latitude remains untested. Multiple-choice experiments (young kelp vs. other sea weeds) with tropical, subtropical and temperate herbivorous fishes show shifting species-specific preferences and fish-to-fish interference shifting with latitude (assays replicated in two regions four degrees of latitude apart). Against expectations, only the temperate Kyphosus sydneyanus preferred kelp over other seaweeds, but only in the lower latitude region. Siganus fuscescens, the most abundant tropical herbivore in both regions, preferred grazing on turf, suggesting that tropical fish might reduce kelp recruitment by consuming microscopic sporophytes in turf matrix.

AB  - Orchids coexist with a diversity of endophytic fungi within their roots and other parts of the plant. These are presumed to contribute to nutrition, and may protect the plants against pathogens and herbivores; however, some may be latent pathogens and/or bring no benefit to the plant. Guarianthe skinneri is an epiphytic Central American threatened orchid used as an ornamental plant and in the rituals and celebrations of many communities. However, in the Soconusco region (Chiapas, Mexico), the pseudobulbs of mature plants are affected by the Lasiodiplodia theobromae fungus, causing the disease "black blotch". We evaluated and compared the diversity of the endophytic fungal community within the leaves, pseudobulbs and roots of mature plants in two conditions, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Thirty samples from each condition and tissue were amplified with ITS and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were obtained and analyzed to determine taxonomic assignment and functionality with FUNGuild, obtaining 1857 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Alpha diversity was similar between plant conditions. In symptomatic plants, significant differences were found between the three types of tissue. According to the FUNGuild functionality analysis, 368 ASVs were determined to be endophytic fungi. The tissues of G. skinneri plants are reservoirs of fungal endophytes that should be considered for further exploration for research and conservation purposes.

AB  - Under a changing climate, species will need to rapidly adapt to novel conditions at existing locations, migrate to track suitable climate, or risk widespread declines. For sessile, slow-migrating organisms like trees, adaptive capacity is expected to be particularly important for survival. Alternatively, assisted migration has been proposed as a means to help align tree populations with shifting climate habitats. Here we report on the performance of seed sources and species at broadleaf and conifer climate change trials at 10 and 11 years after planting, respectively. The trials were established in southern Ontario - an important transition zone between boreal and temperate ecosystems - and were designed to assess: (1) the assisted migration potential of six broadleaf species (via northward movements of seed sources), and (2) the adaptive capacity of three conifer species (via southward movements of seed sources). Both broadleaf and coniferous seed sources tolerated significant movements while maintaining reasonable growth and survival rates. In fact, several coniferous seed sources exhibited relatively high growth and survival rates despite southward transfers of more than 1000 km (> 5 degrees C mean annual temperature) - indicating considerable adaptive capacity to climate change in these northern conifer populations. Furthermore, several of the broadleaf species exhibited high levels of growth and survival despite being planted at, or beyond, their current northern range limits - suggesting the potential for modest range expansions via assisted migration. Despite caveats related to the relatively young age of the plantations and deer browsing at the site, these findings help forest managers better understand potential climate change impacts and assisted migration outcomes.

AB  - Diverse organisms actively manipulate their (sym)biotic and physical environment in ways that feed back on their own development. However, the degree to which these processes affect microevolution remains poorly understood. The gazelle dung beetle both physically modifies its ontogenetic environment and structures its biotic interactions through vertical symbiont transmission. By experimentally eliminating (i) physical environmental modifications and (ii) the vertical inheritance of microbes, we assess how environment modifying behaviour and microbiome transmission shape heritable variation and evolutionary potential. We found that depriving larvae of symbionts and environment modifying behaviours increased additive genetic variance and heritability for development time but not body size. This suggests that larvae's ability to manipulate their environment has the potential to modify heritable variation and to facilitate the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation. This cryptic variation may become released and selectable when organisms encounter environments that are less amenable to organismal manipulation or restructuring. Our findings also suggest that intact microbiomes, which are commonly thought to increase genetic variation of their hosts, may instead reduce and conceal heritable variation. More broadly, our findings highlight that the ability of organisms to actively manipulate their environment may affect the potential of populations to evolve when encountering novel, stressful conditions.

AB  - Soil nematodes are major soil organisms known to reduce wheat production worldwide. However, they are a crucial part of soil biodiversity. Due to the limited data available regarding nematode biodiversity associated with cereal crops in Morocco, a survey was conducted in 2019 across 80 wheat fields. Thirty-three nematode taxa were obtained with different trophic groups: 11 bacterivores (i.e., Rhabditis and Cephalobus spp.), 11 herbivores (i.e., Pratylenchus and Heterodera spp.), 6 fungivores (i.e., Ditylenchus and Aphelenchoides spp.), 4 omnivores (i.e., Dorylaimus and Aporcelaimus spp.) and one predator (Mononchus spp.). For each locality, the diversity of nematode communities was assessed through multiple diversity indices. Three areas (Ait Melloul, Oulad Dahou, and Sidi Boushab) were more diversified and had pronounced nematode occurrence. Moreover, few localities (e.g., Ait Amira and Lqliaa) were shown to be disturbed. Our study underlined that several nematode taxa were significantly correlated with edaphic and climatic/geographic properties. On the other hand, the spatial and parsimony analyses revealed that plant feeders were most associated with bacterial feeders in disturbed soils. This work revealed that the soil nematodes associated with wheat crops are diverse and can serve as an important tool for soil biomonitoring at a large scale.

AB  - Tropical oceans host a high diversity of species, including large marine consumers. In these oligotrophic eco-systems, oceanic islands often favour the aggregation of species and biomass as they provide feeding opportu-nities related to the mechanisms of island mass effect. As such, the waters surrounding La Reunion (Southwest Indian Ocean) host seabirds, large pelagic teleosts, elasmobranchs, delphinids and sea turtles. Isotopic niche partitioning and comparison of trophic levels among these species (n = 21) were investigated using stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotope analysis. Overall, delta 13C values were highly variable among taxa, indicating that the species exploit multiple foraging habitats along a coast-open ocean gradient. Overlap in delta 15N values was limited, except for teleost species, the two species of sea turtles and two species of delphinids, the Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Spinner dolphin (Stellena longirostris). Stable isotope analyses of samples collected over a 9-years period on different tissues with different integration times provide a consistent picture of the structure of the community of large marine vertebrates species around La Reunion and highlight the underlying mechanisms to limit the competition between species. The wide range of isotopic values confirms that large marine vertebrates have different trophic roles in coastal marine food webs around this oceanic island, which limits their potential of competitive interactions for resources.

AB  - Fluid-feeding herbivores directly affect host plants through sap consumption. Moreover, they establish mutualistic relationships with ants, which might generate additional reproductive costs related to pollinator repellence. Here we studied the drivers of variation in the outcomes of these interactions from the perspective of Psittacanthus robustus, a hummingbird-pollinated mistletoe. We hypothesized that associations between fluid-feeding insects and ants should indirectly decrease mistletoe reproduction by repelling pollinators, and directly by reducing seed size, germination, and establishment of plants presenting denser herbivore aggregations. First, we manipulated the presence of the ant Camponotus rufipes on mistletoe inflorescences to assess their effects on visitation behavior of pollinators. We correlated fruit production and fruit and seed size to abundance of fluid-feeding insects on plants. Moreover, we conducted a field experiment assessing the effects of aggregation size of fluid-feeding herbivores on seed germination and seedling establishment. Ant presence on inflorescences did not affect the visitation rates of the main pollinator, the hummingbird Eupetomena macroura. Abundance of fluid-feeding herbivores did not explain variation in fruit crop size. However, we observed a significant reduction in seed size in those plants hosting larger aggregations of fluid-feeding herbivores. The reduction in seed size did not translate into a significant decrease in seed germination nor a decrease in seedling establishment. Our results dispute previous studies highlighting negative indirect effects on plant-pollinator interactions mediated by the presence of ant-trophobiont mutualisms. Likewise, our study underscores the need of assessing fluid-feeding herbivore effects on crucial stages of the host plant life cycle to clarify fitness consequences of multitrophic interactions.

AB  - Aim The body size of marine megafauna can influence population dynamics because larger females have disproportionally greater reproductive output. We explored how this size scaling relationship can affect predictions of population size structure in nesting sea turtles by combining a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis with a long-term field nesting survey. Location Global (meta-analysis) and Malaysia (field survey). Time period Present. Major taxa studied Sea turtles. Methods We extracted body size and reproductive parameters of all sea turtle species from the literature and estimated the reproductive-energy output using allometric models. We then examined the relationship between body size and the proportion of protected nesting beaches by country as an indicator of conservation efforts on body size. Long-term monitoring (1993-2019) of body size and nesting data on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Redang Island (Malaysia) was used to examine temporal changes in body size and fecundity and to test whether the size scaling of fecundity was isometric (linear) or allometric (curvilinear). Results We show that the total reproductive-energy output of larger nesting females was, on average, disproportionately greater in all sea turtle species. We found no strong correlations for countries with a higher proportion of protected nesting sites with female size. Finally, we showed that scaling-derived calculations of population-level yearly reproductive output in the green turtle population from Redang Island were more accurate when using a hyperallometric (rather than an isometric) relationship at the individual level. Main conclusions Understanding ecosystem function and conservation effort requires accurate predictions of population trends. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for scaling effects of body size in predicting anthropogenically mediated population shifts, and the need to protect large females in order to facilitate effective population replenishment.

AB  - The Trinidadian red-brocket deer (Mazama americana trinitatis) is the only species of deer in Trinidad and is classified as a unique subspecies of red-brocket deer. Despite the importance of the species in Trinidad, to date there have been no published studies on their densities. We report on the densities of this species at four different sites in Trinidad over a 3-year period, with the first 2 years sampled during a hunting moratorium. Diurnal surveys were conducted, with density estimates calculated using King's Estimator. Surveys were repeated in both the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 312 deer on 1131.4 km of transect were observed over the study. Density estimates varied between different sites (1-16 individuals/km(2)), and between one and eight individuals/km(2) island-wide. Overall, the estimated density of red-brocket deer increased in two of four sites during the study period, indicating that the institution of the moratorium may have had a positive impact on populations of deer. The fact that density estimates varied considerably across the island suggests that harvest levels may need to be tailored for different sites.

AB  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) are found in various habitats, from pure forest cultures to agricultural areas and mountains. In adapting to the geographically and seasonally differentiating food supply, they depend, above all, on an adapted microbiome. However, knowledge about the microbiome of wild ruminants still needs to be improved. There are only a few publications for individual species with a low number of samples. This study aims to identify a core microbiota for Bavarian roe deer and present nutrient and microbiota portraits of the individual habitat types. This study investigated the roe deer's rumen (reticulorumen) content from seven different characteristic Bavarian habitat types. The focus was on the composition of nutrients, fermentation products, and the rumen bacterial community. A total of 311 roe deer samples were analysed, with the most even possible distribution per habitat, season, age class, and gender. Significant differences in nutrient concentrations and microbial composition were identified for the factors habitat, season, and age class. The highest crude protein content (plant protein and microbial) in the rumen was determined in the purely agricultural habitat (AG), the highest value of non-fibre carbohydrates in the alpine mountain forest, and the highest fibre content (neutral detergent fibre, NDF) in the pine forest habitat. Maximum values for fibre content go up to 70% NDF. The proportion of metabolites (ammonia, lactate, total volatile fatty acids) was highest in the Agriculture-Beech-Forest habitat (ABF). Correlations can be identified between adaptations in the microbiota and specific nutrient concentrations, as well as in strong fluctuations in ingested forage. In addition, a core bacterial community comprising five genera could be identified across all habitats, up to 44% of total relative abundance. As with all wild ruminants, many microbial genera remain largely unclassified at various taxonomic levels. This study provides a more in-depth insight into the diversity and complexity of the roe deer rumen microbiota. It highlights the key microorganisms responsible for converting naturally available nutrients of different botanical origins.

AB  - Manure covered by organic materials during the storage has shown that it can effectively reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, but few studies have focused on the bacterial communities in manure or the coverage and mechanism responsible for reducing gas emissions. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts and mecha-nisms of cornstalk and sawdust coverings on greenhouse gas emissions during sheep manure storage. Sheep manure covered by organic material reduced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (42.27%-42.55%) relative to un-covered control through physical adsorption and biological transformation of Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Brachybacterium, Dietzia and Brevibacterium. Sheep manure covered by organic materials also increased methane (CH4) emissions (16.31%-43.07%) by increasing anaerobic zones of coverage. Overall, coverings reduced carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) by 29.87%-33.60%. Coverings had less effect on the bacterial diversity and com-munity of sheep manure, and the number of bacteria shared by sheep manure and the covering material increased with storage progress, indicating that these bacteria were transferred to the covering materials with gas emissions and moisture volatilization. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that functional group intensities of the covering materials increased and the fibrous structures became more disordered during the storage period. In general, it was safe to use organic materials as coverages during sheep manure storage, which was conducive to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - The number of invasive non-native pests is increasing rapidly in forests as a result of global change. It is therefore important to prevent their damage in order to preserve the integrity of forest ecosystems and the associated services. According to the biotic resistance hypothesis, species-rich communities are less likely to be invaded. The associational resistance hypothesis states that insect herbivores are more likely to colonise and exploit plants surrounded by conspecific neighbours than heterospecific, non-host plant species. More diverse forests would therefore be less damaged by non-native pests than tree monocultures. We tested these hypotheses by comparing the damage caused to seeds by the western conifer bug Leptoglossus occidentalis, , an invasive insect native to North America, in plots of pure maritime pine and mixed plots of maritime pine and birch. These plots were in two tree diversity experiments in Europe. Mixed pine plots differed in terms of pine density (1250 versus 625 pines/ha), proportion of pine and birch (25 %, 50 %, 75 %) and spatial mixing pattern (aggregated versus dispersed). We sampled 635 cones in 37 plots. Overall, the proportion of seeds damaged by the invasive bug was significantly lower in mixed plots than in pure pine plots at both experimental sites. There was no significant effect of pine density or relative proportion in the mixtures on seed damage. Aggregated pines in the mixed plots were significantly more damaged than dispersed pines, suggesting that bugs may have done less damage when they had more difficulty locating their host trees. This is consistent with the hypothesis of lower plant apparency. These results support the view that forest plantations of mixed species, which are known to be less vulnerable to attack by native insects, may also be more resistant to infestation by exotic insects. Row-wise, intimate mixtures of two species represent a promising option for designing tree plantations that are more resistant and easier to manage.

AB  - Invasive species management is promoted as a general practice to maintain rangeland biodiversity and mitigate livestock performance losses (e.g., weight gain) stemming from invasive-species effects (e.g., competitive exclusion of palatable forages). It is hypothesized that altering fire-timing (e.g., moving from early to late-growing season burning) or integrating herbicide application into fire management regimes may lead to more successful reduction of certain invasive species without negatively affecting livestock weight gains. However, large-scale, replicated experimental evidence linking invasive species abundance or management practices to cattle weight gain is mostly lacking across grasslands. We manipulated eight large (333 - 766 ha) pastures managed with fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory) to test how growing (i.e., August-September) and dormant (i.e., March-April) season fires, herbicide application, or invasive species abundance (namely Lespedeza cuneata) affected yearling stocker cattle weight gain - i.e., per head weight gain - from 2018 to 2020. We found that yearling stocker cattle gained significantly less weight in pastures burned during the growing season, and her-bicide application did not increase weight gains overall. Moreover, we did not find a significant relationship between L. cuneata abundance and per head yearling stocker cattle weight gain. Our results add to a growing line of evidence that invasive species management does not always benefit livestock producers. The hypothesized negative relationship between invasive species abundance and cattle weight gain may be minimal (or neutral) across large grassland landscapes, particularly those managed with pyric herbivory. To date, pyric herbivory is the only management regime known to simultaneously promote biodiversity, and restrict some invasive plant species like L. cuneata.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that facilitative interactions between species play an essential role in coastal wetland ecosystems. However, there is a lack of understanding of how such interactions can be used for restoration purposes in saltmarsh ecosystems. We therefore studied the mechanisms of reciprocal facilitative interactions between native annual plants, Suaeda salsa, and burrowing crabs, Helice tientsinensis, in a middle-elevation saltmarsh (with generally high plant density and moderate tides) in the Yellow River Delta of China.
   We investigated the relationship between the densities of the plants and crab burrows in different seasons. Then, we tested whether and how saltmarsh plants and crabs indeed facilitate each other in a series of field and laboratory experiments. Finally, we applied the results by creating a field-scale artificial approach for microtopographic modification to restore a degraded saltmarsh.
   We found that the density of plant seedlings in spring was positively correlated with the density of crab burrows in the previous autumn; moreover, the density of crab burrows was correlated with the density of plants in summer. The concave-convex surface microtopography created by crabs promoted seed retention and seedling establishment of saltmarsh plants in winter and spring. These plants in turn facilitated crabs by inhibiting predators, providing food and reducing physical stresses for crabs in summer and autumn. The experimental removal of saltmarsh plants decreased crab burrow density, while both transplanting and simulating plants in bare patches promoted crabs. The microtopographic modification, inspired by our new understanding of the interactions between saltmarsh plants and crabs, showed that these degraded saltmarsh ecosystems can be restored by a single ploughing intervention.
   Synthesis. Our results suggest a reciprocal facilitation between annual plants and burrowing crabs in a middle-elevation saltmarsh ecosystem. This knowledge yielded new restoration options for degraded coastal saltmarshes through the one-time ploughing initiation of microtopographic variation, which could promote the re-establishment of ecosystem engineers and lead to the efficient recovery of pioneer coastal vegetation and associated fauna.

AB  - ContextThe Complementary Habitat Hypothesis posits that animals access resources for different needs by moving between complementary habitats that can be seen as 'resource composites'. These movements can occur over a range of temporal scales, from diurnal to seasonal, in response to multiple drivers such as access to food, weather constraints, risk avoidance and human disturbance. Within this framework, we hypothesised that large herbivores cope with human-altered landscapes through the alternate use of complementary habitats at both daily and seasonal scales.ObjectivesWe tested the Complementary Habitat Hypothesis in European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) by classifying 3900 habitat-annotated movement trajectories of 154 GPS-monitored individuals across contrasting landscapes.MethodsWe considered day-night alternation between open food-rich and closed refuge habitats as a measure of complementary habitat use. We first identified day-night alternation using the Individual Movement - Sequence Analysis Method, then we modelled the proportion of day-night alternation over the year in relation to population and individual characteristics.ResultsWe found that day-night alternation is a widespread behaviour in roe deer, even across markedly different landscapes. Day-night alternation followed seasonal trends in all populations, partly linked to vegetation phenology. Within populations, seasonal patterns of open/closed habitat alternation differed between male and female adults, but not in juveniles.ConclusionOur results support the Complementary Habitat Hypothesis by showing that roe deer adjust their access to the varied resources available in complex landscapes by including different habitats within their home range, and sequentially alternating between them in response to seasonal changes and individual life history.

AB  - South American camelids (SAC) played a central biocultural role in Andean communities until today. Paleoparasitology, a discipline examining parasite remains from ancient times, can shed light on SAC, animals closely related to humans, providing insights into camelid populations, societies and the environment in the past. The objectives of this study are (1) to provide new insight into the parasite diversity of SAC from the Southern Puna, (2) to compare parasite diversity between different sites, and (3) to interpret the findings in relation to environmental and cultural changes in the Puna over time. The coprolites studied proceed from three archaeological sites in the Southern Puna: Cueva Inca Viejo (CIV), Punta de la Pe & ntilde;a 4 (PP4) and Piedra Horadada 2 (PH2). A total of 153 coprolites were studied, subjected to rehydration, homogenization, filtration and spontaneous sedimentation. The assignation of the zoological origin of coprolites as SAC was based on their morphology, biogeographic origin, the presence of Eimeria macusaniensis and Lamanema chavezi/Nematodirus lamae and aDNA analysis. Seventeen parasite taxa belonging to Apicomplexa, Nematoda and Platyhelminthes were found, representing the highest richness recorded in ancient times until now. A noteworthy finding was the recovery of zoonotic species like Fasciola hepatica and capillariids, providing insight into possible zoonotic infections in ancient Andean populations. The record of Moniezia sp. and Strongyloides sp. suggest their presence in native Andean species before the arrival of Hispanic societies. The results revealed a parasitic fauna consistent with both modern and paleoparasitological studies. Variations in the composition of parasite assemblages were observed over time and between sites.

AB  - Maternal deprivation has been shown to disrupt the development of neonates. Nevertheless, separating the young animals from their dams soon after birth is a common practice in dairy farming. We investigated the effects of maternal deprivation on goat kids' (Capra hircus) social behavior and social ontogeny before and after weaning. Twenty female kids were raised together with their dams (DR kids) and other lactating goats and kids, whereas 20 female kids were separated from their dams 3 days after birth and artificially reared together (AR kids). At weaning, each treatment group was split in half and moved into two new pens where they were mixed with the other treatment group. Social behaviors were recorded before and after weaning. Before weaning, AR kids were observed performing more play-fighting, racing, stepping on each other, and standing in contact with each other than DR kids, but AR allogroomed less and spent less time resting alone than DR kids. After weaning and mixing of the treatments, DR kids initiated more and received less agonistic interactions than AR kids, but this difference reduced across the 5 weeks of observations as AR kids appeared to progressively change their social behavior after interacting with DR kids.

AB  - Human activity in African tropical rainforests continues to threaten wild mammals. Many rural communities are dependent on hunting, yet there is a widespread lack of baseline data on ecology and the sustainability of hunting. We investigated the impacts of human activity on mammal species composition and distributions within a community forest surrounding a village in the buffer zone of the Dja Biosphere Reserve in south-east Cameroon. We conducted a camera-trap survey in August-November 2017 and detected 24 mammal species, including Critically Endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Endangered central African chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Endangered tree pangolin Phataginus tricuspis. We used occupancy analysis to explore relationships between indicators of human activity (distance to a road and the Reserve), habitat quality (distance to the river and tree cover) and the distributions of species. We found that the local distribution of threatened mammals was not apparently limited by human activity, and proximity to the road did not negatively influence occupancy for any species. However, most of the Reserve's large species were not detected, including the African forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis and the largest ungulates, and the occupancy of two species commonly hunted for wild meat was positively correlated with distance from the village, indicating hunting may be unsustainable. Our results show that the community forest provides habitat for threatened species outside the Reserve and in close proximity to people. However, effective conservation management will require continued monitoring and research to determine whether current rates of hunting are sustainable.

AB  - While sustainable agriculture relies on natural pest control, we lack insights into the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down factors on pest levels, especially along broad environmental and management gradients. To this aim, we focused on bottom-up and top-down control of herbivore damage in sixty sites in the centre of origin of Arabica coffee in southwestern Ethiopia, where coffee grows along a management gradient ranging from little or no management in the natural forest to commercial plantations. More specifically, we examined how canopy cover, percentage of surrounding forest and management intensity affected caffeine and chlorogenic acid concentration (bottom-up process) and attack of dummy caterpillars by ants and birds (top-down process), and how these in turn affected pest levels. Caffeine and chlorogenic acid concentrations were negatively related to canopy cover, while ant attack rate was positively related to canopy cover. Both ant and bird attack rate increased with the percentage of surrounding forest. Yet, secondary chemistry and caterpillar attack rates were unrelated to herbivory, and herbivory was only directly and positively affected by management intensity. Our study highlights that canopy cover can have contrasting effects on plant defence and predation, and that changes in bottom-up and top-down factors do unlike often assumed - not necessarily translate into reduced pest levels. Instead, direct effects of management on pest levels may be more important than bottom-up or top-down mediated effects. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - During RV MS Merian expedition MSM75, an international, multidisciplinary team explored the Reykjanes Ridge from June to August 2018. The first area of study, Steinaholl (150-350 m depth), was chosen based on previous seismic data indicating hydrothermal activity. The sampling strategy included ship- and AUV-mounted multibeam surveys, Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), Epibenthic Sledge (EBS), and van Veen grab (vV) deployments. Upon returning to Steinaholl during the final days of MSM75, hydrothermal vent sites were discovered using the ROV Phoca (Kiel, GEOMAR). Here we describe and name three new, distinct hydrothermal vent site vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs); Hafgufa, Stokkull, Lyngbakr. The hydrothermal vent sites consisted of multiple anhydrite chimneys with large quantities of bacterial mats visible. The largest of the three sites (Hafgufa) was mapped, and reconstructed in 3D. In total 23,310 individual biological specimens were sampled comprising 41 higher taxa. Unique fauna located in the hydrothermally venting areas included two putative new species of harpacticoid copepod (Tisbe sp. nov. and Amphiascus sp. nov.), as well as the sponge Lycopodina cupressiformis (Carter, 1874). Capitellidae Grube, 1862 and Dorvilleidae Chamberlin, 1919 families dominated hydrothermally influenced samples for polychaetes. Around the hydrothermally influenced sites we observed a notable lack of megafauna, with only a few species being present. While we observed hydrothermal associations, the overall species composition is very similar to that seen at other shallow water vent sites in the north of Iceland, such as the Mohns Ridge vent fields, particularly with peracarid crustaceans. We therefore conclude the community overall reflects the usual "background" fauna of Iceland rather than consisting of "vent endemic" communities as is observed in deeper vent systems, with a few opportunistic species capable of utilizing this specialist environment.

AB  - Being opportunistic omnivores, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) readily feed on edible garbage. Given the presence of substantial volumes of edible food waste, large multi-county and regional municipal sanitary waste landfills constitute attractive forage resources for pigs, providing a year-round anthropogenic source of potentially high-quality forage. Our objective was to assess the effects that a large regional landfill has on the local pigs foraging in that facility's waste disposal cells. The landfill, located on the United States Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA, became operational in 1998 and pigs began foraging there in 2001. By 2009 >100 pigs/night were observed foraging in the landfill, suggesting landfill establishment may have important consequences for population dynamics, public safety, and disease transmission. We evaluated changes in body mass, fetal litter size, numbers of pigs removed, and wild pig-vehicle collisions (WPVCs) before (1980-2000) and after (2001-2019) pigs began foraging in the landfill on SRS. Body mass during the after period increased to a greater extent for pigs in the vicinity of the landfill compared to pigs on the rest of SRS. Fetal litter size increased for pigs in the vicinity of the landfill, whereas it remained unchanged on the rest of SRS. Our density surrogate (number of pigs harvested) increased around the landfill during the after period by 2.9 times, whereas on the rest of the site it only increased by 53%. No WPVCs occurred adjacent to the landfill before 2001, but WPVCs increased along the 2 major roads bordering the landfill after 2001. Effects of sanitary waste landfills on wild pig populations scavenging there can present unique challenges to population management, control, public safety, and disease transmission. Potential approaches to address these challenges could be exclusion fencing to prevent access to the landfill's waste disposal cells or enhanced placement of waste cell covers to reduce access.

AB  - Increases in droughts may disrupt the life-supporting services of grasslands, including the forage provision for herbivores. However, less is known about drought impacts on forage quality (i.e., dynamics of the cell characteristics of leaves and stems of herbs). Leaf economic traits reflect drought effects on plant communities, but whether they can predict forage quality patterns under drought remains unclear. We assessed the effects of early- and late-season extreme droughts on (i) forage quality parameters [readily digestible, internal cellular constituents: protein, minerals, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC); and non-readily digestible, cell wall components: neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF)]; (ii) community-weighted leaf traits [specific leaf area (cwmSLA) and leaf dry matter content (cwmLDMC)]; and (iii) leaf traits-quality parameters relationships across three grasslands over two growing seasons. Both early and late droughts decreased ash and ADF and increased WSC across sites, while early drought slightly reduced protein and NDF. Both droughts decreased cwmSLA and increased cwmLDMC across sites. Community-weighted leaf traits and forage quality parameters were unrelated under early ambient conditions, but their relationships under early-season drought imply that lower cwmSLA and higher cwmLDMC communities had higher forage quality (higher protein and less lignified fibre contents) than higher cwmSLA and lower cwmLDMC communities. Under late-season ambient or drought conditions, most relationships indicate that lower cwmSLA and cwmLDMC communities had higher forage quality (higher protein and ash, and more digestible fibre contents) than higher cwmSLA and cwmLDMC communities. Overall, forage quality was higher under late-season ambient conditions compared to the early season, and both drought types had limited negative effects on forage quality in the studied grasslands. Moreover, leaf traits can predict forage quality patterns and plants' adaptation under certain circumstances, including regular intra-seasonal dry periods and extreme drought conditions.

AB  - Biological invasions threaten biodiversity globally. In Australia, introduced and invasive European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a major predator of native wildlife, and are implicated in numerous species extinctions, prompting large-scale fox population control programs. Lethal control-typically via poison (1080) baiting-is common, but the consistency of its efficacy has been questioned, and the desired outcomes are frequently not measured or evaluated. We aimed to assess the success and impacts of lethal fox control on fox activity, and subsequent effects on a co-occurring, invasive mesopredator (feral cat, Felis catus), and native and invasive prey species. We surveyed three locations in the Wimmera region of Victoria, each experienced a different baiting regime (no baiting, standard systematic baiting, intensified baiting). Camera traps were deployed from April 2021 to August 2023 to determine predator activity alongside non-target herbivores. Baiting treatment was not associated with differences in fox or cat activity. Nurcoung (no baiting) had the lowest activity of both cats and foxes across the study. Fox activity patterns under standard baiting were higher than intensified baiting. Our results suggest that fox control might destabilise population dynamics of foxes, potentially facilitating increased activity levels through higher emigration rates from the surrounding agricultural environments. Our study highlights the critical importance of appropriately monitoring the outcomes of invasive species control programs to ensure the a priori strategic objectives are achieved. To achieve more effective fox population suppression broader, landscape-scale approaches that take a nil-tenure approach are essential.

AB  - ContextLinear Transportation Infrastructures (LTIs) are among the largest factors responsible for landscape fragmentation, in turn increasing population isolation. In this context, studies have mainly focused on a single species' response to barrier elements and mitigation thereof. Yet, the implementation of conservation strategies to restore landscape connectivity may be challenging when multi-specific responses are not measured and fully considered.ObjectivesWe aimed to assess the effect of two different types of LTIs, a fenced highway and a navigation canal on gene flow in three ungulate species in Northeastern France.MethodsWe genotyped 98 red deer (C. elaphus), 120 wild boars (S. scrofa) and 140 roe deer (C. capreolus) with species-specific microsatellite markers from 3 sampling sites located on either side of both LTIs considered in the study area. We assessed the continuity of gene flow using Bayesian clustering methods and a mapping approach to determine inter-individual genetic dissimilarity in relation to landscape characteristics.ResultsOur study showed different impacts of LTIs on the gene flow of species belonging a priori to the same functional group. Genetic differentiation among red deer and wild boar sampling units was observed on either side of the highway, but no such differentiation was identified for roe deer. However, no genetic structuring was associated with the presence of the canal in any species.ConclusionsThe impact of LTIs on gene flow in large species results from the structural characteristics of the infrastructure, and our study shows that mitigation measures should consider species-specific behaviors to facilitate the use of crossing structures and thus ensure gene flow across ILTs.

AB  - Ecosystem services and their contribution to local economies and livelihoods still need to be fully understood and recognized by many policymakers. The primary purpose of this research is to integrate land use and land cover data and local ecological knowledge-based data with geographical information systems through a participatory approach to enhance natural resource management. We selected the Pariac-Rajucolta watershed as a study area because it is a typical landscape in the high-Andean mountains, with half of its territory inside a protected area. The methods involved a six-month participatory approach quantifying the benefits and exchange values of 33 provisioning ecosystem services, compiling the primary data from the locals and spectral information from Sentinel-2A. The results show that only agricultural and artificial areas delivered multiple benefits and offered the highest commercialization value of ecosystem ser-vices. The community mainly benefits from nutrition, materials, or energy from cultivated terrestrial plants, reared animals, wild plants, and surface water at the watershed level. At the same time, the services with high exchange proportions were mainly short-only meat of guinea pigs, manure, wild fruits, mushrooms, and wild plants for food. The abundance and the spatial distribution of benefits and exchange values of ecosystem services displayed a pattern of high quantity for the downstream and low in the basin's top and midstream of the watershed (inside the protected area). In conclusion, the study shows the importance of knowing ecosystem services benefits and exchange values as an initial approach to developing participatory strategies for managing and conserving natural resources.

AB  - Background Insect pests are a significant threat to natural resources and social development. Modeling species assemblages of insect pests can predict spatiotemporal pest dynamics. However, research gaps remain regarding the mechanism for determining species assemblages of insect pests in alpine forest ecosystems. Here, we explored these determinants using a field investigation conducted for insect pests in a region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We assessed the species assemblages of insect pests in alpine forest ecosystems based on species co-occurrence patterns and species diversity (i.e., observed diversity, dark diversity, community completeness, and species pool). A probabilistic model was used to test for statistically significant pairwise patterns of species co-occurrence using the presence-absence matrix of pest species based on species interactions. We used ordinary least squares regression modeling to explore relationships between abiotic factors (i.e., climate factors and human influence) and species diversity. Results Positive pest species interactions and many association links can occur widely across different investigation sites and parts of plant hosts in alpine forest ecosystems. We detected high dark diversity and low community completeness of insect pests in alpine forest ecosystems. High temperature and precipitation could promote pest species diversity, particularly dark diversity and species pools. Human influence could drive high levels of pest species diversity and lead to dark diversity and species pools. Community completeness could be an effective indicator for insect pest risk assessment. Conclusions Our study provides new evidence for the determinants of insect pest species assemblages in alpine forest ecosystems from the perspectives of pest species interactions and abiotic factors. The findings of our study could reveal the mechanism for shaping species assemblages and support the prevention and control of insect pests in alpine forest ecosystems.

AB  - The interaction of recent orographic uplift and climate heterogeneity acted as a key role in the East Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (EHHM) has been reported in many studies. However, how exactly the interaction promotes clade diversification remains poorly understood. In this study, we both used the chloroplast trnT-trnF region and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci to investigate the phylogeographic structure and population dynamics of Hippophae gyantsensis and estimate what role geological barriers or ecological factors play in the spatial genetic structure. The results showed that this species had a strong east-west phylogeographic structure, with several mixed populations identified from microsatellite data in central location. The intraspecies divergence time was estimated to be about 3.59 Ma, corresponding well with the recent uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Between the two lineages, there was significant climatic differentiation without geographic barriers. High consistency between lineage divergence, climatic heterogeneity, and Qingzang Movement demonstrated that climatic heterogeneity but not geographic isolation drives the divergence of H. gyantsensis, and the recent regional uplift of the QTP, as the Himalayas, creates heterogeneous climates by affecting the flow of the Indian monsoon. The east group of H. gyantsensis experienced population expansion c. 0.12 Ma, closely associated with the last interglacial interval. Subsequently, a genetic admixture event between east and west groups happened at 26.90 ka, a period corresponding to the warm inter-glaciation again. These findings highlight the importance of the Quaternary climatic fluctuations in the recent evolutionary history of H. gyantsensis. Our study will improve the understanding of the history and mechanisms of biodiversity accumulation in the EHHM region.

AB  - Natural Trap Cave (NTC) is a well-known fossil locality located in Wyoming that contains a discontinuous record of sediments from the early Sangamonian (similar to 150 ka) to the present and produces a diverse vertebrate assemblage from 2-9 and 23-47 cal ka BP. This study examines changes in the rank abundance distribution (RAD) of NTC's large-bodied (>8 kg) vertebrates, to assess the stability of the local ecosystem surrounding the cave across the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition. RADs were generated based on 2208 skeletal elements from four stratigraphic units, collected by Gilbert and Martin from 1974 to 1979. All bones included in this study had: a north-west grid coordinate, a known depth below the sediment surface, were over 20% complete and taxonomically diagnostic. Isotaphonomy was assessed using multinomial regressions of %MAU against multiple taphonomic variables: size, shape, degree of abrasion and weathering, fracture type, percent complete, original bulk density, and surface area to volume ratio. Changes in RADs were analyzed using rank abundance curves (RACs), Wilcoxon Rank Sums test, and kurtosis. RADs were also fit to a suite of standard ecological models (i.e., geometric, log-series, zero-sum multinomial, & log-normal) using maximum likelihood and the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc). The four faunal assemblages show little variation in taphonomic biasing, so any changes in the RADs reflects changes in the ecosystem. The four RACs showed little change in their shape or faunal composition and are dominated by a few abundant taxa, representing an ecosystem that experienced perturbations (i.e., a concave RAC and a kurtosis value > 3). The Wilcoxon Rank Sums test found no statistical difference among the RADs from the lower three stratigraphic units. This means that the abundance structure of the large-bodied vertebrates did not change prior to (35.8-25.3 cal ka BP) or during the Last Glacial Maximum (25.3-17.2 cal ka BP) and the local ecosystem surrounding NTC never approached equilibrium. The uppermost stratigraphic unit represented a mixed Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene assemblage, so changes in ecosystem structure from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene (10.5 cal ka BP - present) cannot be evaluated. Unfortunately, the ecological models used in this study provide little insight into the maturity or processes influencing the formation of the local ecosystem surrounding NTC because only three models produced a Delta AICc value between 4.4 and 6.7.

AB  - Climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing global challenges in recent decades. Agricultural activities significantly influence climate dynamics, necessitating thorough investigation of their emission patterns. Using the FAO datasets, the objectives of this study were to assess agricultural GHG emissions, identify influencing factors, and explore potential mitigation strategies. The results show that emissions related to crop production are strongly correlated with the yields of predominant crops. Maize production had the largest impact on crop emissions (0.023), followed by potato (0.021) and rice (0.007). Notably, these three crops accounted for substantial portions of total crop-related emissions, with maize contributing 11.70%, potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) 10.21%, and rice 9.25%. In the livestock sector, cattle herds generated 10.75% of emissions, with pigs and sheep contributing 9.82% and 10.03%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed the cattle/buffalo population as the dominant emission driver (0.32), followed by sheep/goat (0.21) and swine (0.10) populations. Simultaneously, emissions from livestock operations were closely associated with the populations of key livestock species. Thus, from a climate mitigation perspective, prioritizing yield-optimized agronomic approaches for maize and potato cultivation, along with strategic population management of cattle and sheep, represents a critical pathway toward achieving emission reduction targets in global agricultural systems.

AB  - The expansion of subtropical thicket vegetation at the expense of more species-rich, fire-prone fynbos, potentially due to lower frequency and severity of fire and browsing, is a concern in many coastal dune landscapes of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) where these two vegetation types co-occur. We were interested in the effects of severe fire or browsing treatments (causing complete loss of aboveground biomass) on the vigour of post-fire resprouts of dune thicket shrubs. Cape St Francis, CFR, South Africa. We used an in situ experimental approach to compare the effects of simulated fire and browsing by herbivores on mortality, resprouting vigour and resprouting rate of 10 canopy-forming dune thicket shrub species from different architectural guilds, 5 years after a previous severe wildfire. Survival was significantly lower after fire (85%) than after browsing (95%), and was significantly positively related to pre-treatment shrub size. All measures of resprouting vigour were significantly lower after fire than after browsing, and were significantly positively related to pre-treatment size. Resprouting rate was significantly lower after fire than after browsing, and was significantly positively affected by pre-treatment size. Survival and measures of resprouting vigour were generally decoupled from architectural guild and species identity. Dune thicket shrubs showed high survival after both fire and browsing treatments, suggesting that these species are resilient to frequent complete loss of above-ground biomass. Our results suggest that short interval fires (5-15 years) of high severity will merely maintain the co-occurrence of dune fynbos and thicket vegetation by setting back thicket growth rather than causing large-scale mortality of thicket shrubs.

AB  - Coastal zones support the most productive marine ecosystems, yet they are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic stressors such as dredging. In this study, we investigated how seasonal variation and dredging activities conducted during the construction of a harbor and submarine base (Sepetiba Bay, RJ, Brazil) affected the phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages. The observed temporal variability at five different sites over 10 years revealed that dredging exceeds the expected influence of dry and rainy seasons on plankton abundance and diversity. In general, the abundance of both groups increased during dredging due to the resuspension of nutrients and benthic organisms. This increase was particularly evident in the dinoflagellate Scrippsiellaa cuminata, the diatoms Thalassiosira rotula and Nitzschia longissima, and the herbivorous zooplankton Acartia clausii and Pseudevadne tergestina. Moreover, season and dredging activities synergistically influenced plankton assemblages, resulting in larger seasonal variations during dredging activities. After the end of the harbor construction, plankton abundance decreased and remained low until the end of the monitoring, which may indicate persistent changes in the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of impacted areas.

AB  - Seasonal migration is a behavioral response to predictable variation in environmental resources, risks, and conditions. In behaviorally plastic migrants, migration is a conditional strategy that depends, in part, on an individual's informational state. The cognitive processes that underlie how facultative migrants understand and respond to their environment are not well understood. We compared perception of the present environment to memory and omniscience as competing cognitive mechanisms driving altitudinal migratory decisions in an endangered ungulate, the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) using 1,298 animal years of data, encompassing 460 unique individuals. We built a suite of statistical models to partition variation in fall migratory status explained by cognitive predictors, while controlling for non-cognitive drivers. To approximate attribute memory, we included lagged attributes of the range an individual experienced in the previous year. We quantified perception by limiting an individual's knowledge of migratory range to the area and attributes visible from its summer range, prior to migrating. Our results show that perception, in addition to the migratory propensity of an individual's social group, and an individual's migratory history are the best predictors of migration in our system. Our findings suggest that short-distance altitudinal migration is, in part, a response to an individual's perception of conditions on alterative winter range. In long-distance partial migrants, exploration of migratory decision-making has been limited, but it is unlikely that migratory decisions would be based on sensory cues from a remote target range. Differing cognitive mechanisms underpinning short and long-distance migratory decisions will result in differing levels of behavioral plasticity in response to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, with important implications for management and conservation of migratory species.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes can be sensitive to environmental fluctuations, which influence both availability of food resources and metabolic rate, and thus nutritional requirements. Impacts on herbivore nutritional ecology may result from seasonal variations in temperature and meteoceanographic shifts such as wind-induced upwelling events. We evaluated the effects of seasonal changes on the nutritional ecology of 3 nominally herbivorous fishes (Acanthurus chirurgus, Sparisoma axillare and Kyphosus vaigiensis) in a subtropical rocky reef on the southeastern Brazilian coast using a combination of gut content analysis (at 2 scales of magnification) and stable isotope analysis. Sampling of in situ water temperature covered both patterns of seasonal variation in sea surface temperature, and seasonal occurrence of upwelling. Local upwelling occurred throughout the year but less frequently in winter. Diet and isotopic niche displayed little seasonal variation. Species-specific patterns of seasonal variation indicated distinct responses to environmental fluctuations. Temperature alone cannot explain the locality-specific variation in the nutritional ecology of herbivorous reef fish, and contrary to predictions that digestion in herbivorous fishes is impaired by cooler temperatures, no significant shifts in species' nutritional ecology were detected.

AB  - AimPredicting climate driven species range shifts requires knowledge of mechanisms limiting species fitness under various climatic conditions. The traditional approach of modelling ranges of herbivorous insects by fitting environmental niche models to occurrence records is generally incapable of differentiating direct effects of climate on insect populations versus indirect effects acting on the range of their host plants. Here, we delimit the southern extent of a major forest defoliator, the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in North America, and investigate whether its range is limited directly by climate or indirectly by the range of its host trees.LocationEastern North America.MethodsWe use pheromone traps to survey populations; these are sensitive tools for detecting low-density populations. We applied mechanistic models of the effect of temperature on C. fumiferana fitness to evaluate whether these patterns of occurrence can be explained by the direct effect of climate.ResultsWe found that this insect species is widely present through most of the southern distribution of host spruce and fir species, both in the upper Mississippi River valley and the central and southern Appalachian Mountains. The species was present in ca. 50% of spruce-fir sites surveyed in the Appalachian Mountain region but was absent in the five most southerly sites where spruce and fir occur in eastern North America. Simulation using historical meteorological data indicated that all survey sites are climatically suitable for C. fumiferana.ConclusionsSimulation of climate effects, along with the species' absence from the most southern distribution of hosts, indicate that while the southern range limit of C. fumiferana is limited by host availability it is not directly constrained by climate. Furthermore, populations at the species' southern extent may be in a dynamic state of extinction and recolonisation, thus explaining at least the temporary absence of C. fumiferana from certain locations.

AB  - Whereas the impacts of N deposition on forest ecosystems have been well studied in remote areas in predominantly forested landscapes, we know relatively less about the impacts of N deposition on forests in heavily human-modified landscapes. We studied the influence of adjacent land use, local point sources, and woodlot stand structure on subcanopy N transport and enrichment via throughfall in three woodlot fragments in southern Lower Michigan, USA. We found that one site had markedly higher TF N concentrations compared to the other two; however, our data indicate that elevated TF concentrations resulted from differences in tree species composition, rather than differences in surrounding land use. Specifically, we observed that the local abundance of basswood (Tilia americana) was positively associated and the local abundance of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) was negatively associated with TF N concentrations. One site had markedly greater TF N fluxes compared to the other two, which was driven by a lack of understory vegetation, possibly due to higher deer browsing at this site. Together, the results of this study demonstrated that TF N concentrations and fluxes were more strongly influenced by the internal characteristics of fragmented woodlots, such as forest structure and species composition, than by the surrounding land use.

AB  - The trophic ecology of fourteen species of demersal fishes and six species of demersal decapod crustaceans from the continental slope and rise of the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea (SEMS) was examined using stable isotope analysis. Mean delta C-13 values among fish species varied by ca. 4.0 parts per thousand, from -20.85 parts per thousand (Macroramphosus scolopax) to -16.57 parts per thousand and -16.89 parts per thousand (Conger conger and Centrophorus granulosus), showing an enrichment in delta C-13 as a function of depth (200 - 1400 m). Mean delta C-13 values of the crustaceans showed smaller variation, between -18.54 parts per thousand (Aristeus antennatus) and -16.38 parts per thousand (Polycheles typhiops). This suggests a shift from pelagic to regenerated benthic carbon sources with depth. Benthic carbon regeneration is further supported by the low benthic-pelagic POM-delta C-13 values, averaging -24.7 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand, and the mixing model results, presenting relatively low contribution of epipelagic POM to the deep-sea fauna. Mean delta N-1(5) values of fish and crustacean species ranged 7.91 +/- 0.36 parts per thousand to 11.36 +/- 0.39 parts per thousand and 5.96 +/- 0.24 parts per thousand to 7.73 +/- 0.46 parts per thousand, respectively, resulting in trophic position estimates, occupying the third and the fourth trophic levels. Thus, despite the proximity to the more productive areas of the shelf, low number of trophic levels (TL similar to 1 .0) and narrow isotopic niche breadths (SEA(c)<1) were observed for demersal crustaceans (TL = 2.94 +/- 0.18) and fishes (TL = 3.62 +/- 0.31) in the study area - probably due to the ultra-oligotrophic state of the SEMS resulting in limited carbon sources. Our results, which provide the first trophic description of deep-sea megafauna in the SEMS, offer insight into the carbon sources and food web structure of deep-sea ecosystems in oligotrophic marginal seas, and can be further used in ecological modeling and support the sustainable management of marine resources in the deep Levantine Sea.

AB  - Invasive mammalian species, which can pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, are one of the most problematic threats for the protection worldwide. In the Czech Republic, nutria (Myocastor coypus) is one of the most problematic due to localized damage to agricultural crops and negative impact to riparian ecosystem vegetation. At present, however, there is no methodology available to systematically monitor nutria population density, distribution and new habitat colonization. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a methodology for the accurate determination of nutria abundance that should allow the identification of risk areas and more effective control of agricultural damage. The proposed pilot methodology is based on a combination of direct counting using thermal cameras, indirect verification of residence signs and activity assessment by camera traps. Results from selected locality of interest in Central Bohemia and a control site indicated high nutria abundance, with highest mean abundance recorded along rivers (22.14 ind./km; 95% CI: 0-44.78) and streams (11.90 ind./km; 95% CI: 3.09-20.71), with lower abundance around other water bodies (6.24 ind./km; 95% CI: 0-16.53) and drainage canals (4.64 ind./km; 95% CI: 0.68-8.60).

AB  - 1. While transect walks have long been the preferred monitoring method for many flying insect taxa, malaise traps combined with DNA metabarcoding have gained growing prominence. However, it remains unclear whether both methods reveal comparable species richness and the same ecological drivers along environmental gradients.
   2. We selected three groups of pollinators (wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies) and one group of herbivores (grasshoppers) as functionally important and conservation-relevant model groups, comparing results of both methods along an elevational gradient in the German Alps.
   3. Across the study region, both methods detected a similarly high species richness of pollinators with similar to 50% overlap of species pools, but transect walks revealed more species per site, especially in higher elevations and under low temperatures. Body size spectra differed between methods, with on average more large butterfly and more small bee species in transect walks. Nevertheless, temperature and flower richness were consistent drivers of pollinator richness, independent of the sampling method. Grasshopper richness from transect walks was considerably higher than from malaise traps. Both methods identified temperature and only malaise traps also identified management as drivers of grasshopper richness.
   4. We conclude that malaise traps are principally suitable substitutes for the more time-consuming pollinator transect walks. However, the effectiveness of these passive traps is more susceptible to changes in sampling temperature, and in some pollinator groups, body size classes are presented differently, which is important to consider during analyses. For grasshoppers, transect walks appear to be more suitable to assess species richness, as considerably more species can be monitored.

AB  - In a fast-changing world, understanding how organisms adapt to their environment is a pressing necessity. Research has focused on genetic adaptation, while our understanding of non-genetic modes is still in its infancy. The host-associated microbiome can be considered a non-genetic mode of adaptation, which can strongly influence an organism's ability to cope with its environment. However, the role of the microbiome in host ecological dynamics is largely unexplored, particularly in animal communities. Here, we discuss the following hypothesis: invasive species may rapidly adapt to local conditions by adopting beneficial microbes from similar co-occurring native species. This occurs when the invader's fitness is influenced by adaptation to local conditions that is facilitated by microbes acquired from native microbiomes. We present a minimal mathematical model to explore this hypothesis and show that a delayed acquisition of native microbes may explain the occurrence of an invasion lag. Overall, our results contribute to broadening the conceptualization of rapid adaptation via microbiome transfer and offer insights towards designing early intervention strategies for invasive species management.

AB  - The natural enemies hypothesis predicts that the abundance and diversity of antagonists such as predators and parasitoids of herbivores increases with the diversity of plants, which can lead to more effective top-down control of insect herbivores. However, although the hypothesis has received large support in agricultural systems, fewer studies have been conducted in forest ecosystems and a comprehensive synthesis of previous research is still lacking.
   We conducted a meta-analysis of 65 publications comparing the diversity, abundance or activity of various groups of natural enemies (including birds, bats, spiders and insect parasitoids) in pure vs. mixed forest stands. We tested the effects of forest biome, natural enemy taxon and type of study (managed vs experimental forest).
   We found a significant positive effect of forest tree diversity on natural enemy abundance and diversity but not on their activity. The effect of tree diversity on natural enemies was stronger towards lower latitudes but was not contingent on the natural enemy taxon level.
   Overall, our study contributes toward a better understanding of the "natural enemies hypothesis" in forest systems and provides new insights about the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, we outline potential avenues for strengthening forest resistance to the growing threat of herbivorous insects. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft far Okologie.

AB  - Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. are fire-driven. Frequent prescribed fire or lack thereof through shifts in fire regimes may have consequences for tree health and associated herbivorous subcortical beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Yet, interactions between these ecologically and economically important beetles and prescribed fire in the southeastern U.S. are not well documented. We assessed the effects of various fire regimes, specifically of frequent fire, fire exclusion, and fire reintroduction, on bark and root-feeding beetles in mature longleaf pine stands in two edaphic types (mesic and xeric) in southwestern Georgia. We employed an information theoretic statistical approach to determine the effects of site conditions, as defined by both soil properties and stand structure, and prescribed burning on trap catches of subcortical beetles by species. We trapped a total of 141,611 beetles, indicating that subcortical beetles are abundant in this ecosystem. While the highest trap catches for three Ips beetle species were in the xeric fire-exclusion treatment, catches of I. grandicollis (Eichhoff) were similar at both sites for the fire-exclusion treatment. For the fire-exclusion treatment, I. avulsus (Eichhoff) and I. calligraphus (Germar) catches were 2-10 times higher at the xeric than mesic sites. Orthotomicus caelatus (Eichhoff) and Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) catches were 1.1-2.4 times higher in frequent-fire than fire-exclusion treatments. Root-feeding weevils, Pachylobius picivorus (Germar) and Hylobius pales (Herbst), exhibited opposite trends with catches higher and lower in burned treatments, respectively. Ips calligraphus were positively associated with percent basal area of understory trees, indicating this species may benefit from fire exclusion. Ips avulsus catches were negatively correlated with total basal area, suggesting this species may benefit from more open habitats like those facilitated by frequent fire. We conclude that both soil properties and stand conditions interact with the fire regime to differentially affect the catches of southeastern bark and root-feeding beetle species in a longleaf pine ecosystem.

AB  - The numbers of visitors to greenspaces in the United Kingdom has increased over the last few years as the health benefits of spending time in greenspaces have become better known. This has led to problems for conservation ecologists due to increased numbers of reported human-wildlife encounters. Deer are often found in public spaces and are of particular concern. Previous research suggests elevated levels of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) in deer is a result of increased human activity. This has been linked to several negative effects on the deer's health. From a practitioner's point of view, it is therefore important to implement effective management strategies that are based on scientific evidence to help ensure the welfare of managed deer populations. In an effort to identify the impact of visitor numbers on faecal cortisol concentrations, samples from 2 red deer (Cervus elaplus) herds in Lyme Park (Cheshire), United Kingdom, were collected and analysed. A predictive spatial model was developed based on logistic regression to identify areas within the park of low and high human-deer encounter probability. The faecal cortisol levels were found to be significantly higher on days with a high number of visitors. In addition, landscape features such as buildings and roads increased the probability of human-deer encounters, whereas woodland and scrub decreased the probability. However, human-deer encounter probability changed with distance to the features. By providing local park managers with this scientific data, these findings can directly inform current management efforts to reduce deer stress levels in Lyme Park. In addition, the spatial modelling method has the capacity to be implemented in other parks across the country with minimal cost and effort.

AB  - Increasing abundance of large ungulates is raising human-wildlife impacts and the effectiveness of recreational hunting to reduce their population growth is increasingly questioned. We report on long-term trends (> 15 years) in wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) and hunting bags, and on associations between the annual growth rate of WVC and that of hunting bags for three ungulates - the wild boar, the red deer, and the roe deer - and the grey wolf in northwest Spain to evaluate the regulating capacity of recreational hunting at large spatial scale. Wildlife-vehicle collisions increased by 332% in 16 years and 91% of all traffic accidents were caused by collisions with these three ungulates. All ungulate species showed significant positive trends in WVC and hunting bags, but we did not observe a negative association between annual growth rate of hunting bags and that of WVC except for the wild boar. Results suggest that recreational hunting was unable to reduce ungulate population growth at the regional scale. There was no upward trend of vehicle collisions with wolves over the study period, possibly reflecting stable wolf populations. Natural mortality due to predation could be promoted through the protection of apex predators, but the lethal management of apex predators, often based on sociopolitical pressures rather than damage levels, can conflict with the strategy for mitigating ungulate impacts. Ungulate management needs to be reconsidered from an ecological perspective that integrates human management measures, including recreational hunting, based on the population dynamics and the recovery of predator-prey interactions by favoring the expansion of apex predators.

AB  - Holistically managed urban greenspaces have human and ecological benefits. Butterflies and skippers (Papilionoidea) are particularly sensitive to human impacts and changing environmental conditions and can serve as model organisms for park management. We monitored butterflies across 18 urban parks in Cincinnati, Ohio, to explore the relationship between the amount of forested and non-forested microhabitat and Papilionoidea biodiversity. Transect counts were used to assess Papilionoidea occurrence throughout the summer of 2021. Species richness was found to significantly increase with the amount of non-forested area, while no relationships were found between forested species richness and area or total species richness and total park area. In addition to providing suggestions for urban park microhabitat management, this study updates the species checklist for Hamilton County, Ohio, adding four species. Forty-three species and 433 individuals were sighted during the study. Three species found in Cincinnati Parks were under Ohio Department of Natural Resources conservation status.

AB  - One of the main challenges of outdoor pig production systems is their potential environmental impact due to direct deposition of pigs? excreta on the land that can lead to nitrate leaching. However, plants can recycle nutrients, and a sufficient vegetation cover can mitigate adverse environmental impacts of outdoor pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of concentrate feed restriction on gestating sows foraging behaviour and ensuing damages caused to vegetation cover in a pasture-based system. Ten groups of three sows were randomly assigned to two concentrate feed levels, supplying either 90 % (P90) or 40 % (P40) of metabolizable energy requirements, from week 5 of gestation until farrowing. All groups of sows were housed at a density of 8 sows/ha in a rotational pasture system including a permanent area and three 25 ? 50-m legume-grass pasture plots, which could be accessed in rotation for periods of 2?3 weeks. Posture and location of sows were assessed at weeks 8?9, 12?13 and 15 of gestation using data loggers. During the same weeks, video recordings were made when the sows were at pasture, in order to determine their time spent foraging. Vegetation cover of pasture plots was determined at the beginning and end of the grazing periods using a method based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-acquired image processing. In the second half of gestation, P40 sows spent 60 % more time active on pasture than P90 sows during the daytime (P < 0.01). The feeding level did not influence the number of daily visits to pasture plots, but P40 sows spent more time on pasture and travelled longer distances per visit than P90 sows. While at pasture, P90 sows spent more time rooting (P < 0.001) and less time grazing (P = 0.002) than P40 sows. In pasture plots with P90 sows, an increasing proportion of bare soil was observed over time, whereas in P40 plots, a greater proportion of high vegetation was replaced by medium vegetation. These results indicate that a higher concentrate restriction promoted grazing behaviour in pregnant sows, leading to greater disappearance of high vegetation but not to greater vegetation cover destruction. In contrast, the lower concentrate restriction increased the proportion of rooting activity, leading to greater damage to vegetation cover. In conclusion, this study has shown that concentrate feeding level of gestating sows on pasture can be reduced without adverse effects on pasture vegetation cover.

AB  - Mixed mountain forests consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) are among the most productive and stable forest ecosystems in Europe. Their southeasternmost geographical distribution range is located in the Western Rhodopes, where they have high economic, recreational, and ecological value. In the past, shelterwood cuttings dominated forest management practices in these forests and were mainly aimed at maintaining and reproducing conifers. During the past two decades, single-tree and group-tree selection systems have been promoted as alternative management approaches to support the conversion of spruce-dominated stands to close-to-nature mixed forests of fir, beech, and spruce. However, the natural regeneration dynamics in these stands are barely known, and their dependence on microsite and management effects needs to be better understood. The objective of this study was to investigate ecological factors under management regimes of different intensity ("single-tree"-selection and "group-tree"-selection) that influence the regeneration processes in mixed mountain forests in the Bulgarian Rhodopes. Data on regeneration and microsite conditions were collected on 105 systematically distributed plots (25 m(2)/100 m(2)) in four 100-120 years old stands located in the regional forest district of Smoljan, Bulgaria (1580-1650 m a.s.l.). We relied on generalizeds linear mixed models to analyse for each species the (1) size-dependent regeneration density and (2) height increment in dependence on management practices, competing vegetation, as well as soil and light conditions. Our study revealed an overall high potential for recruitment in the Western Rhodopes. Regeneration density was highest in fir (median 12800 N ha-1), followed by spruce (median 1600 N ha-1) and beech (median 1200 N ha-1). Fir benefited most from "single-tree" selection cuttings, while "group-tree" selection cutting tended to promote beech and fir but also spruce. Competing ground vegetation was detrimental for seedling density of all species. Annual height increment increased with plant size, was lowest in spruce, and similar in fir and beech. Sapling increment was driven by light, whereas seedlings did not react to increased radiation. Browsing was species-specific and was highest in beech (15-30 %), followed by fir (5-10 %) and spruce (<1 %). It was not a crucial factor in impeding tree recruitment. We conclude that frequent harvest activities of low intensity which consider advanced regeneration are a promising approach to successfully convert the formerly spruce-firdominated forests to climate-adapted fir-beech-(spruce)-mixed stands.

AB  - Predicting how increasing temperatures interact with other global change drivers to influence the structure and dynamics of Earth's ecosystems is a primary challenge in ecology. Our study made use of multiple simultaneous "natural experiments" to examine how rapid warming, declining nutrients, invasive consumers, and riparian invasive species management interact to influence leaf decomposition in a large and regulated river. Specifically, we compared the breakdown of cottonwood (Populus fremontii), willow (Salix exigua), and saltcedar (Tamarix sp.) leaf litter in 2022 to a previous experiment from 1998 that occurred under much cooler water temperatures, and had higher water phosphorus concentrations, low numbers of invasive New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), and unaltered litter chemistry from the herbivory of saltcedar leaf beetles (Diorhabda carinulata). We found that the effects of up to 10 degrees C warmer temperatures on leaf decomposition were mediated by the establishment and management of invasive species and declining water nutrient concentrations arising from upstream reservoir lowering. Such interactions led to accelerated breakdown of saltcedar, but relatively minor effects of warming on the rate of cottonwood and willow decomposition. Additionally, our results demonstrate the potential for favorable invasive species management outcomes in the terrestrial environment to produce unintended responses in adjacent freshwater ecosystems. As temperatures continue to rise, it is critical that future studies consider how warming interacts with multiple stressors and environmental factors to influence processes such as decomposition in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The conservation of the genetic diversity of the European bison population is carried out mainly in ex situ herds, constituting a functional metapopulation. The breeders have to balance between the available capacity of the reserves and the need to enrich the free and semi-free herds with appropriate individuals. If there are limitations (e.g., financial) in the transfer of individuals, breeders report a problem of surplus individuals. The aim of this study was to estimate the migration parameters in the wisent metapopulation ex situ to maintain genetic diversity in hypothetical herds. The analysis was a two-step process. The first part of this study was carried out between the years 1998 and 2017, based on information from the European Bison Pedigree Book about eight selected herds. The average annual share of exported and imported individuals in the chosen metapopulation were calculated (8.81% (SD: 11.51) and 0.75% (SD: 2.15), respectively). The proportion of males to females among the exported animals was close to 1:1. The sex ratio of imported animals was close to 2:1 (M:F). The majority of transports were exports of animals (92.1%). The share of individuals exported from different age-sex groups was calculated. On this basis, in the second part of the study, the proportion of exported surplus individuals in the smallest hypothetical herd was established as 5.89% of the adult females, or 8.98% of adult males, or 32.70% of females aged 1-3 years. In order to maintain the genetic sustainability of hypothetical herds it is crucial to import individuals (M/F: 1/1; interval: 10 years). The results of this study will provide necessary information to determine the tools of wisent population management in the enclosure.

AB  - Although many plants are dispersed by wind and seeds can travel long distances across unsuitable matrix areas, a large proportion relies on co-evolved zoochorous seed dispersal to connect populations in isolated habitat islands. Particularly in agricultural landscapes, where remaining habitat patches are often very small and highly isolated, mobile linkers as zoochorous seed dispersers are critical for the population dynamics of numerous plant species. However, knowledge about the quali- or quantification of such mobile link processes, especially in agricultural landscapes, is still limited. In a controlled feeding experiment, we recorded the seed intake and germination success after complete digestion by the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and explored its mobile link potential as an endozoochoric seed disperser. Utilizing a suite of common, rare, and potentially invasive plant species, we disentangled the effects of seed morphological traits on germination success while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. Further, we measured the landscape connectivity via hares in two contrasting agricultural landscapes (simple: few natural and semi-natural structures, large fields; complex: high amount of natural and semi-natural structures, small fields) using GPS-based movement data. With 34,710 seeds of 44 plant species fed, one of 200 seeds (0.51%) with seedlings of 33 species germinated from feces. Germination after complete digestion was positively related to denser seeds with comparatively small surface area and a relatively slender and elongated shape, suggesting that, for hares, the most critical seed characteristics for successful endozoochorous seed dispersal minimize exposure of the seed to the stomach and the associated digestive system. Furthermore, we could show that a hare's retention time is long enough to interconnect different habitats, especially grasslands and fields. Thus, besides other seed dispersal mechanisms, this most likely allows hares to act as effective mobile linkers contributing to ecosystem stability in times of agricultural intensification, not only in complex but also in simple landscapes.

AB  - Kelp forests are critical marine ecosystems that provide habitat and ecological services, as well as economic benefits. However, kelp forests worldwide are facing multiple pressures, including climate change and human activities. In this study, we investigated whether recruitment success, an infrequently recorded variable in kelp monitoring studies, was affected in degraded kelp reefs where adult golden kelps ( Laminaria ochroleuca ) were persistently absent due to fish consumption. We conducted a three-year seasonal monitoring of kelp recruits and juveniles in both healthy and degraded kelp reefs in northwest Spain. Our findings reveal a decline in spring kelp recruitment over time on degraded reefs, while it remained stable on healthy reefs. The results indicate that continued herbivory pressure can decrease kelp recruitment, suggesting the potential exhaustion of kelp stand resilience. Altogether, our study highlights the importance of biotic interactions, such as herbivory, in understanding changes in kelp forest dynamics. Moreover, it emphasizes the significance of including recruitment in kelp forest assessments as an indicator of resilience.

AB  - Non-native organisms have invaded novel ecosystems for centuries, yet we have only a limited understanding of why their impacts vary widely from minor to severe. Predicting the impact of non-established or newly detected species could help focus biosecurity measures on species with the highest potential to cause widespread damage. However, predictive models require an understanding of potential drivers of impact and the appropriate level at which these drivers should be evaluated. Here, we used non-native, specialist herbivorous insects of forest ecosystems to test which factors drive impact and if there were differences based on whether they used woody angiosperms or conifers as hosts. We identified convergent and divergent patterns between the two host types indicating fundamental similarities and differences in their interactions with non-native insects. Evolutionary divergence time between native and novel hosts was a significant driver of insect impact for both host types but was modulated by different factors in the two systems. Beetles in the subfamily Scolytinae posed the highest risk to woody angiosperms, and different host traits influenced impact of specialists on conifers and woody angiosperms. Tree wood density was a significant predictor of host impact for woody angiosperms with intermediate densities (0.5-0.6 mg/mm(3)) associated with highest risk, whereas risk of impact was highest for conifers that coupled shade tolerance with drought intolerance. These results underscore the importance of identifying the relevant levels of biological organization and ecological interactions needed to develop accurate risk models for species that may arrive in novel ecosystems.

AB  - Novel approaches to quantifying density and distributions could help biologists adaptively manage wildlife populations, particularly if methods are accurate, consistent, cost-effective, rapid, and sensitive to change. Such approaches may also improve research on interactions between density and processes of interest, such as disease transmission across multiple populations. We assess how satellite imagery, unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery, and Global Positioning System (GPS) collar data vary in characterizing elk density, distribution, and count patterns across times with and without supplemental feeding at the National Elk Refuge (NER) in the US state of Wyoming. We also present the first comparison of satellite imagery data with traditional counts for ungulates in a temperate system. We further evaluate seven different aggregation metrics to identify the most consistent and sensitive metrics for comparing density and distribution across time and populations. All three data sources detected higher densities and aggregation locations of elk during supplemental feeding than non-feeding at the NER. Kernel density estimates (KDEs), KDE polygon areas, and the first quantile of interelk distances detected differences with the highest sensitivity and were most highly correlated across data sources. Both UAS and satellite imagery provide snapshots of density and distribution patterns of most animals in the area at lower cost than GPS collars. While satellite-based counts were lower than traditional counts, aggregation metrics matched those from UAS and GPS data sources when animals appeared in high contrast to the landscape, including brown elk against new snow in open areas. UAS counts of elk were similar to traditional ground-based counts on feed grounds and are the best data source for assessing changes in small spatial extents. Satellite, UAS, or GPS data can provide appropriate data for assessing density and changes in density from adaptive management actions. For the NER, where high elk densities are beneath controlled airspace, GPS collar data will be most useful for evaluating how management actions, including changes in the dates of supplemental feeding, influence elk density and aggregation across large spatial extents. Using consistent and sensitive measures of density may improve research on the drivers and effects of density within and across a wide range of species.

AB  - Colonisation of decaying leaves fallen from mangrove trees by bacteria and fungi is thought to play an important role at the base of food webs in most tropical estuaries. Compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) has enabled the previously difficult methodological task of measuring plant, bacterial and fungal energy flows to food webs. Here, we assessed the biosynthetic origins of amino acids at the base of a mangrove food web using the CSIA-AA approach. Trophic positions of the 2 most common mangrove fauna-fiddler crabs and sesarmid crabs-estimated from nitrogen isotopes in phenylalanine and glutamic acid approached 2, suggesting that these species are herbivores rather than microbivores. Consistent with this finding, carbon isotope fingerprints in AAs did not support the importance of essential AAs derived from fungi and bacteria but rather suggested the importance of those originating from plants, especially microalgae. These results suggest that (1) microbial mineralization of decaying leaves supports the production of more easily assimilated microalgae and (2) bacteria and fungi, as intermediates, also routinely incorporate plant-derived AAs into their biomass.

AB  - Gray wolf Canis lupus predation on domestic dogs Canis familiaris is a considerable wolf-human conflict issue in several regions of Europe and North America but it has not been well documented in the scientific literature. Livestock depredations by wolves may be related to the abundance of wild prey. Regardless of the presumed motivations of wolves for attacking dogs (likely due to interference competition and predation), the abundance of wild prey populations may also influence the risk of wolf attacks on dogs. We examined whether the annual number of fatal attacks by wolves on dogs was related to the abundance of primary prey, including wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Estonia, as well as the abundance of moose Alces alces in Finland. Statistical models resulted in significant negative relationships, thus providing evidence that the risk of attacks in both house yards (Estonia) and hunting situations (Finland) was highest when the density of wild prey was low. Wild ungulates cause damage to agriculture and forestry, but they seem to mitigate conflicts between wolves and humans; therefore, it is necessary to develop a holistic, multispecies management approach in which the importance of wild ungulates for large carnivore conservation is addressed.

AB  - Environmental change is expected to alter trophic interactions and food web dynamics with consequences for ecosystem structure, function and stability. However, the mechanisms by which environmental change influences top-down and bottom-up processes are poorly documented. Here, we examined how environmental change caused by shrub encroachment affects trophic interactions in a dryland. The predator-prey system included an apex canid predator (coyote; Canis latrans), an intermediate canid predator (kit fox; Vulpes macrotis), and two herbivorous lagomorph prey (black-tailed jackrabbit, Lepus californicus; and desert cottontail, Sylvilagus audubonii) in the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico, USA. We evaluated alternative hypotheses for how shrub encroachment could affect habitat use and trophic interactions, including (i) modifying bottom-up processes by reducing herbaceous forage, (ii) modifying top-down processes by changing canid space use or the landscape of fear experienced by lagomorph prey and (iii) altering intraguild interactions between the dominant coyote and the intermediate kit fox. We used 7 years of camera trap data collected across grassland-to-shrubland gradients under variable precipitation to test our a priori hypotheses within a structural equation modelling framework. Lagomorph prey responded strongly to bottom-up pulses during years of high summer precipitation, but only at sites with moderate to high shrub cover. This outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis that bottom-up effects should be strongest in grasslands because of greater herbaceous food resources. Instead, this interaction likely reflects changes in the landscape of fear because perceived predation risk in lagomorphs is reduced in shrub-dominated habitats. Shrub encroachment did not directly affect predation pressure on lagomorphs by changing canid site use intensity. However, site use intensity of both canid species was positively associated with jackrabbits, indicating additional bottom-up effects. Finally, we detected interactions between predators in which coyotes restricted space use of kit foxes, but these intraguild interactions also depended on shrub encroachment. Our findings demonstrate how environmental change can affect trophic interactions beyond traditional top-down and bottom-up processes by altering perceived predation risk in prey. These results have implications for understanding spatial patterns of herbivory and the feedbacks that reinforce shrubland states in drylands worldwide.
   Our study on canid-lagomorph dynamics provides valuable insights into the underappreciated role that perceived predation risk plays in mediating herbivore responses to climate and environmental change in drylands.image

AB  - Temperatures in the southwest South Atlantic Ocean have increased over recent decades due to changes in Brazil's Current dynamics affecting marine ecosystems. However, the effects of ocean warming on demersal fauna in the region are poorly understood. Here, we analyse megafauna species composition, and changes in biomass of species with warm- and cold-water affinities for 29,021 commercial demersal catches landed in the harbours of Santa Catarina state, Brazil, between 2000 and 2019. We find evidence of megafauna tropicalization in the Brazilian Meridional Margin during this period. The mean temperature of catches has increased sharply since 2013, with the averaged optimal temperature preferences of all species in commercial catches in one year increasing at a rate of 0.41 degrees C yr(-1). These changes in the mean temperature of the catch correlate well with model-based bottom water temperatures (with 0 and 1-year time-lag) and transport volumes of the Brazil Current (with 3 and 4-year time-lag).

AB  - Climate change, land use conversion and human population growth are reducing and fragmenting historical ranges of large animals, especially in Africa. Particularly, land conversion to agriculture is leading to coexistence challenges between humans and elephants. In this study we investigated the factors affecting the intensity of elephant crop damage in the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor (Tanzania). We also predicted future conflicts (crop damage intensity) for different land management (crop types) and water scarcity (drought) scenarios using model averaging. Our results show that intensity of elephant damage (proportion of area damaged in an individual farm as a percentage) increased with crop palatability and land use conversion in the last similar to 30 years, particularly deforestation. Conversely, the intensity of elephant damage decreased with increasing human activity (higher proportion of settlements and farmland), and distance to waterbodies. Most farms affected by elephants (65 %) were at short distances (< 250 m) from waterbodies. We also predicted a significant increase of elephant crop damage intensity from 17 % when the farm is covered with no palatable crops, to 54 % and 63 % when palatable crops covered 50 % and 100 % of the farmland, respectively. For the predicted water stress scenario in which all small seasonal waterbodies would dry off, we predicted a 46 % reduction in the total area of farmland susceptible to damage although we expect an increase in human-wildlife competition for water. We conclude that land use changes and water availability strongly affect elephant crop damage. We hope these results contribute to the development and better implementation of management strategies that enhance long-term peaceful coexistence between humans and elephants.

AB  - We examined the effects of phosphorus (P) on algal biomass and stoichiometry and, subsequently, alterations to zooplankton populations. We modified P supply in microcosms and tracked changes in algal and Daphnia populations, and phosphorus concentrations. Even though we found algal biomass increased over the experiment in low P containers, greater food abundance did not increase Daphnia abundance. In low P containers, a high algal biomass was accompanied with elevated C:P ratios, very low soluble reactive P concentrations and low Daphnia fecundity. High algal C:P ratios and low soluble reactive P concentrations in these microcosms indicated a strong P-limitation of algae and food quality constraints on consumer populations. In high P containers, algal biomass initially increased, which led to an increased Daphnia abundance. In most of the high P microcosms, rapid increases in Daphnia populations led to reduced algal biomass and increased concentrations of soluble reactive P. However, in an outlier high P container, we found a different pattern with elevated algal biomass, low soluble reactive P concentrations and a very large Daphnia population. Our results show that P supplies can strongly affect Daphnia-algae interactions, but the nature of these effects are likely complicated by internal feedbacks that affect the gain and loss of both populations.

AB  - BackgroundHistorically, the Andean people have experienced uncertainty in terms of the availability of food resources because of climatic and ecological variations that are typical of mountainous environments. Risk management strategies, including the diversified and complementary use and management of species and ecosystems at different elevations, have faced such uncertainty. The current effects of climate change on food security motivate studies on subsistence adaptative strategies. TEK offers extraordinary experience and local biocultural memory to meet present and future needs. From an ethnoecological perspective, we aim to identify the variety of local foods in Andean communities, their cultural and nutritional value for local people, their use frequencies, and their forms to obtain them from different environments, productive systems, and interchanges. We expected to identify traditional Andean diversified subsistence patterns despite the pressure of modern food and interchange systems.MethodsThis study was conducted in two communities in the highlands of the Department of Hu & aacute;nuco, Peru. We conducted 24 semistructured interviews with households sampled through the snowball method. We asked about their daily life food, plant and animal components of diet, frequencies and seasons in which they are consumed, and ways to obtain them. We complemented the information through ethnobotanical collection of wild, weedy, and ruderal edible plants and records on domestic and wild animals included in the diet.ResultsWe recorded 37 crop species, 13 domestic animals, 151 wild, weedy, and ruderal food plant species, the 3 most commonly consumed wild animals, and 52 processed products obtained from local stores and markets. The main crops are potato and maize, while the main domestic animals included in the diet are cattle, pigs, and sheep. Rice, pasta, and bread are the main raw and processed foods included in the diet. Crops represent nearly half of the food consumed and purchased (in kg/year), and tubers and cereals provide most of the kilocalories, carbohydrates and proteins. Wild, weedy, and ruderal plants are consumed in relatively low amounts and at relatively low frequencies per species, but overall, they constitute a significant proportion of the kg of annually consumed food (14.4% in Cani and 9.6% in Monte Azul). Knowledge and use of these resources play a key role in local cuisine and nutrition.ConclusionThe current food patterns studied are based on diverse diets, including multiple feedstuffs, sources, and practices to obtain them, which reflects the traditional Andean subsistence pattern. The increasing adoption of processed food has influenced the declining consumption of local food, mainly among young people. Communication and policies to promote local food, emphasizing the role of wild plants and their adequate consumption, and provide information on their nutritional value are recommended to support efforts toward food sovereignty and conservation of Andean biocultural diversity.

AB  - ContextThere are no estimations of herbivory baselines in Spain. Due to the bioclimatic conditions, ungulates have maintained Open Ecosystems until the Holocene. Pastoral tradition later fulfilled the niche of wild grazers, but this role is not considered in environmental assessments of grazing livestock.ObjectivesWe attempted to better understand the scale of herbivory in Spain. We aimed to estimate the weight of current wild herbivory and evaluate the role of domestic herbivory in these baselines. We applied them to improve the allocation of environmental impacts and emissions from grazing livestock.MethodsWe inferred an equation relating Net Primary Productivity (NPP) with ungulate biomass and enteric CH4 with data from 11 Spanish Protected Areas. We estimated theoretical baselines in Spain using other literature sources. We applied the equations to the Spanish open ecosystems that are currently grazable. We also estimated the proportion of grazing livestock that would be part of such baseline.ResultsWe found relationships between NPP and ungulate biomass and enteric CH4 emissions. However, current abundances are several times below the estimated baselines and the carrying capacity. There are major constraints for herbivore populations to reach their baseline state, particularly the absence of migration and the extinction of grazers among wild herbivores. Structural maintenance of Open Ecosystems should therefore be complemented by domestic grazers that cannot be replaced by the extant wild, mostly browser, ungulates.ConclusionsWe concluded that Spain is widely susceptible to being populated by herbivores that generate Open Ecosystems as baseline landscapes. Current grazing livestock accounts for a significant part of them, so baselines must be included in their environmental assessments. For the case of Spain, we propose a minimum baseline equivalent to 36% of current grazing livestock biomass and 23% of their enteric CH4 emissions.

AB  - Prevention of non-native species introductions and establishment is essential to avoid adverse impacts of invasive species in marine environments. To identify potential new invasive species and inform non-native species management options for the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas), 138 marine species were risk screened for current and future climate conditions using the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit. Species were risk-ranked as low, medium, high, and very high risk based on separate (calibrated) thresholds for fishes, tunicates, and invertebrates. In the basic screening, 15 fishes, two tunicates, and 26 invertebrates were classified as high or very high risk under current climate conditions. Whereas, under future climate conditions, 16 fishes, three tunicates, and 33 invertebrates were classified as high or very high risk. Very high risk species included: California scorpionfish Scorpaena guttata, red scorpionfish Scorpaena scrofa, purple whelk Rapana venosa, and Santo Domingo false mussel Mytilopsis sallei under both current and future climates, with weedy scorpionfish Rhinopias frondosa, Papuan scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis papuensis, daggertooth pike conger Muraenesox cinereus, yellowfin scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis neglecta, tassled scorpionfish Scorpaenopsis oxycephalus, brush-clawed shore crab Hemigrapsus takanoi, honeycomb oyster Hyotissa hyotis, carinate rock shell Indothais lacera, and Asian green mussel Perna viridis under climate change conditions only. This study provides evidence to inform trans-boundary management plans across the five Gulf of Mexico states to prevent, detect, and respond rapidly to new species arrivals.

AB  - Sleeper populations of non-native species can remain at low abundance for decades before irrupting. For over a century, fallow deer (Dama dama) in the island state of Tasmania, Australia, remained at low abundance and close to the region in which they were released. Recently, there are indications the population has increased in abundance and distribution. Here, we spatially quantify the population change using a time series of annual spotlight counts from 1985 to 2019 (up to 172 transects annually, totalling of 5756 transect counts). Next, we predict the potential for further range expansion, using global occurrences to characterise the species' climatic niche, and remote-camera surveys (3225 camera sites) to model fine-grained habitat suitability. Spotlight counts of fallow deer increased by 11.5% annually, resulting in a 40-fold increase from 1985 to 2019. The core distribution increased 2.9-fold during this 35-year period, and now spans c. 27% of Tasmania's land area. Satellite populations have established in locations where farmed deer have escaped or been released, suggesting that humans have facilitated range expansion via new introduction events. Based on climate and habitat suitability, our models predict that 56% of Tasmania is suitable under the current climate. This suggests range expansion is likely to continue unless the population is actively managed, which could include the eradication of satellite populations and containment of core populations. This case study cautions that despite over a century of slow population growth, sleeper populations of non-native species can abruptly increase.

AB  - Background The ability to automatically count animals is important to design appropriate environmental policies and to monitor their populations in relation to biodiversity and maintain balance among species. Out of all living mammals on Earth, 60% are livestock, 36% humans, and only 4% are animals that live in the wild. In a relatively short period, development of human civilization caused a loss of 83% of wildlife and 50% of plants. The rate of species extinction is accelerating. Traditional wildlife surveys provide rough population estimates. However, emerging technologies, such as aerial photography, allow to perform large-scale surveys in a short period of time with high accuracy. In this paper, we propose the use of computer vision, through deep learning (DL) architecture, together with aerial photography and density maps, to count the population of Steller sea lions and African elephants with high precision. Results We have trained two deep learning models, a basic UNet without any feature extractor (Model-1) and another with the EfficientNet-B5 feature extractor (Model-2). We measured the model's prediction accuracy, using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the predicted and actual animal count. The results showed an RMSE of 1.88 and 0.60 to count Steller sea lions and African elephants, respectively, regardless of complex background, different illumination conditions, heavy overlapping and occlusion of the animals. Conclusions Our proposed solution performed very well in the counting prediction problem, with relatively low training parameters and minimum annotation. The approach adopted, combining DL and density maps, provided better results than state-of-art deep learning models used for counting, indicating that the proposed method has the potential to be used more widely in large-scale wildlife surveying projects and initiatives.

AB  - Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), circulates in multi-host mammal communities. While interactions between different host species are mainly indirect, current knowledge postulates interspecific transmission is favored by animal contact with natural substrates contaminated with droplets and fluids from infected animals. However, methodological constraints have severely hampered monitoring of MTBC outside its hosts and the subsequent validation of this hypothesis. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the extent to which environmental contamination with M. bovis occurs in an endemic animal TB setting, taking advantage of a new real-time monitoring tool we recently developed to quantify the proportion of viable and dormant MTBC cell fractions in environmental matrices. Sixty-five natural substrates were collected nearby the International Tagus Natural Park region, in the epidemiological TB risk area in Portugal. These included sediments, sludge, water, and food deployed at unfenced feeding stations. The tripartite workflow included detection, quantification, and sorting of different M. bovis cell populations: total, viable, and dormant. Real-time PCR targeting IS6110 to detect MTBC DNA was performed in parallel. The majority of samples (54 %) contained metabolically active or dormant MTBC cells. Sludge samples had a higher burden of total MTBC cells and a high concentration of viable cells (2.3 x 104 cells/g). Ecological modelling informed by climate, land use, livestock and human disturbance data suggested eucalyptus forest and pasture cover as potential major factors affecting the occurrence of viable MTBC cells in natural matrices.

AB  - Populations of a bulb mite that were experimentally selected for a male weapon showed reduced diversity across the genome, indicating that strong sexual selection increases the strength of purifying selection.
   The evolution of costly traits such as deer antlers and peacock trains, which drove the formation of Darwinian sexual selection theory, has been suggested to both reflect and affect patterns of genetic variance across the genome, but direct tests are missing. Here, we used an evolve and resequence approach to reveal patterns of genome-wide diversity associated with the expression of a sexually selected weapon that is dimorphic among males of the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. Populations selected for the weapon showed reduced genome-wide diversity compared to populations selected against the weapon, particularly in terms of the number of segregating non-synonymous positions, indicating enhanced purifying selection. This increased purifying selection reduced inbreeding depression, but outbred female fitness did not improve, possibly because any benefits were offset by increased sexual antagonism. Most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that consistently diverged in response to selection were initially rare and overrepresented in exons, and enriched in regions under balancing or relaxed selection, suggesting they are probably moderately deleterious variants. These diverged SNPs were scattered across the genome, further demonstrating that selection for or against the weapon and the associated changes to the mating system can both capture and influence genome-wide variation.

AB  - Carnivores, especially wolves (Canis sp.), have profound impacts on their ecosystems, affecting the abundance and behavior of prey and competitors, but this has not been examined in detail for red wolves (C. rufus). We studied a population of red wolves that was reintroduced to eastern North Carolina in 1987 and initially thrived, peaking at 120 animals. Due to an increase in anthropogenic mortality and a decline in government support, the population experienced a crash starting in 2014. We evaluated changes in the relative abundance of prey and competitor species during the red wolf decline with 25 camera traps run primarily on National Wildlife Refuges from 2015 to 2021. If red wolves were having an ecological effect on the mammal community, we expected this effect would decline as the wolf population waned, resulting in increased prey and competitor populations. Supporting this, we found that relative abundance increased for most prey and competitor species including American black bear (Ursus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor). For all species, this increase was most notable after spring 2018, the second year with low red wolf reproduction. For some species, the increase was dramatic; the detection rate for raccoon, bear and bobcat doubled from the spring of 2018 to the spring of 2021. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) showed a general increase in relative abundance but remained prevalent even at their lowest detection rates. Our results lend correlational support to the hypothesis that red wolves had a strong effect on their ecosystems by suppressing prey and competitor populations when they were at their peak. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that reintroductions of large predators have ecological impacts, with the caveat that these impacts can decline rapidly if the predators dwindle back to critically low numbers.

AB  - In addition to feeding on animal remains, many scavengers also function as predators. Carcasses may therefore affect local animal communities by attracting facultative scavengers and increasing predation risk for other species in the vicinity of the carcasses. This risk may be elevated in low productivity environments, especially where humans increase carcass production and where facultative scavengers include invasive species. In June and October 2018, we monitored experimentally placed red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) carcasses and artificial bird nests in two different habitats in the Simpson Desert, Australia, to identify the nest predators attracted to the carcasses, and to determine how carcasses affect overall and predator-specific nest predation. We modelled our nests to approximate those of the ground nesting little buttonquail (Turnix velox) and the endangered night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis). Native Corvus spp. and then invasive red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were the top carcass visitors and nest egg predators. Carcass presence and open habitat increased overall nest predation and fewer artificial parrot nest eggs were depredated compared to those of quail. Open habitat and carcass presence only increased predator-specific nest predation by foxes, but corvid nest predation was highest in June 2018, and for the artificial quail nest types. Foxes were the main predator of eggs from night parrot nests. Our study shows that carcass provisioning by humans may have indirect, deleterious effects on ground nesting birds, and indicates that foxes might pose a greater threat to night parrot populations than previously recognised.

AB  - While the impact of livestock grazing has been frequently assessed for grasses, little is known about how livestock affects tree seedlings and saplings. We explored the effects of goat, cattle and camel browsing on the survival of Balanites aegyptiaca seedlings and saplings, a broadleaved evergreen tree species indigenous to Sudan, in Dinder Biosphere Reserve-Sudan (DBR). We used a stratified sampling design with four sites: GOA (mainly browsed by goats), CAT and CAM being mainly browsed by cattle and camels, respectively, while CON was a control area without any livestock browsing. We tested the survival, mortality and recovery of seedlings and saplings across different sites. Our results revealed that mortalities of seedlings in GOA were almost four times higher than that of CAM and CON and twice that of CAT (F-3,F-196 = 100.39, P < .001). Further, sapling mortality was three times higher in GOA than that observed in CAT and CON (F-3,F-196 = 73.4, P < .001). We found that seedlings recover better than saplings, and, unexpectedly, goat browsing severely affected the natural regeneration of B. aegyptiaca in DBR compared to other livestock species. Our study findings contribute to sustainable forest management and show that particularly goat browsing needs to be suppressed for conservation of vulnerable tree species.

AB  - The cross-hybridization of American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) with Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Bl.) is a promising strategy for restoring a blight-resistant strain of this keystone species to the Appalachian mountains. To assess the ecological impacts of hybridization on invertebrate communities, we conducted a study across chestnut plots with varying degrees of hybridization (75%, 94%, or 100% American chestnut). Our findings indicate American chestnut hybridization impacted invertebrate communities above- and belowground. Aboveground insect community composition, insect herbivory, gall infestation, and belowground invertebrate diversity were all altered. While some of these differences could be explained by different growth habits or environmental differences, stark differences in Asian chestnut gall wasp infestation (Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu.) suggest a genetic component. These results suggest that chestnut hybridization, and particularly expanded restoration efforts using chestnut hybrids, could impact invertebrate communities above- and belowground in addition to pest dynamics. Understanding these effects is crucial for successful chestnut restoration and ecosystem management.

AB  - Highly seasonal environments can increase competition among herbivores for nutrients, affecting rates of reproduction and survival. There is concern about the impacts of non-native ungulates on Greater Sage-grouse in the Great Basin of North America. We estimated nesting propensity, the annual proportion of females attempting a nest, for Greater Sage-grouse in relation to the abundance of ungulates using 7 years of data from the northwestern Great Basin, USA. We focused on nesting because it is the necessary first major investment required for the production of new recruits. We used a Bayesian multistratum model to investigate the effects of weather and sympatric non-native herbivores, free-roaming horses and domestic cattle, on reproductive rates and female survival of adult and yearling sage-grouse. Adults nested at a higher rate (0.931, 95% CI, 0.904-0.953) than yearlings (0.867, 95% CI, 0.802-0.922) under average conditions of covariates other than age. If the first nest failed, renesting rates were similar between adults (0.349, 95% CI, 0.292-0.410) and yearlings (0.353, 95% CI, 0.217-0.507). Females in better body condition at the start of the season nested at higher rates, and moderately snowy winters led to the highest nesting propensity during the following spring. Drier conditions led to low rates of nesting, particularly in areas with dense cattle grazing. Female survival was lower for nesting females, indicating a survival cost of reproduction. Areas with abundant free-roaming horses had slightly higher nesting propensity, though other research suggests negative impacts later in the breeding cycle. Sage-grouse face life history trade-offs that may be shifting due to changing climatic conditions. Our work suggests that the effects of competition with non-native ungulates on sage-grouse life histories may be exacerbated by adverse weather.

AB  - Prescribed fall burning is commonly used worldwide on rangeland sites to enhance vegetation resources and restore disturbed ecosystems, but little is known about how it may alter microbial communities and insect activities. We used two site treatments (low- to moderate-burn severity plots and unburned control plots) at a high-elevation (2 100 m above sea level) shrub-steppe rangeland site. Four yr after the prescribed burn, captured insects primarily consisted of Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets) species with similar or greater numbers captured on burned plots as compared with unburned plots. We used wood stakes to assess microbial population changes. Aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) and pine ( Pinus taeda L.) wood stakes were placed horizontally on the soil surface and vertically into the mineral to determine microbially altered wood decay rates. In mineral soil, mass loss (wood decay) of both aspen and pine increased significantly in the burned plots after 5 yr. Surface aspen also had increased decay in the burned plots, but pine surface stakes were unaffected. Surprisingly, at this high-elevation site we also found subterranean termites ( Reticulitermes tibialis Banks) feeding on both stake species, with greater numbers on aspen stakes in burned plots leading to greater wood mass loss and organic matter turnover rates. Our results suggest that that fall prescribed burning can enhance insect numbers and microbial decay in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems. Understanding these changes can help land managers predict the influence of fall prescribed burning operations on soil biological properties and insect communities.

AB  - Conservation agriculture is an innovative approach based on minimal soil disturbance, soil cover with crop residues, and crop rotation, which increases the biodiversity of soil macrofauna thus contributing to nutrient cycling and soil aggregation. In addition, macrofaunal abundance may play a role at regulating insect pest populations. The study aims to predict the effects of soil management practices (conventional tillage and conservation agriculture) on the abundance of soil macrofauna and herbivore predation in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) based cropping systems. We conducted a field experiment with a randomized complete block comprising two treatments, Conventional Tillage (CT) and Conservation Agriculture (CA), and six replications in a cotton-maize rotation system from 2020 to 2023. Soil monoliths and pitfall traps were installed in both treatments to collect ground-dwelling arthropods, to analyse the influence of soil management practices on their abundance, their trophic groups, and the rate of pest predation by generalist predators. Pest predation rates were assessed using artificial caterpillars made from plasticine. The results showed significant positive effects of soil management practices on herbivory rate, herbivore abundance, predator abundance, omnivore-predator abundance and pest predation rate. The average herbivory rate was 9.8 % in the conservation agriculture plots and 11.6 % in the conventional tillage plots. Overall, the predation rate was 58.9 % in the conservation agriculture plots and 21.8 % in the conventional tillage plots. The abundance of predators and of omnivore-predators were significantly higher in conservation agriculture than in conventional tillage. These findings suggest that conservation agriculture practices improve soil macrofauna and pest regulation, with potential benefits on soil quality and sustainability in cotton cropping systems.

AB  - 1. Contemporary ecosystems commonly support multiple non-native species, which can alter community structure and directly or indirectly interact with one another. Novel interactions between invasive species can result in the facilitation or suppression of one or both invaders, making it important to understand the underlying mechanisms that affect invasion outcomes.2. Goldfish Carassius auratus and Chinese mystery snails Cipangopaludina chinensis have been introduced widely through the aquarium trade and co-occur in their non-native ranges. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to assess separate and combined effects of goldfish and mystery snails on urban pond community structure and to investigate whether goldfish and mystery snails affected one another positively, neutrally or negatively. We predicted that the distinct trophic levels of each species and the anti-predator traits of mystery snails would lead to positive interactions between invaders and synergistic effects on the aquatic community.3. Goldfish directly increased turbidity and decreased filamentous algae, zooplankton, juvenile native snails and survival of amphibians via consumptive effects. Goldfish indirectly increased periphyton, phytoplankton and body size of surviving native green frogs Lithobates clamitans through trophic cascades and/or release from competition. Mystery snails had more subtle effects including reducing growth rates of native grey tree frogs Hyla versicolor, likely through competitive interactions.4. With goldfish present, mystery snails showed increased reproductive success (higher biomass of juveniles), likely due to indirect competitive release from other herbivores. In contrast to their effects on native snails, goldfish did not consume juvenile mystery snails, likely due to their unique traits (e.g. large size and shell thickness). Mystery snails slightly reduced goldfish growth but did not affect their survival.5. These results suggest unidirectional facilitation between invaders via indirect changes in the food web. Overall, our study found strong direct and indirect effects of invasive aquarium species, particularly goldfish, and provides experimental support for the invasional meltdown hypothesis within urban waterbodies, which are especially prone to invasions.

AB  - Elk hoof disease is an emerging disease in the northwestern United States. Managing wildlife disease is a difficult task, particularly when information on cause and transmission is limited. We examined the relationships among wildlife normative belief dimensions and level of trust in the wildlife management agency with support for hoof disease management actions in elk (Cervus canadensis). The study was conducted in 2020 with two sampling frames of Washington State residents: random Address-Based Sample of general population (ABS) and licensed elk hunters. For the ABS, a mail-push-to-web followed by a paper questionnaire survey method was applied, while an e-mail contact to web survey was employed for the hunters. Perceived values, perceived risks, and trust in the wildlife management agency were indicators of support for management options. Results illustrated two main implications: proactive communication with stakeholders is important in the management process, and collaboration may be useful to increase trust.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors which might interact in non-additive ways. Two key stressors in marine systems that are likely to be mediated by ongoing climate change are temperature and salinity. Here, we experimentally examine the influence of warming and desalination on mortality rates of a key herbivorous sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus, between two populations over time. Mortality rates were significantly increased by warming and desalination as individual stressors, with up to total mortality exhibited at the highest water temperature (27 degrees C) and lowest salinity (25). However, these stressors interacted, with desalination significantly exacerbating mortality rates at the highest temperature, but not under lower thermal regimes (21 degrees C and 25 degrees C). Mortality rates were relatively consistent between two sea urchin populations. Overall, temperature and salinity stressors can significantly interact to mediate mortality rates of key aquatic species, in ways that cannot be predicted by considering individual stressors in isolation. Future research should incorporate multiple environmental contexts to better understand and predict species responses to changing climate.

AB  - BackgroundNetwork theory is largely applied in real-world systems to assess landscape connectivity using empirical or theoretical networks. Empirical networks are usually built from discontinuous individual movement trajectories without knowing the effect of relocation frequency on the assessment of landscape connectivity while theoretical networks generally rely on simple movement rules. We investigated the combined effects of relocation sampling frequency and landscape fragmentation on the assessment of landscape connectivity using simulated trajectories and empirical high-resolution (1 Hz) trajectories of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). We also quantified the capacity of commonly used theoretical networks to accurately predict landscape connectivity from multiple movement processes.MethodsWe simulated forager trajectories from continuous correlated biased random walks in simulated landscapes with three levels of landscape fragmentation. High-resolution ibex trajectories were reconstructed using GPS-enabled multi-sensor biologging data and the dead-reckoning technique. For both simulated and empirical trajectories, we generated spatial networks from regularly resampled trajectories and assessed changes in their topology and information loss depending on the resampling frequency and landscape fragmentation. We finally built commonly used theoretical networks in the same landscapes and compared their predictions to actual connectivity.ResultsWe demonstrated that an accurate assessment of landscape connectivity can be severely hampered (e.g., up to 66% of undetected visited patches and 29% of spurious links) when the relocation frequency is too coarse compared to the temporal dynamics of animal movement. However, the level of landscape fragmentation and underlying movement processes can both mitigate the effect of relocation sampling frequency. We also showed that network topologies emerging from different movement behaviours and a wide range of landscape fragmentation were complex, and that commonly used theoretical networks accurately predicted only 30-50% of landscape connectivity in such environments.ConclusionsVery high-resolution trajectories were generally necessary to accurately identify complex network topologies and avoid the generation of spurious information on landscape connectivity. New technologies providing such high-resolution datasets over long periods should thus grow in the movement ecology sphere. In addition, commonly used theoretical models should be applied with caution to the study of landscape connectivity in real-world systems as they did not perform well as predictive tools.

AB  - Data extraction from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has proved effective in animal surveys and monitoring, but to date has scarcely been used for detailed population analysis and individual animal feature extraction. We assessed the zoometric and feature extraction of the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) using data acquired from a captive population for comparison with reintroduced populations monitored by UAVs. Highly accurate scaled and geo-rectified imagery derived from UAV surveys allowed precise morphometric measurements of the oryx. The scaled top-view imagery combined with baseline data from known sex, age, weight and pregnancy status of captive individuals were used to develop predictive models. A bracketed index developed from the predictive models showed high accuracy for classifying the age group <= 16 months, animals with a weight >80 kg and pregnancy. The pregnancy classification decision tree model performed with 91.7% accuracy. The polynomial weight predictive model performed well with relatively high accuracy when using the total top-view surface measurement. Photogrammetrically processed UAV-acquired imagery can yield valuable zoometric data, feature extraction and modelling; it is a tool with a practical application for field biologists that can assist in the decision-making process for species conservation management.

AB  - The diet composition and prey selection of grey wolves (Canis lupus) inhabiting the Roztocze and Solska Forest (south-east Poland) was studied based on an analysis of scats collected in 2001-2002 (n = 84) and 2017-2020 (n = 302). In both periods, wolves preyed mainly on wild ungulates (96.5-96.7% of consumed biomass). Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was the most critical wolf prey accounting for 57.8% of consumed biomass in 2001-2002 and 49.2% and 2017-2020, but wolves positively select only wild boar (Jacob's selectivity index D = 0.213 in 2001-2002 and 0.710 in 2017-2020) and fallow deer (D = 0.588 only in 2017-2020). The largest species - moose Alces alces and red deer Cervus elaphus - were consumed less than expected from their share in the ungulate community. Predation on medium-sized wild mammals and domestic animals was low, 0.8-2.2% and 1.1-2.7% of the biomass consumed, respectively. The breadth of the wolf diet was very narrow and identical in both study periods (B = 1.07), while the similarity of diet composition was high (alpha = 0.999). This study indicated the stability of the wolf diet over two decades and the importance of wild boar as a food source for this carnivore.

T2  - BIOLOGY BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - Data on the concentration of Cs-137 is obtained from soils, food plants, and muscle tissue of seven species of game animals (wild reindeer, elk, roe deer, musk deer, bighorn sheep, white hare, and brown bear) in the tundra and taiga zones of Yakutia. It has been shown that reindeer and musk deer are consumers of bushy lichens, are characterized by a relatively high content of Cs-137 (up to 51.6-75.1 Bq/kg), and can be a source of its intake into the organism of the next level consumer-the brown bear. The levels of Cs-137 in other herbivorous species are relatively low. Meat products of a number of species constitute an important component of the nutrition of the population of reindeer herding and hunting and hunting regions of the Far North. At present, the concentrations of the radionuclide in the tissues of the species studied do not exceed the established sanitary and hygienic standards.

AB  - Across the globe, biological invasions have disrupted mutualisms, producing reverberating consequences for ecosystems. Although invasive species frequently trigger mutualism disruptions, few studies have quantified the demographic mechanisms by which mutualism breakdown may generate population effects. In a Kenyan savanna, the invasive big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) has disrupted a foundational mutualism between the monodominant whistling-thorn tree (Acacia drepanolobium) and native ants (Crematogaster spp.) that deter browsing by large mammalian herbivores. We conducted experiments to quantify the demographic consequences of this mutualism disruption in the presence and absence of large mammalian herbivores. Invasion by P. megacephala exacerbated population declines of A. drepanolobium, primarily through decreased survival and reproduction of adult trees. However, these fitness reductions were small compared to those resulting from the presence of large mammalian herbivores, which negatively impacted growth and survival. Contrary to expectation, the expulsion of metabolically costly Crematogaster mutualists by P. megacephala did not result in higher population growth rates for trees protected from large mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that invasive P. megacephala may impose a direct metabolic cost to trees exceeding that of native mutualists while providing no protection from browsing by large mammalian herbivores. Across landscapes, we expect that invasion by P. megacephala will reduce A. drepanolobium populations, but that the magnitude and demographic pathways of this effect will hinge on the presence and abundance of browsers.

AB  - Trees can emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when under attack by herbivores, and these signals can also be detected by natural enemies and neighbouring trees. There is still limited knowledge of intra- and inter-specific communication in diverse habitats. We studied the effects of induced VOC emissions by three Ficus species on predation on the focal Ficus trees in a lowland tropical rainforest in Papua New Guinea. Further we assessed predation across a phylogenetically diverse set of neighbouring tree species. Two of the focal tree species, Ficus pachyrrhachis and F. hispidioides, have strong alkaloid-based constitutive defences while the third one, F. wassa, is lower in constitutive chemical defences. We experimentally manipulated the jasmonic acid signalling pathway by spraying the focal individuals with either methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DIECA). These treatments induce increases or decreases in VOC emissions, respectively. We tested the possible effects of VOC emissions on each focal Ficus tree and two of its neighbours by measuring the predation rate of plasticine caterpillars. We found that predation increased after the MeJA application in only one focal tree species, F. wassa, while the DIECA application had no effect on any of the three focal species. Further, we did not detect an effect of our treatments on predation rates across neighbouring trees. Neither the phylogenetic distance of the neighbouring tree from the focal tree nor the physical distance from the focal tree had any effect on predation rates for any of the three focal Ficus species. These results suggest that even congeneric tree species vary in their response to the MeJA and DIECA treatment and subsequent response to VOC emissions by predators. Our results also suggest that MeJA effects did not spill over to neighbouring trees in highly diverse tropical rainforest vegetation.

AB  - The ultimate goal of threatened plant translocations is to establish self-sustaining populations. Lessons learnt from plant translocations can inform future translocations and improve conservation outcomes via adaptive management. We assessed translocation success for 76 translocations of 50 species established as part of recovery programmes between 1998 and 2016 in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR), a biodiversity hotspot with Mediterranean-type climate. We used a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to assess translocation success as measured by plant survival, height growth, crown growth, and reproduction (flowering and fruiting). We found that fencing to prevent vertebrate herbivory improved survival, irrigating plants over the first two summer dry periods improved the likelihood of reproduction, and where the rainfall increased above the 30-year average in the two years following planting, it positively influenced survival, growth, and reproduction. We recommend that fencing to prevent herbivory should be broadly considered in threatened plant translocations, while irrigation to improve translocation success would benefit plant species in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and other dryland environments.

AB  - Western redcedar (WRC) is an ecologically and economically important forest tree species characterized by low genetic diversity with high self-compatibility and high heartwood durability. Using sequence capture genotyping of target genic and non-genic regions, we genotyped 44 parent trees and 1520 offspring trees representing 26 polycross (PX) families collected from three progeny test sites using 45,378 SNPs. Trees were phenotyped for eight traits related to growth, heartwood and foliar chemistry associated with wood durability and deer browse resistance. We used the genomic realized relationship matrix for paternity assignment, maternal pedigree correction, and to estimate genetic parameters. We compared genomics-based (GBLUP) and two pedigree-based (ABLUP: polycross and reconstructed full-sib [FS] pedigrees) models. Models were extended to estimate dominance genetic effects. Pedigree reconstruction revealed significant unequal male contribution and separated the 26 PX families into 438 FS families. Traditional maternal PX pedigree analysis resulted in up to 51% overestimation in genetic gain and 44% in diversity. Genomic analysis resulted in up to 22% improvement in offspring breeding value (BV) theoretical accuracy, 35% increase in expected genetic gain for forward selection, and doubled selection intensity for backward selection. Overall, all traits showed low to moderate heritability (0.09-0.28), moderate genotype by environment interaction (type-B genetic correlation: 0.51-0.80), low to high expected genetic gain (6.01%-55%), and no significant negative genetic correlation reflecting no large trade-offs for multi-trait selection. Only three traits showed a significant dominance effect. GBLUP resulted in smaller but more accurate heritability estimates for five traits, but larger estimates for the wood traits. Comparison between all, genic-coding, genic-non-coding and intergenic SNPs showed little difference in genetic estimates. In summary, we show that GBLUP overcomes the PX limitations, successfully captures expected historical and hidden relatedness as well as linkage disequilibrium (LD), and results in increased breeding efficiency in WRC.

AB  - Ungulates commonly select habitat with higher forage biomass and or nutritional quality to improve body condition and fitness. However, predation risk can alter ungulate habitat selection and foraging behavior and may affect their nutritional condition. Ungulates often choose areas with lower predation risk, sometimes sacrificing higher quality forage. This forage-predation risk trade-off can be important for life history strategies and influences individual nutritional condition and population vital rates. We used GPS collar data from adult female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) to model mule deer habitat selection in relation to forage conditions, stalking cover and predation risk from mountain lions to determine if a forage-predation risk trade-off existed for mule deer in central New Mexico. We also examined mountain lion kill sites and mule deer foraging locations to assess trade-offs at a finer scale. Forage biomass and protein content were inversely correlated with horizontal visibility, hence associated with higher stalking cover for mountain lions, suggesting a forage-predation risk trade-off for mule deer. Mule deer habitat selection was influenced by forage biomass and protein content at the landscape and within home range spatial scales, with forage protein being related to habitat selection during spring and summer and forage biomass during winter. However, mule deer selection for areas with better foraging conditions was constrained by landscape-scale encounter risk for mountain lions, such that increasing encounter risk was associated with diminished selection for areas with better foraging conditions. Mule deer also selected for areas with higher visibility when mountain lion predation risk was higher. Mountain lion kill sites were best explained by decreasing horizontal visibility and available forage protein, suggesting that deer may be selecting for forage quality at the cost of predation risk. A site was 1.5 times more likely to be a kill site with each 1-meter decrease in visibility (i.e., increased stalking cover). Mule deer selection of foraging sites was related to increased forage biomass, further supporting the potential for a trade-off scenario. Mule deer utilized spatio-temporal strategies and risk-conditional behavior to reduce predation risk, and at times selected suboptimal foraging areas with lower predation risk.

AB  - BackgroundCurrent research on livestock movement ecology focuses on quantifying the factors that trigger alterations in movement behavior and understanding hidden mechanisms. Modern tracking technologies and robust statistical analysis models deliver new opportunities for investigating how individual animals cope with the joint effect of biotic and abiotic factors at different time scales.MethodsWe applied multivariate Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to characterize the fine-scale movement behavior (30-second intervals) of GPS-tracked domestic Zhongwei goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) for 124 days and analyzed the combined influence of biotic and abiotic factors and specific time of day on their seasonal movement behavioral transition in a predator-free, semi-arid mountain grassland in China.ResultsWe classified the behaviors of goats into two states: foraging (low step length, varied turning angle) and travelling (long step lengths, small turning angles). The terrain slopes had the most impact on their movement behavioral transition in the full year, spring, autumn, and winter. However, in the summer with hotter temperatures, the specific time of day explains their movement behavior most. Forage resources indicated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and terrain ruggedness measured by the Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM), had less impact on their behavior transitions compared to terrain slope and specific time of day. Elevation and solar radiation could not explain their movement behavior in different seasons, nor could NDVI in winter or VRM in spring and autumn. Across different seasons, the probability of foraging behavior increased with the later times of day, steeper terrain slopes, and higher NDVI, while it decreased with increasing VRM. The impact of NDVI on the probability of foraging behavior was largest during the early onset of vegetation growth in spring, and lowest in winter coinciding with a lower availability of food resources. The movement speed was lower, and the daily foraging percentage was higher in spring and winter due to lower food resources and shorter daylight hours. In contrast, movement speed was higher, and the daily foraging percentage was lower in summer and autumn with more food resources and longer daylight hours. The percentage of time allocated to foraging increases hourly from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm across various seasons.ConclusionsHMMs were found to be useful for disentangling the movement behavior of goats. Our approach provides new insights into the seasonal and daily behavioral strategies of goats. Results demonstrate that in the mountain region, terrain slopes and specific times of the day more effectively trigger domestic goat behavioral transition from one state to the next compared with biotic factors, represented herein by NDVI, across different seasons. The early onset of vegetation growth and a shorter period of available high-quality forage in spring, significantly influenced goat behavioral transitions. Overall, these results are important for designing appropriate grazing management strategies that satisfy the ecological and socioeconomic demands of semi-arid grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Accurate information on wildlife occurrence in anthropogenic landscapes is essential to develop effective conservation measures. Monitoring multiple mammal species in heterogeneous landscapes can be challenging because of the diversity of land-uses and species behaviors. Therefore, different monitoring methods are better adapted to different contexts. We compared data obtained from camera traps with data gathered through an online survey to document the presence of mammal species in mosaic landscapes of the Garden Route Biosphere Reserve in South Africa. The survey detected the same 15 species as the camera traps as well as the additional common duiker. Both methods effectively detected most large mammal species, whereas results were less consistent for smaller species and carnivores. Combining the two methods enabled us to produce more robust estimates of species absence and confirm species presence reported by survey respondents. In less disturbed areas, respondents with good ecological knowledge were effective at monitoring mammal species, while extending the spatial coverage of the study. Bearing in mind the limitations of each method, camera traps and an online survey could complement each other if combined. Together, they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of mammal communities in anthropogenic landscapes, increasing both spatial coverage and the number of species sightings.

AB  - Climate change negatively impacts reindeer grazing in Fennoscandia, with the encroachment of Empetrum nigrum (crowberry) being a significant, yet largely unrecognized problem. Crowberry encroachment affects the neighboring palatable vegetation negatively, homogenizing the pasture and decreasing ecosystem biodiversity. Current husbandry management aims are based on sustainable use of the pasture land, yet pasture quality is not considered a central indicator. To prevent overgrazing, reindeer numbers are limited, but as the animals avoid crowberry, this invasive species exacerbates the Norwegian reindeer husbandry's pasture crisis. Herders therefore intervene with two adaptive strategies, supplementary feeding and/or crowberry control. We develop a general three-species bioeconomic model with five variants to understand the economic impact of an invasive species on herbivore husbandry, and the net benefits of the two adaptive measures at the steady state. Our analytical results show that the native invasive encroachment causes a decrease in not only the nutrient-high grazing land but also the optimal herbivore herd and slaughter volume. Supplementary feeding is implemented to increase the herd size, yet the measure further depletes the grazing pasture, making this practice unsustainable. Instead, controlling crowberry protects both the grazing pasture and reindeer herd size. Applying this to the Norwegian reindeer husbandry case, we find crowberry control more cost-effective and less stressful for the pasture land than supplementary feeding. Government subsidies are shown to be essential for restoring herd sizes to the status quo.

AB  - In the United States, wildlife managers are entrusted with preserving culturally and economically important ungulate populations in the face of the ongoing spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established an adaptive management plan to reduce the reliance of elk (Cervus canadensis) on supplemental winter feeding on the National Elk Refuge. The end goal of reducing the unnaturally high aggregation of elk during the winter is to mitigate the threat of disease outbreaks and to meet the objectives of sustainable populations of elk on the refuge. In this case study, we evaluated 6 years (2017-2022) of data from GPS-collared elk to determine the efficacy of shortening the length of the annual feeding period on the refuge to reduce elk aggregation. We measured aggregation using proximity rates, based on pairwise interactions over time, in both raw form as an index as well as predicted proximity as a function of other abiotic influences. We created a new R package, wildagg, to help with the process of computing the metrics from our study and to increase reproducibility in the future. Aggregation declined in years with less feeding on the refuge according to raw aggregation metrics when examined in isolation and dependent on the baseline feeding year used for comparison. However, accounting for abiotic factors while modeling proximity rates suggested in some years the decision to shorten the feeding period had less influence on aggregation than predicted. Our results underscore the complexity of measuring management outcomes and the usefulness of multiple approaches to evaluation.

AB  - Identifying suitable habitats and quantifying the spatial overlap among sympatrically distributed ungulates is essential for safeguarding their long-term survival. We deployed infrared cameras to capture the distribution sites of sika deer (Cervus nippon), Reeve's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the Taohongling Sika Deer National Nature Reserve (TNNR) and measured nine environmental factors. Based on this, we applied MaxEnt modeling to assess the species' habitat suitability and applied the Pianka index to evaluate niche overlap. The results showed that the sika deer occupied the smallest area of high-suitability habitat (53.85 km2, 11.13% of the study area), primarily concentrated in the core zone of the TNNR. Specifically, 37.86% of the sika deer's high-suitability habitat overlapped with wild boar and 29.06% overlapped with Reeve's muntjac. Pianka index analysis revealed substantial spatial niche overlap between sika deer and Reeve's muntjac (0.487) but limited overlap between sika deer and wild boar (0.160). Our findings indicate substantial overlap between sika deer and sympatric species. To effectively protect the sika deer in the TNNR, we recommend increasing the number of monitoring sites, implementing habitat improvement measures (e.g., vegetation restoration and water supplementation stations), and establishing isolation corridors to enhance habitat connectivity.

AB  - Plant-available silicon (Si) concentrations vary considerably across tropical soils, yet the ecological importance of that variation remains largely unresolved. Increased Si availability can enhance growth and modulate foliar nutrient status in many crop species suggesting similar effects might occur in natural systems. However, how growth, foliar Si and macronutrient concentrations as well as their stoichiometry respond to plant-available Si and how these responses differ across tropical tree species is unknown. We experimentally exposed seedlings of 12 tropical tree species to a gradient of plant-available Si concentrations, representing 85 % of the variation found across central Panama, and assessed responses in aboveground growth and foliar nutrient status. Furthermore, we assessed whether higher plant-available Si increases P availability. Increasing plant-available Si led to increased foliar Si concentrations (by up to 140%). It also led to higher aboveground growth (by up to 220%), and it affected foliar C and N concentrations, and nutrient stoichiometry across species. However, at the species-level only a small subset of two to four species showed significant growth and foliar nutrient responses. At the soil-level, plant-available P remained unchanged along the experimental soil Si gradient. Our results showed that Si can improve growth and/or modulate foliar nutrient status in a number of tropical tree species. Furthermore, species' growth and foliar nutrient concentrations might vary differently across tropical forest sites varying in plant-available Si. Additionally, Si-induced responses in foliar nutrient stoichiometry have the potential to affect herbivory and litter decomposition. Taken together, natural variation in plant-available Si might influence plant performance unequally across tropical tree species, and change trophic interactions, with potential implications for ecosystem processes.

AB  - Numerous unique flora and fauna inhabit the Lower Florida Keys, including the endangered Florida Key deer, found nowhere else. In this vulnerable habitat of flat islands with low elevation, accelerated sea level rise poses a threat. Predicting the impact of sea level rise on vegetation and wildlife is crucial. This study used 5 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sea level rise scenarios to assess their effects on No Name Key, Florida. The goal was to estimate changes in the Florida Key deer population relative to sea level rise using a lidar-derived elevation data and a vegetation map. The method used 2 cases to model the sea level rise impact. In Case 1, total non-submerged area at current sea level was determined. Using 5 IPCC scenarios, a new total nonsubmerged land area was estimated, and deer numbers were predicted for each scenario. In Case 2, upward migration of coastal vegetation combined with the coastal squeeze process was modeled. A distinct elevation range for each vegetation type at the current sea level was determined. Vegetation ranges were redistributed based on respective elevation ranges in the sea level rise scenarios. Areas for each vegetation type were recalculated, and Key deer numbers were estimated for each sea level rise scenario. Results under the worst emission scenario showed the following: (1) for case 1, the land area was reduced to 30 % of the current land area, corresponding to having about 27 deer, and (2) for case 2, the land area was reduced to 70 % of the current land area, having about 54 deer on No Name Key. The results indicated reduced non-submerged land area and less upland vegetation, particularly hardwoods/hammocks, by the year 2100. As less land area is available, a decline in Key deer population is expected as sea levels rise. Since Key deer favor upland vegetation, habitat affected by sea level rise will likely support a smaller deer population. The findings emphasize the need for precise, timely predictions of sea level rise impacts and long-term conservation strategies. Specifically designed measures are required to protect and maintain endangered wildlife, such as the Florida Key deer, residing on these vulnerable islands.

AB  - Estuaries are impacted by catchment land use changes, driving degradation associated with eutrophication and alterations in sediment dynamics. Estuarine ecological monitoring has typically covered only recent periods, so magnitudes and trajectories of degradation are often poorly described. Here, we develop a multi-method approach to hindcast historic estuary condition. We determined geochemical properties in dated sediment cores from two sites in the eutrophic New River Estuary (NRE), Aotearoa New Zealand. Mud, organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen (N) contents increased from similar to 1847 to 2019 (similar to 20 to 100%, similar to 1 to similar to 7%, similar to 0.2 to similar to 3%, and similar to 0.03 to similar to 0.37% respectively). Historic land use modelling shows increasing catchment loads and water column total N rising from 165 to 663 mg m-3, with more rapid change in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Strong correlations (R-2 = 0.93-0.95) were found between sediment N content and water column N concentrations. Trophic indicators hindcasted by a Bayesian Belief Network worsened from the mid-20th to 21st centuries. This degradation is associated with increased sheep, beef and dairy farming in the catchment. Our approach identifies nutrient and sediment loadings associated with 'tipping points' for indicators and can inform policy by identification of hazardous levels of contaminant loading for other estuaries.

AB  - To forage optimally, deer select individual plants highest in limiting nutrients, while avoiding individuals that are high in anti-herbivore defenses. For some woody species, deer may selectively browse on larger stems, which can provide a larger amount of younger, more nutritious tissue per individual. However, in some species, larger stems may possess increased levels of anti-herbivore defenses, ultimately discouraging deer from browsing on these larger individuals. We examined differences in the proportion of twigs and stems (individual seedlings/saplings/trees) browsed across three height classes for four species: blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata Michx,), white ash (F. americana L.), sassafras (Sassafras albidium Nutt.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum L.), across multiple sites in central Indiana. Overall, we found that taller stems had a higher likelihood of being browsed, but smaller stems were browsed more heavily. We also found that sugar maple twigs and stems were most likely to be browsed, while sassafras twigs and white ash twigs and stems were least likely to be browsed. Our results indicate that under intense browsing pressure, preference should be given to smaller stems for protection, and that stands with greater vertical stratification of palatable species are more resilient to the effects of deer browsing.

AB  - Bull kelp populations in northern California declined drastically in response to the 2014-2016 marine heatwave, sea star wasting disease, and subsequently large increases in herbivorous purple urchin populations. Despite the regional kelp forest collapse, there were small, remnant populations where bull kelp was able to survive. Moderate resolution satellites (i.e., Landsat) have been important for creating long-term, large-scale time series of bull kelp forests, however, these have been shown to underestimate or entirely exclude refugia due to their low densities and proximity to the coastline. While measurements from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are spatially detailed, they are temporally limited and difficult to collect over regional scales. The development of CubeSat constellations has enabled a workaround for these tradeoffs, with global imagery available near-daily at meter-scale. We developed a method for mapping bull kelp canopy across the different sensor cohorts in the PlanetScope constellation. This required correcting surface reflectance measurements to account for differences in the spectral response functions among the sensors and leveraging the temporal frequency of PlanetScope data to increase the automation of classifying kelp canopy in imagery with increased noise. Using the PlanetScope derived kelp canopy extents, we identified locations where bull kelp refugia have persisted in northern California. We found that bull kelp refugia occupied about 2% of the total available habitat in the region and about 9.4% of the average canopy area observed prior to 2014. These areas may be critical to the success of kelp forest re-establishment in northern California, which increases their importance for ongoing monitoring, conservation, and restoration efforts.

AB  - Background and Aims Intraspecific variation in foundation species of forest ecosystems can shape community and ecosystem properties, particularly when that variation has a genetic basis. Traits mediating interactions with other species are predicted by simple allocation models to follow ontogenetic patterns that are rarely studied in trees. The aim of this research was to identify the roles of genotype, ontogeny and genotypic trade-offs shaping growth, defence and reproduction in aspen.
   Methods We established a common garden replicating >500 aspen genets in Wisconsin, USA. Trees were measured through the juvenile period into the onset of reproduction, for growth, defence chemistry (phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins), nitrogen, extrafloral nectaries, leaf morphology (specific leaf area), flower production and foliar herbivory and disease. We also assayed the TOZ19 sex marker and heterozygosity at ten microsatellite loci.
   Key Results We found high levels of genotypic variation for all traits, and high heritabilities for both the traits and their ontogenetic trajectories. Ontogeny strongly shaped intraspecific variation, and trade-offs among growth, defence and reproduction supported some predictions while contradicting others. Both direct resistance (chemical defence) and indirect defence (extrafloral nectaries) declined during the juvenile stage, prior to the onset of reproduction. Reproduction was higher in trees that were larger, male and had higher individual heterozygosity. Growth was diminished by genotypic allocation to both direct and indirect defence as well as to reproduction, but we found no evidence of trade-offs between defence and reproduction.
   Conclusions Key traits affecting the ecological communities of aspen have high levels of genotypic variation and heritability, strong patterns of ontogeny and clear trade-offs among growth, defence and reproduction. The architecture of aspen's community genetics - its ontogeny, trade-offs and especially its great variability - is shaped by both its broad range and the diverse community of associates, and in turn further fosters that diversity.

AB  - Two opposite spatial dynamics of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) occur in Mediterranean landscapes at the end of the summer: a higher segregation of animals during periods of food scarcity versus the aggregation of individuals of both sexes for reproductive purposes. Nevertheless, red deer spatial dynamics and activity patterns may differ in fenced areas, where high deer numbers are reached artificially through intensive management. Yet, such effects remain insufficiently investigated in the literature, despite the prevalence of fenced estates in Mediterranean landscapes within central-southern Iberian Peninsula. We used camera traps and Random Forest to analyze how environmental and anthropogenic factors affected red deer spatial dynamics in a perimeter-fenced Mediterranean landscape during the period of the year when food resources are most limited. Our key findings indicated that females selected areas with higher-quality food resources, and elevated nutritional needs due to lactation, corresponding to the flat, humid lowland areas. In contrast, males demonstrated a less concentrated distribution, although during the rut they migrated towards territories with females. Conversely, daily activity patterns did not differ significantly between sexes. The Random Forest model revealed how altitude, slope, and proximity to water sources or supplementary crops influenced deer spatial dynamics. Our findings emphasized the importance of assessing seasonal movement patterns of deer within fenced areas to determine whether their behavior aligns with natural conditions and if the enclosed landscape ensures adequate environmental heterogeneity. When these requirements are met, fenced landscapes can contribute to the health of deer populations and ecosystems. Therefore, such assessments (i.e., camera trap monitoring and spatial modeling of seasonal movement patterns) can subsequently be used as an additional indicator of good deer management practices, complementing those already in use.

AB  - Improving agricultural production in response to the increasing food demand remains a major challenge in agroecology. The world has made significant efforts to meet this issue by developing several cultivation techniques, such as the use of chemical fertilizers and arable land conversion into agricultural land. However, most of these techniques have caused a significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services. Recent data suggest that biological conservation within and around agroforestry systems are potential solutions that can both reduce biodiversity loss and guarantee crop production. This logic is based on the hypothesis that increasing plant diversity in and around agricultural systems can limit the pest attack rate and increase crop yield. We tested this hypothesis using structural equation modeling on empirical data collected in agroforestry systems around the Pendjari biosphere reserve in West Africa. We measured crop diversity, crop yield, arthropod pest diversity, abundance, the rate of crop herbivory, and the diversity of plants in surrounding natural vegetation in 32 permanent plots. We estimated arthropod diversity and abundance using pitfall traps. We found a direct positive effect for plant diversity and a direct negative effect of arthropod herbivory on crop yield. The diversity of plants in surrounding natural vegetation had a direct positive effect on arthropod pest diversity but a marginal negative direct effect on the rate of crop herbivory. We found no significant direct or indirect effect for crop diversity. Our findings underline the important role of biodiversity conservation in agricultural production improvement. We suggest that the conservation of plant diversity around agroforestry systems may be an effective option to control herbivory damage. Its combination with other pest control techniques may further limit crop depredation and ensure the long-term conservation of wildlife.

AB  - Rhodolith beds, including maerl, are structurally complex perennial habitats that support a high species diversity but are threatened by numerous human activities, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their global ecological importance, increased research efforts are needed to facilitate development of effective measures to conserve these habitats. Two areas hosting rhodolith beds are known to occur off the coast of Malta (central Mediterranean), but only one has been previously studied. Through analysis of video footage collected from 56 different stations coupled with a desk study on human activities, the present study characterized the rhodolith bed located off the southeastern coast of Malta, including its extent, rhodolith morphotype composition, associated megabiota and impacts of anthropogenic activities thereon. The bed occurred at depths of 60-95 m and covered an area of approximately 200 km2, making it the second most extensive rhodolith area reported for the Mediterranean to date. It was dominated by spherical and branched rhodoliths whose cover reached a maximum of 74% but was more often <50%, similar to other Mediterranean rhodolith beds. A total of 84 different megafaunal species were recorded, suggesting that the diversity of megafauna associated with rhodolith bed habitats has been previously underestimated. A number of human activities, including extensive vessel anchoring and officially designated areas for aquaculture, bunkering and trawling, overlap with the mapped rhodolith distribution, highlighting the risk of habitat degradation. A holistic approach to the management of all the competing activities and interests relative to the southeastern coast of Malta that gives due consideration to this newly characterized rhodolith bed and the threats it faces is therefore recommended. The legal framework and policy recommendations for better conservation of rhodolith bed habitats in the Mediterranean and European Seas are also discussed.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a global concern. Current technological advances allow the development of novel tools that can monitor biodiversity remotely with minimal disturbance. One example is passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), which involves recording the soundscape of an area using autonomous recording units, and processing these data using acoustic indices, for example, to estimate the diversity of various vocal animal groups. We explored the hypothesis that data obtained through PAM could also be used to study ecosystem functions. Specifically, we investigated the potential relationship between seven commonly used acoustic indices and insect leaf herbivory, measured as total leaf damage and as the damage from three major insect feeding guilds. Herbivory was quantified on seedlings in 13 plots in four subtropical forests in south China, and acoustic data, representing insect acoustic complexity, were obtained by recording the evening soundscapes in those same locations. Herbivory levels correlated positively with the acoustic entropy index, commonly reported as one of the best-performing indices, whose high values indicate higher acoustic complexity, likely due to greater insect diversity. Relationships for specific feeding guilds were moderately stronger for chewers, indicating that the acoustic indices capture some insect groups more than others (e.g., chewers include soniferous taxa such as crickets, whereas miners are mostly silent). Our findings suggest that the use of PAM to monitor ecosystem functions deserves to be explored further, as this is a research field with unexplored potential. Well-designed targeted studies could help us better understand how to best use novel technologies to monitor ecosystem functions.

AB  - Fecal microbiota variability and individuality are well studied in humans and also in farm animals (related to diet- or disease-specific influences), but very little is known for exotic zoo-housed animals. This includes a wide range of species that differ greatly in microbiota composition and variation. For example, herbivorous species show a very similar and constant fecal microbiota over time, whereas carnivorous species appear to be highly variable in fecal microbial diversity and composition. Our objective was to determine whether species-specific and individual-specific clustering patterns were observed in the fecal microbiota of wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and tigers (Panthera tigris). We collected 95 fecal samples of 11 animal individuals that were each sampled over eight consecutive days and analyzed those with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16SrRNA gene. In order to identify species or individual clusters, we applied two different agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms - a community detection algorithm and Ward's linkage. Our results showed that both, species-specific and individual-specific clustering is possible, but more reliable results were achieved when applying dynamic time warping which finds the optimal alignment between different time series. Furthermore, the bacterial families that distinguish individuals from each other in both species included daily occurring core bacteria (e.g., Acidaminococcaceae in wildebeests or Clostridiaceae in tigers) as well as individual dependent and more fluctuating bacterial families. Our results suggest that while it is necessary to consider multiple consecutive samples per individual, it is then possible to characterize individual abundance patterns in fecal microbiota in both herbivorous and carnivorous species. This would allow establishing individual microbiota profiles of animals housed in zoos, which is a basic prerequisite to quickly detect deviations and use microbiome analysis as a non-invasive and cost-effective tool in animal welfare.

AB  - While soil salinization is a major concern for agriculture worldwide, the application of sodium (Na) can stimulate growth in many plant species, due to its ability to replace potassium (K) in some physiological functions. We present an overview of the potential and risks associated with replacing KCl fertilizer with a mixture of KCl and NaCl in tropical plantations, with a focus on Eucalyptus. A wide range of responses of Eucalyptus species to the salinization of the soil is well documented and the planting of Eucalyptus rows in salinity-damaged landscapes has been used in Australia to lower the water table and reduce soil salinization. A positive effect of NaCl application on Eucalyptus growth in K-deficient environments has been demonstrated in hydroponics, which is consistent with comprehensive studies conducted on entire rotations in Brazil. The addition of NaCl to K-deficient soils increased above-ground biomass at harvest in E. grandis plantations by a factor of 1.4, whereas the addition of the same amount of KCl increased biomass by a factor of 2. A comparison between KCl and K2SO4 applications suggested a positive response of E. grandis to Cl, in addition to the response to Na. The effects of Na application on the physiology of E. grandis support the hypothesis of a functional role for Na in K-deficient soils. Consistent results have been reported on the physiology of olive tree, coconut palm and cocoa tree. Atmospheric inputs of Na depend on the distance from the ocean, ranging from approximately 30 to 5 kg ha1 yr-1 in coastal and inland forests, respectively. Na is an essential nutrient for animals, maintaining homeostasis and playing a crucial role in neural networks. Substantial quantities of Na are routinely fed to animals in extensive livestock farming. A growing body of evidence suggests that a shortage of Na can limit the activity of insects, particularly plant decomposers. The application of Na in tropical plantations could therefore accelerate the release of nutrients during litter decomposition, thereby promoting tree growth. However, Na application could also stimulate herbivory and lead to leaf area losses. We recommend setting up multi-location experiments covering a wide range of soils and climates in tropical regions, for perennial species of commercial interest. In-depth studies should be carried out on certain sites to understand how tree physiology, soil functioning and herbivory are influenced by the addition of NaCl.

AB  - The trend of global cooling across the Cenozoic transformed the North American landscape from closed forest to more open grasslands, resulting in dietary adaptations in herbivores in response to shifting resources. In contrast, the material properties of the predator food source (muscle, skin, and bone) have remained constant over this transition, suggesting a corresponding lack of change in predator dietary adaptations. We investigated the North American mammalian predator fossil record using a tooth-shape metric and body mass, predicting that the former would exhibit stability. Instead, we found that mean molar morphology became more blade-like, with our tooth-shape metric sharply increasing in the late Eocene and remaining high from the Oligocene onward. Subsequent tests in extant carnivorans reveal taxa with more bladelike teeth are prevalent in more open environments. Our results reveal an unexpected functional shift among North American predators in response to large-scale environmental changes across the Cenozoic.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, maintaining soil fertility, and carbon sequestration in soil. However, our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms and driving factors of microbial community structure in non-calcareous fluvo-aquic soil under different fertilization treatments remains limited. A field experiment was designed with winter wheat-summer maize rotation system started in 1978. Five treatments were selected: CK (no fertilizers); N (nitrogen); NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium); M (60,000 kg pig manure ha-1); MN (60,000 kg pig manure + 276 kg N ha-1). The results showed that N, NPK, M and MN treatment significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) by 22.7% and 38.8%, 23.1% and 30.5%, 113.4% and 141.6%, 167.1% and 304.1% compared to CK, respectively. Long-term fertilization (NPK, M, and MN) alters the structure of soil microbial communities through improvements in soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and soil enzyme activities. Additionally, pig manure application significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Pezizomycetes (35.9%) and Firmicutes (23.4%). Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that TN and SOC are the primary factors driving the changes in soil bacterial communities. TN and catalase activity are the main factors driving the changes in the soil fungal community. Overall, long-term fertilization, especially the addition of organic resources, can strengthen the biological regulation processes in soil ecosystems to maintain or enhance soil fertility.

AB  - The endangered Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis) has a large portion of its range within a military operations area in southwestern Arizona, USA. Sonoran pronghorn have been actively managed in this region for more than 20 years. Recovery efforts have included release of captive-born pronghorn into areas both currently and historically occupied by wild pronghorn. These areas provide habitat for federally endangered essential and experimental non-essential, referred to as 10(j), pronghorn populations. More than 20 years of monitoring efforts have resulted in a large dataset on their spatial occurrence and movement within these areas. To synthesize long-term trends and seasonality in Sonoran pronghorn movement and mortality, we employed a suite of quantitative analyses that characterized the pronghorns' 1) individual and population-level home ranges, 2) occurrence near active military targets, 3) trends in seasonal group sizes and composition, 4) sex- and group-specific survivorship, and 5) changes in movement-based behavior following release from captivity. We found strong seasonal trends throughout, including sex-specific differences in seasonal movement rates, home ranges, survival, and group composition. Further, captive-born pronghorn released into the endangered population exhibited markedly higher survival compared to those released in 10(j) areas. Captive-born pronghorn exhibited significant seasonal use of active military target areas. These analyses, which represent the most comprehensive analysis of Sonoran pronghorn movement and survival to date, have important implications for the future conservation and management of this endangered species. Our results indicate that active management of endangered Sonoran pronghorn has successfully increased survival, and we recommend maintaining or increasing current recovery efforts, such as captive breeding and placement of supplemental resources throughout their range (e.g., freestanding water and supplemental forage), to further boost the survivorship of both wild- and captive-born pronghorn. Moreover, future management efforts could use our seasonality results to create dynamic prediction models of when and where pronghorn are likely to overlap with military activities to best manage interactions. Our methods have added application to other mobile species of conservation interest occurring in disturbed and resource-limited landscapes.

AB  - Methane seep communities on the Koryak slope in the Bering Sea were discovered in 2018 during the 82nd cruise of the RV Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev using ROV Comanche 18. Methane seeps found between 400 m and 695 m depth are the northernmost chemosynthesis-based habitats (similar to 61 degrees N) known to date in the Pacific. Macrofauna species composition and community structure of methane seep and background benthic communities were investigated at three depth horizons: 400-402 m, 417-429 m and 647-695 m.
   A total of 335 macrofaunal species were identified. At the depth 647-695 m the species richness in the methane seep communities was 265 species and 72 species in the background. The deepest seep communities were characterized by the highest species richness, relatively high evenness and strong variations in the composition and structure. At shallower depths the species richness was low: 33-34 species at methane seeps and 66-71 in the background. The methane seep communities at shallow depths showed relatively low evenness and low diversity of community structure. The highest species richness at the greatest depth can be related in part to increased habitat heterogeneity associated with carbonate crusts and vesicomyid clam beds occurring only at deeper methane seeps. The deepest methane seep communities were dominated by the chemosymbiotrophic pliocardiine Calyptogena pacifica; dominant in the background was the ophiumid Ophiophthalmus normani. At shallower methane seeps only single specimens of C. pacifica were found. The shallower methane seeps were dominated by the background species despite numerous extensive bacterial mats and high potential toxicity of the environment. The seep community at 417-429 m was dominated by the echinoid Brisaster latifrons with population density on the bacterial mat four times higher than in the background. Four chemosymbiotrophic species were recorded at 647-695 m and only one was found at shallower depths. Potentially obligate to reducing habitats polychaetes of the genus Neosabellides and Ophryotrocha occurred in methane seep communities at all depths. Further geochemical, geological and microbiological studies are required to better characterize differences of methane seeps at different depths and reasons of these differences.

AB  - Animals determine their daily movement trajectories in response to a network of ecological processes, including interactions with other organisms, their memories of previous events, and the changing environment. These combine to cause the emergent space use patterns observed over longer periods of time, such as a whole season. Understanding which processes cause these patterns to emerge, and how, requires a process-based modelling approach. Individual-based decisions can be described as a system of partial-differential equations (PDEs) to produce a dynamic description of space use built from the underlying movement process. Here we combine PDE-based models with step-selection analysis to investigate the combined effects of three established ecological processes that partially shape movement and space use: 1) a heterogeneous environment; 2) the environmental markings of moving conspecifics; and 3) the memory of direct interactions with conspecifics. We apply this framework to a large GPS-based dataset of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in the southeastern US. We fit models at the population level to provide predictive models, then tailor these to fit individual deer. We specifically incorporate relationships between each possible pair of deer and define each animal's responses to their unique local environments using separate integrated step-selection analyses. We show how individual movements and decisions yield emergent patterns in animal distributions, and we provide a full generalised description of the framework so that it may be applied to any species simultaneously responding to multiple potentially interacting stimuli (e.g. sociality, morphology, etc.). We found that the population of bucks had highly varied preferences for vegetation, but were shaping their space use in response to conspecific interactions, dependent on the individual relationships between two deer. We advocate for increased consideration of individual-based movement rules as determinants of realized animal space use, and particularly how these affect emergent distributions of entire species.

AB  - Stable isotopes of animal tissue have been used to estimate diet for many consumer species and places, but the ability to assign contributions to all food items is limited by the number of tracers used, and the separation of the tracer data among the dietary sources. We tested whether we could detect caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in the diet of individual predators in southwest Canada, where caribou are endangered. The separation between caribou tissue and that of other common prey was minimal using C13 and N15 isotope ratios and our confidence in assigning the caribou diet fraction correctly was low despite testing several fractionation values and priors. We measured the concentration of a suite of elements in the tissue of lichen, large prey and predators to investigate whether we could use an elemental concentration as a diet tracer and better assign the caribou diet fraction, because several of these elements were known to be more abundant in lichen, a major food for caribou in winter. Strontium and cesium had higher concentrations, when normalized by a common salt (we chose calcium), in caribou tissue than the other prey species we measured; this was also true for strontium isotope ratios. The elemental tracers appeared to overestimate caribou in the diet however, we suggest that the addition of either cation could yield finer and more accurate estimates of diet for large terrestrial predators after further investigation. The addition of a strontium isotope ratio tracer to a diet investigation may be equally informative and require less pre-work, because one ratio (Sr87/Sr86) has already been well studied.

AB  - The archaeological sequence at western Lake Constance is famous for the high-density of Late Neolithic lakeshore settlements. Recent excavations uncovered Middle Neolithic (MN) sites near the prehistoric lakeshore, with the site Reichenau-B33 providing a bioarchaeological assemblage. Anthracological, carpological, and archaeozoological results from Reichenau-B33, embedded in the analysis of a large bioarchaeological dataset, covering Early Neolithic (Linearbandkeramik) and MN (Hinkelstein, Grossgartach, R & ouml;ssen) assemblages from southwest Germany allow elucidating subsistence adaptations of these first farmers. Wood exploitation targeted the site's hinterland, relying mainly on oak, beech and ash. The charred carpological assemblage reveals typical MN crops with naked barley, emmer, and einkorn, while pulses and oil crops are very rare. Two Chenopodium album seeds concentrations reflect the routine exploitation of wild plants also mirrored at several other MN sites. The faunal assemblage of Reichenau-B33 is dominated by red deer (>70%) and includes low proportions of domestic pig and sheep/goat. Thus, the first farmers at Lake Constance adapted to a forested landscape, in which clearings for settlements and fields likely attracted wild herbivores that were routinely hunted. This focus on red deer hunting may have been an opportunistic response, allowing obtaining animal resources while conserving the small herds of livestock and protecting crop fields.

AB  - Australia's largest land carnivore, the dingo, has been targeted by control programs in many agricultural landscapes since European settlement because of the judgement that dingoes cause costs to producers through the killing of livestock. As Australian pastoralists, we challenge the assumption that dingoes will only cause costs to producers. Based on our personal experiences and from research, we provide an alternative view, namely that in certain circumstances, there are major economic and ecological benefits of maintaining dingoes in grazing landscapes by controlling the unmanaged grazing pressure. As cattle producers, we have obtained significant financial gains for our family businesses, and environmental benefits on our properties by maintaining dingoes. Dingoes greatly reduce high-density populations of larger kangaroo species and some feral animals, especially goats. Such unmanaged grazing is persistently identified as a major factor in landscape degradation across large areas of Australian rangelands. The Australian pastoral industry as a whole, and the government departments that support it, need to evaluate, consider and discuss the economic and ecological benefits as well as the costs of maintaining dingoes in Australian pastoral landscapes.

AB  - Wildlife contend with seasonal fluctuations in resource availability and have adapted survival and reproductive strategies to overcome resource limitations. Many northern ungulates are adapted to a dynamic nutritional landscape and rely on somatic reserves accumulated during the short growing season. Moose (Alces alces) populations in the boreal forest respond to variation in their nutritional landscapes that quickly change after wildland fires. We tested associations between somatic energy reserves of female moose and a suite of factors relevant to energy demands and nutrient availability after landscape scale wildland fires on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. From 2015-2022, we immobilized 97 individual, adult moose (n=163 early winter; n=98 late winter) and collected over 223,000 GPS locations. We evaluated if somatic energy reserves of cow moose were influenced by endogenous or exogenous energy demands, or access to moose forage to accumulate energy reserves. Cows that gave birth and lost their neonate(s) early in the summer had more early winter body fat (14.39% +/- 0.24SE) compared with cows that gave birth and the neonate survived to 4-months-old (10.59% +/- 0.34SE). Body fat measured in early winter was positively correlated with home ranges of cows during summer with a higher percent cover of aspen forage. Late winter body fat of cow moose was negatively correlated with home ranges with higher percent cover of aspen forage, but positively correlated with home ranges with higher percent cover of willows and shoulder season forages. Our results highlight that a suite of plant species and seral states is needed across the landscape for moose to accumulate and moderate the loss of somatic energy reserves over the year. Furthermore, our results emphasize the importance of shoulder season forages for moose when snow depth is low. Managing the nutritional landscape of the boreal forest through interagency wildland fire management could create a mosaic of seral states that enhances moose forage, while reducing wildland fire hazards along the wildland urban interface and providing ecosystem services.

AB  - Alien plant invasion success can be inhibited by two key biotic factors: native herbivores and plant diversity. However, few studies have experimentally tested whether these factors interact to synergistically resist invasion success, especially factoring in changing global environments (e.g. nutrient enrichment). Here we tested how the synergy between native herbivores and plant diversity affects alien plant invasion success in various nutrient conditions. For this purpose, we exposed alien plant species in potmesocosms to different levels of native plant diversity (4 vs. 8 species), native generalist herbivores, and high and low soil nutrient levels. We found that generalist herbivores preferred alien plants to native plants, inhibiting invasion success in a native community. This inhibition was amplified by highly diverse native communities. Further, the amplified effect between herbivory and native plant diversity was independent of nutrient conditions. Our results suggest that a higher diversity of native communities can strengthen the resistance of native generalist herbivores to alien plant invasions by enhancing herbivory tolerance. The synergistic effect remains in force in nutrient-enriched habitats that are always invaded by alien plant species. Our results shed light on the effective control of plant invasions using multi-trophic means, even in the face of future global changes.

AB  - Giant deer Megaloceros giganteus (Blumenbach, 1799) fossils are commonly found in Lateglacial deposits throughout Ireland. While their migrational behaviour has been suggested, it has never been researched. We hypothesise that giant deer underwent seasonal migrations, specifically during Late Pleistocene cold periods as a behavioural adaptation. Giant deer required a high nutrient uptake and were maladapted to the cold-dry steppe of the Pleistocene glacials. Migration allowed for optimal nutrient uptake during summer, while avoiding the harsh winter conditions of the glacials by moving to sheltered, low-lying areas. In this study strontium isotope analysis (Sr-87/Sr-86) of sequentially sampled dental enamel is conducted for the first time on giant deer that were previously sampled in the same manner for delta C-13 and delta O-18, allowing correlations between the isotope data sets. One specimen from Ballybetagh, Dublin generated results indicating seasonal mobility behaviour. This individual was perhaps pushed to migrate at the Younger Dryas stadial onset as the vegetation giant deer depended on disappeared in Ireland. Adaptive mobility behaviour in response to climate was perhaps imperative to their survival through previous glacial periods, but other Eurasian populations would need to be analysed to make such a general conclusion.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances drive global biodiversity loss, necessitating continuous conservation efforts to protect threatened species through reintroductions. Post-reintroduction success depends critically on interspecific interactions between reintroduced populations and sympatric native or invasive species. We used camera-trapping data collected in the urban landscape of Shanghai to examine how native Chinese hare (Lepus sinensis) and free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) impacted the spatiotemporal behavior of reintroduced Chinese water deer (Hydropotes inermis). Results indicate that the deer exhibited an uncommon unimodal diurnal activity pattern and temporally avoided sympatric mammals. Chinese water deer tended to avoid areas frequently used by both dogs and hares. Deer adopted fine-scale spatial-temporal segregation to avoid direct encounters with pack-hunting dogs during the day, prompting deer to increase their daytime activity. Consequently, a notable decrease in dusk activity was observed, which may represent an adaptive strategy to further separate from hares temporally, ultimately facilitating coexistence between these species. Evaluating the trade-offs between spatial and temporal responses is crucial for developing management practices and ensuring the long-term sustainability of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Although the widespread effects of climate change impact almost all ecosystems, we lack a detailed understanding of how wildlife that thrive in human-dominated environments are able to adjust their life history to modifications in land use of their natural habitat. In particular, spatial variation in environmental conditions is predicted to influence body development during the crucial early life phase, with marked impacts on individual performance and population dynamics for long-lived species. Large herbivores have increased substantially in number and distribution over the last half century across Europe. The synanthropic roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has been particularly successful, gradually colonizing agricultural landscapes. However, little is known about how habitat heterogeneity in this heavily human-impacted environment impacts demographic performance. Specifically, we predicted that fawns born in predominantly cultivated local habitats would achieve faster early development due to the food subsidies obtained from agricultural crops by their mothers. Contrary to our expectations, fawns in semi-natural forest were around 10% heavier at birth than those born in more mixed (by 0.163 +/- 0.058 kg) and open (by 0.169 +/- 0.006 kg) agricultural habitats. However, the body mass of all fawns subsequently increased at a similar average rate (0.148 +/- 0.058 kg/day) over the first 20 days of life, irrespective of their habitat. This habitat-dependent variation in early life mass appeared to be driven by reproductive phenology, as (1) early-born fawns were heavier than late-born fawns, and (2) mothers living in forest gave birth around 10 days earlier than those living in the mixed and open sectors. Semi-natural habitats might thus be the more suitable for fawn early development, despite the availability and abundance of energetically rich food resources for lactating mothers in open and mixed habitats.

AB  - Despite decades of commercial harvest of bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinelIus) from Jamestown Reservoir, North Dakota, and the recent rapid growth of sport bowfishing that targets this species, there is a lack of biological information on this native catostomid. At present, no-limit recreational and commercial harvest of bigmouth buffalo occurs in North Dakota, with no harvest-reporting for recreational take. A long-lived life history was recently documented for this species, with a life-span exceeding 100 years. At Jamestown Reservoir, bigmouth buffalo were aged to 58 years of age, with onset of sexual maturity 10 years for females. Evidence for episodic recruitment over a 60-year period was in 1962-1979,1993-2011, and 2017, with recruitment success more likely during non-drought periods. Annual commercial harvest data from this reservoir indicate bigmouth buffalo have declined significantly over the past 30 years, most precipitously since 2010 during the bowfishing era. The demographic patterns, episodic recruitment, and harvest changes observed in this population are relevant for informing management of bigmouth buffalo and other long-lived freshwater fishes.

AB  - Active forest management and maintenance or restoration of biodiversity are intertwined. We describe several Central European forest types through typical management cycles and identify synergies and trade-offs with biodiversity conservation. Synergies emerge when the maintenance of forest structures supporting recognized human needs for biomass production create diverse habitats. On the stand level, relevant are tending interventions during stand development, the length of the production cycle, and the choice of tree species. Thinning promotes forest productivity, enhances structural heterogeneity, and the habitat diversity for many species groups. The vertical and horizontal diversity on the stand level is high in uneven-aged multi-species forests. The choice of the rotation period is controversial, because no balance between forest productivity, stand stability, and habitat quality is yet negotiated. On the landscape level heterogeneity arises when many actors implement a range of silvicultural concepts and management intensities. Deadwood of different dimensions provides multiple habitats and enhances biodiversity, but causes challenges for forest protection in some forest types. A possible compromise is setting aside unmanaged interconnected units with veteran trees (stepping-stone habitats). Damage caused by wildlife is an un-resolved issue in Central European forests. High ungulate populations are reducing the potentially emerging diversity of tree species by selective browsing. A controversial topic is the introduction of non-native tree species, potentially filling in where native tree species cannot cope with expected future site conditions. Their introduction may lead into uncharted territory with respect to biotic threats. In conclusion, the knowledge-based discourse between nature conservation and forest management needs to be continued to further develop the successful concept of multiple-use forestry.

AB  - Evaluating plant functional traits helps to understand how plants respond to changing environmental conditions and resource availability associated with disturbance events. Livestock production is one of the primary drivers of tropical forest loss and degradation. Livestock alter environmental conditions within the forest by grazing, trampling and nutrient inputs, which in turn can influence species composition and functional traits of species. Understanding how livestock influence functional traits along a successional gradient is poorly understood. Here, we studied the effect of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits and soil nutrients in secondary and old-growth tropical dry forests. We analyzed plant functional traits of the most important species in successional and old-growth forest communities in both cattle present and cattle excluded plots. Our results showed the effects of cattle grazing and fallow age on plant functional traits, with fallow age explaining more variation than cattle grazing. In early succession, functional traits were associated with water conservation (thicker leaves, lower specific leaf area), and in later successional they were linked with sunlight conservation (larger height, higher specific leaf area). The presence of large fruits and seeds in advanced successional sites suggests high resource availability, which may help plants to successfully reproduce. Moreover, under cattle grazing some functional traits are associated with herbivory defense (high foliar dry weight and thick leaves). Even though N and C increased as succession advanced, the sites with cattle grazing had higher NH4 and NO3 concentrations as a result of fecal deposition. Plant functional traits responded to fallow age than to cattle grazing. Our study showed that cattle exclusion, as a management and biodiversity conservation strategy, contributes positively to soil nutrition. Thus, fallow age and cattle exclusion facilitate soil recovery and allows establishing species with suitable functional attributes for overcoming environmental filters in abandoned cattle fields.

AB  - In nutrient-poor wildlife reserves it has become common-practice to provide supplemental mineral resources for wildlife. Yet, the impacts of anthropogenic mineral supplementation on large herbivore nutrition, behaviour, and subsequent impact on ecosystem processes have received little attention. Here, we examine the contribution of anthropogenic mineral lick provision to wildlife nutrient intake across a community of mammalian herbivores (>10 kg) in the southern Kalahari Desert. Based on predicted daily nutrient intake and a faecal nutrient assessment, many large herbivore species appear deficient in phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), or zinc (Zn). For these nutrients, anthropogenic salt and mineral licks constitute an important source of nutrient intake helping to reduce or overcome requirement deficits. Larger-bodied species disproportionately consumed licks, acquiring more nutritional benefits. A comprehensive assessment of animal body condition indicated that, in general, large herbivores display good health. However, bulk grazers, non-ruminants and females displayed poorer body condition. We discuss how provisioning of anthropogenic mineral licks may inflate large herbivore populations beyond the long-term carrying capacity of the reserve by decoupling wildlife fecundity from nutrient-related feedbacks on population growth. Over time, this could compromise ecosystem integrity through habitat degradation, modified species interactions and trophic cascades. Based on results presented here, it is clear that anthropogenic provisioning of mineral licks should be considered cautiously by wildlife managers aiming to conserve natural processes in landscapes.

AB  - A reasonable hydrological regime is of great significance for ecosystem services and wildlife habitat management in river-connected lakes. Shengjin Lake is a Ramsar site with international importance for wintering migratory waterbirds. Since the Huangpen River sluice began operations, the lake's hydrological rhythm was changed. We investigated the effect of different hydrological conditions under water level control on the abundance of waterbird foraging guilds using habitat as an intermediary. First, linear models of 12 years dataset (2008-2019) based on waterbird surveys and satellite remote sensing images were constructed to analyse the relationship between habitat area and water level. Then, generalized linear mixed models were used to explore the effects of habitat area on abundance in different waterbird foraging guilds. Finally, the abundance of each type of waterbird guild was predicted at intervals of 0.10 m at the water level. Overall, 60% of the abundance of waterbird foraging guilds could be explained by water level with habitat as an intermediary, and this was affected by the rate of change of their preferred habitat area with water level increase. When the water level was less than 10.2 m, the meadow area was negatively correlated with the D80 water level (average water level of 71-80 days before waterbirds wintering), which was the main factor that affected tuber foragers and seed foragers/dabbling waterbirds. The abundance of food for these herbivorous waterbirds during the middle wintering was affected by the exposed tidal flat area in October, which provided suitable conditions for the secondary growth of grass. Starting from 10.20 m, waterbird abundance rapidly reduced with a sharply increasing water area, which was influenced by artificial sluice control and reduced rainfall. Therefore, management should be focused on appropriately lowering the water level in the early wintering period. Considering the suitable habitat area, hysteresis of meadow growth, and residential water demand, a water level control scheme was recommended to be 8.65-9.50 m in the early wintering period, 8.11-8.80 m in the middle wintering period, and 8.09-9.40 m in the late wintering period. The results of this study will help to promote the reasonable water level control for the lakes as the wintering grounds of migratory waterbirds. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Livestock grazing is common and widespread in the high Andean region; however, few studies have evaluated the effects of traditional camelid grazing (llamas and alpacas) on small and medium sized mammals. We studied small mammals in Sajama National Park in Bolivia. We evaluated the association between livestock abundance and 1) the abundance of small mammals, and 2) small mammal activity patterns. In a grid of 36 sampling stations, small mammals were divided into two study groups, according to their body size and the trophic group. We assessed small mammal abundances with grids of live capture traps and vizcacha with camera traps. We performed GLM and Basic Kernel Density estimation analyses for associations between livestock abundance and abundance of small mammals, and small mammal activity patterns, respectively. The presence of mountain vizcacha and rodents was less likely where livestock abundance was higher. Herbivores and granivores, but not omnivores, were also negatively affected by higher livestock abundance. The diurnal activity patterns of mountain vizcachas declined when livestock abundance was higher. We suggest some alternatives for livestock management plans to minimize the negative effects of traditional livestock on small mammals.

AB  - Many Galapagos giant tortoises make seasonal migrations from arid lowlands in the wet season, to humid highlands in the dry season. However, for critically endangered Western Santa Cruz giant tortoises (Chelonoidis porteri), at least 88% of the habitat in the highlands is now used for agriculture. To understand the impact of agricultural land use on tortoise behavior, we conducted 242 30-minute observations of tortoises on farms. We (1) recorded the time tortoises spent eating, walking, and resting in three different land-use types, (2) measured their temperature, and (3) quantified their selection of fine-scale vegetation characteristics. We found that tortoises rest for significantly longer periods when they are in abandoned land, compared to livestock, grazing, and touristic land. Generally, tortoises rested for longer when they were cooler. Time spent eating was increased by the density and proportion of ground vegetation, while time spent walking was reduced by tall vegetation. These findings suggest that the distribution of land-use types and the fine-scale composition of thermoregulatory and grazing resources within farmland have important implications for the behavior of tortoises while in human-modified land. Wildlife managers and landowners wishing to support tortoises on farms should focus on rehabilitating abandoned land and encouraging a heterogenous mix of sun and shade, and short ground vegetation across land-use types.

AB  - Deltaic landscapes go through cycles of birth, growth, decline, and death governed by intertwined geological, biological, and ecological processes. In this study, we tracked deltaic lobes in the Balize Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana, USA, over 28 years (1984-2012). Hydrologic and geomorphic patterns as well as sustained patterns of wetland plant richness, diversity, and biomass are described. Plant diversity and biomass were modeled by nMDS ordination. Taxa (53) were harvested and dried (116,706 g) from 965 (0.25 m(2)) plots and divided into three groups: I. four foundation species, corresponding to 78.9% of the total harvest; II. nine pioneer species, corresponding to 13.6% of the total harvest; and III. all other taxa, corresponding to 7.5% of the total harvest (eight miscellaneous grasses, eight miscellaneous sedges, and twenty-four miscellaneous herbs). Autogenic/allogenic processes (sedimentation, subsidence, plant colonization, and succession events) affected composition and biomass. Eleven important species were identified. Taxon richness increased on mudflats during primary succession (fifteen to twenty-five taxa per site), then declined to fewer than five taxa per site. The niche space theory explained patterns of community change, with a similar total biomass/yr (similar to 500 g/m(2)/yr) at all study sites. Quantile regression analyses showed that the water quality and quantity of the Mississippi River influenced biomass, especially in springtime waters. Stochastic events (storms, herbivory, salt burn, and flood pulses) impacted biomass. Long-term studies like this are required in a future of climate unknowns.

AB  - Environmental change is multidimensional, with local anthropogenic stressors and global climate change interacting to differentially impact populations throughout a species' geographic range. Within species, the spatial distribution of phenotypic variation and its causes (i.e., local adaptation or plasticity) will determine species' adaptive capacity to respond to a changing environment. However, comparatively less is known about the spatial scale of adaptive differentiation among populations and how patterns of local adaptation might drive vulnerability to global change stressors. To test whether fine-scale (2-12 km) mosaics of environmental stress can cause adaptive differentiation in a marine foundation species, eelgrass (Zostera marina), we conducted a three-way reciprocal transplant experiment spanning the length of Tomales Bay, CA. Our results revealed strong home-site advantage in growth and survival for all three populations. In subsequent common garden experiments and feeding assays, we showed that countergradients in temperature, light availability, and grazing pressure from an introduced herbivore contribute to differential performance among populations consistent with local adaptation. Our findings highlight how local-scale mosaics in environmental stressors can increase phenotypic variation among neighboring populations, potentially increasing species resilience to future global change. More specifically, we identified a range-center eelgrass population that is pre-adapted to extremely warm temperatures similar to those experienced by low-latitude range-edge populations of eelgrass, demonstrating how reservoirs of heat-tolerant phenotypes may already exist throughout a species range. Future work on predicting species resilience to global change should incorporate potential buffering effects of local-scale population differentiation and promote a phenotypic management approach to species conservation.

AB  - Context Aerial shooting is an important tool for managing the economic and environmental impacts of widespread wild fallow deer populations in eastern Australia and could be crucial for mounting an effective response to an emergency animal disease incursion. However, there is a concern that the disturbance caused by aerial shooting could cause infected animals to disperse, thereby transmitting pathogens to previously uninfected areas. Aims We sought to describe the nature and extent of spatial behavioural changes in fallow deer exposed to aerial shooting to: (1) assess the risk that aerial shooting poses to disease spread, and (2) better understand how aerial shooting can contribute to routine deer management programs. Methods We contrasted movement rates, activity range areas, and daily activity patterns of 48 GPS-collared fallow deer before, during and after exposure to aerial shooting at three sites in New South Wales. Key results No collared deer left its pre-shoot activity range area during shooting or within 30 days after shooting finished. Observed behaviour changes included increased daily and hourly distance travelled by female deer during and after shooting, increased activity range areas for female deer after shooting, and increased nocturnal activity in female and male deer during shooting. However, observed changes were minor, temporary, localised, and variable among sites. Conclusions Collared deer showed strong site fidelity despite repeated intense disturbance and substantial population reductions. We found no evidence to support concerns that aerial shooting poses a hazard of disease spread. Implications Aerial shooting should be retained as a key control tool for managing wild fallow deer populations in Australia, including for reducing disease host population densities in the event of an emergency animal disease incursion.

AB  - Aim A primary goal of community ecology is to understand the mechanisms that drive species' spatial distribution and habitat associations. Species' geographic distribution can be influenced by the distribution of their prey partly because consumers' behaviour is oriented to optimal energy use during foraging. We analysed how differences in dietary preferences influence the spatial distribution and habitat associations of species at the landscape scale. We hypothesized that differences in feeding guilds will lead to divergent habitat association patterns among species. Location Amazon River drainage basin. Taxon Characiform fishes in the family Serrasalmidae (piranhas and pacus). Methods We used diet data to classify species into feeding guilds (frugivores, herbivores, piscivores, fin and scale feeders and planktivores). We used three proxies of habitat association derived from satellite products: floodplain extent, landscape heterogeneity and flood duration, in three distance buffers. We implemented phylogenetic generalized least squares models to evaluate the relationship between habitat association and feeding guilds. Results Frugivores, piscivores and fin and scale feeders presented similar patterns of habitat associations, with frugivores occupying wider areas of floodplain and greater landscape heterogeneity. Herbivores and planktivores were associated with smaller floodplain extents and lower landscape heterogeneity. All feeding guilds were associated with similar levels of flood duration. Main conclusions Differences in resource distribution (assessed through feeding guilds) can influence habitat association. Considering the hydrological variability (i.e. floodplain extent) and landscape heterogeneity that characterize floodplains, the patterns of habitat association vary with the spatial scale considered. This work highlights the importance of understanding species habitat associations by fish as well as food resource dynamics and floodplain dependence. This realization is critical for assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Many large carnivores, despite widespread habitat alteration, are rebounding in parts of their former ranges after decades of persecution and exploitation. Cougars (Puma concolor) are apex predator with their remaining northern core range constricted to mountain landscapes and areas of western North America; however, cougar populations have recently started rebounding in several locations across North America, including northward in boreal forest landscapes. A camera-trap survey of multiple landscapes across Alberta, Canada, delineated a range edge; within this region, we deployed an array of 47 camera traps in a random stratified design across a landscape spanning a gradient of anthropogenic development relative to the predicted expansion front. We completed multiple hypotheses in an information-theoretic framework to determine if cougar occurrence is best explained by natural land cover features, anthropogenic development features, or competitor and prey activity. We predicted that anthropogenic development features from resource extraction and invading white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virgianius) explain cougar distribution at this boreal range edge. Counter to our predictions, the relative activity of native prey, predominantly snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), was the best predictor of cougar occurrence at this range edge. Small-bodied prey items are particularly important for female and sub-adult cougars and may support breeding individuals in the northeast boreal forest. Also, counter to our predictions, there was not a strong relationship detected between cougar occurrence and gray wolf (Canis lupus) activity at this range edge. However, further investigation is recommended as the possibility of cougar expansion into areas of the multi-prey boreal system, where wolves have recently been controlled, could have negative consequences for conservation goals in this region (e.g. the recovery of woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou]). Our study highlights the need to monitor contemporary distributions to inform conservation management objectives as large carnivores recover across North America.

AB  - The rangelands form a precious heritage of an ancient agro-pastoral system in Saudi Arabia, known for its livestock based on camel. The extensive rangelands in the Tihama alluvial plain are facing a deterioration in climatic conditions. In the past, the monitoring of these rangelands, in general, was done by direct vegetation surveys in the field. Currently, researchers have greatly benefited from the contribution of remote sensing, especially with the eighth generation of Landsat satellite images, making it possible to provide values relating to the thermal emissivity of the ground surface, obtained in the two bands 10 and 11. This method allows the calculation of algorithms and the creation of advanced models. The creation of a multi-source database established on the exploitation of the Geographic Information System and remote sensing was necessary to identify the local conditions that have favored the resilience of the plant cover, and the identification of multiple intervention methods appropriate to each sector according to its state of resilience. The results revealed a reduction in soil temperature average, increasing from 29.5- 42.5 degrees C in 2013 to 38.2- 25.3 degrees C in 2022. These changes are accompanied by a significant expansion of the vegetation cover, estimated at 26% over the same period despite the substantial climate changes the region has experienced. In the Tihama plain the LST index is significantly influenced by the type of deposit, soil salinity, soil moisture, as well as the density of soil benches. On the adjacent eastern and north-eastern slopes, the values are much lower due to the altitude, the sheltered position, the inclination of the angle of incidence of the sun's rays and the disparity in the colours of the rocky outcrops.

AB  - To understand the multicellular composition of tissues, and how it is altered during development, ageing and/or disease, we must visualise the complete cellular landscape. Currently, this is hindered by our limited ability to combine multiple cellular markers. To overcome this, we adapted a highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) technique called 'Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity' (IBEX) to the zebrafish retina. We optimised fluorescent antibody micro- conjugation to perform sequential rounds of labelling on a single tissue to simultaneously visualise all major retinal cell types with 11 cell-specific antibodies. We further adapted IBEX to be compatible with fluorescent transgenic reporter lines, in situ hybridisation chain reaction (HCR), and whole-mount immunofluorescence (WMIF). We applied IBEX at multiple stages to study the spatial and temporal relationships between glia and neurons during retinal development. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of IBEX across species by testing it on the turquoise killifish ( Nothobranchius furzeri) and African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis) to glean large amounts of information from precious tissues. These techniques will revolutionise our ability to visualise multiple cell types in any organism where antibodies are readily available.

AB  - Juvenile growth rate is a critical demographic parameter, as it shortens the time to maturity and often dictates how long individuals remain vulnerable to predation. However, developing a mechanistic understanding of the factors determining growth rates can be difficult for wild populations. The gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is an ecosystem engineer threatened by habitat loss and deficient management of pinelands in the southeastern United States. We investigated the factors governing immature gopher tortoise growth and explored the use of drone-based imagery for habitat assessment by comparing predictive models based on ground-based plant surveys versus drone-derived data. From 2021 to 2022, we tracked and measured immature tortoises in native sandhill and human-modified, ruderal habitat in south-central Florida. Using quarterly, high-resolution drone imagery, we quantified plant cover types and vegetation indices at each occupied burrow and measured the frequency of occurrence of forage species by hand. Annual growth rates of immature tortoises in ruderal habitat were higher than those in sandhill and were the highest published for this species. Models based on drone-derived data were able to explain similar proportions of variation in growth as ground-collected measures of forage, especially during the late dry season when both types of models were most predictive. Habitat differences in forage nitrogen content were also more pronounced during this season, when dominant ground cover in ruderal habitat (bahiagrass) had much higher nitrogen content than dominant ground cover in sandhill (wiregrass). Despite concerns about potential growth-survival trade-offs, tortoises in ruderal habitat did not exhibit lower apparent survival. Our findings indicate that habitat dominated by nutritious non-native grass can provide a valuable supplement to native sandhill through the mechanism of increased growth rates due to higher forage quality. Finally, our study demonstrates that drone technology may facilitate management by providing less labor-intensive ways to assess habitat quality for this and other imperiled herbivores.

AB  - Background Migrations in temperate systems typically have two migratory phases, spring and autumn, and many migratory ungulates track the pulse of spring vegetation growth during a synchronized spring migration. In contrast, autumn migrations are generally less synchronous and the cues driving them remain understudied. Our goal was to identify the cues that migrants use in deciding when to initiate migration and how this is updated while en route. Methods We analyzed autumn migrations of Arctic barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) as a series of persistent and directional movements and assessed the influence of a suite of environmental factors. We fitted a dynamic-parameter movement model at the individual-level and estimated annual population-level parameters for weather covariates on 389 individual-seasons across 9 years. Results Our results revealed strong, consistent effects of decreasing temperature and increasing snow depth on migratory movements, indicating that caribou continuously update their migratory decision based on dynamic environmental conditions. This suggests that individuals pace migration along gradients of these environmental variables. Whereas temperature and snow appeared to be the most consistent cues for migration, we also found interannual variability in the effect of wind, NDVI, and barometric pressure. The dispersed distribution of individuals in autumn resulted in diverse environmental conditions experienced by individual caribou and thus pronounced variability in migratory patterns. Conclusions By analyzing autumn migration as a continuous process across the entire migration period, we found that caribou migration was largely related to temperature and snow conditions experienced throughout the journey. This mechanism of pacing autumn migration based on indicators of the approaching winter is analogous to the more widely researched mechanism of spring migration, when many migrants pace migration with a resource wave. Such a similarity in mechanisms highlights the different environmental stimuli to which migrants have adapted their movements throughout their annual cycle. These insights have implications for how long-distance migratory patterns may change as the Arctic climate continues to warm.

AB  - Extreme wildfire events, such as the Pantanal 2020 megafires, are expected to become more common. Assessing the impacts of such extreme events on wildlife is imperative for conservation planning. Direct observation of carcasses can provide valuable information on how these impacts relate to spatial heterogeneity. Here, we use double-observer carcass surveys to assess the numbers and spatial patterns of direct mortalities of medium- to large-sized mammals resulting from the Pantanal 2020 megafires in a large reserve (1080 km2) in the northern Pantanal wetland. Accounting for imperfect detection, we model the spatial variation in mortality occurrence and abundance, testing the effects of habitat-related variables and wildfire severity using multi-species N-mixture models. We found that 26 out of 27 species of medium and large-sized mammals died from the fires with a mean estimate of around 49 thousand individuals. The most affected species included capuchin monkeys, agoutis, peccaries, tapirs, brocket deer, tamanduas, coatis and capybaras. Direct mortality of mammals by wildfires was affected by landscape factors related to species habitats, species traits (probably related to escape or refuge strategies), and the intensity of the wildfires. Mortalities presented a general positive relationship with non-flooded forests (a fire-sensitive habitat in Pantanal) and with the severity of wildfires. Artificial water bodies, a common landscape structure in Pantanal, had 7.5 times more deaths than other areas. Synthesis and applications: With the approach used, we were able to: (i) identify mortality hotspots associated with landscape features; (ii) simultaneously identify the most affected species and assess the average relationships for all the assemblage of medium- and large-sized mammals. We discuss conservation and management actions in two contexts: species prioritization for rescuing and monitoring; and territory prioritization for fire prevention and fighting.

A observa & ccedil;& atilde;o diretas de carca & ccedil;as pode fornecer informa & ccedil;& otilde;es valiosas sobre como esses impactos se relacionam com a heterogeneidade espacial da paisagem. N & oacute;s usamos amostragens de carca & ccedil;as com protocolo de observadores duplos para estimar os n & uacute;meros e avaliar os padr & otilde;es espaciais da mortalidade direta de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte resultantes dos megainc & ecirc;ndios de 2020 em uma reserva (1080 km2) no Pantanal Norte.

Encontramos que 26 de 27 esp & eacute;cies de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte morreram diretamente devido aos inc & ecirc;ndios, com uma estimativa m & eacute;dia de em torno de 49 mil indiv & iacute;duos. As esp & eacute;cies mais afetadas incluem macacos-prego, cutias, catetos, queixadas, antas, veados mateiro e catingueiro, tamandu & aacute;s-mirins, quatis e capivaras. A mortalidade direta de mam & iacute;feros pelo fogo foi influenciada por aspectos da paisagem relacionados ao h & aacute;bitat das esp & eacute;cies, por caracter & iacute;sticas das esp & eacute;cies provavelmente relacionadas a estrat & eacute;gias de fuga ou ref & uacute;gio e pela intensidade dos inc & ecirc;ndios. As mortalidades apresentaram uma rela & ccedil;& atilde;o positiva geral com florestas n & atilde;o-alag & aacute;veis (um h & aacute;bitat sens & iacute;vel ao fogo no Pantanal) e com a severidade dos inc & ecirc;ndios. Tanques (pequenos lagos artificiais), uma estrutura comum na paisagem do Pantanal, apresentou 7,5 vezes mais mortes do que em outras & aacute;reas.

AB  - Mainstream biodiversity conservation continues to emphasise the rapid disappearance of charismatic megafauna. Fungi are ignored, partially because many are invisible. However, their conservation is of growing concern because their decline signals a decrease in overall biodiversity and losses in ecosystem integrity and function. Social science engagement with microbes is of growing interest because the diverse characteristics of fungal bodies create new entry points for conservation. Using data collected over three years from literature review, lab ethnography, and interviews, this paper develops two new concepts intended to operate at the intersection of these discussions. A review of the fungal conservation literature finds mainstream species conservation an ill fit for fungi. Drawing from the literature on ecosystem function and conservation biopolitics, I introduce the term 'functional collectives' to reframe the role of fungi in nature through a focus on fungal bodies. Acknowledging the extraordinary diversity of fungi and their relative unknowability, I further introduce the concept of 'conservation of abundance'. A focus on abundance rather than scarcity meets the needs expressed by fungal conservationists for habitat protection and conservation based on available knowledge. Both concepts align with the biophysical realities of fungi while also answering growing calls within social conservation for conviviality and care.

AB  - Background: Ticks are ectoparasites that transmit a variety of pathogens that cause many diseases in livestock which can result in skin damage, weight loss, anemia, reduced production of meat and milk, and mortality. Aim: The aim of this study was to identify tick species and the distribution on livestock hosts (sheep, goat, dairy cattle, and buffalo) of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and Islamabad from October 2019 to November 2020. Materials and Methods: Surveillance was performed to calculate the prevalence of ticks on livestock. Tick prevalence data (area, host, breed, gender, age, and seasonal infestation rate) was recorded and analyzed. Results: A total of 2080 animals were examined from selected farms, and, of these, 1129 animals were tick-infested. A total of 1010 male tick samples were identified to species using published keys. Haemaphysalis punctata, Haemaphysalis sulcata, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma excavatum, Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma rufipes, Rhipicephalus decoloratus Rhipicephalus microplus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus were collected from goats, sheep, buffalo, and cattle. The overall rates of tick infestation on livestock were 34.83% (buffalo), 57.11% (cattle), 51.97% (sheep) and 46.94% (goats). Within each species, different breeds demonstrated different proportions of infestation. For cattle breeds, infestation proportions were as follows: Dhanni (98.73%), Jersey (70.84%) and the Australian breed of cattle (81.81%). The Neeli Ravi breed (40%) of buffalo and the Beetal breed (57.35%) of goats were the most highly infested for these species. Seasonally, the highest prevalence of infestation (76.78%) was observed in summer followed by 70.76% in spring, 45.29% in autumn, and 20% in winter. The prevalence of tick infestation in animals also varied by animal age. In goats, animals aged 4-6 years showed the highest prevalence (90%), but in cattle, the prevalence of ticks was highest (68.75%) in 6 months-1-year-old animals. 1-3 years old buffalo (41.07%) and 6 months-1 year sheep (65.78%) had the highest prevalence rate. Females had significantly higher infestation rates (61.12%, 55.56% and 49.26%, respectively) in cattle, sheep, and goats. In buffalo, males showed a higher prevalence (38.46%) rate. Conclusions: This study showed tick diversity, infestation rate, and numerous factors (season, age, and gender of host) influencing tick infestation rate in different breeds of cattle, sheep, goats, and buffalo in Punjab Province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, and Islamabad, Pakistan. Higher tick burdens and rates of tick-borne disease reduce production and productivity in animals. Understanding tick species' prevalence and distribution will help to develop informed control measures.

AB  - Climatic warming affects plant growth and physiology, yet how warming alters chemistry in invasive plants and indirectly affects herbivorous insects remains largely unknown. Here, we explored warming-induced changes in leaf chemistry of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides and its native congener Alternanthera sessilis, and further examined how these changes affected the performance of the herbivores, Cassida piperata and Spodoptera litura. We conducted a simulated warming experiment to address its effects on 13 leaf chemical traits of A. philoxeroides and A. sessilis. We measured growth and development time of two herbivores reared on plants from warming or ambient controls. Warming significantly affected leaf chemistry composition for both the invasive and native Alternanthera. Warming decreased nitrogen concentration in A. philoxeroides and increased total flavonoid and total phenol concentration in A. sessilis. The effects of warming on nutrients (i.e. fructose, sucrose, total soluble sugar and starch) varied with individual chemicals and plant species. Weight of C. piperata pupal and S. litura larval reared on warming-treated A. sessilis significantly decreased compared with non-warmed control, and a similar pattern was observed for weight of S. litura larval feeding on warming-treated A. philoxeroides. In addition, warming-treated A. sessilis significantly prolonged larval development time of S. litura. These results indicate that warming can directly affect the leaf chemistry in both invasive plant and its native congener, but these effects vary by species. Such differences in warming-induced changes in plant chemistry could indirectly affect herbivorous insects associated with the invasive and native plants.

AB  - The dietary guild structure of ungulate communities is a useful paleoecological tool for understanding the context of hominin paleobiology and evolution. Ungulates are well represented in the fossil record, and their dietary preferences reflect those of major habitat types. However, paleoecology relies on modern ecological patterns as analogs for recreating ecologies of the past. It has previously been sug-gested that for much of the Pliocene, no such modern analogs exist for the herbivore communities associated with hominins in eastern Africa. This study aims to determine whether the ungulate com-munity associated with A. afarensis at the Pliocene site of Laetoli, Tanzania, shares similarities with extant communities or whether it lacks a modern analog. Our multiproxy approach using mesowear, hyp-sodonty, and stable carbon isotopes of tooth enamel to infer the diets of ungulates in the Upper Laetolil Beds shows that this community is dominated by browsers and mixed feeders and has a very low prevalence of grazers and frugivores. This dietary guild composition distinguishes the Upper Laetolil Beds from modern African communities and suggests either that the Upper Laetolil Beds had a unique vegetation structure which was able to support a higher diversity of browsing ungulates than that exists in African ecosystems today or that it retained an ungulate community that was resilient to environ-mental change. The Upper Laetolil Beds ungulate community is also unique relative to other mid-Pliocene communities in eastern Africa, some of which are similar to extant communities, while others, such as Laetoli, lack modern counterparts. This suggests that A. afarensis was a eurytopic species that inhabited a variety of ecosystems, including those with and without modern analogs. The co-occurrence of both analog and nonanalog communities in the Pliocene suggests that the trans-formation toward ungulate communities of modern aspect occurred asynchronously in eastern Africa.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With ongoing climate change and increasing human activities, shrub expansion has been observed worldwide. Alpine meadows are one of the ecosystem types that are sensitive to shrub expansion. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an actinorhizal shrub species on nitrogen (N) status of the soil and other plants in the alpine meadow ecosystem. We measured the N-15 natural abundance and N concentration of different tissues of Hippophae tibetana, and examined its effects on the N-15 natural abundance and N content of the soil and neighboring plants at different locations surrounding the shrub clumps in an alpine meadow in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results show that the delta N-15 in branches and roots of H. tibetana was much lower, and N concentration much higher, than that of other plants. delta N-15 of the plants and soil surrounding the shrub clumps was not significantly altered. Underneath the shrub canopy, due to the N-rich leaf litter of H. tibetana, N content of neighboring plants significantly increased compared to plants at other locations. However, the aboveground biomass of neighboring plants was marginally lower underneath the canopy than outside. These results suggest a minor N-facilitation effect of this actinorhizal shrub on the soil and neighboring plants through its N-rich leaf litter. However, the facilitation effect was not enough to offset the negative effect of the shrub on its neighboring plants due to competition of other resources.

AB  - Intercropped systems are regarded as a promising strategy for generating multiple benefits to the ecosystems in the rubber-plantation zone. However, knowledge about the impacts of intercropped systems with rubber on carbon and nitrogen storage in soils and their affecting factors is limited. In this study, three rubber-based intercropped systems, including rubber intercropped with Theobroma cacao, Coffea liberica, and Camellia sinensis, as well as rubber monoculture, were selected in Xishuangbanna, a typical rubber plantation zone in China. We collected soil samples from 0-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm depths to analyze soil bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), pH, the ratio of carbon and nitrogen (C/N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The results showed that rubber trees intercropped with C. liberica significantly increased the SOC and TN stocks of the 0-40 cm soil layer by 19.9% and 13.6%, respectively, compared to rubber monoculture. Soil properties usually had strong relationships with SOC and TN stocks. Our study demonstrated that rubber with the C. liberica intercropped system had greater potential for C and N sequestration in this tropical region.

AB  - Human activities in the oceans increase the extinction risk of marine megafauna. Interventions require an understanding of movement patterns and the spatiotemporal overlap with threats. We analysed the movement patterns of 33 white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) satellite-tagged in South Africa between 2012 and 2014 to investigate the influence of size, sex and season on movement patterns and the spatial and temporal overlap with longline and gillnet fisheries and marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a hidden Markov model to identify 'resident' and 'transient' movement states and investigate the effect of covariates on the transition probabilities between states. A model with sex, total length and season had the most support. Tagged sharks were more likely to be in a resident state near the coast and a transient state away from the coast, while the probability of finding a shark in the transient state increased with size. White sharks moved across vast areas of the southwest Indian Ocean, emphasising the need for a regional management plan. White sharks overlapped with longline and gillnet fisheries within 25% of South Africa's Exclusive Economic Zone and spent 15% of their time exposed to these fisheries during the study period. The demersal shark longline fishery had the highest relative spatial and temporal overlap, followed by the pelagic longline fishery and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shark nets and drumlines. However, the KZN shark nets and drumlines reported the highest white shark catches, emphasising the need to combine shark movement and fishing effort with reliable catch records to assess risks to shark populations accurately. White shark exposure to shark nets and drumlines, by movement state, sex and maturity status, corresponded with the catch composition of the fishery, providing support for a meaningful exposure risk estimate. White sharks spent significantly more time in MPAs than expected by chance, likely due to increased prey abundance or less disturbance, suggesting that MPAs can benefit large, mobile marine megafauna. Conservation of white sharks in Southern Africa can be improved by implementing non-lethal solutions to beach safety, increasing the observer coverage in fisheries, and continued monitoring of movement patterns and existing and emerging threats.

AB  - Soil microbes are the key to revealing the mechanisms driving variation in soil biogeochemical processes. In recent decades, forests in Southeast China have been widely transformed into tea plantations due to the drivers of economic benefits. However, the changes in the soil microbial community and their potential function during the transition from a typical forest ecosystem to tea plantations remain poorly understood. This study investigated the soil microbial community in tea plantation soils with different planting ages, i.e., 6, 12, 23 and 35 years, and in an adjacent woodland control. We discovered that tea planting significantly increased soil bacterial richness (ACE and Chao1) and decreased fungal richness, the diversity of bacteria (Simpson and Shannon) show a trend of initially decreasing and then increasing while there was no significant effect on fungal diversity. After tea planting, the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria increased by 180.9%-386.6% and 62.3%-97.5%, respectively; the relative abundances of Acidobacteria decreased by 11.4%-66.8%. However, the fungal phyla were not significantly different among different aged tea plantations and woodlands. FAPROTAX and FUNGuild revealed that the transition of natural woodland to tea plantations significantly increased the relative abundances of aerobic_chemoheterotrophy (14.66%-22.69%), chemoheterotrophy (34.36%-37.04%), ureolysis (0.68%-1.35%) and pathogenic fungi (26.17%-37.02%). db-RDA proved that the bacterial community structure was more strongly related to soil pH and available nitrogen (AN), while the main determinants of the fungal community composition were soil pH and soil organic matter (SOM). These findings indicate that tea planting has a strong effect on the soil microbial community and potential function. The change in soil pH during tea planting was the most important factor affecting the soil microbial community, while soil bacteria were more sensitive to tea planting than fungi.

AB  - Jellyfish play a vital role in the ocean's ecosystem, acting as a nursery for young fishes, crabs, and brittle stars, as well as a source of food for certain charismatic megafauna, such as sunfish and sea turtles. They also pose a threat to human activities, with jellyfish blooms negatively impacting fisheries, power generation, and tourism. However, very little information is available on the biodiversity of jellyfish within the waters of Borneo. Here, we present new records of jellyfish found along the coast of Sabah, Malaysia, located in northern Borneo, bordering the megadiverse region of the Coral Triangle. A total of six species belonging to two classes and six families hitherto not recorded to the state are reported, Chironex yamaguchii, Acromitus maculosus, Crambione mastigophora, Linuche aquila, Netrostoma sp., and Phyllorhiza punctata. Of these, two species (C. yamaguchii and L. aquila) are harmful to humans, with C. yamaguchii capable of causing human fatalities. Reports of harmful jellyfish are useful to the medical and tourism industry, as some of these species may inflict stings and adverse reactions to humans ranging from rashes and skin irritation to fatal envenomation. A checklist has also been provided for all collected jellyfish species from Sabah waters of Borneo, Malaysia.

AB  - Organic farming is considered an efficient approach to improve soil fertility for sustainable agriculture. However, its soil micro-ecological effects and functions in intensive rice cropping systems are still obscure. Twelve soil samples were collected from a field experiment with four treatments such as M0 (no pig manure), M1 (1.6 t ha 1 pig manure), M2 (3.2 t ha 1 pig manure) and M3 (4.8 t ha 1 pig manure) after eight rice-oilseed rape rotation. Soil chemical property, enzyme activity and abundant/rare bacterial or fungal communities were analyzed to investigate the effect of conversion to organic farming with continuous pig manure application on soil microbiota. Stochastic processes controlled the assembly of abundant taxa, and deterministic processes dominated rare taxa. The composition and network construction of bacterial and fungal communities were significantly affected by pig manure, with changes in soil property and enzyme activity. Based on partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), pig manure application affected bacteria construction and enzyme activities by increasing soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). In summary, long-term pig manure application promotes specific microbial associations known to be involved in degrading complex organic compounds, and improving soil fertility such as soil enzyme activities. This research provides insight into understanding the processes behind changes in bacterial and fungal communities in paddy soil after conversion to organic farming.

AB  - Preliminary research conducted in Warsaw in the 1970s and 2000s showed that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) stayed in forest habitat and avoided anthropogenic areas. Activity and exploration patterns of animals are shaped by indices of anthropogenic disturbances, elevated in large cities. The aims of the study were (1) to compare the presence of roe deer in natural and anthropogenic habitats of Warsaw during three periods: 1976-1978, 2005-2008 and 2017-2021, based on snow tracking on transect routes (681.2 km in total), and (2) to describe the presence and activity of roe deer in relation to human disturbances in selected urban forests in its reproductive period (March-August), based on camera trap survey (2019-2020, 859 observations, 5317 trap-days in total). The number of tracks was higher in natural habitat during all three periods, with the highest value in 2017-2021 (9.85/km/24 h). The peak of roe deer activity was recorded at dusk, and it changed with moon phases between spring and summer. Landscape connectivity and level of light pollution did not affect the activity pattern of roe deer. Our research showed that roe deer inhabiting urban areas avoided human presence by using well-covered habitats and being active in periods when the level of human disturbance was lower.

AB  - Axis deer (Axis axis) are invasive species that threaten native ecosystems and agriculture on Maui Island. To mitigate negative effects, it is necessary to understand current abundance, population trajectory, and how to most effectively reduce the population. Our objectives were to examine the population history of Maui axis deer, estimate observed population growth, and use species-specific demographic parameters in a VORTEX population viability analysis to examine removal scenarios that would most effectively reduce the population. Only nine deer were introduced in 1959, but recent estimates of >10,000 deer suggest population growth rates (r) ranging between 0.147 and 0.160 even though >11,200 have been removed by hunters and resource managers. In VORTEX simulations, we evaluated an initial population size of 6,000 females and 4,000 males, reflecting the probable 3F:2M sex ratio, with annual removal rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% over a 10-year period. A removal rate of 10% resulted in a positive growth rate of 0.103 +/- 0.001. A 20% removal rate resulted in only a slightly negative growth, while a 30% removal rate resulted in -0.130 +/- 0.004. By increasing the ratio of females removed to 4F:1M in the 30% harvest scenario, the decline nearly doubled, resulting in -0.223 +/- 0.004. Effectively reducing axis deer will most likely require an annual removal of approximately 20-30% of the population and with a greater proportion of females to increase the population decline. Selective removal of males may not only be inefficient, but also counterproductive to population reduction goals.

AB  - Simple Summary Adaptation to new environments by reintroducing banteng (Bos javanicus) is important for sustainable conservation and habitat management. The aims of this study were to test whether increased human disturbance in the edge area affects animal movement, territory size, and even the area of use in Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary. Using camera traps, we found that the reintroduced banteng preferred salt licks and more distance from ponds. In the core area, the area of use was decreased, followed by the adaptation to the new habitat by the reintroduced banteng. In the edge area, the area of use was smaller than in the core area due to the increased disturbance from human activities. We suggest that the reintroduction program should be conducted in the core area rather than in the edge area, and controlling human activities at the edge may increase the area of use for the reintroduced banteng population in the future. Monitoring of banteng (Bos javanicus) after reintroduction is important for their management. This study aimed to monitor the preferred habitat and area of use of reintroduced banteng at the core (13 banteng) and the edge (three banteng) of Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary between 2019 and 2021 and compared the finding with previous studies conducted from 2014 to 2019. The Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) showed the most preferred, moderately preferred, and least preferred areas were 44.7 km(2), 1.2 km(2), and 54.1 km(2) in the dry season, and 25.9 km(2), 1.0 km(2), and 9.3 km(2) in the wet season, respectively. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) showed the most preferred, moderately preferred, and least preferred areas as 12.1 km(2), 17.3 km(2), and 65.9 km(2), respectively. Banteng have previously been found close to ponds and salt licks. The area of use size, as determined by Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), was 20.3 km(2) and 6.5 km(2), respectively. Three banteng were reintroduced to the edge area in 2020. The edge area was temporarily utilized by these individuals. In the core area, the area of use in this study decreased compared to the previous studies from 2014 to 2019, indicating they were able to find their preferred habitat. This study suggested that, if the area is managed appropriately, banteng will be able to live in a smaller habitat, and we will be able to restore the banteng population in the future.

AB  - This study analyses, in the Sahelian zone of Niger, the morphological traits of sheep and goats' responses to environmental stress and the contribution of adaptive traits to herd productivity. The study utilized 2490 adult small ruminants, including 653 red and Sahelian goats and 1837 Peulh (with three varieties: Balami, Oudah and Bali-Bali) and Tuareg (Ara-ara) sheep from 13 sites with a marked aridity gradient within the country's northern latitude. Carcass yield was assessed on a second sample of 1617 adult animals, comprising 876 sheep and 741 goats. Variations in thorax auricular index (ratio of ear length to thorax depth), gracility index (which reflects the subtraction of the animal's body from the ground) and hot carcass yield, according to climate zones and breed, were subjected to an analysis of variance at the 5% risk threshold. Principal Component Analysis was used to analyze correlations between biometric and heat indices. For most breeds, the auricular thorax index and the gracility index were higher for animals in arid zones than those in humid zones. The increase in the average values of the body indices had as a result an increase in the animals' carcass yield and live weight. In all sheep and goat breeds, gracility increases with heat index. Gracility differed (p < 0.05) between breeds, with Bali-Bali and Oudah subgenetics of the Peulh sheep breed being more gracile than the Ara-ara sheep. Also, the auricular thorax index was higher (p < 0.05) in Sahelian goat than in red goat. The importance of biometric indices in terms of animals' adaptability to their environment means that we need to define important heat stress indicators specific to sheep and goats in Sahelian farming systems.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are increasing worldwide, leading to health, economic and conservation issues. Assessing genetic structure and diversity can aid in the effective monitoring and management of wild boar populations. Processes related to sexual selection and behavioral differences between sexes support the importance of considering sex in measuring genetic diversity. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of wild boar in southwestern Spain by comparing multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) in males and females. We collected tissue samples from 142 culled individuals and 146 fetuses during routine hunting activities and used 16 microsatellite markers to quantify MLH. Paternity analyses were conducted to infer the genotypes of reproductive males. Our results indicated that the sampled individuals constituted a unique polygynandrous population without clear genetic structure. We found that males tended to exhibit lower MLH than females, with reproductive males showing significantly lower MLH than females. We discuss the selection and demographic processes that might explain our results. We highlight the importance of sex-balanced culling for population control, as well as the use of sex-balanced samples for monitoring genetic diversities.

We studied bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and their habitat and quantified relationships among 1) the foodscape (defined herein as spatiotemporal variation in the quality and availability of forage plants); 2) female behavior (i.e., use of the foodscape and rugged escape terrain), condition (% ingesta-free body fat), and disease status (infection status and antibody levels); and 3) juvenile survival. We conducted intensive vegetation sampling and used generalized additive modeling to map the foodscapes available to bighorn sheep during summer (May-September) over 2 years in 2 population ranges in Idaho, USA: the East Fork of the Salmon River and the Lost River Range. In each study area, we used global positioning system (GPS) collars and field observations to monitor adult female behavior and lamb survival, quantified nutritional condition and disease status of maternal females in late winter, and used known-fate survival modeling to test for effects of female traits and behavior on lamb survival. Adjusted R-2 values for foodscape models ranged from 0.34 to 0.61. Collared females consistently selected rugged escape terrain in both study areas, but we found little evidence of selection for the foodscape. We did not detect any consistent effects of maternal space-use behavior on lamb survival. In contrast, nutritional condition of females in late winter had a strong, positive effect on summer lamb survival: lambs born to females in relatively good condition (15% ingesta-free body fat, similar to 94% probability of lamb survival) were roughly 4 times more likely to survive the summer months than lambs born to females in poor condition (5% ingesta-free body fat, similar to 25% probability of lamb survival). In addition, whereas maternal infection with the pathogen Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae had no discernable effect on juvenile survival, lambs born to females that showed no sign of exposure (antibody) to M. ovipneumoniae (similar to 99% probability of survival) were roughly 3 times more likely to survive the summer than lambs born to females that had mounted a strong immune response (35% probability of survival). Our work adds to a growing body of literature linking nutritional condition to juvenile survival and other key vital rates, and highlights the importance of efforts to better understand the role of nutrition in the context of disease and other factors limiting performance of herbivore populations.

AB  - Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWBP) Whooping Cranes are increasingly using inland areas for a portion of the winter. There have been individuals near Granger Lake during five of the last 13 winters and 11 of the last 13 winters in Colorado and Wharton counties, Texas, USA. At least 11 individuals used Colorado/Wharton counties in 2022-2023, and 18 used this area in 2023- 2024. We used data from all Whooping Cranes with active transmitters from 2009-2018 and from three additional inland wintering individuals from 2017-2022. We compared 95% auto-correlated kernel density estimates (AKDE) and daily distance movements for coastal wintering cranes and those that spent a portion of their winter inland. We also examined daily movement patterns in relation to wintering range use (inland or coastal) considering demographic and temporal factors with generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM). Six marked birds across 10 bird-winters from 2011-2021 spent between 3.1-99.3% of their winter at inland areas. Inland wintering birds had AKDE home ranges that were 3.1 times as large as coastal wintering birds. Additionally, the top GLMM predicted that spending a portion of the winter at inland areas equated to a 92.0 +/- 4.2% increase in daily movement during the winter. We found that several other factors influenced daily movement patterns, which warrant consideration when comparing between the groups. Age and family status impacted the model, but subadults, family groups, and adults without juveniles all had overlapping confidence intervals. Daily movements followed a quadratic temporal pattern, with greater movements in the late fall and early spring. Continued use of inland areas has implications for how we manage, monitor, and plan for this population's recovery.

AB  - Leeches in the genus Hirudinaria Whitman, 1886, also known as buffalo leeches, are blood-sucking ectoparasites of vertebrates. Although they are widely distributed in Asia and had been highly abundant in the past, studies on diversity and taxonomy of this genus are still scarce. There is probably a large amount of cryptic diversity yet to be discovered, particularly from mainland Southeast Asia. In this study, we used morphology and DNA barcoding with a COI gene fragment to explored the diversity of Hirudinaria leeches in the southern region of Thailand, where a unique geographic feature could have led to the diversification of freshwater biota. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and species delimitation approaches (ABGD, bPTP, GMYC, and BOLD) revealed the presence of four putative species of Hirudinaria leeches from southern Thailand, including H. bpling, H. thailandica, and two morphologically cryptic lineages of H. manillensis. Compared to other leech genera, genetic distances of Hirudinaria leeches were relatively low (0.11-0.65% within species; 3.72-14.36% between species) and barcoding gaps were very narrow (1.54-2.88%). The species diversity, distribution pattern, and a phenomenon of low genetic divergence of Hirudinaria leeches in southern Thailand could be explained by an ancient seaway, paleo-drainage, and anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The ecological impacts of multiple stressors are hard to predict but important to understand. When multiple stressors influence foundation species, the effects can cascade throughout the ecosystem. Gulf of Mexico seagrass ecosystems are currently experiencing a suite of novel stressors, including warmer water temperatures and increased herbivory due to tropicalization and conservation efforts. We investigated the impact of warming temperatures and grazing history on plant performance, morphology, and palatability by integrating a mesocosm study using the seagrass Thalassia testudinum with feeding trials using the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. Warming temperatures negatively impacted T. testudinum tolerance traits, reducing belowground biomass by 34%, productivity by 74%, shoot density by 10%, and number of leaves per plant by 24%, and negatively impacted resistance traits through 13% lower toughness of young leaves and a trend for reduced leaf carbon:nitrogen. Lytechinus variegatus individuals preferred to consume plants grown under heated conditions, which supports findings of enhanced palatability. Simulated turtle grazing impacted more plant traits than grazing by other herbivores, potentially diminishing plant resilience to future disturbances through reduced rhizome non-structural carbohydrate concentrations and increasing palatability through reduced fiber content and 23% lower leaf carbon:phosphorus. Simulated turtle, simulated parrotfish, and urchin grazing reduced leaf carbon:nitrogen by 11%, also potentially increasing nutritive value. Interactions between warming temperatures and grazers on plant traits were additive for 16 out of 19 response variables. However, the stressors non-additively impacted the number of leaves per plant, fiber content, and epiphyte load. We suggest that the impacts of grazers on leaf turnover rate and leaf age may vary based on water temperature, potentially driving these interactions. Overall, increased temperatures and grazing pressure will likely reduce seagrass resilience, structure, and biomass, potentially impacting feedback systems and producing negative consequences for seagrass cover, associated species, and ecosystem services.

AB  - The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a major component of the Southern Ocean's ecosystem. Limited high-resolution data on the relative importance of oceanographic processes on the behavioral responses of krill at traditional predator foraging grounds constitutes a major obstacle in the understanding of krill-environment coupling and ecosystem-based management of this resource. Aggregation structures of krill and predator interactions were investigated using active acoustic data collected by WBAT echosounders deployed on moorings in two hydrographically different sites in Bransfield Strait. Near Nelson Island, water flows from the northwest to southeast while Deception Island is influenced by stronger net current velocities from the southwest to northeast. Krill aggregations were identified and then classified in three clusters using a swarm-identification algorithm and hierarchical clustering using aggregation morphological characteristics: acoustic density, mean depth, center of mass, inertia, equivalent area, aggregation index, and proportion occupied. A total of 693 and 736 aggregations were detected at the mooring sites close to Nelson and Deception Islands. The three aggregation categories ranged from high to low densities, evenness, and dispersion and were distributed throughout the water column. Krill aggregation density distribution and mean thickness are influenced by krill mean depth, current velocities and direction. The majority of observed predator dive profiles occurred over the aggregation type with highest krill densities at both Nelson and Deception Islands, and within the first 25 m of the water column. The heterogeneity of krill aggregations potentially impacts predator foraging strategies and predator-krill interactions in the hydrodynamically active Bransfield Strait.

AB  - Aims Woody plants represent the ancestral growth form in angiosperms with herbs evolving repeatedly from them. While there are a number of hypotheses about drivers of the evolution of the herbaceous habit, the ability to avoid frost damage in winter by discarding their aboveground biomass has often been invoked as the main force in their evolution. We propose instead that any unpredictable disturbance might have been much more important than the seasonal frost, as herbs easily survive repeated disturbance.
   Methods We tested this hypothesis by comparing herbs and woody plants in their ability to deal with three types of simulated disturbances, more predictable winter freezing, less predictable spring freezing and herbivory. Comparison was made in an experimental common garden setup with 20 species differing in woodiness. We evaluated the effects of these disturbances on mortality and regrowth of plants.
   Important Findings Herbs did not have an advantage over woody plants in survival when exposed to winter freezing. In less predictable conditions of spring freezing herbs survived the treatment better than woody plants and this advantage was even larger in case of the simulated herbivory treatment. The advantage of herbs over woody plants in less predictable conditions suggests that herbaceous growth form might be an adaptation to unpredictable disturbance, which herbs are able to tolerate thanks to their ability to survive loss of aboveground biomass. Consequently, factors such as mammal herbivory or fire might have been the most likely factors in the transition from woody species to herbs.

AB  - Simple Summary The increase in the productivity of dairy buffaloes is one of the main factors for the introduction of intensive management systems and the mechanization of daily production activities. Machine milking can be considered as a critical point, as a process that is repeated at least twice a day and includes physical and psychological stressors: machine settings and maintenance, a new environment, calf separation and closeness to a person are potential sources of chronic stress, which negatively affect some aspects of buffalo behavior, welfare and productivity. Buffalo behavior during milking is an extremely important tool for determining the temperament of the animal, which in turn is essential for determining the level of welfare and conditioning of this activity, thus minimizing the problems and consequences for both animals and people who serve them. There are no recent studies to evaluate the milk temperament score of Bulgarian Murrah buffaloes in Bulgaria and how it affects their milk productivity, which is why we conducted our study.Abstract The goal of this research was to evaluate milking temperament and its relationship with test-day milk (TDMY0) yield in Bulgarian Murrah buffaloes. This study involved 90 buffalo cows reared under a tie-stall production system which were milked twice a day with a milking pipeline. The behavioral responses of the buffaloes were reported during preparation for milking and during actual milking. The average temperament score during preparation for milking was 1.83, and 1.93 during milking itself. The most common reaction was leg lifting (18.9%), followed by cows moving on the stall bed (10%), definite kicking (9.9%), and 13.3% managing to remove the milking cluster during milking. The frequency of buffaloes showing adverse reactions (scores 4 and 5) increased considerably during milking compared to preparation for milking. Repeated scoring of temperament during the same lactation did not show a significant difference in the frequency of temperament assessments both in preparation for milking and during milking. The minimal difference may be due to the accuracy of the assessment or a momentary change in the condition of the animals during the two scorings. Cows with the most unwanted milking behavior (scores 5 and 4) had the highest LS means for TDMY, 8.18 kg and 7.65 kg, respectively. The reasons for these buffaloes remaining until later lactations was their high milk yield and the injection of oxytocin before milking, which helps them to be fully milked.

AB  - The polewards range expansion of tropical herbivorous fish into temperate latitudes is leading to overgrazing of marine habitats and community phase shifts in some regions. Here, we test the potential effects of increased herbivory on the temperate habitat-forming seagrass Posidonia australis. We used a series of simulated herbivory experiments to predict the potential impacts of climate-mediated increases in seagrass consumption along P. australis entire latitudinal range (similar to 9 degrees latitude) in eastern Australia (1700 km of coastline). We subjected treatment plots to two levels of simulated herbivory (10% or 80% of leaves clipped) and compared them to unclipped controls. We measured seagrass leaf growth rates and tissue chemical traits: carbohydrates in rhizomes, leaf phenolics, and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and C:N ratio) in leaves and rhizomes. At the warmest range-edge population, we also tested how responses to increased herbivory may vary between summer and winter, or with repeated clipping events. Clipped shoots maintained growth rates similar to unclipped controls despite losing up to 80% of leaf biomass. This was consistent along the full latitudinal range and after repeated simulated herbivory at the northernmost location. One-off clipping events impacted plant architecture, increasing the number of subdividing shoots. At the species range edge, leaves grew more in winter than in summer, and clipping tended to lower seagrass growth only in winter; however, higher levels of shoot subdivision were produced over summer than in winter. Plant chemical traits could not explain consistently the growth patterns observed despite some traits varying with latitude (e.g., leaf nitrogen content decreased with latitude and C:N ratio increased) and/or simulated herbivory. Synthesis: P. australis growth is not affected by increases in simulated herbivory and may be relatively resilient to future increases in seagrass consumption, suggesting that this species could be a relative 'winner' under future climate change conditions that lead to enhanced herbivory.

AB  - Seeking to evaluate the impact of the increasing conversion of forest remnants into agricultural areas on the aquatic food chain, the present study investigated land use at multiple spatial scales and its impact on primary producers and primary consumers in a Neotropical floodplain, using delta 13C and delta 15N in three periods within a 20-year window. Over years of study, an increase in the percentage of agricultural land use in the investigated area was verified. The delta 15N values of primary producers were associated with impacts in the riparian forest and the basin. In contrast, the increase in the delta 15N values of the consumer was related to impacts in the basin. Changes in consumer's trophic position and isotopic niche reflected the impacts on the reduction in riparian forests in rivers. In contrast, the most conserved area of riparian forest tends to be a barrier to the impacts of land use on the basin, as observed in the river in the protected area. Thus, the conservation of riparian forests is essential for the stability of the trophic structure of aquatic consumers, as it acts as a barrier to impacts on the basin.

AB  - In shallow soft-bottom intertidal systems, microphytobenthic assemblages (MPB) and macrofauna interact and play important roles in ecosystem functioning. Macrofauna can affect MPB through bioturbation or/and herbivory. Most bioturbators also exert herbivory pressure on MPB, hence the results of the interaction between benthic macrofauna and MPB is not easy to predict. In this study we performed a small scale field experiment in order to discriminate the effect of bioturbation and herbivory by the intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice granulata on MPB structure, and primary production in SW Atlantic mudflats. The implemented treatments allowed us to separate the effects of bioturbation from those of herbivory on MPB. Results showed that N. granulata, through bioturbation + herbivory did not affect MPB structure (i.e., biomass, abundance and composition); and crab bioturbation without herbivory also did not modify MPB structure. Nevertheless, crab bioturbation without herbivory almost doubled MPB primary production, compared to the values registered in the treatment without bioturbation and herbivory and the treatment with bioturbation + herbivory. Sediment properties were equally affected by bioturbation in the four treatments. Thus, our results shows that the only significant effect on MPB structure is due to crab bioturbation.

AB  - During the past several decades, the paleoecology of the Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex in the Palearctic has been thoroughly explored, especially using stable isotope analysis. Numerous studies have documented high ecological plasticity and regional heterogeneities for this fauna. However, very limited attention has focused on Northeast Asia, at the southeastern edge of the distribution of the mammoth steppe biome. In the present study, we undertook radiocarbon dating, zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), and stable isotope analysis on the fossil faunas from Yanjiagang Paleolithic site, Northeast (NE) China, and from the Geographical Society Cave in the nearby Russian Far East, to explore the paleoecology of this fauna in this middle-latitude region. Isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) data from these two sites suggested that the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was a grazer feeding on grasses/sedges, while the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and steppe bison (Bison priscus) utilized a wider range of food resources. All megaherbivores exhibited some ecological plasticity. Meanwhile, the mammal remains from Geographical Society Cave prevalently exhibited lower delta N-15 values than those from China, indicating variable environments and vegetation in Northeast Asia during MIS 3. Interestingly, through reevaluating the diachronic mammal distribution and ecology based on direct radiocarbon dating and ZooMS, we report the credible presence of Bubalus, typically interpreted as a mild climate faunal element in the Pleistocene, within the Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex in Yanjiagang. This emphasizes the unique scenario of this biome in Northeast Asia, where the fauna exhibited sensitivity to synergic effects of climatic oscillations and local geographic traits. After comparing isotopic data of mammoth from different subregions of Asia, we found that NE China displayed both highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, possibly related to the higher temperature compared to the Arctic regions. This study reveals the characteristics and complexity at the southeastern limit of the range of the mammoth steppe biome and urges more systematic studies within and outside this region.

AB  - The Peruvian guanaco (Lama guanicoe cacsilensis) is classified as being "in critical danger of extinction" by the government. In this study, we evaluate how the conflict between farmers and guanacos in the Susapaya and Estique Districts, Tacna Department (Southern Peru) may represent a threat to their survival. To evaluate the situation, we 1. Conducted field surveys to monitor guanaco presence, 2. Used available remote sensing data to map guanaco movement, and 3. interviewed the impacted farmers concerning their losses. Remote sensing data showed that sedentary guanaco family groups located in prime steppe vegetation habitats never entered agricultural areas, while field surveys showed that bachelor bands and solitary individuals did, perhaps seeking forage due to growing population pressure. Interview data found that 90% of community farmers felt that guanacos were a problem best resolved by better fencing (45%), hunting (19%), or increased security (16%), and 92% saw no value in the conservation of the species. Hunting is illegal, given the critically endangered status of guanacos in Peru, so additional efforts are needed to both educate those who feel guanacos are a menace and involve them in efforts to preserve the species.

AB  - In the face of environmental change, high-quality and fine-scale information is essential in order to monitor the highly dynamic environments on land and sea. While traditional approaches to data collection face a number of practical limitations, advanced technologies could supplement and further improve our efforts. Taking sea turtles as a modeling organism, we present a novel methodological framework for monitoring species by means of advanced technologies, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles coupled with image and temperature sensors. Diverse monitoring protocols were refined through pilot studies conducted in both terrestrial and nearshore sea turtle habitats. Our approach focuses on the collection of information for critical biological parameters concerning species reproduction and habitat use, following the complex life cycle of the species. Apart from biological information, our framework encompasses also the collection of information on crucial environmental factors that might be changing due to current and future human-derived pressures, such as beach erosion and temperature profile, as well as highly important human activities such as recreational use within nesting beaches that could undermine habitat quality for the species. This holistic and standardized approach to monitoring using advanced technologies could foster our capacity for conservation, resolving difficulties previously addressed and improving the collection of biological and environmental data in the frame of an adaptive management scheme.

AB  - With climate change, spring warming tends to advance plant leaf-out. While the timing of leaf-out has been shown to affect the quality of leaves for herbivores in spring, it is unclear whether such effects extend to herbivores active in summer. In this study, we first examined how spring and autumn phenology of seven Quercus robur genotypes responded to elevated temperatures in spring. We then tested whether the performance of two summer-active insect herbivores (Orthosia gothica and Polia nebulosa) and infection by a pathogen (Erysiphe alphitoides) were influenced by plant phenology, traits associated with genotype or the interaction between these two. Warm spring temperatures advanced both bud development and leaf senescence in Q. robur. Plants of different genotype differed in terms of both spring and autumn phenology. Plant phenology did not influence the performance of two insect herbivores and a pathogen, while traits associated with oak genotype had an effect on herbivore performance. Weight gain for O. gothica and ingestion for P. nebulosa differed by a factor of 4.38 and 2.23 among genotypes, respectively. Herbivore species active in summer were influenced by traits associated with plant genotype but not by phenology. This suggest that plant attackers active in summer may prove tolerant to shifts in host plant phenology-a pattern contrasting with previously documented effects on plant attackers active in spring and autumn.

AB  - The genus Encephalartos is entirely endemic to Africa, and like most cycad species, the genus is at risk of extinction. One of the threats jeopardising the future of the genus is reproduction failure, a failure that is still poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate what predisposes Encephalartos species to seed damages through predation, a potential cause of reproduction failure. We collected functional traits of 430 individuals of Encephalartos villosus, as well as data on pre-dispersal seed predation, habitat type and elevation in the Origi Gorge Nature Reserve, South Africa. Then, we analysed our data by fitting a structural equation model. We found that plants tend to be taller when moving from open to close habitat, whereas plant height tends to increase along elevation. In addition, taller plants tend to have more leaves, and plant canopy size shows significant positive relationship with elevation, plant height and number of leaves. These findings suggest a leaf height-canopy dimension strategy perhaps in response to environmental stresses imposed by elevation. We tested the effects of habitat types on seed production. Although there were significantly more seeds in open habitats, open habitats showed the lowest proportion of predated seeds. Finally, we tested the effects of elevation on seed production. We found that seed production decreases along elevation while the proportion of predated seeds increases. Under the resource concentration hypothesis, these findings (where there are more resources, predation is low) are unexpected, suggesting rather that it is the resource dilution effect that matches the pre-dispersal seed predation patterns in our study area. We suggest that anthropogenic pressures at lower elevation due to easy access may cause seed predators to shift towards higher elevation where they cause heavier damage to seed, thus perhaps contributing to the extinction risk of the genus Encephalartos.

AB  - Invasive species are one of many anthropogenic challenges to maintaining a healthy marine ecosystem. Two rabbitfish species (Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus) are among the more successful migrants from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, where their intense foraging has caused damage to the algae community, thus reducing primary production and habitat complexity, and impacting nurseries for early life stages. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the impact of rabbitfish on algae is lower in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) although rabbitfish densities are similar in protected and fished areas. One explanation could be that fear of predators, more often present inside MPAs and an important component of a healthy marine ecosystem, reduces the ecological impacts of rabbitfish. This research aimed to test if such fear effects do occur in rabbitfish. Using controlled mesocosm experiments, we tested S. rivulatus reactions to two chemical predation cues: chemical alarm cues released from a recently killed conspecific fish, and water-borne cues from a tank with a live grouper predator, Epinephelus marginatus. We found that rabbitfish significantly reduce their overall food consumption as well as their bites per minute when exposed to the alarm cue, but not when exposed to the grouper water cue. These results support the idea that MPAs, which effectively increase the density of large piscivores and hence predation, can mitigate the impact of invasive herbivorous species. If the mesocosm results can scale up to natural systems, predation cues may be artificially introduced to other target areas in order to reduce rabbitfish grazing outside reserves. Thus, this study provides information that can be used to manage the ecological impacts caused by invasive rabbitfish, both inside and outside of marine reserves.

AB  - Inner Mongolia has a large area of marsh wetland in China, and the marsh in this region is important for maintaining ecological balance. Understanding variations in vegetation phenology of marsh ecosystems and their responses to climatic change is crucial for vegetation conservation of marsh wetlands in Inner Mongolia. Using the climate and NDVI data during 2001-2020, we explored the spatiotemporal changes in the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (LOS) of vegetation growing season and analyzed the effects of climate change on vegetation phenology in the Inner Mongolia marshes. Results showed that SOS significantly (p < 0.05) advanced by 0.50 days/year, EOS significantly delayed by 0.38 days/year, and thus LOS considerably increased by 0.88 days/year during 2001-2020 in marshes of Inner Mongolia. Warming temperatures in winter and spring could significantly (p < 0.05) advance the SOS, and increased summer and autumn temperatures could delay EOS in Inner Mongolia marshes. We found for the first time that daytime maximum temperature (T-max) and night minimum temperature (T-min) had asymmetric effects on marsh vegetation phenology. Increasing T-max had a stronger advancing effect on SOS than increasing T-min from December to April. The increase of T-min in August could obviously delayed EOS, while increasing T-max in August had no significant effect on EOS. This study highlights that the asymmetric influences of nighttime and daytime temperatures should be taken into account in simulating marsh vegetation phenology in temperate arid and semi-arid regions worldwide, particularly in the context of global asymmetric diurnal warming.

AB  - The effect of peach shell biochar (PSB) amendment on sheep manure (SM) composting was investigated. Five different ratios of PSB were applied (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% PSB), and named T1 to T5, and run 50 days of composting experiment. It was found that PSB (especially 7.5% and 10%) could improve the compost environment, regulate the activity of microorganisms and related enzymes, and promote the decomposition of compost. 7.5% and 10% PSB advanced the heap into the thermophilic stage and increased the maximum temperature, while also increasing the germination index by 1.40 and 1.39 times compared to control. Importantly, 10% PSB effectively retained more than 60% of carbon and 55% of nitrogen by inhibiting the excess release of NH3 3 and greenhouse gases. High proportion PSB amendment increased the activity of dehydrogenase and cellulase, but inhibited protease and urease. The correlation results indicated that PSB changed the key bacterial genus, and there was a stronger association with environmental factors at 7.5% and 10%. Therefore, 7.5% and 10% peach shell biochar can be used as appropriate proportions to improve composting conditions.

AB  - Forest defoliators are one of the major biological disturbances to forest ecosystems. As one of the abnormal nutrient input paths into forest ecosystems, frass deposition from the pest outbreak plays a critical role in regulating soil organic carbon (SOC) in forest ecosystems. However, how frass deposition affects SOC and its fractions in forests remains unclear. Based on a severe outbreak of defoliator in an oak-sweetgum mixed forest in Jigong Mountain in 2014, we compared the difference in SOC between plots with and without frass deposition for 4 consecutive years. The results showed that frass deposition led to a significant increase of 25.1 % in soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and 32.0 % in dissolved organic C (DOC) in 2014, which further escalated to 50.4 % and 50.6 % in the subsequent year (2015), respectively. The response of SOC to frass deposition lagged behind MBC and DOC. Specifically, there was no change in SOC in 2014, but a significant increase (50.9 %) was observed in the subsequent 2-3 years. The positive dependences of MBC and DOC upon fine root biomass were negated under frass deposition, while the relationship between SOC and fine root biomass remained unaffected. Soil organic carbon and DOC showed non-linear responses to frass amount and the changed soil nitrogen content. Our finding that the response of SOC to frass deposition lagged behind soil labile C indicates that SOC exhibits a certain resilience towards forest disturbance. The findings also imply that investigating the long-term impacts of frass deposition on SOC in forests would contribute to the scientific assessment of forest C cycling under disturbance.

AB  - The present investigation evaluated the effect of microclimate modification on feed intake, growth performance, and hemato-biochemical profile of Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) heifers during summer. Twenty-four buffalo heifers, between 15 and 20 months of age with an average body weight of 363.75 +/- 11.27 kg, were randomly assigned to 4 groups based on their age and body weight. The heifers of the T0 (control) group were kept under the shed without any cooling treatment, while the animals in group T1 were tied with a cooling jacket. Buffalo heifers of group T2 were subjected to a cooling jacket with forced ventilation and animals in group T3 were treated with intermittent sprinkling (10 min., at 2 h intervals) and forced ventilation between 9.00 AM and 6.00 PM during the experiment. The ambient temperature inside the shed and core body temperature were reduced in groups T1, T2, and T3 compared to T0. Heifers had higher dry matter intake when subjected to cooling treatments T1, T2, and T3, whereas water intake was reduced in T2 and T3 groups. The animals in T2 and T3 groups attained higher average daily weight gain, while the feed conversion was better in the T3 group compared to T0. The hematological measures such as hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, and total leucocyte count were found higher in T0. The serum glucose, sodium, and potassium levels increasedand alkaline phosphatase activity decreased in groups T1, T2 and T3 when compared with T0. It can be concluded that the provision of intermittent sprinkling and cooling jacket in combination with forced ventilation could improve the microclimate, which in turn could enhance the performance of Murrah heifers during hot summer days in the tropics.

AB  - Scrophularia arguta (Scrophulariaceae) is a rare amphicarpic annual species with a fragmented distribution in North Africa, part of the Arabian Peninsula, and Macaronesia, with several pe-ripheral populations on the Iberian Peninsula (south-western Europe) as well. The Iberian pop-ulations have a disjunct distribution: several endangered or critically endangered populations are present in the southeast versus a few non-listed ones representing a relict lineage with a unique plastid haplotype inhabiting the west-central region (Extremadura). In this study, we examined the largest and most important population of this relict lineage to assess potential threats to its survival. We evaluated pollination and reproductive systems, floral rewards, fruit and seed set from chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers, and population dynamics (i.e., phenology, sur-vival, reproductive success, and predation level). We found that the main threats to the popu-lation are predation by wild herbivores, such as red deer and, to a lesser extent, Cucullia scrophulariae caterpillars. These threats decrease reproductive success to such an extent that population survival may be in jeopardy if no action is taken to reduce the effects of herbivores. In addition, the existence of nearby beehives alters the presence and density of wild pollinators that contribute to gene flow via pollen transfer and increase genetic variability. Cleistogamous seeds may help maintain the population in specific microhabitats (mainly quartzite rock cracks), although at the cost of reducing genetic variability. Finally, we recommend that regional/national administrations responsible for biodiversity matters adopt measures to ensure the conservation and survival of west-central populations.

AB  - Intense herbivory from high densities of a native, herbivorous crab (Sesarma reticulatum) has led to extensive losses of salt marsh vegetation in numerous locations along the Atlantic coastline of the United States. The spatial distribution of these crabs in marshes depends on substrate type in that sandy sediments with low cohesivity are unsuitable for burrow construction and maintenance. In fact, where beach sand has been deposited onto marshes during past storm events the sand content of the substrate is still high enough to be unsuitable for crab burrowing many decades later. In this study, we used sand from the terrestrial edge of two different salt marshes to assess whether marsh substrate manipulations/additions could facilitate vegetation recovery. The effect of substrate substitution with sand, as well as sand placement on top of denuded areas, was to greatly reduce burrow densities and allow vegetation to recover through clonal growth from adjacent plants. These results provide a basis for developing salt marsh management strategies where they are being impacted by this species.

AB  - Urushiol is the natural product produced by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) that is responsible for millions of cases of delayed contact allergenic dermatitis in North America each year. Avoidance of poison ivy plant material is the clinically recommended strategy for preventing urushiol-induced dermatitis symptoms. However, poison ivy leaf shape is anecdotally notoriously variable, thereby confounding accurate poison ivy identification. This study focused on quantitative analyses of poison ivy and a common poison ivy look-alike (American hog peanut) leaf shape variability in North America to empirically validate the high degree of poison ivy leaf shape plasticity.Poison ivy and American hog peanut records were scored for seven attributes of compound leaf shape that were combined to produce a total leaf complexity score. Both the mean and the distribution of poison ivy total leaf complexity scores were significantly greater than that of American hog peanut. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses corroborated a high degree of poison ivy leaf shape variability relative to American hog peanut. A poison ivy accession producing frequent palmate penta-leaflet compound leaves was evaluated using linear regression modeling.Poison ivy total leaf complexity was exceedingly variable across a given latitude or longitude. With that said, there was a small but significant trend of poison ivy total leaf complexity increasing from east to west. Palmate penta-leaflet formation was significantly correlated with a stochastic leaflet deep-lobing developmental process in one unusual poison ivy accession.The empirically-validated poison ivy leaf shape hypervariability described in this report likely confounds accurate poison ivy identification, thereby likely resulting in many accidental urushiol-induced clinical allergenic dermatitis cases each year.

AB  - Eastern redcedar (ERC) (Juniperus virginiana L.) encroachment threatens long-term Great Plains health. Goats browse juniper by defoliation and debarking but are limited by aversive postingestive feedback from plant secondary metabolites. Protein supplementation may increase fed juniper foliage intake by offsetting nitrogen loss from plant secondary metabolites-protein binding, but little is known for goats browsing whole juniper, mimicking a field setting. Therefore, the objective was to study the effects of rumen undegradable protein (RUP) supplementation and tree height on goat browsing. Experimental design was two 3 x3 Latin squares of two diets and three ERC tree height treatments. Within each square, 12 Savannah xSpanish xBoer crossbred 50 kg +/- 3.9 kg does were fixed to a diet for 10 d (7 d adaptation and 3 d ERC browsing). Fed diets were control (grass hay and whole corn) and supplemented (grass hay and dried distiller's grain, an RUP source). Diets were isocaloric, and supplemented diet crude protein was fed at 2 xmaintenance. Each pen (three pens of four goats per diet) was offered two trees from one of three tree height treatments for 8 h daily over 3 d in a rotation where pens received all tree height treatments. Supplemented RUP did not increase defoliation (P = 0.73), trunk debarking (P = 0.84), or branch browsing (P = 0.74). However, tree height may impact browsing as short (50 cm) trees were more defoliated and 50 cm and 100 cm trees had more branches browsed than taller (200 cm) trees (P < 0.05). Therefore, for field application relevance, it may be more important for pen studies to measure browsing of whole juniper rather than fed foliage intake. Future pen and/or field studies should explore alternative protein sources, consider tree height in their design, and offer goats whole juniper. (c) 2023 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The influence of gut and gonad bacterial communities on insect physiology, behaviour, and ecology is increasingly recognised. Parasitism by parasitoid wasps alters many physiological processes in their hosts, including gut bacterial communities. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are restricted to the gut or also occur in other tissues and fluids, and the mechanisms underlying such changes are unknown. We hypothesise that host microbiome changes result from the injection of calyx fluid (that contain symbiotic viruses known as polydnaviruses) and venom during parasitoid oviposition and that these effects vary by host tissue. To test this, we microinjected Pieris brassicae caterpillars with calyx fluid and venom from Cotesia glomerata, using saline solution and natural parasitism by C. glomerata as controls. We analysed changes in the bacterial community composition in the gut, regurgitate, haemolymph, and labial salivary glands of the host insects. Multivariate analysis revealed distinct bacterial communities across tissues and fluids, with high diversity in the salivary glands and haemolymph. Parasitism and injection of calyx fluid and venom significantly altered bacterial communities in the salivary glands. Differential abundance analysis showed that parasitism affected bacterial relative abundance in the haemolymph, and that Wolbachia was only found in the haemolymph of parasitized caterpillars. Altogether, our findings reveal that parasitism influences the host haemolymph microbiome, and both parasitism and injection of calyx fluid and venom drive changes in the bacterial community composition within the host salivary glands. Given that the composition of salivary glands can influence plant response to herbivory, we discuss these results in the broader context of plant-parasitoid interactions.

AB  - The European bison (wisent) Bison bonasus is not only the largest terrestrial mammal in Europe, but also an example of the successful restitution and reintroduction of a species that became extinct in nature at the beginning of the 20th century. Even so, it remains a rare, protected species, and one susceptible to varied threats, including diseases. It has a specific parasitofauna, comprising only a few specific species retained with the last hosts in the restitution process, and some others acquired from other ungulates, or via environmental interactions. The current data on parasitic arthropods originated from the winter season, and less frequently, from autumn and early spring. The present study contains the first information on the occurrence of arthropods in the European bison (n = 6) in the summer season, which is the period of their increased activity. Data on the seasonal and populational dynamics of ectoparasites have been verified; specific parasite species (Demodex bisonianus, Bisonicola sedecimdecembrii, and recently described Demodex bialoviensis) and typical parasite species (Chorioptes bovis, Ixodes ricinus) have been recorded. The data refer to the information from other study periods, summarizing and valorizing data on parasitic arthropods in the form of a global checklist. These arthropods occur in European bison frequently (prevalence reaches up to 100%), but they are present in small numbers, and do not present a burden for the host; only sometimes, with high intensity of infection, they cause parasitoses (chorioptosis, mallohagosis). However, as an effect of regular activity, by penetrating the skin of the host, they create gateways for secondary infections, and hematophagous parasites (e.g., ticks) can be vectors of pathogens that can be hazardous, even at low infection levels. The identification of the parasitological threats faced by European bison is not only important from the standpoint of the study object, i.e., the Bialowieza Forest European bison population, from which the existing bison population of Europe has been derived, but also the fact that their transfer to different parts of Europe can entail the additional transfer of their parasites.

AB  - Wildlife crime poses a severe threat to global biodiversity, driving species extinctions and enabling organized crime networks. While China has strengthened legal frameworks to combat illegal wildlife trade, the shift of illicit activities to online platforms challenges traditional enforcement methods. This study integrates judicial records (2011-2019) with Baidu Search Index (BSI) data to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildlife crime and its linkage to public search behavior, focusing on six keystone taxa: elephants, rhinos, tigers, bears, pangolins, and musk deer. Using spatial autocorrelation analysis and temporal correlation tests, we assessed how search trends reflect demand-side drivers and crime patterns. Key findings reveal a rise-and-decline trend in wildlife crime and most of the BSI values during the 2010s. Crimes involving exotic species (e.g., elephants, rhinos) clustered in coastal trafficking hubs, while offenses against native taxa (bears, musk deer) dispersed across source regions. Public search behavior exhibited species-specific patterns: derivative products correlated with exotic species crimes, whereas vernacular names aligned with native species offenses, reflecting divergent motivations. Spatial analysis identified High-High crime-search hotspots and demand-supply mismatches. This study pioneers the use of BSI as a real-time proxy for monitoring wildlife crime, demonstrating its utility in pinpointing demand hotspots and informing targeted interventions. Methodologically, integrating digital behavioral data with judicial analytics offers a transformative approach for conservation policy, albeit constrained by semantic ambiguities and rural data gaps. These insights advocate for adaptive, data-driven strategies to curb biodiversity loss and transnational trafficking networks.

AB  - Nematodes are involved in many important ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and plant growth. Nematode communities are thought to be structured at regional scales mainly by abiotic soil characteristics and climatic drivers and at local scales by habitat heterogeneity and biotic interactions. Blond dunes are dominated by marram grass (Calamagrostis arenaria), the key dune-forming plant species in Western Europe. Consequently, nematode food webs are mainly associated with marram grass in these coastal areas.We investigated the relative importance of regional biogeographic factors and local biotic drivers, such as the vegetation's spatial structure and the occurrence of an invasive plant species, in determining the functional diversity of belowground nematode communities inhabiting the roots of marram grass and surrounding soil in coastal dune areas. We found that nematode functional group abundances mainly differed among biogeographic regions, but that abundances could not be linked to plant-associated parameters, such as plant vitality or abundance. Additionally, the abundances of different functional groups seemed to be positively associated within both rhizosphere and bulk soil, an effect that could be the result of ecological filtering or facilitative interactions. Nematode pressure has been assumed to be an important driver of marram grass degeneration under ceasing sand dynamics.We here show that variation in nematode functional group composition is only weakly related to these local changes in plant vigour, but that large-scale patterns in nematode communities may explain regional variation in marram dynamics in coastal dunes.

AB  - Pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer populations were fully integrated in natural systems, they played an ecological role as top predators affecting food web dynamics according to predator-prey models, through which they maintained and controlled prey species numbers. However, human abilities to adapt to changing environments and different habitats as well as their capacity to expand, allowed them to occupy new environments in a formidable short lapse of time, where potential preys were unable to defend themselves against such a powerful predator. Humans were the origin of megafauna extinction in the America continent and other regions. But it was since Neolithic times, at the end of the last glacial period, when a huge change took place as humans started to manage and change the local environment through incipient crop cultivation and animal breeding. The ecological role of humans changed dramatically because, as technological advances progressed, as well as their survival rate and the ability to withstand severe weather conditions, they became a powerful species with the ability to alter all the environments and the eventual capacity to destroy them, often unintentionally. Further, humans have moved and introduced alien species across the world, causing unexpected outcomes, some of them seriously deleterious for the host fauna and flora. Currently, humans are increasingly concerned about land degradation and global warming effects and see the necessity of undertaking habitat restoration and promoting the so-called rewilding processes, including the reintroduction of wild grazers and large predators to attempt restore original food webs. An ecologically-driven human hunting activity may help in this restoration process, occupying top predators' empty niches and promoting rural development through the sustainable use of the hunting resource.

AB  - Climate change is altering high-latitude ecosystems in multiple facets, including increased insect herbivory pressure and enhanced emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from vegetation. Yet, joint impacts of climatic drivers and insect herbivory on VOC emissions from the Arctic remain largely unknown. We examined how one-month warming by open-top plastic tents, yielding a 3-4 degrees C air temperature increase, and the natural presence of gall-forming eriophyoid mites, Aculus tetanothrix, individually and in combination, affect VOC emissions from whortle leaved willow, Salix myrsinites, at two elevations in an Arctic heath tundra of Abisko, Northern Sweden. We measured VOC emissions three times in the peak growing season (July) from intact and gall-infested branches using an enclosure technique and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and leaf chemical composition using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Isoprene accounted for 91% of the VOCs emitted by S. myrsinites. Isoprene emission rates tended to be higher at the high than low elevation during the measurement periods (42 mu g g(-1)DWh(-1) vs. 23 mu g g(-1)DWh(-1)) even when temperature differences were accounted for. Experimental warming increased isoprene emissions by approximately 54%, but decrease demissions of some minor compound groups, such as green leaf volatiles (GLV) and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). In contrast, gall-infestation did not affect isoprene emissions but stimulated emissions of DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs, particularly under ambient conditions at the low elevation. The NIRS-based chemical composition of the leaves varied between the two elevations and was affected by warming and gall-infestation. Our study suggests that under elevated temperatures, S. myrsinites increases emissions of isoprene, a highly effective compound for protection against oxidative stress, while an infestation by A. tetanothrix mites induces emissions of herbivore enemy attractants like DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs. Under both conditions, warming effects on isoprene remain but mite effects on DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs diminish. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogeographic studies aim to understand species distributions and are becoming increasingly relevant to establish baselines to monitor ecological change. The NW Atlantic coast hosts a cold-temperate biota, although knowledge about its biogeography is patchy. This study documents for the first time biogeographic variation at mid-to-high intertidal elevations in wave-exposed rocky intertidal habitats along the open Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia (Canada), a hydrographically distinct subregion of this cold-temperate region. For this goal, we measured the summer abundance of algae and invertebrates at the same nine locations over four consecutive years (2014 to 2017) spanning 415 km of coastline, which allowed us to examine latitudinal and interannual patterns. In addition, we looked for mensurative evidence on possible drivers underlying these patterns, focusing on sea surface temperature, daily maximum and minimum temperature (which often happen at low tides at thus differ from sea surface temperature), pelagic food supply for intertidal filter-feeders (phytoplankton abundance and particulate organic carbon), drift sea ice during the cold season (which can cause intertidal disturbance), and species associations. Our field surveys revealed that northern locations can be severely disturbed by ice scour when drift ice is abundant and, while biological recolonization occurs over the years, it differs in pace among locations. Southern locations, instead, did not experience ice scour during our study and, thus, generally exhibited a higher species richness and abundance than northern locations. Multivariate analyses indicated that the aforementioned expressions of temperature and pelagic food supply explained together 3255% of the variation in along-shore biogeographic pattern, depending on the year. Species association analyses suggest that algal foundation species (generally more abundant at southern locations) contribute to increase location-wise species richness. Mensurative evidence for bottom-up forcing in seaweed-herbivore and filter-feeder-predator systems differed greatly among years. Overall, in addition to its inherent value to advance NW Atlantic intertidal biogeography, our species distribution database should be valuable to assess ecological change decades into the future as climate change and other anthropogenic influences unfold.

AB  - Asian elephants in Thailand face threats from anthropogenic activities such as foraging for nontimber forest products (NTFP), livestock ranching, and expansion of agricultural areas. These threats to their habitats lead to human-elephant conflicts (HEC) and endanger the survival of Asian elephants. This study assesses seasonal changes in elephant densities by comparing habitats inside and outside a protected area and analyzing the impact of human activities on elephant habitat use in a buffer zone of the Huai Kha Khaeng World Heritage Site. We surveyed elephant densities using 130 sample plots, employing the dung count method and categorizing surveyed plots by forest types, environmental factors, and anthropogenic activities. Surveys conducted seven times (from October 2018 to September 2019) captured seasonal changes in NTFP, livestock ranching, and agricultural activities. Anthropogenic activities affecting elephant habitat use were examined using a mixed-effect model. Seasonal variations significantly impacted elephant densities across surveys, averaging 0.63 individuals/km2. High densities (1.05-1.27) occurred outside the protected area in the dry season while lower densities (0.09-0.36) were recorded in the rainy season. During April-May and October-November, elephants favored areas with NTFP utilization, coinciding with villagers' foraging periods, potentially intensifying HEC. Elephants avoided buffer areas with intense livestock activity from the late dry season to the end of the rainy season but favored open areas, crop fields, and fruit orchards during the dry season. Recommendations include strict enforcement to remove livestock, implementing seasonal guidelines for NTFP harvesting, and prioritizing wildlife habitat management within the protected area. These measures are crucial for mitigating human-elephant conflicts, conserving elephant habitats, and fostering coexistence between local communities and elephants in the buffer zones of the world heritage site.

AB  - For decades, many freshwater fishes native to North America have been written off as "rough fish" and neglected as inconsequential or even scorned if perceived as inimical to traditional gamefish. Across the continent, the exact species included in this category vary but often include members of the families Lepisosteidae, Amiidae, Hiodontidae, Catostomidae, Ictaluridae, and Sciaenidae. The casual or callous treatment of these fishes, although occasionally questioned by diversity-minded scientists and the public for at least a century, has recently come under more widespread scientific scrutiny, as more holistic views of ecosystems and ecosystem-based management are increasingly embraced and implemented. Paradoxically, we are also in an era where increasing technological capabilities have exacerbated the casual disposal of native fishes via bowfishing and other methods, often followed by widespread publicity through social media. Amid this rapid technological evolution, recent scientific studies have identified and highlighted the long lifespans, erratic recruitment, and surprisingly complex stock composition and life histories of many of these neglected fishes. Conservation of these distinctive and fragile taxa has been initiated under the recognition of this life history diversity. As exemplified by the 23 articles in this Special Issue on "Underappreciated Native Fishes of North America and their Management" and highlighted in this introductory article, research on many of these taxa has surged, as has their need for management. Scientific discoveries during this timeframe have redefined our understanding of several of the species and have led to an enlightened appreciation of these fishes and their valuable roles in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization has increased wealth disparity within the United States, impacting the urban landscape and species interactions. In particular, the interactions between street trees and the arthropod communities that live among them may be modified by both human population densities across urban to suburban locations, as well as income levels within these areas. We examined the effect of land use type (urban vs. suburban) and median household income on variation in leaf damage and arthropod abundance of red maples (Acer rubrum) in the District of Columbia metropolitan region. We compared these levels of leaf damage to rates observed in a nearby temperate deciduous forest. We predicted leaf damage would be positively correlated with urbanization (forested < suburban < urban) and negatively correlated with neighborhood income level (low > medium > high). Instead, we observed higher levels of leaf damage on trees in the forest environment compared to the urban and suburban areas. Leaves from urban medium and high-income areas were less likely to exhibit herbivore damage than those from suburban areas. Of the leaves with damage, those in urban high-income and suburban low-income areas exhibited the most leaf area missing. These trends may be related to specific factors associated with urbanization and income level, such as impervious surface coverage and tree coverage. This study highlights differences in biotic interactions across individual neighborhoods and the importance of including socio-economic variables when examining species interactions in urban environments.

AB  - Most seabird species avoid predation by locating their breeding colonies in predator-free islands, inaccessible cliffs, capes, or on the mainland in Antarctica, the only continent without terrestrial predators. Departing from this general rule, a significant number of large Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies exist nowadays in South American Atlantic mainland shores spanning a wide latitudinal range. Based on published radiocarbon dating of colonies, along with historical and archaeological records, we postulate that the current distribution of these colonies may be a response to predator eradication by sheep farmers. This would have made breeding habitats near marine food resources accessible and may have also reduced competition with neighboring colonies. We employed stable isotope analysis to estimate the penguin contribution to the diet of four pumas responsible for killing thousands of penguins in a breeding colony located within a coastal national park. Furthermore, we used a bioenergetic model to quantify the consumption of forage fish under different population distribution and abundance scenarios. We briefly discuss the implications of our results in the context of conservation policies aimed at establishing ecosystem baselines along the Patagonian shores.

AB  - Energy flow through consumer-resource interactions is largely determined by body size. Allometric relationships govern the dynamics of populations by impacting rates of reproduction as well as alternative sources of mortality, which have differential impacts on smaller to larger organisms. Here we derive and investigate the timescales associated with four alternative sources of mortality for terrestrial mammals: mortality from starvation, mortality associated with aging, mortality from consumption by predators, and mortality introduced by anthropogenic subsidized harvest. The incorporation of these allometric relationships into a minimal consumer-resource model illuminates central constraints that may contribute to the structure of mammalian communities. Our framework reveals that while starvation largely impacts smaller-bodied species, the allometry of senescence is expected to be more difficult to observe. In contrast, external predation and subsidized harvest have greater impacts on the populations of larger-bodied species. Moreover, the inclusion of predation mortality reveals mass thresholds for mammalian herbivores, where dynamic instabilities may limit the feasibility of megafaunal populations. We show how these thresholds vary with alternative predator-prey mass relationships, which are not well understood within terrestrial systems. Finally, we use our framework to predict the harvest pressure required to induce mass-specific extinctions, which closely align with previous estimates of anthropogenic megafaunal exploitation in both paleontological and historical contexts. Together our results underscore the tenuous nature of megafaunal populations and how different sources of mortality may contribute to their ephemeral nature over evolutionary time.

AB  - Most tapirs are good seed dispersers. An exception is the Malayan tapir, Tapirus indicus, a seed predator (mainly of large seeds). Little is known about the capacity for tapirs to disperse seeds throughout their evolutionary history. We used the occlusal surface area (OSA) of tapir cheek teeth as a predictor of seed dispersal potential in living and extinct tapir species. We used T. indicus as a reference for an extant tapir that mostly eats seeds. The OSA was calculated by multiplying the maximal width and length of molars and premolars. A threshold based on T. indicus OSA was projected onto a box plot analysis and used as a predictor for tapir seed dispersal potential. Ordination and statistical results suggest that tooth morphology is uniform between Tapirus species and that size is the main factor affecting variation. Maxillary teeth show greater variation in morphology than mandibular teeth between species. The results suggest that extant South American tapirs are good seed dispersers. North American tapirs present variable OSAs, and Asian tapirs have a low capacity for dispersion. All European tapirs were probably efficient seed dispersers. We present the first morphometric evidence for seed dispersal capacity in tapirs, with ramifications for tapir palaeoecology.

AB  - Populations of macropods are higher than estimated pre-European densities in many parts of Australia. To achieve appropriate densities of macropods in the Australian Capital Territory's nature reserves, multi-tenure kangaroo management units are used to tailor management of kangaroos and total grazing pressure to achieve conservation objectives. An adaptive management framework is recommended that monitors the state of the ground-layer vegetation and alters the cull accordingly. This case study may provide insights for kangaroo management in other temperate areas of Australia.

AB  - Windthrow disturbance is an important driver of arthropod diversity in forests. In the past, studies have mainly focused on the first years after disturbance, and there are hardly any data on arthropod trajectories in windthrows and on salvage logging effects over decades. We sampled arthropods of different functional groups on 16 permanent plots following two windstorms (Vivian and Lothar) in coniferous and broadleaf forests at different elevations in Central Europe over two decades. Flight interception and pitfall traps were operated during the entire growing seasons in three habitat types per site: unsalvaged windthrow, salvaged windthrow and control forest. In total, 524,115 individuals from 1666 arthropod species were identified, of which more than 90% occurred in windthrows, including 40%-53% species exclusively found in windthros. Over the two decades, saproxylics, herbivores, pollinators, predators and endangered species showed significantly higher species numbers and abundances in windthrows than in control forests, where only 6% exclusive species occurred. Arthropod communities in windthrows showed distinct dynamics during the two decades. Their species numbers and abundances peaked in the first 3 years, coined by saproxylic species, such as bark beetles, and by pollinating hoverflies. While abundances declined rapidly, species numbers remained elevated for two decades. Arthropod similarity between windthrows and forests (indicating resilience) increased with time but depended on elevation and forest type. After 20 years, it reached an average of 50% in lowland broadleaf forests, but only 30% in high-elevation spruce forests, indicating lower resilience. Salvage logging had no significant effect on overall species numbers but altered species composition. More than 10% exclusive species were found in salvaged and up to 20% in unsalvaged windthrows, with the latter supporting more endangered species, particularly towards the second decade. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that windthrow causes an initial boost of arthropod diversity. While abundances thereafter rapidly decline, species numbers remain at relatively high levels during at least two decades. Unsalvaged windthrows are an indispensable resource for endangered species, particularly in later wood decay stages.
   St & uuml;rme sind wichtige Faktoren f & uuml;r die Erhaltung der Arthropodenvielfalt in W & auml;ldern. Bisherige Untersuchungen bezogen sich haupts & auml;chlich auf die ersten Jahre nach der St & ouml;rung, und es gibt kaum Angaben zur l & auml;ngerfristigen Entwicklung von Arthropoden in Windw & uuml;rfen und zu den Auswirkungen einer Holzr & auml;umung. Wir beprobten verschiedene funktionelle Gruppen von Arthropoden auf 16 Dauerbeobachtungsfl & auml;chen nach zwei St & uuml;rmen (Vivian, Lothar) in Nadel- und Laubw & auml;ldern unterschiedlicher H & ouml;henlagen in Mitteleuropa & uuml;ber zwei Jahrzehnte. W & auml;hrend der gesamten Vegetationsperiode wurden Flug- und Bodenfallen in drei Lebensraumtypen betrieben: unger & auml;umter Windwurf, ger & auml;umter Windwurf und intakter Kontrollwald. Insgesamt wurden 524 ' 115 Individuen von 1 ' 666 Arthropodenarten bestimmt. Mehr als 90% der Arten kamen in den Windw & uuml;rfen vor, 40%-53% sogar ausschlie ss lich dort. In dieser Periode von 20 Jahren wiesen Windw & uuml;rfe deutlich h & ouml;here Artenzahlen und Abundanzen an Xylobionten, Herbivoren, Best & auml;ubern, R & auml;ubern und gef & auml;hrdeten Arten auf als intakte W & auml;lder. Nur 6% der Arten kamen ausschliesslich im Kontrollwald vor. Die Artengemeinschaften in Windw & uuml;rfen zeigten eine deutliche Dynamik in diesen zwei Jahrzehnten. Ihre Artenzahlen und Abundanzen erreichten in den ersten drei Jahren ihr Maximum. Diese Phase war von xylobionten Arten wie Borkenk & auml;fern und Bl & uuml;tenbesuchern wie Schwebfliegen gepr & auml;gt. W & auml;hrend die Abundanzen rasch zur & uuml;ckgingen, blieb die Artenzahl zwei Jahrzehnte lang auf einem hohen Niveau. Die & Auml;hnlichkeit (Similarity) der Arthropoden zwischen Windw & uuml;rfen und W & auml;ldern nahm mit der Zeit zu (Resilienz), hing jedoch von H & ouml;henlage und Waldtyp ab. Nach 20 Jahren erreichte sie in den Laubw & auml;ldern des Tieflandes durchschnittlich 50%, in hochgelegenen Fichtenw & auml;ldern jedoch nur 30%, was eine geringere Resilienz bedeutet. Die Sturmholzr & auml;umung hatte keine signifikanten Auswirkungen auf die Gesamtartenzahl, ver & auml;nderte aber die Artenzusammensetzung. Mehr als 10% exklusive Arten wurden in ger & auml;umten und bis zu 20% in unger & auml;umten Windw & uuml;rfen gefunden, wobei letztere mehr gef & auml;hrdete Arten aufwiesen, insbesondere in der zweiten Dekade. Synthese und Anwendungen: Unsere Studie zeigt, dass ein Windwurf zu einer markanten Zunahme der Arthropodenvielfalt f & uuml;hrt. W & auml;hrend die Abundanzen schnell wieder abnehmen, bleiben die Artenzahlen & uuml;ber mindestens 20 Jahre auf relativ hohem Niveau. Unger & auml;umte Sturmfl & auml;chen sind eine herausragende Ressource f & uuml;r gef & auml;hrdete Arten, insbesondere in sp & auml;teren Zerfallsstadien.

AB  - As hunter -gatherers, Neandertal mobility and corresponding adaptations were influenced by the mobility of their prey; thus, it is critical to track how the movement patterns of each species varied over time at specific sites. Here, prey paleomobility is reconstructed by measuring radiogenic strontium isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in herbivore teeth recovered from two archaeological sites (Pech de l 'Aze <acute accent> IV and Roc de Marsal) in the Dordogne Valley (Aquitaine Basin) of southwestern France that span marine isotope stages (MIS) 5-3. These ratios are compared to a published isoscape as well as new environmental samples (soil, Helix shells, rodent teeth, water, and wine). Our results show that reindeer ( Rangifer ) likely moved within the sedimentary basins of France and did not venture into mountainous regions. Instead, reindeer, bison ( Bison ) and other prey species were available year-round in the Aquitaine and Paris basins. Red deer ( Cervus ) and horse ( Equus ) may have ventured into the mountains. These results suggest that Neandertals could find year-round faunal resources in these basins, at least during MIS 4 and 3.

AB  - Background There is an urgent need to develop global observation networks to quantify biodiversity trends for evaluating achievements of targets of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Camera traps are a commonly used tool, with the potential to enhance global observation networks for monitoring wildlife population trends and has the capacity to constitute global observation networks by applying a unified sampling protocol. The Snapshot protocol is simple and easy for camera trapping which is applied in North America and Europe. However, there is no regional camera-trap network with the Snapshot protocol in Asia. New information We present the first dataset from a collaborative camera-trap survey using the Snapshot protocol in Japan conducted in 2023. We collected data at 90 locations across nine arrays for a total of 6162 trap-nights of survey effort. The total number of sequences with mammals and birds was 7967, including 20 mammal species and 23 avian species. Apart from humans, wild boar, sika deer and rodents were the most commonly observed taxa on the camera traps, covering 57.9% of all the animal individuals. We provide the dataset with a standard format of Wildlife Insights, but also with Camtrap DP 1.0 format. Our dataset can be used for a part of the global dataset for comparing relative abundances of wildlife and for a baseline of wildlife population trends in Japan. It can also used fortraining machine-learning models for automatic species identifications.

AB  - The mechanisms driving species co-occurrence are varied and include biotic interactions, abiotic factors, and scale-dependent processes. Based on a comprehensive dataset of lepidopteran herbivores recorded from a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment, we tested the contribution to herbivore species co-occurrence of herbivore phylogenetic relatedness, plant diversity and functional traits, and spatial scale. We found that Lepidoptera co-occurrence was negatively associated with their phylogenetic relatedness, tree diversity, and defensive traits, but positively associated with nutritional functional traits. Furthermore, species co-occurrence was higher at larger spatial scales (tree species or plot) than at smaller scale (individual trees). Our results provide evidence supporting both environmental filtering and competition exclusion hypotheses, and highlight the significance of functionality in shaping species coexistence of herbivores in plant-arthropod systems.

AB  - Temperature is often used to infer how climate influences wildlife distributions; yet, other parameters also contribute, separately and combined, with effects varying across geographical scales. Here, we used an unoccupied aircraft system to explore how environmental parameters affect the regional distribution of the terrestrial and marine breeding habitats of threatened loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Surveys spanned four years and ~620 km coastline of western Greece, encompassing low (<10 nests/km) to high (100-500 nests/km) density nesting areas. We recorded 2395 tracks left by turtles on beaches and 1928 turtles occupying waters adjacent to these beaches. Variation in beach track and inwater turtle densities was explained by temperature, offshore prevailing wind, and physical marine and terrestrial factors combined. The highest beach-track densities (400 tracks/km) occurred on beaches with steep slopes and higher sand temperatures, sheltered from prevailing offshore winds. The highest inwater turtle densities (270 turtles/km) occurred over submerged sandbanks, with warmer sea temperatures associated with offshore wind. Most turtles (90%) occurred over nearshore submerged sandbanks within 10 km of beaches supporting the highest track densities, showing the strong linkage between optimal marine and terrestrial environments for breeding. Our findings demonstrate the utility of UASs in surveying marine megafauna and environmental data at large scales and the importance of integrating multiple factors in climate change models to predict species distributions.

AB  - Remote cameras have become a mainstream tool for studying wildlife populations. For species whose developmental stages or states are identifiable in photographs, there are opportunities for tracking population changes and estimating demographic rates. Recent developments in hierarchical models allow for the estimation of ecological states and rates over time for unmarked animals whose states are known. However, this powerful class of models has been underutilized because they are computationally intensive, and model outputs can be difficult to interpret. Here, we use simulation to show how camera data can be analyzed with multistate, Dail-Madsen (hereafter multistate DM) models to estimate abundance, survival, and recruitment. We evaluated four commonly encountered scenarios arising from camera trap data (low and high abundance and 25% and 50% missing data) each with 18 different sample size combinations (camera sites = 40, 250; surveys = 4, 8, and 12; and years = 2, 5, 10) and evaluated the bias and precision of abundance, survival, and recruitment estimates. We also analyzed our empirical camera data on moose (Alces alces) with multistate DM models and compared inference with telemetry studies from the same time and region to assess the accuracy of camera studies to track moose populations. Most scenarios recovered the known parameters from our simulated data with higher accuracy and increased precision for scenarios with more sites, surveys, and/or years. Large amounts of missing data and fewer camera sites, especially at higher abundances, reduced accuracy, and precision of survival and recruitment. Our empirical analysis provided biologically realistic estimates of moose survival and recruitment and recovered the pattern of moose abundance across the region. Multistate DM models can be used for estimating demographic parameters from camera data when developmental states are clearly identifiable. We discuss several avenues for future research and caveats for using multistate DM models for large-scale population monitoring.

AB  - Parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarinae) are key components of reef environments worldwide. Their fused beak-like teeth enable them to play important ecological roles, including the opening of bare spaces that benthic organisms may colonize. However, the extent to which this role is played can vary among species and individuals due to morphological traits. Scarus trispinosus is considered the main excavator parrotfish in the southwestern Atlantic due to its large size, robust jaw apparatus and the prevalence of grazing scars it leaves on the reef benthos. Large individuals of the species, however, have been threatened by overfishing. Here, we assessed the dynamics of bite scars of S. trispinosus on the on the reef benthos of the Abrolhos Archipelago, Brazil. Bite scars taken on epilithic algal matrices were marked and photographed for eight consecutive days. We tested whether individual body size and the number of consecutive bites affect the recolonization of the scar area over time. The mean scar area (1.78 +/- 1.04 cm2) decreased significantly over eight days, but the colors within the scar remained significantly different from the control areas after this period. Both individual body size and the number of consecutive bites had a significant positive effect on scar size. We estimated that S. trispinosus opens bare space at a rate of 0.6 +/- 0.34 m2 ind-1 d-1 for individuals larger than 40 cm. This study provides novel information on the effects of the foraging activity of the endangered S. trispinosus, highlighting its unique role on Brazilian reefs and its functional vulnerability.

AB  - Animal migration is a key process underlying active subsidies and species dispersal over long distances, which affects the connectivity and functioning of ecosystems. Despite much research describing patterns of where animals migrate, we still lack a framework for quantifying and predicting how animal migration affects ecosystem processes. In this study, we aim to integrate animal movement behavior and ecosystem functioning by developing a predictive modeling framework that can inform ecosystem management and conservation. We propose a framework to model individual-level migration trajectories between populations' seasonal ranges as well as the resulting dispersal and fate of propagules carried by the migratory animals, which can be calibrated using empirical data at every step of the modeling process. As a case study, we applied our framework to model the spread of guava seeds, Psidium guajava, by a population of migratory Galapagos tortoises, Chelonoidis porteri, across Santa Cruz Island. Galapagos tortoises are large herbivores that transport seeds and nutrients across the island, while Guava is one of the most problematic invasive species in the Galapagos archipelago. Our model can predict the pattern of spread of guava seeds alongside tortoises' downslope migration range, and it identified areas most likely to see establishment success. Our results show that Galapagos tortoises' seed dispersal may particularly contribute to guava range expansion on Santa Cruz Island, due to both long gut retention time and tortoise's long-distance migration across vegetation zones. In particular, we predict that tortoises are dispersing a significant amount of guava seeds into the Galapagos National Park, which has important consequences for the native flora. The flexibility and modularity of our framework allow for the integration of multiple data sources. It also allows for a wide range of applications to investigate how migratory animals affect ecosystem processes, including propagule dispersal but also other processes such as nutrient transport across ecosystems. Our framework is also a valuable tool for predicting how animal-mediated propagule dispersal can be affected by environmental change. These different applications can have important conservation implications for the management of ecosystems that include migratory animals.

AB  - We used the COVID-19 pandemic closure at the Saint Louis Zoo to examine visitor effects on space use and glucocorticoid levels in banteng, grizzly bears, polar bears, and western lowland gorillas. The study was divided into four six-week phases: closure in spring 2020, reopening in summer 2020, fall 2020, and spring 2021 as a seasonal comparison. Space use data were collected using video, and fecal samples were assayed for glucocorticoids. Generalized linear models were used to examine differences in zone occupancy and glucocorticoids between phases. The banteng spent more time near visitors, and glucocorticoids were only temporarily elevated in two of five animals when visitors returned. The grizzly bears spent more time in their habitat than in the den, and the polar bear spent more time near viewing areas after visitors returned. Glucocorticoids did not differ significantly between the closure and reopening for any bears. The gorillas spent less time close to visitors immediately after reopening but this effect waned by fall; glucocorticoid data were not available. Overall, based on space use and glucocorticoid levels, we suggest visitor effects on the gorillas are neutral, on the grizzly bears are neutral or positive, and are positive on the banteng and polar bear.

AB  - The oak lace bug Corythucha arcuata (Say, 1832), an invasive sap-sucking insect originating from North America, has rapidly spread across Europe, raising concerns about its impact on oak forest ecosystems. This study evaluates the short-term effects of C. arcuata infestation on radial growth and wood properties of Hungarian oak Quercus frainetto Ten. in Kalyvas-Margaritiou public forest complex along the Xanthi-Drama national highway in northeastern Greece, Xanthi Prefecture, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Oak trees were sampled in areas with varying degrees of infestation to compare growth characteristics and evaluate potential physiological impacts. Results revealed no statistically significant differences in tree radial growth or late/early wood ratios (p=0.125 and p=0.0837, respectively) between infested and non-infested trees. The study also highlights the critical role of highways as dispersal corridors, with infestation levels decreasing with distance from the roads. While short-term impacts appear negligible, the potential for long-term consequences remains a concern. Continuous infestation could interact with other stressors, such as drought, defoliation, and climate extremes, posing risks to tree health, acorn production, and associated biodiversity. This study underscores the importance of monitoring invasive species and their cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems.

AB  - Many mammals cross large rivers to access seasonal habitats, yet river crossing behavior is poorly acknowledged or understood. Crossing large rivers is inherently risky, with vessel traffic and flooding events increasing the risk of drowning. We investigated river crossing behavior by threatened bison (Bison bison) in the boreal forest, using data from 11 GPS-collared animals to identify when and where they cross a major river. We used kernel densities of GPS locations to identify crossing hotspots, and developed resource selection function (RSF) models that used habitat characteristics to explain crossing behavior based on a priori hypotheses. We then predicted high-probability crossing areas along a 400-km stretch of river using the best-supported RSF model. Bison regularly crossed the river ((x) over bar = 8.6 crossings/100 days), particularly during summer months. Model selection results suggested that bison may have chosen river crossing areas that maximized access to forage. Bison preferred to cross the river near islands and areas with high seismic line densities, both of which were likely preferred summer foraging habitats. In addition, islands may have been used as temporary stopovers while crossing the river, or for relief from biting insects. Bison crossed the river where the channel was relatively narrow (x over bar = 400 +/- 213 m [SD]) and chose days when river discharge was low, likely to reduce the risk of drowning, exhaustion, or hypothermia. While based on a small sample of collared bison, predictions about high-probability crossing areas may be used to inform mitigation measures aimed at reducing bison drowning caused by vessel traffic, which is expected to increase as resource development expands in the region. Our approach may be informative for identifying river crossing hotspots for other mammals that cross major rivers.

AB  - Land degradation, competition with livestock, infrastructure development, and climate change have reduced habitat availability and reduced population connectivity for many wildlife species. Large herbivores are particularly vulnerable, and approximately 90 % of global large herbivore diversity is in Africa. The endangered Grevy's zebra illustrates the decline and fragmentation of large mammalian herbivore populations, with exten-sive population loss across their range in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. A better understanding of the factors influencing population connectivity and movement patterns of Grevy's zebra, highlighted in national strategies, offers valuable insights for other threatened species.Using location and movement data for Grevy's zebra from GPS collars deployed between 2010 and 2017, seasonally-explicit landscape resistance was modelled as a function of water availability, vegetation, cattle density, topography and proximity to roads and settlements. Maximum entropy models identified habitat suit-ability during wet and dry seasons respectively. Population connectivity analyses using least-cost paths and circuit theory determined landscape resistance to movement and highlighted linkage pathways. Movement was modelled over a range of distances, using GPS data.Grevy's zebra reliance on water was confirmed, with an apparent trade-off between habitat suitability and proximity to people. Connectivity models highlighted potentially isolated populations, with reduced seasonal connectivity being most apparent between north to south distribution areas. These results can inform sustainable land management planning in northern Kenya and offer support for Grevy's zebra conservation actions. These results also provide insights that can be applied to other large herbivores occurring in this region and in arid or degraded environments elsewhere.

AB  - Hepatitis E caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered an emerging foodborne zoonosis in industrialized, non-endemic countries. Domestic pigs and wild boars are considered the main reservoir of HEV. However, HEV can also infect an ever-expanding host range of animals, but they exact role in transmitting the virus to other species or humans is mostly unknown. In this work, we investigated the spread of HEV in free-living and captive spotted deer (Axis axis) from Uruguay in a 2-year period (2020-2022) and examined the role of this invasive species as a new potential reservoir of the virus. In addition, with the aim to gain new insights into viral ecology in the context of One Health, by using camera trapping, we identified and quantified temporal and spatial coexistence of spotted deer, wild boars, and cattle. In free-living animals, we detected an anti-HEV seropositivity of 11.1% (6/54). HEV infection and viral excretion in feces were assessed by RT-PCR. Thirteen of 19 samples (68.4%) had HEV RNA. Six samples were amplified using a broadly reactive RT-PCR and sequenced. No captive animal showed evidence of HEV infection. Additionally, HEV RNA was detected in a freshwater pond shared by these species. Phylogenetic and p-distance analysis revealed that zoonotic HEV genotype 3 strains circulate together with unclassified variants related to moose HEV whose potential risk of transmission to humans and other domestic and wild animals is unknown. The data presented here suggest that spotted deer (A. axis) may be a novel host for zoonotic HEV strains.

AB  - Mapping of winter habitat suitability is important for the persistence and conservation of at-risk woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)). While well documented at the national scale for boreal woodland caribou, particularly in highly disturbed southern ranges, winter habitat suitability remains understudied in northern and intact ranges such as in northern Ontario. We used boosted regression tree species distribution modeling and environmental variables with ecological relevance to woodland caribou to predict and map suitable winter woodland caribou habitat in northeastern Ontario, Canada. The best model suggests that peatland types and the climatic effect of James and Hudson Bay may have a marked (68.8% cumulative relative influence) effect on woodland caribou habitat suitability. Based on this, a predictive model identified a large and clustered zone of winter woodland caribou habitat centered within the transition between the ecozones. By accounting for local-scale aspects of woodland caribou habitat and bioclimatic variables, our model provides comprehensive predictions of woodland caribou winter habitat suitability in this transition zone. Additional investigation of the role of peatland type in woodland caribou habitat suitability in different seasons and different regions may help further understand woodland caribou distribution and habitat use.

AB  - Hand-reared animals are invaluable and irreplaceable in studies of wildlife nutrition. Hand-rearing protocols provide insights into dietary and training programs, but less information is available on disease management. In young ruminants, thiamin (Vitamin B1) deficiency is a particularly important disease that is treatable early in the disease process, but otherwise can be fatal. In this husbandry report, we describe a case of suspected thiamin deficiency in a hand-reared calf (Rangifer tarandus granti) that resulted in clinical signs of polioencephalomalacia and persisted for > 3 months. We attempted treatment with thiamin injections; injections resolved clinical signs of disease, but clinical signs of disease returned once injections stopped. After > 2 months of thiamin injections, the caribou calf received a rumen transfaunation from a fistulated moose (Alces alces) housed at the same facility. Following rumen transfaunation, we did not observe signs of thiamin deficiency. The calf outgrew other females in the cohort initially and shows no long-term effects of thiamin deficiency or polioencephalomalacia. We recommend rumen transfaunation when thiamin deficiency is suspected and does not resolve with thiamin injections alone. We also recommend heterospecific donors if conspecific donors are not available.

AB  - Current genome sequencing technologies have made it possible to generate highly contiguous genome assemblies for non-model animal species. Despite advances in genome assembly methods, there is still room for improvement in the delineation of specific gene features in the genomes. Here we present genome visualization and annotation tools to support seven livestock species (bovine, chicken, goat, horse, pig, sheep, and water buffalo), available in a new resource called AgAnimalGenomes. In addition to supporting the manual refinement of gene models, these browsers provide visualization tracks for hundreds of RNAseq experiments, as well as data generated by the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) Consortium. For species with predicted gene sets from both Ensembl and RefSeq, the browsers provide special tracks showing the thousands of protein-coding genes that disagree across the two gene sources, serving as a valuable resource to alert researchers to gene model issues that may affect data interpretation. We describe the data and search methods available in the new genome browsers and how to use the provided tools to edit and create new gene models.

AB  - The objective of current study was to find out the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in blue wildebeest, alpacas, and goats with same husbandry and fence site in Harbin Zoo, China. From August 2015 to August 2016, 507 fecal samples of blue wildebeest (188), alpacas (195) and goats (124) were examined for gastrointestinal parasites by saturated sodium chloride floatation technique. The microscopic analysis, based on the morphology of oocysts, indicates that the present parasites are Capillaria sp. in blue wildebeest; Eimeria christenseni, E. alijevi, Trichuris sp. and one Strongy-type species in goats; Trichuris sp., Nematodirus sp., Moniezia sp., E. macusaniensis, another Eimeria sp. and another Strongy-type (different with goats) in alpacas. It was discovered that the infection rate was 45.74%, 38.97%, and 12.09% in blue wildebeest, alpacas and goats, respectively. The hosts have different dominant parasite and diverse prevalence in different season, temperature, and humidity groups. Host specificity is the main reason for the difference of host fauna among the three ruminants. The data of the study will provide an accumulating knowledge to help preventing and controlling the spread of infectious parasitic diseases in the zoo.

AB  - Chironomidae is a group of insects widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems, where they are generally abundant and highly diverse, performing important ecosystem functions. These insects can serve as biomonitoring tools because they respond readily to environmental changes, especially those of human origin. In this study, we tested whether changes in land use and land cover (LULC), as well as environmental variables, would affect the functional feeding groups (FFG) and the Chironomidae community in floodplain lakes within the Trombetas and Tapaj & oacute;s river basins. Nine lakes were sampled in these areas. The collected material was sorted in the laboratory and mounted on semi-permanent slides for identification and classification into functional feeding groups. A total of 3536 individuals, distributed across 33 genera, were identified. Generally, environments characterised by non-forest natural formations, forested areas, and temperature were positively correlated with the Chironomidae community. Conversely, the variables electrical conductivity, urban area, and conductivity showed negative correlations with the community. Regarding the FFG, collector-gatherers were the most abundant, followed by predators, shredder-herbivores, and collector-filterers. When evaluating the influence of environmental variables and land use and cover on the FFG, we found that urban areas and non-forest natural formations negatively impacted predators and shredder-herbivores, while also increasing electrical conductivity. Additionally, low dissolved oxygen concentrations negatively affected collector-filterers, and collector-gatherers were negatively influenced by forested areas. Thus, our results corroborate the importance of environmental variables and changes in land use on the Chironomidae community, providing information that can contribute to the conservation of floodplain lakes, with biomonitoring of these lakes and information for public policies.

AB  - In temperate ecosystems wild ungulates are known to switch their diets from growing season in spring and summer to lean season in winter. Such dietary shifts are crucial for wild herbivores living under temperate climatic conditions. The sympatric wild herbivores in temperate habitats may have to compete for limited food resources in winter and more diet overlap is likely to occur among them. The present study was conducted from December 2020 to February 2021 to assess winter dietary overlap between two sympatric wild caprids: markhor (Capra falconeri) and Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral) at Kazinag National Park (KNP) and its adjoining areas viz., Limber Wildlife Sanctuary (LiWLS), Lachipora Wildlife Sanctuary (LaWLS) and Naganari Conservation Reserve (NCR) in the Kashmir Himalaya. The two wild goats shared same habitat and limited food plants in winter at lower altitudes of KNP. We used micro-histological analysis for identifying dietary items from 120 fresh faecal samples of two wild goats (markhor, n = 60 and Himalayan goral, n = 60). The faecal samples were collected from the field after the animals left the sites. The analysis revealed 20 identified plant species from Himalayan goral diet and 17 from markhor diet shared with the former. Both wild goats maintained a higher proportion of browse (Himalayan goral = 57.58%; markhor = 70.99%) than graze (Himalayan goral = 40.43%; markhor = 25.14%) in their winter diet. Overall Shannon-diversity index values were high for Himalayan goral (2.23) and relatively low for markhor (1.95). High diversity index values were recorded in January (Himalayan goral = 2.27; markhor = 2.07) and slightly lower values for December (Himalayan goral = 2.24; markhor = 1.87) and February (Himalayan goral = 2.18; markhor = 1.90). Markhor and Himalayan goral had a higher dietary overlap (0.72 +/- 0.17) for shrubs and less overlap for grasses (0.32 +/- 0.09) and trees (0.22 +/- 0.06) in winter. Himalayan goral had high amount of diet overlap with markhor for grasses (0.37 +/- 0.14) in December and shrubs in January (0.64 +/- 0.21) and February (0.49 +/- 0.11). The comprehensive investigation of the winter diet overlap between two sympatric wild goats in KNP and adjoining areas would boost conservation action.

AB  - Camera traps and drone surveys both leverage advancing technologies to study dynamic wildlife populations with little disturbance. Both techniques entail strengths and weaknesses, and common camera trap methods can be confounded by unrealistic assumptions and prerequisite conditions. We compared three methods to estimate the population density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virgnianus) in a section of Pilot Mountain State Park, NC, USA: (1) camera trapping using mark-resight ratios or (2) N-mixture modeling and (3) aerial thermal videography from a drone platform. All three methods yielded similar density estimates, suggesting that they converged on an accurate estimate. We also included environmental covariates in the N-mixture modeling to explore spatial habitat use, and we fit models for each season to understand temporal changes in population density. Deer occurred in greater densities on warmer, south-facing slopes in the autumn and winter and on cooler north-facing slopes and in areas with flatter terrain in the summer. Seasonal density estimates over two years suggested an annual cycle of higher densities in autumn and winter than in summer, indicating that the region may function as a refuge during the hunting season.

AB  - Drones are growing in popularity and are used to locate individual animals, estimate ungulate population size, and monitor endangered species. Our goal was to assess the efficacy of using drones to locate neonatal white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for capture. During May-June 2019 and June 2020, we used a drone equipped with thermal-infrared (TIR) and conventional multispectral red-green-blue (RGB) cameras to locate and confirm fawn thermal signatures in Minnesota's southern farmland region. We confirmed 29 and 71 fawn thermal signatures in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We captured 13 fawns to validate the methodology (detection and identification) of using drones for capture in 2019. We flew the drone for 47.3 hours covering 792 hectares (17 hectares per hour) in 2019 and flew for 41.1 hours and covered 1640 hectares (40 hectares per hour) in 2020. We worked 201.5 person-hours with a mean crew size of 4 people that required 6.9 person-hours to locate each fawn in 2019, whereas we worked 145.7 person-hours with a mean crew size of 4 people that required 70% less effort and resulted in 2.1 person-hours to locate each fawn in 2020. Flight efficiency was highest at 60 m above ground level (AGL) with a speed of 9 m/s; however, diurnal use of drones made identifying fawn thermal signatures difficult as thermal loading of the environment quickly reduced the temperature differential between vegetation and signatures. We found TIR-equipped drones to be an efficient method to locate and subsequently capture fawns in open habitats in comparison to other capture methods such as vaginal implant transmitters (VITs), ground searches, or monitoring doe behavior. We recommend flying at night or in cloudy conditions to avoid false positives. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Fenced sanctuaries that exclude feral predators are critical for threatened species conservation. However, adaptive management of these sanctuaries requires careful consideration of the potential impact herbivore populations free from predation can have on the condition of native vegetation. The Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary in the Australian Capital Territory comprises Critically Endangered box-gum grassy woodland, threatened orchids, abundant macropods, and a reintroduced population of the Eastern Bettong (Bettongia gaimardi, hereafter "Ngaluda"). To understand how Ngaluda, along with other herbivores, may be potentially impacting vegetation across the sanctuary, we undertook an assessment of indicator plant species. We monitored 106 plots for 13 indicator species (10 species with tuberous roots that the burrowing Ngaluda would be preferentially targeting and three non-tuberous species). We found that most floristic indicators we investigated - including richness of indicator species and the abundance of lilies - were higher in the Goorooyarroo area of the sanctuary (where Ngaluda are absent and wallabies are rare) compared to the Mulligans Flat area of the sanctuary (where Ngaluda are present and wallabies are abundant), suggesting a negative impact of the overall herbivore assemblage of Mulligans Flat. However, within just Mulligans Flat, some indicators, including the abundance of a common orchid, were significantly lower in areas associated with high Ngaluda activity irrespective of other herbivore densities. We found no instance of Ngaluda presence or higher activity being associated with higher values for any floristic indicator we investigated. These results are consistent with known impacts of abundant herbivores and reintroduced digging marsupials in other predator-free sanctuaries in Australia. Our results highlight that Ngaluda herbivory may be outweighing any positive effect of their diggings on native vegetation and indicate the need for careful risk mitigation when deciding how critically endangered animals and vegetation communities are managed together in sanctuaries.

AB  - This technical note asks what role Canadian Bison ranchers play in conserving North American Bison. Bison are keystone species in grassland ecosystems and pose numerous ecological benefits as wild animals. Unfortunately, most wild Bison have been eradicated through the process of colonization. Today, over 90% of Bison exist in commercial production rather than for conservation; however, the Canadian Bison Association-an organization committed to protecting the industry-wishes to blur the line between the two. Conversations with a few members of the CBA suggest that ranching may support the numerical recovery of Bison but may not support ecological recovery. Although there have been calls for cross-jurisdictional collaboration in the Bison conservation literature, more research is needed to reconcile what appear to be incompatible values between ranchers and ecological conservationists.

AB  - Blastocystis cf. Blastocystis hominis is the most common unicellular parasite found in human and animal intestines. Little is known about the life cycle, transmission and mechanisms of pathogenesis for this parasite. The aim of this study was to obtain new data on the genetic diversity of Blastocystis in selected species of mammals found in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF), Poland, the best preserved lowland forest in temperate Europe. 113 faecal samples were collected in the period 2018-2020 from seven species of wild mammals occurring within the Polish part of BPF and its surroundings. Blastocystis was detected by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene. The overall prevalence of Blastocystis in animals was 8.9%. A larger number of stool samples (90) were collected from European bison and only for this species was it possible to calculate the prevalence of infection (5.6%). The isolates obtained from European bison were classified as ST1, ST3, ST5, ST7. Blastocystis was also detected in the grey wolf (Canis lupus) (ST5), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (ST5) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) (ST1). In conclusion, for the first time we have demonstrated the presence of Blastocystis in wild European bison. Preliminary studies have shown that Blastocystis is present in at least 4 species of wild mammals in the BPF area and that it exhibits great genetic diversity.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) are abundant in grazing ecosystems and play a pivotal role in shaping vegetation characteristics. However, accurately determining their diets through traditional methods, such as direct observations, remains challenging, particularly in natural communities and mixed-species grazing systems. Recent studies have shown that DNA metabarcoding can effectively identify the plant composition in LMH diets as well as the plant-dwelling arthropods (PDA) incidentally ingested by LMH while grazing. Given the high specificity of herbivorous insects to their host plant, we hypothesize that DNA metabarcoding of arthropods ingested by LMH could offer valuable insights into their feeding preferences. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of plant and arthropod DNA metabarcoding methods in identifying the diets of sheep and cattle and to compare their performance with direct observations and known dietary patterns from the literature. To test this, we collected fecal samples from sheep and cattle grazing in the northeast Asian grasslands. We amplified arthropod DNA using COI mitochondrial markers and plant DNA using ITS1 markers, followed by Illumina sequencing. Additionally, we conducted field observations to identify plants grazed by sheep and cattle. The DNA metabarcoding methods provided a comprehensive view of the LMH diet. Both DNA metabarcoding methods successfully detected dietary differences between sheep and cattle, with sheep primarily consuming nutrient-rich forbs and cattle predominantly grazing on Poaceae, consistent with known foraging behaviors. While the constant presence of arthropods across multiple samples suggests that DNA of ingested arthropods could provide complementary information regarding LMH foraging behavior, we found such to be rather limited. However, our findings confirm that plant DNA metabarcoding is a reliable and accurate method for identifying LMH diets.

AB  - Bacterial-feeding nematodes affect bacteria-mediated nitrogen (N) cycling processes by their predation on bacteria. However, the correlations between bacterial abundance, diversity, community composition, and the abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes in the presence of organic combined with inorganic fertilizers, and their effects on soil N availability are unclear. Here, four field fertilization treatments, including unfertilized control (CK), chemical N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers (NPK), NPK plus crop straw (SNPK), and NPK plus pig manure (MNPK), were performed for studying relationships among bacterial abundance, diversity, community composition, and the abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes along with corresponding effects on soil N availability. Results showed that nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content was significantly upregulated in the SNPK and MNPK treatments compared to that in the NPK treatment and showed a significant positive relationship with bacterial abundance and community composition. As revealed by partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM), bacterial community composition had a stronger effect on the NO3--N content, and bacterial-feeding nematodes indirectly affected the NO3--N content by directly positively affecting the bacterial community composition, among which the bacterial-feeding nematode Eucephalobus played a stronger role in the production of NO3--N. Overall, the findings of this study suggested that bacterial-feeding nematodes can improve soil N availability through impacting bacterial community composition rather than bacterial diversity and abundance. These results suggest that bacterial-feeding nematodes may play an important role in improving soil N availability in farmlands.

AB  - Native plants of the Sahara are remarkably resistant to prolonged droughts and are important sources of forage, food, and medicine. Their regeneration from seeds after strong anthropogenic disturbances is a challenging step toward their conservation and to mitigate desertification. We studied the germination responses of 43 dominant native species of the Sahara desert that could be propagated from seeds for future ecological restoration projects, exploring the effects of cold stratification and temperatures on seed germination. Seeds were stratified at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then tested for germination at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C. While cold stratification negatively affected four species, it improved the germination of 36 species. Five of these species required cold stratification to germinate. Temperatures during the germination trial significantly influenced seed germinability. Twenty-three species (54%) germinated to higher percentages at intermediate temperatures (20 to 30 degrees C) similar to the maximum temperatures of the rainiest months, when germination in the field is high. Thirteen species (30%) also germinated at a higher temperature (40 degrees C). Seven species (16%) germinated best at low temperatures (5 to 10 degrees C). Our results suggest that cold stratification is an efficient and easy treatment to apply prior to sowing seeds in the field for restoration.

AB  - Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) currently number similar to 3000 on Nantucket Island. No deer were seen on the island at the beginning of the 20th century. The historical record suggests that a single male deer was brought to the island in 1922, and that 2 female deer were brought to the island from Michigan in 1926. After the deer population had increased to several hundred, additional deer (2 male and 3 female) were brought to Nantucket from New Hampshire in 1935 and 1936. To investigate the presence of founder effect in the population on Nantucket, we obtained samples of White-tailed Deer feces or muscle tissue from Nantucket; the New England mainland (including Cape Cod, southeastern Massachusetts, and a few samples from Maine, Connecticut, and Rhode Island), Shelter Island, NY; and Ann Arbor, MI. We amplified a portion of the mitochondrial control region (D-loop), and found 3 different sequences (haplotypes) among 35 deer samples from Nantucket. Two common haplotypes were identical or nearly identical to haplotypes from Michigan. One rare haplotype was also found in deer from the mainland in Connecticut and Massachusetts. This latter haplotype was unusual in that it contained 3 tandem copies of a 75 base-pair repeat, while most White-tailed Deer have 2 copies. In contrast, we found 5 haplotypes among 26 deer from the New England mainland. Haplotype diversity on Nantucket was 0.447 (+/- 0.082), and nucleotide diversity (pi) was 0.021 (+/- 0.005). Haplotype diversity on the mainland was 0.839 (+/- 0.029), and pi was 0.046 (+/- 0.002). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated little genetic differentiation among populations on the New England mainland (phi(ST) = 0.095, P = 0.113). However, when the population on Nantucket was included in the analysis, there was much more genetic variation among populations (phi(ST) = 0.414, P = 0.000). Our results indicate that most deer on Nantucket originated from 2 founding females from Michigan, and a small percentage are descended from later introductions from the New England mainland.

To understand the effect of meteorological changes on the waterbird functional diversity and provide suggestions for management and conservation, we selected a study area (726 km(2)) in Liaohe Estuary, located in northeast China. We explored the trends of the waterbird functional diversity changes in response to meteorological factors using fourth corner analysis. Our study demonstrated that temperature was a key factor that impacted waterbird functional diversity in spring, while precipitation had a greater impact in autumn. The population size of goose and duck was positively associated with temperature and negatively with precipitation, while that of the waders (Charadriiformes) showed opposite association trends. Herbivores and species nesting on the bare ground exhibited responses to meteorological factors similar to those of geese and ducks, while benthivores and waterbirds nesting under grass/shrubs exhibited trends similar to those of waterbirds. Waterbirds with smaller bodies, shorter feathers, and lower reproductive rates preferred higher temperatures and less precipitation than other waterbirds. In addition, we observed seasonal variations in waterbird functional diversity. In spring, we should pay attention to waders, herbivores, and waterbirds nesting on the bare ground when the temperature is low. In autumn, waders, benthivores, and omnivores need more attention under extreme precipitation. As the global climate warms in this study area, waterbird functional diversity is expected to decline, and community composition would become simpler, with overlapping niches. Biodiversity management should involve protecting intertidal habitats, supporting benthic macrofaunal communities, preparing bare breeding fields for waterbirds favoring high temperatures to meet their requirements for population increase, and preventing the population decline of geese and ducks, herbivores, and species nesting under grass/shrubs. The findings of our study can aid in developing accurate guidelines for waterbird biodiversity management and conservation.

AB  - Recent theoretical work has provided major new insights into the ways that species interactions in food webs are organized in ways that permit the coexistence of significant numbers of species. But, we seem to have forgotten about trees! Not the phylogenetic ones that are increasingly important for dissecting the evolutionary structure of food webs, but the trees, shrubs and grasses that are the basal species in all terrestrial ecosystems. Many of the food webs available for analysis over the last 30 years were based on freshwater or marine systems where algae were the main plants. Trees are very different from algae; they can live for centuries, while annually producing leaves, fruits and seeds that provide nutrients for a diversity of species on higher trophic levels. In sharp contrast to algae, they are only partly consumed by herbivores and usually compensate or recover from herbivory. Most of the biomass in terrestrial systems is in the plants, this again contrasts with aquatic systems, where most of the biomass is in primary and secondary consumers. Moreover, each individual tree supports its own food web of species that are only partially coupled to those of surrounding trees. If we are going to apply our theoretical understanding of food-web structure to species-rich terrestrial ecosystems in ways that are insightful for conservation, then we need a deeper examination of the role that higher plants play in food webs. While community ecology has developed an increasingly detailed understanding of the ways plant communities are organized, this seems to have evolved almost independently of the food-web literature. In this article, we make a plea to more sharply consider higher plants in food webs and to do this by combining recent theoretical work on food webs, with recent empirical and theoretical work on plant communities. Ultimately, we argue for a deeper integration of plant community ecology into studies of food webs.

AB  - Using transect surveys, we examined the effects of African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) herbivory on cabbage trees (Cussonia spicata) within South Africa's Subtropical Thicket Biome over 15 years (2008-2023). There was an 80% reduction in tree density, from 14.3 to 1.4 trees per 0.1 km2, and a significant decrease in average height. Notably, as cabbage tree numbers declined, elephant browsing intensity also decreased. Trees in steeper areas survived better, suggesting these act as natural refuges. Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted conservation strategies and long-term ecosystem monitoring to preserve these keystone species in enclosed reserves.

AB  - Demersal fishing operations exert, cumulatively, at least three forms of pressures over the benthic environment: mortality of megafauna (landed and discarded), discards of carrion back to the marine environment (also referred to as Predictable Anthropogenic Food Subsidies - PAFS) and disturbance of the seabed, by contact with bottom gear. This study presents a spatial synthesis of these forms of pressure on the Brazilian Meridional Margin (BMM, SW Atlantic) and their accumulated effect, in contribution to the development of effective space-based fishing management strategies. We analyzed landed catch, discards and effort of 2,125 fishing trips of industrial vessels operating double-rig trawlers, pair trawlers, stern trawlers, bottom longline and gillnets, monitored during 2018 in the main fishing harbors of Southern and Southeastern Brazil. All forms of pressure and the Accumulated Pressure Index (API) were represented spatially in a 20 x 20 nautical mile quads mesh grid. We demonstrated that nearly half of the BMM area was under high pressure. We also delimited fishing pressure hotspots in coastal and shelf areas mostly within the 'Brazilian Bight' region, between Sa similar to o Paulo and Santa Catarina states (24-29(degrees)S). Conversely, slope regions were found to be less demanded by demersal fishing, with both benthic ecosystems and demersal populations being barely disturbed. These were regarded as the main refuge areas for benthic and benthopelagic megafauna. Double-rig trawling was a major driver of pressure accumulating over half of total number of demersal fishing trips in 2018. Individual double-rig trawling operations also disturbed a seabed area far greater than the areas disturbed by the other fishing gear, and discarded the largest fraction (similar to 48%) of the produced mortality. Reducing the demersal fishing pressure on the BMM seems to be primarily concerned with abating the intensity of double-rig trawling, and/or diluting their effect through spatial management measures.

AB  - Large ungulates across the world are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, land use change, and other anthropogenic pressures. While conservation measures are critical, for many populations the implementation of conservation measures is often not practical, either due to a lack of information on the species' biology or their conservation status. Here we consider 2 large ungulates, the roan (Hippotragus equinus) and sable (H. niger) antelopes, occurring in Mudumu National Park (MNP) Namibia, for which data on populations trends and habitat use are largely unknown. Here, we used camera trapping data collected in the dry and wet seasons between March and September 2021 in visit frequency models to understand the relationship between habitat variables and the distribution dynamics of roan and sable over time at MNP. Our results showed that roans in the wet season were detected more at sites with increased grass cover and detected less at sites near the Kwando River. In the dry season, roans were detected more at sites with increased grass cover and more termite mounds but detected less at sites near the Kwando River. In the wet season, sables were detected more at sites with fewer termite mounds. In the dry season, sables were detected more at sites with increased grass cover. We hypothesized that roan and sable use fewer areas near permanent water to avoid high predator densities and high grazing intensity by dense herds of short-grass grazers. The study findings are useful knowledge on 2 threatened ungulates and will be used to inform and develop comprehensive conservation programs and strategies that aim to lower the risk of extinction for roan and sable at a Namibian protected area.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most pervasive invasive species in North America. Wild pigs pose a threat to crops, livestock, and the environment, but also provide recreational hunting opportunities. There are avenues for some stakeholder groups to generate income from wild pigs, however, stakeholders vary in attitudes towards wild pigs and their management. We investigated whether financial loss and income resulting from wild pigs influenced hunter stakeholder attitudes towards their management in Texas. We examined how land use influenced hunting landowner attitudes towards wild pigs. We analyzed 22,176 responses (8,707 landowners, 13,469 nonlandowners) from Texas hunters to the Texas A&M Human Dimensions of Wild Pigs Survey. Attitudes towards wild pigs varied significantly based on landownership status and whether land was used for agricultural practices. In addition, landowners who received income from wild pigs on their land considered government or agency hunting to be a less acceptable method of control than those who did not generate such income. However, effect sizes for all our results were small (?(2) = 0.05, Adj. R-2 =0.09, and McFadden's R-2 =0.07) and, across all groups, attitudes towards wild pigs were negative. Few respondents (3.91% of landowners, 0.56% of non-landowners) reported generating income from wild pigs, and reported losses were approximately 4 times greater than income.

AB  - Breeding captive forest musk deer is an important way to obtain musk resources, but it also causes changes in the ecological environment of the breeding site. This study compared the changes in soil bacterial communities inside and outside the captive breeding site and tried to find out its influencing factors. High-throughput sequencing analysis and other methods were used to analyze the changes in the bacterial community structure in the natural soil and forest surrounding the musk deer site after 4 years of captivity. The results showed that the main dominant phyla in the captive soil samples were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi. In order, Sphingomonadales (8.7%), Acidobacteriales (9.9%) and Solibacterales (6.1%) were dominant in the captive soil, while Rhizobiales (11.3%) and Gaiellales (6.2%) were found in non-captive soil. The main soil-specific microorganisms under captive conditions were Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales and Sphingomadales. These microorganisms mainly gather at the order level and can be used as indicator microorganisms. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the microbial diversity in captivity soil was significantly affected by the contents of organic matter, available phosphorus and total nitrogen. These results will provide a basis for the healthy breeding of animals and shed light on the protection of the ecological environment in the Bashan Mountains of Qinling.

AB  - Pleistocene glacial cycles influenced the diversification of high-latitude wildlife species through recurrent periods of range contraction, isolation, divergence, and expansion from refugia and subsequent admixture of refugial populations. We investigate population size changes and the introgressive history of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in western Canada using 33 whole genome sequences coupled with larger-scale mitochondrial data. We found that a major population expansion of caribou occurred starting around 110,000 years ago (kya), the start of the last glacial period. Additionally, we found effective population sizes of some caribou reaching similar to 700,000 to 1,000,000 individuals, one of the highest recorded historical effective population sizes for any mammal species thus far. Mitochondrial analyses dated introgression events prior to the LGM dating to 20-30 kya and even more ancient at 60 kya, coinciding with colder periods with extensive ice coverage, further demonstrating the importance of glacial cycles and events prior to the LGM in shaping demographic history. Reconstructing the origins and differential introgressive history has implications for predictions on species responses under climate change. Our results have implications for other whole genome analyses using pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) analyses, as well as highlighting the need to investigate pre-LGM demographic patterns to fully reconstruct the origin of species diversity, especially for high-latitude species.

AB  - Background and aim Litter decomposition, a key process regulating subtropical forest ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling, is highly susceptible to increasing atmospheric N deposition and is facilitated and regulated by micro-food webs. However, responses of micro-food webs in leaf litter habitats to N deposition remain unclear, especially at humus-near stage of decomposition. Methods In this study, the leaf litter decomposition was subjected to experimental N addition, and the biota communities (microbes and nematodes) in leaf litter habitats and the subsequent micro-food webs were evaluated in a subtropical plantation. Results After a 6-year N addition, the leaf litter microbial community composition showed little change, but the leaf litter microbial G(+)/G(-) showed significant increases. N addition increased the relative abundance of leaf litter herbivores with less resistance and decreased the OP/H. The leaf litter communities in response to N addition were driven by changes in leaf litter pH, Mn, N/Mn and P/Mn ratios. N addition decreased the leaf litter beta G and AP activities, and the EI and SI relative to control plots (no N addition). These shifts were primarily controlled by the leaf litter pH, C, N, Mn, N/Mn and P/Mn ratios. Conclusion These findings illustrate that, in leaf litter habitats, the nematode community responses to N addition are more sensitive than the microbial community, and the micro-food webs become less enriched and less structured in response to N addition at humus-near stage of decomposition. These findings can help to better predict terrestrial biogeochemical cycling under future global change scenarios.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, goats, and buffalo. It is recognized as one of the most destructive animal diseases, primarily attributed to its significant financial impact. We used a machine learning model to predict FMD occurrence at the county level in Iran from 2008 to 2018 using historical data on cases of FMD, so the monthly occurrence of FMD per county was predicted using spatial and temporal lags using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The cost-sensitive balancing and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline SMOTE) methods were also used to handle the imbalanced classification. The results revealed that after applying the cost-sensitive balancing method, the model's performance, as measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, was 81%. However, when we implemented the Borderline SMOTE Oversampling technique, the method performance increased from 81 to 88%. We also found that our proposed model's performance is better than when we use climate-related features to predict disease occurrence. The methodologies and findings of this study provide valuable insights for decision-makers to make informed decisions, mitigating county-level FMD occurrences and preventing economic losses.

AB  - Aerial surveys are commonly used to collect data for estimating abundance of a variety of large animals. In the context of aerial surveys, common abundance estimators, including distance sampling, closed population mark-resight models, and sightability models, all require visually scanning a large area, usually along transects. For sparse populations, such extensive surveys may be inefficient and costly. We evaluated abundance estimators proposed by Rivest et al. (1998) and Clement et al. (2015) in which animals are located using telemetry instead of extensive visual searches, thereby reducing flight time. We conducted aerial surveys of Sonoran pronghorn in southwest Arizona in 2017 and evaluated the bias and precision of abundance estimates returned by both estimators. We also compared the costs of telemetry surveys to sightability surveys, a more common method. Both telemetry-based methods generated unbiased abundance estimates for a population of known size. However, in a population of unknown size, there was evidence of a non-random distribution of telemetry collars and downward bias in abundance estimates. The telemetry-based methods dramatically increased the sighting rate of Sonoran pronghorn during flights and reduced total flight time by >90%, a substantial time and cost savings. However, telemetry-based approaches incur an additional cost of maintaining telemetry collars on animals in the population. For Sonoran pronghorn and other species, telemetry-based abundance estimators may offer significant cost savings over estimators requiring extensive visual searches, if there are not meaningful deviations from model assumptions. Telemetry-based methods will be most useful if the cost of collaring animals is low, if animals are sparse or hard to detect, if the study has a short duration, and if the study species has a loose social structure and tends to form large groups.

AB  - Ongoing declines in the imperiled New England cottontail Sylvilagus transitionalis have coincided with the introduction and expansion of the closely related eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus. These paired population trends have led to the inference of competition between the two species. Competition between native and introduced species has often involved overlapping use of food resources, but limited effort has been spent to analyze the diets of New England cottontail and eastern cottontail and to evaluate the potential for resource competition. We used microhistologic analysis of fecal pellets to assess the winter diets of both species and we compared diet composition with available plant communities to evaluate their preferences for dietary items across southern New England and southeastern New York. We found no differences in diets between New England cottontail and eastern cottontail, although diets did differ between regions within the study area. Diet preferences also were consistent between the species and largely excluded nonnative plant genera. Our results demonstrate that these species are generalist herbivores and that there is high potential for competition for food resources in the winter between them, although the present lack of diet partitioning may indicate the presence of other factors limiting competition. This study highlights the need for careful evaluation of interactions between native and nonnative species, a prerequisite for developing conservation plans that appropriately account for interspecific competition.

AB  - The bioavailability of soil phosphorus (P) fractions is essential for sustaining primary productivity in grassland ecosystems, and it is influenced by grazing intensity and topographical features. However, the specific effects grazing intensity on soil P fractions across varying topographies remain largely unexplored. Here, we utilized 14-year grazing manipulation experiment in a semi-arid grassland, which included two topographical settings (flat vs. slope) and seven levels of grazing intensity (0 to 9.0 sheep ha(-1)), to investigate how these factors impact the storage and transformation of soil P fractions. Soil P fractions were categorized into labile P (Ca-2-P), moderately labile P (Ca-8-P, Al-P, Fe-P), and stable P (O-P, Ca-10-P). Our results demonstrate that high grazing intensities lead to the accumulation of labile and moderately labile P fractions on flat areas due to runoff deposition from adjacent slopes, while these fractions are depleted on slopes themselves. Grazing exerts a direct influence on topsoil by reducing vegetation and litter cover, which accelerate the conversion of labile P fractions into more stable forms due to increased exposure and diminished protection. The mechanisms by which grazing impacts the distribution and dynamics of soil P fractions differ according topographical features. In flat areas, biochemical processes driven by soil organic carbon and microbial communities are predominant, resulting initial decrease and followed by an increase in the proportion of less stable P with rising grazing intensity. Conversely, on slopes, environmental factors, particularly soil pH, play a more dominant role, leading to initial increase followed by a decrease in the proportion of less stable P as grazing intensity escalates. These findings highlight the complex interplay between grazing intensity and topography in shaping soil P dynamics. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective grazing management strategies and promoting sustainable grassland productivity in semi-arid environments.

AB  - BackgroundSeasonal migration is a behavioral strategy that animals evolved to exploit seasonally changing resources. Ungulates in northern temperate landscapes often seasonally migrate between low-elevation winter ranges and higher-elevation summer ranges, allowing individuals to exploit a diversity of forage resources during summer while avoiding extreme conditions during winter. In autumn, the timing of this behavior often overlaps with hunting seasons for managed ungulate populations. Migration presents challenges for managing ungulates when the timing of autumn migrations varies across years and migrations cross management jurisdictions.MethodsWe evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of autumn migration using GPS collar data collected during 2017-2019 from 68 female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) that migrated seasonally within three study areas in northwest Montana. We related the timing of autumn migration to environmental variables including precipitation, snow depth and density, temperature, plant phenology, migration distance, and estimates of relative hunting intensity. We summarized variables across multiple temporal scales (2-day, and 1 week) to identify possible lagged or cumulative effects of conditions on mule deer behavior. We incorporated these variables into a time-to-event modeling framework to estimate their relative impacts on the timing of initiation of autumn migration.ResultsThe collective annual space use of deer in each study area spanned up to 9 hunting districts, and individual deer used an average of 2.1, 2.8, and 2.0 hunting districts per year (range 1-4) in the Cabinet-Fisher, Rocky Mountain Front, and Whitefish study areas, respectively. Furthermore, the return of deer to winter ranges occurred over a 3-month timeframe spanning archery, rifle, and closed hunting periods. While some deer returned to winter range relatively early during archery season in September, others remained in summer range into December, after the general rifle season concluded. Declines in daily minimum temperatures and increased weekly precipitation provided the strongest cues for mule deer to begin their autumn migration. Mule deer with longer migration distances were more likely to initiate their migration sooner, and declining forage conditions also showed a modest effect on timing. Mule deer migrations occurred during times of lower hunting activity prior to its peak during rifle season.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates changing weather conditions were the primary driver of the initiation of autumn migration for mule deer. Given most migrations spanned more than one hunting district, the boundaries of management units were mismatched with the scale of ecological processes, implying that management actions in certain districts may have unintended consequences for populations in nearby districts.

AB  - Rangelands worldwide have been subject to broadscale modification, such as widespread predator control, introduction of permanent livestock water and altered vegetation to improve grazing. In Australia, these landscape changes have resulted in kangaroos (i.e. large macropods) populations increasing over the past 200 years. Kangaroos are a key contributor to total grazing pressure and in conjunction with livestock and feral herbivores have been linked to land degradation. We used 22 years of aerial survey data to investigate whether the density of 3 macropod species in the southern rangelands of Western Australia was associated with: (i) land use, including type of livestock, total livestock, density of feral goats, type of land tenure, and kangaroo commercial harvest effort; (ii) predator management, including permitted dingo control effort, estimated dingo abundance, and presence of the State Barrier Fence (a dingo exclusion fence); and (iii) environmental variables: ruggedness, rainfall, fractional cover, and total standing dry matter. Red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus) were most abundant in flat, open vegetation, on pastoral land, where area permitted for dingo control was high, and numbers were positively associated with antecedent rainfall with a 12-month delay. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) were most abundant on flat, agricultural land, but less abundant in areas with high permitted dingo control. Euros (Osphranter robustus) were most abundant in rugged pastoral land with open vegetation, where permitted dingo control was high. While environmental variables are key drivers of landscape productivity and kangaroo populations, anthropogenic factors such as land use and permitted dingo control are strongly associated with kangaroo abundance.

However, bureaucracy has hindered effective research and application of horse management on public lands and examples on private lands may present new solutions. Here we present the history and current population management strategy for the Wild Horse Ranch (WHR) located in southeastern Wyoming, USA, as an example of an ongoing private entity managing horses. Prior to 1985, this similar to 6,000-ha ranch was used historically for domestic sheep (Ovis aries) production, and after 1985, for yearling cattle (Bos taurus). In 2005, geldings (i.e., castrated males) and mares were purchased from BLM by WHR and introduced to the ranch in conjunction with the development of home sites. In 2019, landowners formed the Wild Horse Preservation Society (WHPS) to enhance horse management and care. The WHPS uses multiple approaches to manage population growth including castrating stallions and treating mares with chemical contraception through partnerships with veterinarians and other stakeholders. In addition, WHPS feeds supplemental hay to horses in severe winter months, provides water during the summer, monitors rangeland vegetation, horse diets, and cares for abandoned foals or geriatric horses. The WHPS is a network of board members and landowners that is working for the betterment of horse welfare and rangeland health and is situated to be a leading entity and example in the area of freeenterprise free-roaming horse reproduction management.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are reliable cues that parasitoids can use to locate host patches. Interactions mediated by plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are vulnerable to disturbance by predicted climate change and air pollution scenarios. Abiotic stress-induced VOCs may act as false signals to parasitoids. Air pollutants can disrupt signalling by degrading HIPVs at different rates and preventing the perception of olfactory signals by reducing the sensitivity of olfactory receptors or by occluding insect sensillae. As essential components of biological control programmes, efforts should be made to assess how different parasitoid species respond and adapt to HIPVs in predicted scenarios. Since providing parasitoid food sources is a promising practice for boosting biological control, parasitoid-flower interactions deserve attention.

AB  - Although guanacos (Lama guanicoe) are widely distributed throughout much of their historic range, they are often restricted to small, isolated populations that are at risk of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. Here we document and interpret baseline patterns of genetic variation in a guanaco population inhabiting in the Bolivian Chaco that is threatened by hunting and habitat degradation. The region, once open grasslands, is dominated by dense shrubs, the result of livestock grazing. The most-recent census identified only 74 individuals and is designated as at 'risk of extinction' by the Bolivian government. We assessed the population's genetic health and uniqueness from the genetic patterns of 16 microsatellite loci, the Hyper-variable Domain I of the mitochondrial Control Region and SRY gene with 29 fecal samples. We identified 19 male and 10 female unique individuals. Microsatellite variation (Ho = 0.64) was similar to larger, less-isolated populations. However, the estimated effective population size was low and consistent with the continuing loss of allelic variation. The two observed mtDNA haplotypes are common in other L. g. guanicoe populations. Although we documented moderate genetic diversity, gene flow among Bolivian and Paraguayan guanaco Chaco populations should be assessed and integrated into explicit conservation management plans.

AB  - Acari community structure and function associated with delayed pig carrion decomposition has not been examined. In this study, 18 swine carcasses were studied in central Texas, USA, during two consecutive summers (2013 and 2014). Samples of ca. 400 g soil were collected from beneath, aside, and 5 m away from each pig carcass over 180 days. Mites from soil samples were extracted using Berlese funnels and identified to order and family levels and classified according to ecological function. In total 1565 and 1740 mites were identified from the 2013 and 2014 soil samples, respectively. Significant differences were determined for mite community structure at order and family levels temporally on carrion (e.g., day 0 x day 14) regardless of treatments and between soil regions where mites were collected (e.g., soil beneath vs. soil 5 m away from carrion). However, no significant differences were found in mite community structure at the order level between pig carrion with and without delayed Diptera colonization (i.e., treatments). Analysis at the family level determined a significant difference across treatments for both summers. Ecological function of mites did not change significantly following the delayed decomposition of pig carcasses. However, detritivores and fungivores were significant indicator groups during the pig carrion decomposition process. Furthermore, 13 phoretic mite species associated with eight forensically important beetle species were documented. Data from this study indicated that the rate of nutrient flow into the soil impacted associated arthropod communities; however, detecting such shifts depends on the taxonomic resolution being applied.

AB  - This review paper explores the contribution of the stable isotope analysis of mammalian bones and teeth to the study of palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment, and palaeoecology. These skeletal remains, composed of both organic and inorganic materials, preserve isotopic signals that reflect an organism's dietary habits and other behaviours, as well as environmental, and climatic conditions during an animal's lifetime. Here, we discuss how carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, hydrogen, strontium, and zinc isotopes in bones and teeth have been used to reconstruct past changes in temperature, precipitation, aridity, permafrost, vegetation, seasonality, and animal diet and mobility. We identify areas where understanding is limited and suggest avenues for future research. Additionally, we highlight how information from different isotopes and tissues can be integrated with archaeological findings to assess the impact of environmental shifts on animal behaviour and ecosystems, offering a deeper understanding of human-animal interactions throughout (pre)history. Ultimately, stable isotopes in bones and teeth serve as more than just palaeo-proxies; they offer insights into human and non-anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems, and help establish baselines for contemporary conservation, ecosystem restoration and rewilding policies and practices.

AB  - The frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heat waves are increasing globally, revealing ecological responses that provide valuable insights toward the conservation of species in a changing climate. In this study, we utilized data from two populations of GPS-collared female wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) in the boreal forest of northwestern Canada to investigate their movement behaviors in response to the 2021 Western North American Heat Wave. Using generalized additive mixed-effect models and a model selection framework, we identified a behavioral temperature threshold for wood bison at 21 degrees C. Above this threshold, movement rates decreased from similar to 100 m/h at 21 degrees C to a low of similar to 25 m/h at 39 degrees C (150% decrease; -9%/degrees C). Extreme heat also contributed to changes in diurnal movement patterns, reducing wood bison movement rates and shifting the timing of peak activity from midday to early morning. These findings highlight the behavioral adaptations of female wood bison and underscore the need to understand the behavioral and physiological responses of cold-adapted mammals to extreme weather events. Subsequent effects of thermoregulatory behavior may impact individual fitness and population viability, particularly at high latitudes where cold-adapted species are increasingly exposed to severe weather resulting from anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Mob-grazing involves maintaining high densities of livestock for short periods so that most plants are either eaten or trampled, followed by long rest periods. This practice has been proposed as a mechanism to increase soil carbon (C) storage and range quality. However, mob-grazing has not universally achieved these objectives, possibly because many factors influence the effects of grazing on soil C dynamics and vegetation. This study examines factors that may mediate grazing impacts on soil C by comparing plant cover and the seasonal dynamics of roots, soil variables, and mycorrhizal fungal hyphae in experimental plots treated with traditional grazing, annual mob-grazing or no grazing for 18 yr. Root and soil variables were measured directly underneath a C-4 grass, a C-3 grass, and a forb up to 5 xduring a 13-mo period. Mob-grazing did not influence total soil C, but it significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), fine particulate organic matter, and nitrogen-15 (delta N-15). Furthermore, mob-grazing increased soil compaction, decreased soil aggregate stability, decreased soil moisture, and tended to increase the abundance of two invasive plant species: Salsola tragus and Bromus tectorum. Soil compaction, soil aggregate stability, root biomass, particulate organic matter, and percent soil C and N varied significantly across seasons and among plant species. The density of mycorrhizal fungal hyphae varied with season but not with grazing treatment. A significant grazing by date interaction in root biomass and soil carbon-13 (delta C-13) suggests that root dieback and inputs of pulverized plant material with a higher delta C-13 signature could be the source of higher SOM in mob-grazed plots. Compared with ungrazed plots, traditionally grazed plots had higher SOM without the adverse impacts on vegetation and soil properties observed in the mob-grazed plots. No single management strategy is universally beneficial. Range managers should carefully weigh the pros and cons of mob-grazing because, although it can increase SOM in surface soils, it may also negatively impact soil structure and composition of vegetation.

AB  - Climate-mediated species redistributions are causing novel interactions and leading to profound regime shifts globally. For species that expand their distribution in response to warming, survival depends not only on their physiological capacity, but also on the ability to coexist or be competitive within the established community. In temperate marine reefs from around the world, the range expansion of tropical species, known as 'tropicalization', has been linked to the disappearance of temperate habitat-forming kelps and shifts to dominance by low-biomass turfing algae. The consequences of these range expansions and habitat changes on resident fish communities are, however, unclear. Here, we use data derived from baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to analyse changes in diversity and abundance of marine fishes over a 17-year period in warming reefs that have experienced kelp loss (occurring c. 2009). Despite the loss of kelp, we found that species richness and overall abundance of fishes (measured as probability of occurrence and relative abundance), including both tropical and temperate species, increased through time. We also found dramatic shifts in the trophic composition of fish assemblages. Tropical herbivorous fish increased most markedly through time, and temperate-associated planktivores were the only group that declined, a potential consequence of tropicalization not previously identified. At the species level, we identified 22 tropical and temperate species from four trophic guilds that significantly increased in occurrence, while only three species (all temperate associated) declined. Morphological trait space models suggest increases in fish diversity and overall occurrence are unlikely to be driven by uniqueness of traits among tropical range expanders. Our results show more winners than losers and suggest that pathways of energy flow will change in tropicalized systems, as planktonic inputs become less important and a higher proportion of algal productivity gets consumed locally by increasingly abundant herbivores.

AB  - The Rio Grande Rise (RGR) is a large and geomorphologically complex feature located in the Southwest Atlantic, with great commercial and scientific interest due to its potential for mining rare earth elements that are critical for low-carbon technologies. Brazilian interest in this area led to the submission of a petition to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in 2018 to include RGR on the limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. However, mining activities are potentially harmful to deep-sea ecosystems and will likely cause some extent of biodiversity loss. Thus, baseline and continuous environmental studies in the RGR are important to address potential conflicts between mineral extraction and the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity. The RGR is characterized by a series of summit plateaus of ~600 m deep divided NE-SW by a rift valley, up to 2000 m deep. In 2018, the plateaus and rift of a small area in RGR (30 degrees 35 ' S - 31 degrees 03 ' S, 35 degrees 36 ' W - 36 degrees 16 ' W) were explored through 13 dives of the robotic underwater vehicle (RUV) HyBIS. Videos were analyzed for the description of structuring factors (topography and habitat types) and to record benthic megafauna occurrences. Video transects revealed highly heterogeneous and rapidly changing habitats. Eleven habitats, five in the rift and six in the plateaus are proposed based on geomorphology, slope, and substrate textures. We recorded 17,008 megabenthic organisms classified in 83 morphotypes and six different phyla, from which Porifera (42.7%) and Cnidaria (41.5%) were the most representative. Samples were characterized by a high dominance and the dissimilarities result chiefly from differences in abundance scores. PERMANOVA tests indicated that Habitat and Region variables were the most important to explain structure within the community data, followed by depth and slope. The rift floor exhibited a low abundance of megabenthic epifauna, except in a sinkhole in the northern part of the rift. The lower and upper rift wall were characterized by different communities delimited by the transition between the Antarctic Intermediate Water and the Upper Circumpolar Deep Water. The habitats formed by Fe-Mn deposits were dominated by distinct communities, which were rarely observed elsewhere. Additionally, we found variations in community structure at regional scales (20-30 km), with distinct communities on each side of the rift and at the southwest of the study area. Our results contribute toward understanding the diversity, biogeography, and environmental drivers of the RGR. Fauna distribution is patchy, linked to habitats with potential mining resources, and dominated by Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) indicator taxa. Extensive community analysis should occur at a given site prior to consideration for the exploitation of natural resources.

AB  - In temperate regions, larger mammalian carrion naturally occurs in terrestrial landscapes as a pulsed resource towards the end of the winter through enhanced ungulate mortality due to starvation or exhaustion. The return of large carnivores in Central Europe provides carrion more equally throughout the year and the active enhancement of carrion for biodiversity by game managers has increased, raising the question of how different scavengers respond to the temporal variation in carrion supply. To address this question, we experimentally deployed 106 cervid carcasses throughout the year in a temperate forest of south-eastern Germany on two types of plots: permanent (i.e., site with multiple subsequent deployments) or random (i.e., site with unique deployment), and reported vertebrate scavenger visitations by camera trapping. Deployment on random or permanent sites did not affect carrion use by any single species. Generalized additive modelling revealed that vertebrate scavenging peaked in the winter season and summer independent of carrion supply. Still, different scavenger species showed different temporal patterns. While wild boar as ungulate omnivores did not display any seasonal patterns, avian scavengers showed significant variation in visitation rates. The mesopredator red fox consumed carrion significantly more often from late winter to summer, while pine marten was present at carrion only during winter. Finally, the specialist large carnivore Eurasian lynx, visited carrion sites most frequently in late winter and early spring. Our results suggest that global warming might impact some groups of vertebrate scavengers more strongly than others by reducing carrion availability in late winter, while returning carnivores could mitigate these impacts.

AB  - Ilulissat Icefjord in Greenland is experiencing the effects of climate change, with the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier being one of the fastest-moving and most productive ice streams in Greenland. This is likely affecting the distribution of species in the fjord, including those important to local fisheries. Due to heavy ice conditions, few studies on environmental and ecological conditions exist from the fjord. However, new techniques such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding now allow deeper insight into the fjord system. Here, we combine local ecological knowledge with data on hydrographic conditions, stable isotopes (delta 18O), and eDNA metabarcoding to investigate the spatial and seasonal distribution of marine fish and mammals inside Ilulissat Icefjord. Our eDNA results support local observations that Arctic char migrate to the southern fjord during summer, harp seals forage in large herds in the fjord system, polar cod is the dominant prey fish in the area, and Greenland shark likely does not reside in the fjord system. Lower predation pressure in the Icefjord, due to the absence of Greenland shark and polar bears as well as limited fishing/hunting, is presumably one of the reasons why ringed seals and Greenland halibut are larger in the Icefjord. Furthermore, our results indicate that in summer, the southern branch of the fjord system has a more diverse community of vertebrates and different water masses than the northern branch and main fjord, indicating a time lag between inflows to the different branches of the fjord system. Our approach highlights the value of combining local ecological knowledge with scientific research and represents a potential starting point for monitoring biological responses in Ilulissat Icefjord associated with climate-induced changes.

AB  - Deforestation of tropical forests have resulted in extensive areas of secondary forests with the potential to restore biodiversity to former old-growth forest levels. The recovery of vertebrate communities is an essential component of biodiversity and ecosystem restoration, as vertebrates provide key ecosystem functions. However, little is known about the recovery trajectories and habitat preferences of vertebrates in tropical landscapes with differing land-use legacies. We used camera traps covering 3 weeks to study the activity of ground-based mammals and birds in the understory of 57 sites along a forest recovery gradient, ranging from active agriculture, such as pastures and cacao plantations, to naturally recovering forests and old-growth forests in the Choc & oacute; rainforest in north-western Ecuador. Our results show that diversity and biomass of wild vertebrates are highest in old-growth forests and late recovery stages, while for domestic vertebrates, these indices are highest in agricultural land. Additionally, while species-habitat networks showed low habitat specificity for vertebrate species, an indicator species analysis found no species to indicate old-growth forests, Dasyprocta punctata and Tayassu pecari to indicate all forest types, and Aramides wolfi and Pecari tajacu to indicate late regeneration forests. We suggest that these patterns are caused by a high habitat connectivity and large amounts of remaining old-growth forest in our study area. Our findings indicate that secondary forests have a high potential for the recovery of vertebrate species diversity and biomass to old-growth level in lowland tropical forests with short regeneration times.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
   La deforestaci & oacute;n de los bosques tropicales ha creado extensas & aacute;reas de bosques secundarios con el potencial de restaurar su biodiversidad a niveles similares a los de los bosques maduros. La recuperaci & oacute;n de las comunidades de vertebrados es un componente esencial de la restauraci & oacute;n de la biodiversidad y los ecosistemas, ya que los vertebrados desempe & ntilde;an funciones clave para los ecosistemas. Sin embargo, poco se sabe sobre las trayectorias de recuperaci & oacute;n y las preferencias de h & aacute;bitat de los vertebrados en paisajes tropicales con diferentes legados de uso del suelo. Usamos c & aacute;maras trampa durante tres semanas para estudiar la actividad de mam & iacute;feros y aves terrestres en el sotobosque de 57 sitios a lo largo de un gradiente de recuperaci & oacute;n forestal, que va desde la agricultura activa, como pastizales y plantaciones de cacao, hasta bosques en recuperaci & oacute;n natural y bosques maduros en la selva tropical del Choc & oacute;, en el noroeste de Ecuador. Nuestros resultados muestran que la diversidad y la biomasa de los vertebrados silvestres son m & aacute;s altas en los bosques maduros y en las & uacute;ltimas etapas de recuperaci & oacute;n, mientras que, para los vertebrados dom & eacute;sticos, estos & iacute;ndices son m & aacute;s altos en las tierras agr & iacute;colas. Adem & aacute;s, mientras que las redes especie-h & aacute;bitat mostraron una baja especificidad de h & aacute;bitat de las especies de vertebrados, un an & aacute;lisis de especies indicadoras no encontr & oacute; ninguna especie indicadora de bosque maduro, Dasyprocta punctata y Tayassu pecari fueron indicadores de todos los tipos de bosque, y Aramides wolfi y Pecari tajacu fueron indicadores de bosque de regeneraci & oacute;n tard & iacute;a. Sugerimos que estos patrones est & aacute;n causados por una alta conectividad del h & aacute;bitat y la gran cantidad de bosque maduro remanente en nuestra & aacute;rea de estudio. Nuestros hallazgos indican que los bosques secundarios tienen un alto potencial para la recuperaci & oacute;n de la diversidad de especies de vertebrados y la biomasa a nivel de bosque maduro en bosques tropicales de tierras bajas con tiempos de regeneraci & oacute;n cortos.

AB  - Amphistomosis is a poorly understood trematode disease of domestic and wild ruminants whose effect has been underestimated. To date, there is limited information on the taxonomic status of amphistome species, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa which is home to diverse species infecting domestic and wild ruminants. In view of this, a survey was conducted in wildlife conservancies and national parks located in Beitbridge, Nyamandlovu, and Hwange in the Matebeleland region of Zimbabwe during the 2019-2021 game hunting seasons. Gastrointestinal tract of 329 carcasses of wild ruminants were examined for amphistome infections and 33/329 (10 %) of the animals were infected and the highest prevalence per locality was in Hwange (35 %; 7/20). A high prevalence of 63 % was recorded in Kobus ellipsiprymnus (waterbuck) from Beitbridge, accompanied with a high parasitic burden of more than 10 000 parasites per animal. The lowest parasitic burden was observed in Connochaetes taurinus taurinus (blue wildebeest) and Hippotragus niger (sable), each with less than 10 amphistomes. A total of 86 amphistome specimens from Syncerus caffer (African buffalo) (n = 27), Aepyceros melampus (impala) (n = 17), Tragelaphus strepsiceros (kudu) (n = 16), waterbuck (n = 10), sable (n = 7), Redunca arundinum (reedbuck) (n = 7), and Connochaetes taurinus taurinus (blue wildebeest) (n = 2) were randomly selected for morphological and molecular identification. Using a combination of both histological technique and ITS-2 rDNA marker, the following seven amphistome species were identified; Leiperocotyle (L.) gretillati, Calicophoron (C.) microbothrium, C. raja, C. clavula, C. phillerouxi, Gigantocotyle (Gi.) symmeri, and Gastrothylax (G.) crumenifer which are pouched amphistome species. Orthocoelium dicranocoelium identification was based on morphological characters only. Although the ITS-2 is a widely used marker, it may not be useful in discriminating cryptic species in the Calicophoron genus. Orthocoelium (O.) dicranocoelium, G. crumenifer and L. gretillati are first records in wild ruminants in Zimbabwe.

AB  - Geopolitical borderlands are politically sensitive areas and biodiversity hotspots, strictly controlled by the government and military. How to ensure political security, while protecting the biodiversity in borderlands is a problem for ecologists and governments. In this study, the nest site selection of the wild boar Sus scrofa was a case study in the Sino-Russia borderland to understand the survival strategy of wild life under anthropogenic pressure. We investigated (a) how the spatial distribution of anthropogenic pressure and wild boar nests in the borderland and (b) how anthropogenic pressure and the border influence on the wild boars' nest site selection. The Getis-Ord Gi* analysis was used to analyze the distribution patterns of wild boar nest sites and anthropogenic pressures in the borderland, the Structural Equation Models was used to explore the influence of border, roads, settlements, agricultural land, grassland and anthropogenic pressure on wild boars' nest site selection. The results indicated that wild boar nest sites are close to the border, roads and agricultural land and away from settlements and grassland. Regardless of the combination of anthropogenic pressure, wild boars make the most advantageous choice and prefer to be closer to the borderland. We speculated that military control played a vital role in borderlands for animal protection under anthropogenic pressure. Wild boars benefit from the prohibition of anthropogenic persecution due to military control. Compared with existing measures, we suggest a different protection/wildlife management strategy, what we need to do may be to prohibit anthropogenic persecution rather than perform other human interventions to protect animals. However, for a species with trouble potential, we need to base our conservation strategies on the recovery of top predators, and play the community control role of top predators to avoid the occurrence of trouble.

AB  - Herbivorous insects consume a large proportion of the energy flow in terrestrial ecosystems and play a major role in the dynamics of plant populations and communities. However, high -resolution, quantitative predictions of the global patterns of insect herbivory and their potential underlying drivers remain elusive. Here, we compiled and analyzed a dataset consisting of 9,682 records of the severity of insect herbivory from across natural communities worldwide to quantify its global patterns and environmental determinants. Global mapping revealed strong spatial variation in insect herbivory at the global scale, showing that insect herbivory did not significantly vary with latitude for herbaceous plants but increased with latitude for woody plants. We found that the cation -exchange capacity in soil was a main predictor of levels of herbivory on herbaceous plants, while climate largely determined herbivory on woody plants. We next used well -established scenarios for future climate change to forecast how spatial patterns of insect herbivory may be expected to change with climate change across the world. We project that herbivore pressure will intensify on herbaceous plants worldwide but would likely only increase in certain biomes (e.g., northern coniferous forests) for woody plants. Our assessment provides quantitative evidence of how environmental conditions shape the spatial pattern of insect herbivory, which enables a more accurate prediction of the vulnerabilities of plant communities and ecosystem functions in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Mediterranean areas contain a great diversity of flora and phytocenosis, due to the different substrates and the special Mediterranean climate, and it is in the Iberian Peninsula where the greatest diversity is concentrated. The need for didactic techniques that generate awareness and good learning results is considered of great relevance in order to obtain well-trained environmental managers. We proceed to the research on different phytosociological groups. The one with the largest number of associations or plant communities is the one located in nitrified environments near urban areas; the group of communities dominated by Poa bulbosa is of great interest for sheep farming, while, for equine and bovine farming, the communities rich in grasses and legumes that are located in rural environments rich in organic matter are of interest. The latter communities are also interesting because they act as a sink for CO2. Due to the serious alterations in Mediterranean grasslands, we propose cultural, socio-educational, and socio-economic strategies to increase family income, thus avoiding the south-north migratory flow, as well as combining exploitation and conservation, and promoting sustainable development.

AB  - Male-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is common in ungulates. The dominant scenario for the evolution of ungulate SSD suggests that habitat openness leads to greater SSD by increasing group size and thus sexual selection through male-male competition for mates. At a more proximate level, adaptive changes in SSD may result from the plastic response of individuals to environmental variation. In this study, we used 161,948 body mass data from a seasonally size-dimorphic species, the northern chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, to examine the role of forest cover and other environmental variables in the expression of SSD. Data were collected from individuals hunted in the Austrian Alps, grouped into 28 mountain ranges with different forest cover, geological substrate and population density. Population-specific growth curves were fitted using monomolecular models, and SSD was calculated as the log-transformed ratio of male to female asymptotic body mass. A path model in which environmental factors indirectly influenced SSD via male or female body mass suggested that SSD increased with increasing density via reduced female body mass and decreased on siliceous substrates via reduced male body mass. Forest cover was negatively associated with body mass in both sexes, but not with variation in SSD.
   Chamois are an interesting species to examine sexual size dimorphism (SSD) as they exhibit very little skeletal size dimorphism, and SSD in body mass is largely seasonal. We analysed 161,948 body mass data of northern chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) in the Austrian Alps to explore environmental influences on SSD. Our findings show that SSD increased with higher population density through reduced female body mass and decreased on siliceous substrates through reduced male body mass, while forest cover negatively affected body mass in both sexes but did not alter SSD.image

AB  - UK animals and plants are surveyed annually by a wide range of long-term citizen science monitoring schemes, which are designed to detect species' range, status and population trend. Here we explore whether these data are suitable for detection of ecological impacts of invasive species on native species. While expert horizon scans and risk assessments can identify those non-native species that are likely to turn invasive from ecological knowledge, it would be valuable to monitor such impacts in practice. Monitoring scheme data may support such evaluations. We consider the utility of monitoring data in this context via a series of case studies examining the detectability of impacts of Ring-necked Parakeet, Grey Squirrel and Reeves' Muntjac on native birds and bats that are potentially vulnerable to their impacts. The results show that monitoring scheme data have the potential to provide novel insight informing the evaluation of invasive effects in a range of contexts, adding to current evidence bases, which typically rely upon ecological principles and evidence from small-scale studies. We found a combination of results supporting the expectation of invasive impacts and those not finding such effects. The latter may partly reflect limitations in data quality, such as issues of co-location of data, sample size, adequately detailed identification of at-risk habitats or locations, and likelihood of incompleteness of data on non-natives. We discuss options to enhance monitoring to support enhanced analyses in the future, but analyses of the data can already provide evidence to assist with the determination of invasive impacts now.

AB  - Introduction: Domestic wildlife markets have important nutritional, medicinal, cultural, and financial significance for local communities, but the scale and diversity of wildlife trade that passes through them is also associated with negative impacts on biodiversity, poor animal welfare, and potential human health risk. To design, and monitor the effectiveness of, interventions to ameliorate such impacts, an understanding of the species sold at the markets and their purpose is required, together with a robust (and potentially flexible) baseline. Here we focus on Bel & eacute;n (the largest open wildlife market in the Peruvian Amazon) and Modelo market, in Iquitos, Peru. Methods: We surveyed wildlife products for sale at both markets approximately weekly over a year, using two different survey methods (open and discreet). To provide a baseline to support future conservation monitoring, we estimated a number of different market metrics (including indices of product availability, volume (observed per survey), and price), for the most frequently observed species 'groups', and compared indices of trade volume with daily river water levels. To provide a complete understanding of the range of species involved, we also described all threatened species recorded at the markets, the products sold, and their uses, including those that were only observed occasionally. Results: Both markets sold predominantly wild meat, and some pets; at Belen Market >30% observations were of decorative, spiritual, or medicinal products. At least 71 unique species (including mammals, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates) were observed in total. The most frequently observed species 'groups' were: lowland paca, peccaries, caiman, river turtles, boas, yellow footed tortoise, parrots, and brocket deer. 27.7% of species were threatened or Near Threatened globally or nationally but there was no evidence that discreet surveys increased their detection. Daily river water levels were positively correlated with indices of trade volume for lowland paca, caiman, and yellow-footed tortoise, and negatively correlated with indices of trade volume for parrots and river turtle eggs. Discussion: Beyond providing a comparative dataset, and insights regarding the apparent availability and value of a diversity of products (including food items, live pets, and other decorative, spiritual, and medicinal items), we suggest that simulations using these data could be used to optimize future monitoring efforts. Finally, our observations of correlations of per survey trade volumes of some species with daily river water levels in Iquitos may inform optimal time of year for species- specific surveys.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) promotes tree species diversity by reducing recruitment near conspecific adults due to biotic feedbacks from herbivores, pathogens, or competitors. While this process is well-described in tropical forests, tests of temperate tree species range from strong positive to strong negative density dependence. To explain this, several studies have suggested that tree species traits may help predict the strength and direction of density dependence: for example, ectomycorrhizal-associated tree species typically exhibit either positive or weaker negative conspecific density dependence. More generally, the strength of density dependence may be predictably related to other species-specific ecological attributes such as shade tolerance, or the relative local abundance of a species. To test the strength of density dependence and whether it affects seedling community diversity in a temperate forest, we tracked the survival of seedlings of three ectomycorrhizal-associated species experimentally planted beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults on the Prospect Hill tract of the Harvard Forest, in Massachusetts, USA. Experimental seedling survival was always lower under conspecific adults, which increased seedling community diversity in one of six treatments. We compared these results to evidence of CNDD from observed sapling survival patterns of 28 species over approximately 8 years in an adjacent 35-ha forest plot. We tested whether species-specific estimates of CNDD were associated with mycorrhizal association, shade tolerance, and local abundance. We found evidence of significant, negative conspecific density dependence (CNDD) in 23 of 28 species, and positive conspecific density dependence in two species. Contrary to our expectations, ectomycorrhizal-associated species generally exhibited stronger (e.g., more negative) CNDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal-associated species. CNDD was also stronger in more shade-tolerant species but was not associated with local abundance. Conspecific adult trees often have a negative influence on seedling survival in temperate forests, particularly for tree species with certain traits. Here we found strong experimental and observational evidence that ectomycorrhizal-associating species consistently exhibit CNDD. Moreover, similarities in the relative strength of density dependence from experiments and observations of sapling mortality suggest a mechanistic link between negative effects of conspecific adults on seedling and sapling survival and local tree species distributions.

AB  - In this paper charcoals from the Syrian sites Tell Mozan and Tell Jerablus are investigated to understand the impact of 4th to 2nd millennium BC settlement on the vegetation. Charcoals from these sites have been identified and oak fragments have been measured for their maximal diameter and annual ring widths. Our results show that while oak had reached its maximal expansion in the Mid-Holocene, and vegetation in the Euphrates Valley was lusher than today, strong anthropogenic impact on the vegetation was occurring, probably already prior to the Late Chalcolithic period. Due to potentially enormous herds of sheep and goat, and possibly large-scale agriculture with perhaps some understory cropping, oak was growing very slowly, to the degree that it must often have had a shrub-like appearance. People did not apply systematic oak woodland management practices, such as coppicing or pollarding. They used dung as an additional fuel, probably to cover for shortages in wood resources. The land appears to have been used both intensively and extensively to a degree that was not sustainable in the long term. This, combined with aridity impact on the oak, probably led to a decrease in oak proportion at Mozan in the Middle Bronze Age.

AB  - Leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) constitute a family of abundant, diverse, and ecologically important herbivorous insects, due to their high specificity with host plants, a close association with vegetation and a great sensitivity to microclimatic variation (factors that are modified gradually during the rainy and dry seasons). Therefore, the effects of seasonality (rainy and dry seasons) and microclimate on the community attributes of chrysomelids were evaluated in a semideciduous tropical forest fragment of northeastern Mexico. Monthly sampling was conducted, between March 2016 and February 2017, with an entomological sweep net in 18 plots of 20 x 20 m, randomly distributed from 320 to 480 m a.s.l. Seven microclimatic variables were simultaneously recorded during each of the samplings, using a portable weather station. In total, 216 samples were collected at the end of the study, of which 2,103 specimens, six subfamilies, 46 genera, and 71 species were obtained. The subfamily Galerucinae had the highest number of specimens and species in the study area, followed by Cassidinae. Seasonality caused significant changes in the abundance and number of leaf beetle species: highest richness was recorded in the rainy season, with 60 species, while the highest diversity (lowest dominance and highest H' index) was obtained in the dry season. Seasonal inventory completeness of leaf beetles approached (rainy season) or was higher (dry season) than 70%, while the faunistic similarity between seasons was 0.63%. The outlying mean index was significant in both seasons; of the seven microclimatic variables analyzed, only temperature, heat index, evapotranspiration and wind speed were significantly related to changes in abundance of Chrysomelidae. Association between microclimate and leaf beetles was higher in the dry season, with a difference in the value of importance of the abiotic variables. The results indicated that each species exhibited a different response pattern to the microclimate, depending on the season, which suggests that the species may exhibit modifications in their niche requirements according to abiotic conditions. However, the investigations must be replicated in other regions, in order to obtain a better characterization of the seasonal and microclimatic influence on the family Chrysomelidae.

AB  - Lay Summary center dot Only 3-14% of the North American grasslands that existed at the time of European settlement still remain, and most of these grasslands are now managed for intensive cattle production. center dot Populations of grassland birds have shown steep declines over the past 50 years. center dot Patch-burn grazing is a rangeland management strategy that uses rotational fire and grazing to reestablish historical patterns of disturbance in prairie ecosystems. center dot We tested whether patch-burn grazing could improve reproductive success of three species of grassland songbirds in a six-year study at two sites in Kansas, USA. center dot Overall, nest survival was low, brood parasitism was high, and we did not find the previously described benefits of patch-burn grazing management over annual burning and grazing. center dot Changing how we manage our grasslands alone might therefore not be enough to combat ongoing population declines of grassland songbirds in some areas.
   Intensification of livestock production has reduced heterogeneity in vegetative structure in managed grasslands, which has been linked to widespread declines in grassland songbird populations throughout North America. Patch-burn grazing management aims to restore some of that heterogeneity in vegetative structure by burning discrete pasture sections, so that cattle preferentially graze in recently burned areas. Although patch-burn grazing can increase reproductive success of grassland songbirds, we know little about possible interactions with regional variation in predator communities or brood parasite abundance, or annual variation in weather conditions. Using six years of data from two tallgrass prairie sites in eastern Kansas, USA, we tested effects of patch-burn grazing on the rates of brood parasitism, clutch size, nest survival, and fledging success of three common grassland songbirds, Dickcissels (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), and Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), among pastures managed with patch-burn grazing versus pastures that were annually burned and either grazed or ungrazed. Dickcissel nests experienced lower parasitism (72.8 +/- 4.6% SE vs. 89.1 +/- 2.2%) and Eastern Meadowlarks had higher nest survival (63.2 +/- 20.5% vs. 16.5 +/- 3.5%) in annually burned and ungrazed pastures than pastures managed with patch-burn grazing. However, average number of host fledglings per nesting attempt did not differ among management treatments for any species. Annual variation in weather conditions had a large effect on vegetation structure, but not on reproductive success. Probability of brood parasitism was consistently high (25.5-84.7%) and nest survival was consistently low (9.9-16.9%) for all species pooled across treatments, sites, and years, indicating that combined effects of predation, parasitism and drought can offset potential benefits of patch-burn grazing management previously found in tallgrass prairies. Although differences in reproductive success among management treatments were minimal, patch-burn grazing management could still benefit population dynamics of grassland songbirds in areas where nest predators and brood parasites are locally abundant by providing suitable nesting habitat for bird species that require greater amounts of vegetation cover and litter, generally not present in burned pastures.

AB  - Unsustainable soil management is one of the drivers of soil degradation, but impact assessment requires the development of indicators. Oribatids might be considered as early indicators of disturbances due to the stability of their community. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of oribatids as bioindicators of sustainable agricultural practices. Under a dry Mediterranean climate, three fertilization experiments - two under a two-crop rotation system and one under maize monoculture and established 12 years earlier - were sampled 3x for oribatid identification during the last annual cropping cycle. The hypothesis was that different nutrient and crop managements affect the number of oribatid species and individuals present, and these parameters could be used as indicators of soil degradation. In total, 18 oribatid species were identified, and 1974 adult individuals were recovered. Maximum abundance was found prior to sowing. Pig slurry (PS) vs. control, and dairy cattle manure (CM) vs. mineral fertilization increased oribatid abundance. This increase was evident when the average applied rates with PS were ca. 2 Mg of organic matter (OM) ha(- 1) yr(- 1), or higher than ca. 4 Mg OM ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for CM. When the preceding crop was wheat and PS or CM were used, Oribatula (Zygoribatula) excavata (which reproduces sexually) predominated. In maize monoculture fertilized with CM, Tectocepheus sarekensis and Acrotritia ardua americana (which can reproduce through parthenogenesis) prevailed vs. Oribatula, which indicated a heavily disturbed soil. Under this specific Mediterranean environment, the predominance of certain parthenogenic oribatid species and the number of individuals provide advanced warning on soil degradation.

AB  - Altered fire regimes threaten biodiversity, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms driving popu-lation declines. Relationships between mammal occurrence and time since fire can be unclear because mammals respond directly to changes in habitat structure rather than time since fire per se, and patterns of regeneration can be highly variable. Previous studies have examined how mammals respond to time since fire and habitat structure separately, but rarely considered the three factors together. Furthermore, fires may interact with other threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation, also rarely incorporated into fire studies but known to influence mammal communities. Understanding each of these mechanisms and how they interact is critical for using fire effectively in conservation.We simultaneously related ground-dwelling mammal species activity to habitat structure, habitat structure to post-fire vegetation growth stage, and species activity to growth stage and landscape structure (extent of heathy woodland vegetation) using structural equation models (SEMs). This allowed us to find direct effects of growth stage on mammals, indirect effects mediated by habitat structure, and additional effects of landscape structure.Understorey cover, litter depth, and coarse woody debris responded to growth stage and were important contributors in all SEMs. Four of seven mammal species responded to at least one habitat structure variable. None of the mammal species were related directly to growth stage, but mammals were indirectly related to growth stage through the mediating influence of habitat structure. For example, western grey kangaroos were linked to recently burnt sites, but only through their negative association with litter depth. Extent of heathy woodland vegetation was also an important driver of mammal activity and was related to all but one species; two species showed a positive relationship, and four negative.Important relationships between fire and ground-dwelling mammals may be overlooked unless changes in important habitat resources are also considered. Fire management planning for fauna conservation should incorporate habitat responses as mammal responses to the fire regime may be mediated by fire-driven changes in resources. Knowing how time since fire affects important habitat structures can improve the effectiveness of using fire to manipulate these to support mammal species. Our results will help land managers understand direct and indirect effects of fire in a landscape where multiple drivers threaten biodiversity, and guide the use of prescribed fire to promote aspects of habitat structure that benefit mammals.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) plays a pivotal role in air-sea interactions, with implications for climate, weather, and marine ecosystems, particularly in regions like the Caribbean Sea, where upwelling and dynamic oceanographic processes significantly influence biodiversity and fisheries. This study evaluates the performance of foundational models, Chronos and Lag-Llama, in forecasting SST using 22 years (2002-2023) of high-resolution satellite-derived and in situ data. The Chronos model, leveraging zero-shot learning and tokenization methods, consistently outperformed Lag-Llama across all forecast horizons, demonstrating lower errors and greater stability, especially in regions of moderate SST variability. The Chronos model's ability to forecast extreme upwelling events is assessed, and a description of such events is presented for two regions in the southern Caribbean upwelling system. The Chronos forecast resembles SST variability in upwelling regions for forecast horizons of up to 7 days, providing reliable short-term predictions. Beyond this, the model exhibits increased bias and error, particularly in regions with strong SST gradients and high variability associated with coastal upwelling processes. The findings highlight the advantages of foundational models, including reduced computational demands and adaptability across diverse tasks, while also underscoring their limitations in regions with complex physical oceanographic phenomena. This study establishes a benchmark for SST forecasting using foundational models and emphasizes the need for hybrid approaches integrating physical principles to improve accuracy in dynamic and ecologically critical regions.

AB  - Defoliation, often induced by herbivores, and soil microbiomes are recognized as key drivers of plant diversity and productivity in grasslands. However, lack of experiments simultaneously manipulating defoliation and soil microbial diversity has constrained our understanding of how these two factors interactively influence both above-ground and below-ground net primary productivity (ANPP and BNPP).We employed a soil filtering approach to create the gradient of soil microbial diversity and removal of above-ground biomass by clipping to simulate defoliation effect from herbivores. Our goal was to investigate how soil microbial diversity affected both ANPP and BNPP under the stress of defoliation.We found that defoliation and soil microbial diversity loss decreased the ANPP and BNPP of the plant community, and Medicago falcata (legume) was more responsive to these treatments than Leymus chinensis (grass) and Artemisia frigida (forb). ANPP was positively correlated with soil microbial richness only when plants suffered defoliation. By contrast, BNPP showed a closer relationship with soil fungal richness than bacteria, and defoliation enhanced this relationship. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that defoliation indirectly regulated ANPP by affecting plant P content, while soil bacterial diversity loss decreased the ANPP through altering plant P and fungal diversity loss directly decreased BNPP. The LEfSe and linear regression analysis revealed that the biomarkers of bacteria (e.g. Actinobacteria, Xanthobacteraceae) and fungi (e.g. Ascomycota, Glomerales) significantly contributed to the variation of ANPP and BNPP under defoliation treatment respectively. Defoliation enhanced phosphorus acquisition by soil microorganisms, further strengthening the microbial regulation of plant productivity.Overall, we provide novel insights on how defoliation enhances the positive effects of soil microbial diversity on above- and below-ground net primary productivity. Our findings highlight that soil microorganisms associated with phosphorus cycling are mobilized to play a more active role in promoting productivity after defoliation. It may provide a new perspective on how to better utilize the role of soil microorganisms in grazed or managed grasslands.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Despite the domestication of sheep and goats by humans for several millennia, we still lack comparative data on their cognitive capacity. Comparing the cognitive skills of farm animals can help understand the evolution of cognition. In this study, we compared the performances of sheep and goats in inference by exclusion tasks. We implemented two tasks, namely a cup task and a tube task, to identify whether success in solving the task could be attributed to either low-level mechanisms (avoiding the empty location strategy) or to deductive reasoning (if two possibilities A and B, but not A, then it must be B). In contrast to a previous study comparing goats and sheep in a cup task, we showed that both species solved the inferential condition with high success rates. In the tube task, performances could not be explained by alternative strategies such as avoiding the empty tube or preferring the bent tube. When applying a strict set of criteria concerning responses in all conditions and controlling for the potential effects of experience, we demonstrate that two individuals, a goat and a sheep, fulfil these criteria. This suggests that sheep and goats are able to make inferences based on deductive reasoning.

AB  - Fences can act as impermeable or semipermeable barriers to animal movement, which can reduce habitat connectivity, carrying capacity, and gene flow. Portions of standard height fence (1.4-1.5 m) and water gaps (fencing to allow water to flow through while controlling animal movement) can offset the potential negative effects of impermeable fences on wildlife by facilitating movement across the boundary. However, little is known regarding the frequency, distance, duration, and timing of deer crossing events. Therefore, we quantified the effects of temporary water gaps and sections of standard fencing on and activity patterns on a property fenced with 2.4-m tall chain link fence topped with 3 barbed wire strands. We captured and fitted 169 deer (80 F, 89 M) with GPS collars that collected 1 location every 15 or 30 minutes from 2011 to 2015. We used k-means cluster analysis to identify crossing locations post-hoc and then calculated the number of crossovers (non-returning forays) and crossover loops (completed loops), maximum distance outside of the property boundary, total distance traveled, crossing time, and time duration outside the fence for each deer. Twenty-seven deer (11 females, 16 males) left the property 340 times through 5 water gaps and an similar to 500-m section of 1.4-1.5-m high 5-strand barbed wire. Twenty-six deer made 333 return trips; however, the 7 non-return events were due to dropped collars (n = 6) and one non-hunting related mortality while outside of the fence. Most crossings were crepuscular, consistent with normal deer movement patterns. Mean maximum distance and duration of crossover loops outside the fence was 705 m and 23.6 h, respectively. Results suggest that temporary water gaps and standard height fencing can facilitate fence crossings by deer while maintaining population fidelity to the property; the 2.4-m tall fence also was an effective security barrier for the property by restricting access to the site. Landowners willing to allow cross-fence movement will need to determine the allowable percentage of animals that may cross, which is dependent on management goals and dictates the type, amount, and location of crossings.

AB  - Simple Summary Ticks are vectors of several agents of human disease, and improvements to traditional surveillance methods are needed to aid in tick-borne disease monitoring and prevention. Invasive wild pigs are broadly distributed in the southern U.S., and removal efforts are often undertaken by local, state, and federal entities. Wild pigs are hosts to several human-biting tick species associated with agents of human disease. This research examines the use of tick collection from wild pigs in the state of Florida as a method of surveillance for ticks and tick-borne pathogens of human concern. Four species of human-biting ticks were collected from wild pigs in this study, yielding similar results to traditional surveillance methods in the state. Known and potential human pathogens were identified in the collected ticks. Landscape features associated with tick diversity and abundance, such as developed spaces, mixed forest, and shrub/scrub habitat were identified, and may be useful for identifying areas of increased risk of encounters with human-biting ticks. These results help to inform tick and tick-borne pathogen surveillance efforts in the state of Florida and suggest that collections from wild pigs may be a useful surveillance tool for continued tick-borne disease surveillance. Invasive wild pigs are distributed across much of the U.S. and are hosts to tick vectors of human disease. Herein, adult ticks were collected from 157 wild pigs in 21 northern and central Florida counties from 2019-2020 during removal efforts by USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services personnel and evaluated for their potential to be used as a method of tick-borne disease surveillance. Collected ticks were identified, screened for pathogens, and the effects of landscape metrics on tick community composition and abundance were investigated. A total of 1415 adult ticks of four species were collected. The diversity of tick species collected from wild pigs was comparable to collections made throughout the state with conventional surveillance methods. All species collected have implications for pathogen transmission to humans and other animals. Ehrlichia, Anaplasma-like, and Rickettsia spp. were detected in ticks collected from wild pigs. These results suggest that tick collection from wild pigs is a suitable means of surveillance for pathogens and vectors. The strongest drivers of variation in tick community composition were the developed open space and mixed forest landcover classes. Fragmented shrub/scrub habitat was associated with increased tick abundance. Similar models may be useful in predicting tick abundance and distribution patterns.

AB  - For prey, movement synchrony represents a potent antipredator strategy. Prey, however, must balance the costs and benefits of using conspecifics to mediate risk. Thus, the emergent patterns of risk-driven sociality depend on variation in space and in the predators and prey themselves. We applied the concept of predator-prey habitat domain, the space in which animals acquire food resources, to test the conditions under which individuals synchronize their movements relative to predator and prey habitat domains. We tested the response of movement synchrony of prey to predator-prey domains in two populations of ungulates that vary in their gregariousness and predator community: (i) elk, which are preyed on by wolves; and (ii) caribou, which are preyed on by coyotes and black bears. Prey in both communities responded to cursorial predators by increasing synchrony during seasons of greater predation pressure. Elk moved more synchronously in the wolf habitat domain during winter and caribou moved more synchronously in the coyote habitat domains during spring. In the winter, caribou increased movement synchrony when coyote and caribou domains overlapped. By integrating habitat domains with movement ecology, we provide a compelling argument for social behaviours and collective movement as an antipredator response. This article is part of the theme issue 'The spatial-social interface: A theoretical and empirical integration'.

AB  - Perceived predation risk and the resulting antipredator behaviour varies across space, time and predator identity. Communities with multiple predators that interact and differ in their use of space, time of activity and hunting mode create a complex landscape for prey to avoid predation. Anthropogenic presence and disturbance have the potential to shift interactions among predators and prey and the where and when encounters occur. We examined how white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus fawn spatiotemporal antipredator behaviour differed along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient that had black bears Ursus americanus, coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus and humans present. We quantified (a) spatial co-occurrence in species distributions, (b) temporal overlap across the diel cycle and (c) spatiotemporal associations between humans, bears, coyotes, bobcats, adult male deer and fawns. We also examined how deer vigilance behaviour changed across the anthropogenic disturbance gradient and survey duration. Anthropogenic disturbance influenced spatiotemporal co-occurrence across multiple scales, often increasing spatiotemporal overlap among species. In general, species' spatial co-occurrence was neutral or positive in anthropogenically disturbed environments. Bears and fawns, coyotes and adult male deer, and bobcats and fawns all had higher temporal overlap in the agriculture-development matrix sites. In addition, factors that influenced deer vigilance (e.g. distance to forest edge and predator relative abundance) in the agriculture-development matrix sites did not in the forest matrix site. By taking into account the different antipredator behaviours that can be detected and the different scales these behaviours might occur, we were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of how humans reduce available niche space for wildlife, creating the neutral and positive spatiotemporal associations between species that studies have been seeing in more disturbed areas.

AB  - A mammal species inventory by estimating their richness is the first and necessary task of any mammal monitoring programme. This paper presents estimates of species richness of mammals (mostly medium and large body-sized) in the Central Forest State Nature Reserve (European Russia). Based on data collected in 2023 from 55 camera trap locations (19 676 camera days), 59 035 images of wild mammals were obtained. A total of 18 species were recorded. Of these, ten species were representatives of the Carnivora, four - Artiodactyla, two - Rodentia, one - Erinaceomorpha, and one - Lagomorpha. This amounted to 84% of all potentially camera-trapped mammals observed in the Central Forest State Nature Reserve. The relative abundance index (RAT) and naive occupancy (psi(naive) ) were calculated for all species. The most common and frequently recorded were Meles meles (RAT = 4.95;psi(naive) = 0.96), followed by Ursus arctos (RAT = 4.39; psi(naive) = 1) and Lepus timidus (RAT = 4.08; psi(naive) = 1), while the most rarely recorded species were Castor fiber (RAT = 0.01; psi(naive) = 0.02), Erinaceus europaeus (RAT = 0.02; psi(naive) = 0.04), and Lutra lutra (RAT = 0.03; psi(naive) = 0.07). Large and medium-sized carnivorous and omnivorous mammal communities were the fastest and most completely captured. According to the constructed single-season multispecies occupancy model with Markov chains Monte Carlo, camera traps failed to record 4-5 more possible species. These species are likely to be Mustela lutreola, , M. erminea, , and Mustela nivalis, , as well as two invasive species, Cervus nippon and Capreolus pygargus. . All the captured species were recorded in total in a short period of time, namely from the end of March to the beginning of May during 1869 camera-days. Two of them ( Castor fiber and Erinaceus europaeus) ) were recorded exclusively at this time, and they were not captured further until the end of the year. This emphasises the importance of conducting mammal inventory, with inclusion of the spring season.

AB  - In this research, the growth and distribution of Alhagi camelorum Medic. as a potential crop was monitored for producing forage in hypersaline and hyperarid regions. For this purpose, seven Alhagi-dominated rangelands were selected in its original homeland at the south of the Great Salt Desert. The soil salinity of selected regions is very variable, and ranged from 3.6 dS m-1 to 725 dS m-1 and from 0.4 dS m-1 to 366 dS m-1 at 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm soil depths, respectively. The annual mean of maximum and minimum air temperature is around 30 and 6 degrees C, respectively, and the mean annual precipitation is less than 150 mm. The plant growth characteristics assessed by canopy cover, canopy height, shoot fresh weight (SFW), and dry weight (SDW) had a negative relationship with soil salinity and pH. The highest SFW (24.97 t ha-1) and SDW (6.98 t ha-1) of Alhagi were obtained where soil salinity was 13 dS m-1 and soil pH was the lowest (7.1). Alhagi maintained the minimal growth and production of 20 cm canopy height and 50% canopy cover even in the saltiest conditions with a soil salinity of 395 dS m-1; hence it can serve as a potential crop for haloculture systems. In Aqda, the canopy cover increased with increase in the soil salinity up to 7-10 dS m-1 but decreased as the salinity levels increased further. The study revealed that A. camelorum not only has a very high tolerance to salinity but a moderate salinity up to 10 dS m-1 can also stimulate the growth. However, soil pH had a greater effect on growth, and Alhagi does not have a high tolerance to soil alkalinity. Therefore, Alhagi species could not be a bio-indicator for soil salinity, while well-established plants with good canopy could be considered as a sign for low alkalinity in arid terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Net-wire fencing built to confine livestock is common on rangelands in the Southwestern USA, yet the impacts of livestock fencing on wildlife are largely unknown. Many wildlife species cross beneath fences at defined crossing locations because they prefer to crawl underneath rather than jump over fences. Animals occasionally become entangled jumping or climbing over fences, leading to injury or death. More commonly, repeated crossings under net-wire fencing by large animals lead to fence damage, though the damage is often tolerated by landowners until the openings affect the ability to enclose livestock. The usage, placement, characteristics, and passage rates of fence crossings beneath net-wire fencing are poorly understood. We monitored 20 randomly selected fence crossings on net-wire livestock fencing across two study sites on rangelands in South Texas, USA, from April 2018 to March 2019. We assessed the characteristics of fence-crossing locations (openings beneath the fence created by animals to aid in crossing) and quantified crossing rates and the probability of crossing by all species of animals via trail cameras. We documented 10,889 attempted crossing events, with 58% (n = 6271) successful. Overall, 15 species of medium- and large-size mammals and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) contributed to crossing events. Crossing locations received 3-4 crossing attempts per day on average, but the number of attempts and probability of successful crossing varied by location and fence condition. The probability of crossing attempts was most consistently influenced by the opening size of the crossing and season; as crossing size (opening) increased, the probability of successful crossing significantly increased for all species. Peaks in crossing activity corresponded with species' daily and seasonal movements and activity. The density and size of fence-crossing locations were dependent on fence maintenance and not associated with vegetation communities or habitat variables. However, crossing locations were often re-established in the same locations after fence repairs. This is one of the few studies to monitor how all animal species present interacted with net-wire livestock fencing in rangelands. Our results will help land managers understand the impact of net-wire livestock fencing on animal movement.

AB  - The rumen microbiome plays a critical role in nutrient metabolism and adaptation of the yak (Bos grunniens), an import livestock animal of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau renowned for their superior plant fiber degradation capacity. However, the microbiome among the different ecological niches within yak's rumen remains unelucidated. Through shotgun sequencing of rumen solid and liquid fractions from five yaks, we identified significant differences in the microbial communities and their genetic functions between the solid and liquid fractions. Solid fractions exhibited dominance by Ruminococcus, Succiniclasticum, and Aspergillus, while Prevotella, Paludibacter, Parabacteroides, and Bacteroides prevailed in liquid fractions. Comparative CAZyme profiling revealed solid fractions were significantly enriched in cellulose/hemicellulose-targeting enzymes (GH5, GH11, and CBM63), implicating their specialization in breaking down the fibrous grasses. In contrast, liquid fractions showed higher abundances of starch-degrading enzymes (GH13, CBM48) and host-glycan utilizers (GH92), suggesting roles in soluble nutrient extraction and host-microbe interactions. Comparative analysis of 574 metagenome-assembled genomes suggested that Methanomethylophilaceae_UBA71 and nitrate-respiring Ruminococcaceae_Firm-04 preferentially colonized in the solids, whereas propionate-producing Quinella and animal glycan-degrading Bacteroides were more prevalent in the liquids. Moreover, compared to Hu sheep, yak's rumen microbiome showed significantly enhanced utilization of plant polysaccharide capacity. Comparative analysis across 10 ruminant species further highlighted host phylogeny as a key driver of rumen microbiome variation.

AB  - Invasive parasites that expand their natural range can be a threat to wildlife biodiversity and may pose a health risk to non-adapted, naive host species. The invasive giant liver fluke, Fascioloides magna, native to North America, has extended its range in Europe and uses mainly red deer ( Cervus elaphus) as definitive hosts. The penetration of the intestinal barrier by the young flukes to reach the liver via the abdominal cavity as well as the release of fluke metabolism products and excreta with the bile and/or changes in the microbial community of the biliary system may enable the translocation of intestinal bacteria across the intestinal barrier and, in turn, could be associated with inflammation and changes in the intestinal bacterial community. The gut commensal community plays a key role in host nutrition and interacts with cells of the immune system to maintain host health. For this study, the gut bacterial community of red deer infected with F. magna and of non-infected red deer from one of the largest forest ecosystems in Central Europe, located on the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, was investigated. The individual fluke burden was associated with changes in the gut microbial composition of the gut of infected individuals, whereas the diversity and composition of the gut bacteria were only slightly different between fluke-infected and uninfected deer. Several bacterial taxa at the genus level were unique to individuals carrying either one or many liver flukes. Our results suggest that the microbiota of red deer is stable to perturbation by low numbers of F. magna. However, a larger parasite burden may cause changes in the gut microbial composition in definitive hosts implying that non-invasive fecal microbiome assessments could serve as indicator for wildlife health monitoring.

AB  - High levels of social connectivity among group-living animals have been hypothesized to benefit individuals by creating opportunities to rapidly reseed the microbiome and maintain stability against disruption. We tested this hypothesis by perturbing the microbiome of a wild population of Grant's gazelles with an antibiotic and asking whether microbiome recovery differs between individuals with high versus low levels of social connectivity. We found that after treatment, individuals with high social connectivity experienced a faster increase in microbiome richness than less socially connected individuals. Unexpectedly, the rapid increase in microbiome richness of highly connected individuals that received treatment led to their microbiomes becoming more distinct relative to the background population. Our results suggest that the microbiome of individuals with high social connectivity can be rapidly recolonized after a perturbation event, but this leads to a microbiome that is more distinct from, rather than more similar to the unperturbed state. This work provides new insight into the role of social interactions in shaping the microbiome.

AB  - Aim: South Africa's subtropical dune thicket represents an interesting case for investigating plant architecture since, unlike most other dry rain forest formations, dune thicket is subject to regular fire. We asked the following questions: (a) what are the different architectural guilds amongst subtropical dune thicket species in mature, closed canopy stands; (b) what are the architectural guilds of the same species but in the early stages of resprouting post fire; (c) do pre-fire guilds predict post-fire guilds; (d) what is the significance of our findings for explaining temporal (post-fire) and spatial patterns of subtropical dune thicket species?
   Location: Cape St Francis, southeastern Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.
   Methods: We used univariate and multivariate methods to identify architectural guilds amongst 11 commonly occurring dune thicket species in closed (light-limited), long unburnt vegetation and in recently burnt stands where vegetative regrowth (sprouts) is exposed to light.
   Results: We found three distinct architectural guilds in unburnt subtropical dune thicket, namely hedge formers, lateral spreaders and vertical growers. In burnt thicket we also identified three resprouting architectures, namely weak resprouters, moderate resprouters and strong resprouters. There was no strong congruence between the unburnt and resprouting architectures.
   Conclusion: Based on the ecologies of each guild, certain expectations originated from the results of the study. We expect frequently burnt landscapes to be dominated by strongly resprouting hedge formers and lateral spreaders, infrequently burnt landscapes to be dominated by strongly resprouting lateral spreaders, and fire-free landscapes to be dominated by weakly resprouting vertical growers.

AB  - Almost all life on earth is facing environmental change, and understanding how populations will respond to these changes is of urgent importance. One factor that is known to affect the speed by which a population can evolve when faced with changes in the environment is strong sexual selection. This increases the adaptive capacity of a population by increasing reproductive skew toward well-adapted (usually) males who will, on average, be best able to compete for matings. This effect could potentially be disrupted when males pursue alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), whereby males within a species exhibit qualitatively different behaviors in their pursuit of matings. ARTs are diverse, but one common class is those expressed through condition-dependent polyphenism such that high-quality, well-adapted males compete aggressively for mates and low-quality, poorly adapted males attempt to acquire matings via other, nonaggressive behaviors. Here, using an individual-based modeling approach, we consider the possible impacts of ARTs on adaptation and evolutionary rescue. When the ART is simultaneous, meaning that low-quality males not only engage in contests but also pursue other tactics, adaptive capacity is reduced and evolutionary rescue, where a population avoids extinction by adapting to a changing environment, becomes less likely. This is because the use of the ART allows low-quality males to contribute more maladaptive genes to the population than would happen otherwise. When the ART is fixed, however, such that low-quality males will only use the alternative tactic and do not engage in contests, we find the opposite: adaptation happens more quickly and evolutionary rescue when the environment changes is more likely. This surprising effect is caused by an increase in the mating success of the highest quality males who face many fewer competitors in this scenario-counterintuitively, the presence of males pursuing the ART increases reproductive skew toward those males in the best condition.
   When the environment is changing, organisms can either migrate, go extinct, or become adapted to the new environment-this last process is called "evolutionary rescue." Whether evolutionary rescue happens is strongly affected how mating occurs in the species, with extinction being less likely when mating is like that found in birds of paradise or red deer, where males compete strongly to mate with females. Evolutionary rescue occurs in these systems because the successful males tend to be in good condition and able to cope with the new environment and their "good quality" genes get transmitted to more of the next generation. In many of these species, however, there are some males who "cheat": These are often low-quality, poorly adapted males who would not be successful if they competed normally, so they try to gain matings by other means by, e.g., sneaking past males guarding females or by trying to mate with females on their way to the places where other males compete. We asked how these "alternative reproductive tactics" (ARTs) could change evolutionary rescue by using a simulation model of populations evolving under environmental change. We found that if males using the ART also compete normally for females, the extinction risk is increased because the low-quality, poorly adapted males are better able to get matings and father offspring. When the ART is "fixed," however, with poor-quality males only able to use the alternative tactic and not engaging in contests, we found that the presence of males following the ART decreased the risk of extinction. This surprising result is because when these males exclude themselves from the contests for females, the males with the best, most adapted genes father even more offspring than they would do otherwise, more than counterbalancing the input of low-quality genes from the males pursuing the ART.

AB  - Loss to cultivated crops by wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is widespread and can jeopardize low-income farmers. In India, although there is lot of political interest in the problem, efforts to understand the patterns, correlates, and underlying reasons for wild pig conflict continue to be minimal. We quantified loss of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to wild pigs and assessed the spatial patterns of damage in a forest settlement of Van Gujjar (Haridwar, India), which is a dairy-based pastoralist community. We chose a 4-km(2) cultivated area comprising 400 farmlands (each measuring 0.8 ha and belonging to a family) and assessed crop damage by wild pigs through field surveys during the harvest season. We interviewed 159 respondents who manage 219 of the total 400 farmlands in the study area to compare actual crop loss with perceived losses. Wild pigs damaged 2.29 tonnes (2,290 kg) of wheat, which was about 2.6% of the potential yield in the study area. A total of 39 farmlands (9.5%), managed by 28 respondents, suffered losses during the survey period at an average loss of about 58.8 kg (SD +/- 89.5, range = 0.7-388 kg). During interviews, 81 respondents managing 155 farmlands (70.7%) reported having suffered wild pig-related crop loss during the survey period. They also perceived losing about 23.4% of the potential yield of wheat due to wild pigs. The perceived losses were much higher than actual losses. Actual losses measured through field surveys underscore the dichotomy between actual and perceived crop loss due to wild pigs. About 81% of recorded wild pig-related damage to wheat occurred within 200 m from the forest edge. The crop protection measures aimed at stopping wild pigs from entering the fields were mostly reactive. Although overall crop losses due to wild pigs seem low at the settlement level, for affected individual families, the losses were financially significant. Such recurrent crop losses can cause families to go into debt, trigger animosity toward conservation, and lead to retaliation measures, which may be indiscriminate and have the potential to affect other endangered mammals in conservation priority landscapes. Because crop losses by wild pigs are severe along the narrow band of fields along the edge of the forest, channeling monetary benefits through insurance-based compensation schemes can help assuage losses to farmers. Further, because crop damage by wild pigs is seasonal, experimenting with mobile fences that can be dismantled and packed away after use would be beneficial.

AB  - Predator non-consumptive effects (NCE) can alter prey foraging time and habitat use, potentially reducing fitness. Prey can mitigate NCEs by increasing vigilance, chewing-vigilance synchronization, and spatiotemporal avoidance of predators. We quantified the relationship between Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) predation risk and elk (Cervus canadensis) behavior. We conducted behavioral observations on adult female elk and developed predation risk indices using GPS collar data from Mexican wolves, locations of elk killed by wolves, and landscape covariates. We compared a priori models to determine the best predictors of adult female behavior and multitasking. Metrics that quantified both spatial and temporal predation risk were the most predictive. Vigilance was positively associated with increased predation risk. The effect of predation risk on foraging and resting differed across diurnal periods. During midday when wolf activity was lower, the probability of foraging increased while resting decreased in high-risk areas. During crepuscular periods when elk and wolves were most active, increased predation risk was associated with increased vigilance and slight decreases in foraging. Our results suggest elk are temporally avoiding predation risk from Mexican wolves by trading resting for foraging, a trade-off often not evaluated in behavioral studies. Probability of multitasking depended on canopy openness and an interaction between maternal period and predation risk; multitasking decreased prior to parturition and increased post parturition in high-risk areas. Openness was inversely related to multitasking. These results suggest adult female elk are altering the type of vigilance used depending on resource availability/quality, current energetic needs, and predation risk. Our results highlight potentially important, but often-excluded behaviors and trade-offs prey species may use to reduce the indirect effects of predation and contribute additional context to our understanding of predator-prey dynamics.
   We quantified the effects of the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) predation risk on elk (Cervus canadensis) behavior in the southwestern United States. Metrics that quantified both spatial and temporal predation risk were top predictors in both datasets. During midday when wolf activity was relatively low, the probability of foraging increased while resting decreased, in areas with high spatial predation risk. During crepuscular periods when elk and wolves were most active, increased predation risk was associated with increased vigilance and slight decreases in foraging. The probability of multitasking increased with predation risk, suggesting that adult female elk may be offsetting the non-consumptive effects of risk on feeding time.image

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are often symptomatic of underlying human-human conflicts, characterised by opposing viewpoints, unclear or limited communication, and failure to compromise. Participatory approaches towards resolving human-wildlife conflict have previously demonstrated success in creating effective wildlife management plans. In the UK, the red deer (Cervus elaphus) is a charismatic native species, yet it is capable of negatively impacting landscape conservation efforts, farming and forestry, and environmental restoration targets. Here, we employed a facilitated workshop, as the decision-making end point to a modified Delphi process, to foster communication between key interested parties in the Lake District National Park, UK, aiming to produce an adaptive impact management framework for red deer. Crucially, consensus was achieved for a vision of adaptive landscape management, objectives for the landscape, monitoring actions, and methods of deer population control, and the resulting framework will underpin management policy for this interest group. During this study facilitated consensus-building among interested parties was critical for the co-creation of policy and plans in order to progress towards the resolution of a long-standing conflict with red deer. It stands as an example for interest group engagement with a view to mitigate a human-wildlife conflict in a multi-user landscape.

AB  - How organisms search for and obtain food is a determinant of their survival. It has been hypothesized that organisms facing food limitations might expand their dietary niche compared with optimal foraging conditions. Nonetheless, some organisms may reduce their dietary niche due to limiting resources. Here, we show the resource use plasticity of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the largest living rodent, in natural and anthropized environments of Brazil using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in hair. We assessed the resource use, size and overlap of isotopic niches, and the influence of body mass, age class, sex, and landscape composition on isotopic values among 13 capybara populations (210 individuals). We observed a wide variation in isotopic values of capybaras among and within populations in different environments. Surprisingly, diets varied from strictly C-4-based to strictly C-3-based, with most individuals feeding on C-4 plants (65%). A substantial portion of individuals presented mixed diets (C-3 and C-4 plants), totaling 31% of the individuals, and few fed exclusively on C-3 plants (4%). Isotopic niche size also varied among populations in both environments, with low overlap considering their core dietary niche. Capybara populations in natural environments had substantial incorporation of C-3 resources, showing individuals with strictly C-3 diets, and possibly relying on a high diversity of food items, while some populations in anthropized ones fed exclusively on C-4 resources. Neither body mass, age class, sex, nor landscape composition significantly influenced isotopic values. Here, we provide evidence of the dietary plasticity of capybaras in different environments, transitioning from the consumption of C-4 to C-3 plants when needed, that is, from preferred to non-preferred food items. Together with the species' behavioral plasticity, our results help explain its resilience in surviving, and even thriving, in both natural and human-modified environments.

AB  - The increased prevalence of diseases in Tibetan pigs and yaks has significantly hampered the cultivation industry, leading to substantial socioeconomic losses and adversely affecting both Tibetan pig production and the livelihoods of surrounding nomads. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, relevant articles on epidemics affecting Tibetan pigs and yaks from 1990 to 2023 were collected from five databases: CNKI, Google, PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science. The study findings, covering the period 1990 to 2023, revealed that Tibetan pigs faced primarily challenges from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Swine flu, Cysticercus tenuicollis, , diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) and Enterococci. Zoonotic diseases such as Trichinosis, Swine flu, Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Toxoplasma gondii, , Cystic echinococcosis (CE), and Japanese encephalitis virus were prevalent in the Tibetan pig area. Meanwhile, the yaks experienced severe outbreaks caused by bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine rotavirus A (BRVA), Echinococcus granulosus, , Neosporosis IgM, Theileria spp. and Anaplasma spp., significantly impacting their quality of life. Primary risk factors for diseases in Tibetan pigs and yaks included age, housing conditions, frequency of deworming and vaccinations, and environmental factors on the plateaus. This review aims to improve regional breeding practices for Tibetan pigs and yaks by addressing these risk factors, thus reducing the prevalence of various diseases in the future. Achieving these objectives will not only elevate the local socioeconomic status, but also establish the Tibetan pig and yak industry as an independent and flourishing sector.

AB  - Expanding knowledge of the trophodynamic of ecosystems improves the understanding of energy flow and interactions formed in food webs; therefore, structural knowledge of food webs helps to understand the ecosystem dynamics. This study describes the marine trophic structure of the largest marine protected area (MPA) of the Colombian Pacific in Malpelo Island, using delta 13C and delta 15N. A total of 293 (38 groups/families) samples were collected and analyzed, being mostly represented by teleosts, followed by crustaceans, elasmobranchs, zooplankton, seabirds, and others functional groups. The marine isospace was between -21.5%o and - 10.0%o for delta 13C and between 4.6%o to 16.9%o in delta 15N. The Malpelo Island marine ecosystem showed a food web composed of five trophic levels (TLs): TL -I (primary producers), TL -II (herbivores), TL -III (primary carnivores), TL -IV (secondary carnivores), and TL -V (tertiary carnivores), along with three intermediate TLs (TLs II -III, III -IV, and IV -V). The isotopic diversity index showed global low values of uniqueness (IUni) (0-0.349), intermediate values of IRicGlobal, and IDisGlobal (0.350-0.640), and high values of IDivGlobal, and IEveGlobal (0.650-1). TLs reflected high trophic interaction indices as a result of multifunctionality (12 feeding mechanisms) and possible ontogenetic changes of organisms in this ecosystem. This study includes the first insights into the marine trophic structure of the Malpelo Island and indicate some functional aspects of the entities that inhabit this ecosystem. This study fill information gaps for the MPA and constitute an important tool to improve the elaboration of management and conservation measures based on the knowledge of the ecosystem function.

AB  - Whether, when, and how genetic diversity buffers individuals and populations against infectious disease risk is a critical and open question for understanding wildlife disease and zoonotic disease risk. Several, but not all, studies have found negative relationships between infection and heterozygosity in wildlife. Since they can host multiple zoonotic infections, we sampled a population of wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), sequenced their genomes, and examined their fecal samples for coccidia and nematode eggs. We analyzed coccidia infection status, abundance, and coinfection status in relation to per-locus and per-individual measures of heterozygosity, as well as identified SNPs associated with infection status. Since heterozygosity might affect host condition, and condition is known to affect immunity, it was included as a co-variate in the per-individual analyses and as response variable in relation to heterozygosity. Not only did coccidia-infected individuals have lower levels of genome-wide per-locus diversity across all metrics, but we found an inverse relationship between genomic diversity and severity of coccidia infection. We also found weaker evidence that coinfected individuals had lower levels of private allelic variation than all other groups. In the per-individual analyses, relationships between heterozygosity and infection were marginal but followed the same negative trends. Condition was negatively correlated with infection, but was not associated with heterozygosity, suggesting that effects of heterozygosity on infection were not mediated by host condition in this system. Association tests identified multiple loci involved in the inflammatory response, with a particular role for NF-kappa B signaling, supporting previous work on the genetic basis of coccidia resistance. Taken together, we find that increased genome-wide neutral diversity, the presence of specific genetic variants, and improved condition positively impact infection status. Our results underscore the importance of considering host genomic variation as a buffer against infection, especially in systems that can harbor zoonotic diseases.

AB  - An important symbolic and subsistence animal for many Native American Tribes, the moose (Alces alces; mos in Algonquin, Penobscot language) has been under consistent threat in the northeastern United States because of winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) parasitism over the past several decades, causing declines in moose populations throughout the region. This decline has raised concern for Tribes and agencies that are invested in moose. Given this concern, it is increasingly important to effectively monitor and develop strategies to manage winter ticks to address consistent population declines of moose due to winter ticks. The Penobscot Nation developed a novel strategy to sample questing winter ticks (i.e., ticks that are actively seeking hosts) using a plot-based sampling protocol that may be suitable for heterogeneous habitats. We deployed this protocol in the northeastern United States in 2022 during the tick questing period (Sep-Dec) on Penobscot Nation sovereign trust lands, the White Mountain National Forest and Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge, and western-central Massachusetts, USA. We analyzed the data using occupancy and N-mixture models. Detection probability peaked during mid-October and tick occupancy and abundance were greatest at sites with intermediate understory vegetation height. The sampling protocol was successful at sampling ticks in Massachusetts, where abundances were expected to be low, indicating that it may be useful for studies planning to monitor winter tick distribution and abundance in areas with sub-optimal moose habitat and where winter tick abundance is expected to be low. This approach may also benefit managers or researchers intending to monitor many species of hard ticks, and where imperfect detection is expected.

AB  - The development of animal husbandry directly affects climate change and the ecological environment. This study aims to explore the relationship between carbon emissions from animal husbandry and economic growth in Inner Mongolia and to provide theoretical and countermeasure support for sustainable development. Based on the environmental Kuznets theory, the present situation of animal husbandry and economic growth in this region is analyzed. By analyzing slaughter and storage data for cow, sheep, hog, and poultry from 2000 to 2022, we calculated carbon emissions using the IPCC coefficient method. The environmental Kuznets curve is used to control variables such as human capital, government intervention, openness, technological innovation, and environmental protection expenditure. The findings show that carbon emissions from cows and sheep have risen significantly over the past 23 years, while the hog industry has remained stable. Both the number of poultry farms and their carbon emissions have declined. Economic growth is one reason for the increase in carbon emissions, while government intervention and openness have had mixed results. To ensure sustainable development, Inner Mongolia should strengthen government supervision, increase investment in environmental protection, expand opening-up, improve rural education, and promote low-carbon growth.

AB  - Objective: Predicted impacts of climate change in the eastern United States are pervasive and complex, including increased precipitation, increased frequency of heavy precipitation events, and altered seasonality of rainfall. This will potentially lead to increased flooding frequency and severity. The River Chub Nocomis micropogon is an important keystone and engineer species in the eastern United States, primarily through its construction of nesting habitat, which is shared with other species ("nest associates") in a mutualistic relationship. River Chub nests are vulnerable to high flows caused by excessive precipitation and by urbanization of watersheds. Using predictions of climate change models, we examined the potential for increased River Chub nest disruption under two climate change scenarios.
   Methods: Published thresholds linking River Chub nest disruption with stream discharge were used to interpret fine-scale predictions of a downscaled climate prediction model (HadGEM2-ES) using a stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG6) calibrated to two climate change scenarios. This was examined for a case study watershed (Big Elk Creek, Maryland). The amount of River Chub nest disruption was compared between present-day stream discharge observations (1995-2021) and simulated data for 2061-2080 under the "worst case" (RCP85) and "probable-case" (RCP45) scenarios. Potential nest disruption in an urbanized stream that lost its River Chub (Gwynns Falls, Maryland) was also evaluated for comparison with Big Elk Creek scenarios.
   Result: Significantly elevated nest disruption under both RCP45 and RCP85 relative to observed current conditions was found under status quo watershed characteristics in the form of more disruptive events, more disrupted days, and shorter periods of disruption-free days during the River Chub nesting season. Potential nest disruption in the urbanized case study stream was far greater than that observed for any scenario.
   Conclusion: Increased nest disruption projected by the downscaled HadGEM2-ES climate prediction model was moderate and far below the level of nest disruption observed in flashy urbanized streams that have lost or may have lost River Chub populations in the region. The moderate impacts of increased flooding from climate change will interact with projected population growth and urbanization for the Big Elk Creek watershed. Mechanistic modeling of fine-scale processes by using stochastic weather generators shows promise for modeling the responses of ecosystems to changing conditions.

Yet, there is limited evidence regarding people's recognition of, and preferences and support for, Australian endangered wildlife. This paper presents survey responses from 223 Zoos Victoria visitors (response rate: 39.1 %) and 90 community members (Victoria, Australia). We examined people's top 10 overall (global) and Australian favourite animals, and conducted an in-depth exploration of recognition of, and preferences and support for, seven Australian endangered species identified as being at risk of extinction within the next decade, including: the leadbeater's possum (Gymnobe-lideus leadbeateri), eastern barred bandicoot (Perameles gunnii), helmeted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops cassidix), southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree), Lord Howe Island (LHI) stick insect (Dryococelus australis), Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), and the orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). Results indicate that the only Australian animals to feature in the overall top 10 favourite list were the kangaroo (ranked 9th for both sample groups) and koala (ranked 6th and 10th for the community and zoo sample, respectively). The Tasmanian devil had the highest rate of recognition (>86 %), in comparison to the remaining six species (1.2-7.3 % across both samples). Endangered species were not prominent in the top favourite Australian species. Australian endangered species' likeability ratings typically followed the pattern of mammals being most likeable (Tasmanian devil and leadbeater's possum), followed by birds, frogs, and insects (helmeted honeyeater, southern corroboree frog, and LHI stick insect). Importantly, for most endangered native species featured (4/7 and 6/7; zoo and community, respectively), simply being able to recognise species significantly (p <.05) increased peo-ple's willingness to support their conservation. Findings underscore several powerful opportunities for future conservation programs to contribute to Australian endangered species conservation by striving to increase public familiarity with Australian species most at risk of extinction.

AB  - Vegetation-free space, or "halos," surrounding habitat patches are visually striking spatial phenomena observed in various ecosystems. These halos are linked to the landscape of fear hypothesis, where risk-averse herbivores concentrate grazing near safe shelters within their habitat. We develop theory demonstrating how habitat distribution shapes trophic interactions, leading to alternative stable states in spatial patterns. Using coral reefs as a model system, we investigate the relationship between halo patterns and predator populations. Specifically, we address the inconsistency between theoretical predictions and empirical observations, where halos are absent in some protected reefs and their sizes are uncorrelated with predator abundance. Our findings reveal that long-term coral distribution patterns influence trophic interactions, supporting the landscape of fear hypothesis. When coral patches are dispersed, herbivore shelter from predators is more evenly distributed across the seascape, facilitating overgrazing and halo oscillation. When coral patches are clustered, limited shelter stabilizes halos, but reduced herbivore limitation can also drive critical transitions to cycles with low vegetation that are difficult to reverse. Discordance between theory and observations may therefore arise from differences in underlying spatial shelter distribution, with broad implications for how landscapes of fear emerge from patchy ecosystems to signal resilience.

AB  - Caterpillars (larval Lepidoptera) are an essential link in trophic networks of forest ecosystems, as they serve as herbivores of vegetation and a food source for many organisms. Phenological mismatches between caterpillars, host plants, or predators may have negative effects across multiple trophic levels. Seasonal timing of caterpillar emergence and peak occurrence may be impacted by climate change, however, studying caterpillar phenology at broad spatial scales is challenging due to lack of data availability. Here, we examine two sources of caterpillar observations, opportunistic records from iNaturalist and structured surveys of forest caterpillars, and compare whether phenology patterns in these datasets are consistent across larval datasets and with more numerous records of adult butterflies. Despite substantial taxonomic differences between these three datasets, we found concurrence in patterns of early and late years in spring onset between datasets. However, the datasets do differ in how well they capture phenological responses to warmer spring temperatures. More data -rich iNaturalist caterpillar and adult butterfly records may provide a reasonable proxy of interannual deviations in forest caterpillars, however, expansions in structured survey efforts are needed to capture changing patterns in other ecologically important measures such as abundance and biomass.

AB  - The Barents Sea, as the largest Arctic shelf region with high productivity, supports vital commercial fisheries. The region's ecosystem is significantly impacted by both warm Atlantic Water (AW) and cold Arctic Water (ARW), resulting in frontal zones that delineate differing water masses. Zooplankton populations serve as the primary link between primary producers and higher trophic levels. To evaluate the potential influence of frontal zones on copepods, we conducted a summer survey focusing on sites where diverse water masses interacted. Our findings revealed that species richness, diversity, biomass, and daily production of common copepods were highest in the Polar Front, separating AW and ARW, as well as in the eastern frontal zones (Barents Sea Water and Novaya Zemlya Coastal Water). Herbivorous copepods, such as Calanus spp. and Pseudocalanus spp., dominated in terms of total copepod biomass and production, whereas the small omnivore Oithona similis prevailed by abundance. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correspondence between frontal zones and copepod assemblages. The primary factors explaining spatial variations in copepod biomass and production included the geographic positions of sampling stations, depth, and chlorophyll a concentration. Our research underscores the significance of oceanographic fronts as zones of critical importance for overall pelagic productivity in Arctic regions.

AB  - Convergent evolution provides powerful opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits. The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) and Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) belong to different subfamilies in Bovidae, but both have evolved similar superfine cashmere characteristics to meet the cold temperature in plateau environments. The cashmere traits of cashmere goats underwent strong artificial selection, and some traces of domestication also remained in the genome. Hence, we investigated the convergent genomic signatures of cashmere traits between natural and artificial selection. We compared the patterns of convergent molecular evolution between Tibetan antelope and Siberian ibex by testing positively selected genes, rapidly evolving genes and convergent amino acid substitutions. In addition, we analyzed the selected genomic features of cashmere goats under artificial selection using whole-genome resequencing data, and skin transcriptome data of cashmere goats were also used to focus on the genes involved in regulating cashmere traits. We found that molecular convergent events were very rare, but natural and artificial selection genes were convergent enriched in similar functional pathways (e.g., ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) in a variety of gene sets. Type IV collagen family genes (COL4A2, COL4A4, COL4A5, COL6A5, COL6A6) and integrin family genes (ITGA2, ITGA4, ITGA9, ITGB8) may be important candidate genes for cashmere formation and development. Our results provide a comprehensive approach and perspective for exploring cashmere traits and offer a valuable reference for subsequent in-depth research on the molecular mechanisms regulating cashmere development and fineness.

AB  - The small tree, Dichrostachys cinerea, occurs in dense patches within grasslands on gabbro-derived soils in the southern Kruger National Park. It is not known whether soil properties in the grasslands affect tree establishment. As a first step in identifying soil properties potentially underpinning differences in vegetation structure, we analysed the soil chemistry of the pedoderm (0-2 cm) in Dichrostachys patches and adjacent open grassland. Relative to the Dichrostachys patches, the pedoderm of the grassland was significantly richer in K (1.4-fold), Ca (2.6-fold), Mg (3.4-fold), Mn (1.7-fold), B (1.2-fold) and Na (1.6-fold). The pH of the grassland was also higher than in the Dichrostachys patches (6.45 +/- 0.14 vs 5.53 +/- 0.09). It is unlikely that the vigour of tree seedlings, tree ramets or grasses in the Dichrostachys patches would be constrained by the concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Mn, B and Na, or the pH, at the study site. Greater concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Mn, B and Na in the pedoderm of the grassland are, however, likely to be linked to relatively greater nutritive value of the grass sward and in turn greater herbivory pressure. This effect is a potential cause of the greater constraint of D. cinerea seedlings and/or ramets in the grassland than in the Dichrostachys patches.

AB  - Variation in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) mortality during winter affects population growth in cold climates. Across the northern extent of their range, mortality increases with colder temperatures and snow. Few studies have examined the relationships between winter conditions and deer mortality, and no studies have concurrently studied this relationship for different ages of deer across multiple years and landscapes. We used recently developed cause-specific mortality models to evaluate temporal and age-class variation in deer mortality in farmland areas and compared to published results from forest areas in Wisconsin, USA, from 2011-2014. We then used temporally varying snow and temperature covariates to predict mortality trends using telemetry information from 860 deer. Cause-specific mortality in the farmland varied by age and year, similar to results from previous research in the forest. Human-related mortality was the leading cause of mortality in the farmland during most years and ranged from 4.3% to 10.3% for juveniles and 3.6% to 9.1% for adults from 2011-2014. Very little predation occurred in the farmland, and this differed from previous research in the forest where predation was the leading cause of mortality. During more severe winters (2013 and 2014), other mortality, usually associated with starvation, was the leading cause of mortality for juveniles in the farmland but not adults. In the forest, we found support for saturating effects of accumulated snow depth days >30.5 cm and accumulated temperature days >0 degrees C on mortality. We also found support for the relationship of mortality with accumulated temperature days >0 degrees C in the farmland but no relationship with snow depth. Deer tolerate sustained cold temperatures, but the timing of winter to spring transition is more important for deer survival in both forested and agricultural areas. In the absence of empirical survival information, managers can use our model to predict annual winter effects on deer survival, which can provide improved inference compared to traditional winter severity indices. Our results suggest changes in predator abundance may have minor influence on overwinter survival compared to winter weather. Based on mortality estimates from previous research, the highest predation rates on juvenile deer in the forest occurred when wolf (Canis lupus) counts were lowest and when wolf abundance was highest, juvenile deer predation rates were lowest.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to disrupt species interactions across global ecosystems. Ectotherm-endotherm interactions may be especially prone to this risk due to the possible mismatch between the species in physiological response and performance. However, few studies have examined how changing temperatures might differentially impact species' niches or available suitable habitat when they have very different modes of thermoregulation. An ideal system for studying this interaction is the predator-prey system. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to characterize the niche overlap and examine biogeography in past and future climate conditions of prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis) and Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii), an endotherm-ectotherm pair typifying a predator-prey species interaction. Our models show a high niche overlap between these two species (D = 0.863 and I = 0.979) and further affirm similar paleoecological distributions during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and mid-Holocene (MH). Under future climate change scenarios, we found that prairie rattlesnakes may experience a reduction in overall suitable habitat (RCP 2.6 = -1.82%, 4.5 = -4.62%, 8.5 = -7.34%), whereas Ord's kangaroo rats may experience an increase (RCP 2.6 = 9.8%, 4.5 = 11.71%, 8.5 = 8.37%). We found a shared trend of stable suitable habitat at northern latitudes but reduced suitability in southern portions of the range, and we propose future monitoring and conservation be focused on those areas. Overall, we demonstrate a biogeographic example of how interacting ectotherm-endotherm species may have mismatched responses under climate change scenarios and the models presented here can serve as a starting point for further investigation into the biogeography of these systems.

As temperatures rise, there is potentially greater risk of disruption in these systems due to a differing physiological response to changing conditions.image

AB  - Twenty years of monitoring data are assessed for trends in abundance of running buffalo clover (Trifolium stoloniferum), an endangered species found on the Fernow Experimental Forest in northeastern West Virginia, where the clover is found under various forest management intensities. Monitored locations were grouped for analysis into sites with common disturbance histories. Of the 13 sites, about half (46%, six sites) were found to have statistically significant trends between numbers of rooted crowns and time. Three out of eight sites with recent and sustained periodic disturbance showed a significant association between time and running buffalo clover counts and the trend is positive. Of the sites with no management or no recent harvest activity, three were found to have negative trends of running buffalo clover counts over time, although at only one site was this statistically significant. This analysis of monitoring data gives some support for previous findings that the number of running buffalo clover rooted crowns is tied to disturbance on the skid roads and increased light conditions created by periodic harvesting.

AB  - Insect herbivores and their parasitoids play a crucial role in terrestrial trophic interactions in tropical forests. These interactions occur across the entire vertical gradient of the forest. This study compares how caterpillar communities, and their parasitism rates, vary across vertical strata and between caterpillar defensive strategies in a semi deciduous tropical forest in Nditam, Cameroon. Within a 0.1 ha plot, all trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were felled and systematically searched for caterpillars. We divided the entire vertical gradient of the forest into eight, five-metre strata. All caterpillars were assigned to a stratum based on their collection height, reared, identified, and classified into one of three defensive traits: aposematic, cryptic and shelter-building. Caterpillar species richness and diversity showed a midstory peak, whereas density followed the opposite pattern, decreasing in the midstory and then increasing towards the highest strata. This trend was driven by some highly dense shelter-building caterpillars in the upper canopy. Specialisation indices indicated decreasing levels of caterpillar generality with increasing height, a midstory peak in vulnerability, and increasing connectance towards the upper canopy, although the latter was likely driven by decreasing network size. Both aposematic and shelter-building caterpillars had significantly higher parasitism rates than cryptic caterpillars. Our results highlight nuanced changes in caterpillar communities across forest strata and provide evidence that defences strategies are important indicators of parasitism rates in caterpillars and that both aposematic and shelter-building caterpillars could be considered a "safe haven" for parasitoids.

AB  - We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), DeerLandscapeDisease (DLD), to investigate the effects of landscape structure, disease transmission, and management alternatives on dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We fitted biased random walk models to data from GPS-collared deer to simulate movements of individual deer and deer groups in an agricultural landscape with fragmented forest patches and a forest-dominated landscape. We estimated behavioral and demographic parameters from field data and published literature of deer ecology. We considered both direct and indirect transmission routes and assumed that bioavailability of infectious pathogens deposited in the environment decreased exponentially over time. We tuned transmission parameters to match observed trajectories of CWD prevalence in Wisconsin, and assumed that infection probability during an encounter was equal for all age classes. Thus, infection prevalence varied with sex-and age-specific behavior.DLD simulations demonstrated significant effects of landscape structure, social behavior and transmission mode on temporal changes in prevalence. Prevalence rose faster and reached higher levels in fragmented forest landscapes due to aggregation of deer within small forest patches. Furthermore, simulation results suggested that CWD might be driven through a mix of frequency-and density-dependent processes, potentially facilitating coexistence of CWD and deer populations. These results demonstrate the utility of ABMs and the importance of including spatial and behavioral heterogeneity when modeling disease transmission.

AB  - Leaf shelters function as microclimatic refuges, reducing arthropod exposure to climatic fluctuations of surrounding habitats. Although facilitation is expected to increase under stressful conditions, empirical studies investigating the patterns of variation and magnitude of effects of ecosystem engineering (EE) at different spatial and temporal scales are still scarce. In this study, we evaluated the facilitation consequences of leaf shelter created by gall-inducers on arthropod communities of Miconia ligustroides (DC.) Naudin (Melastomataceae). We evaluated how such effects change at the leaf and plant levels in a habitat subject to strong climatic seasonality. The presence of leaf shelters on M. ligustroides increased arthropod diversity and biomass, modified the species composition at both the leaf and plant levels, during wet and dry seasons. However, the addition of artificial leaf shelters during the dry season showed greater abundance, richness, and biomass of arthropods when compared to shelters added during the wet season. Regarding the global effects of artificial leaf shelters on the diversity of arthropods associated with M. ligustroides, the dry season showed strong and positive effects, increasing the abundance, richness, and biomass of arthropods by an average of 65% for both years. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the patterns of variation and magnitude of EE at different spatial and temporal scales and provides new insights into the importance of shelters for aridity-sensitive species.

AB  - Simple Summary Thai indigenous pigs (TIPs) have long been associated with the socioeconomics of Thailand's rural communities. They have been raised mainly in three different geographic regions of Thailand: north, northeast, and south. Most of the pigs have a black coat color. However, their genotypes have not been clarified. It is important to understand the genetic background to find an appropriate strategy for sustainable breeding and conservation. The TIPs from the three regions were genetically characterized in comparison. Overall, the TIPs showed a high diversity of microsatellite alleles. They differed significantly from European and Chinese breeds. However, the TIPs are at risk of genetic erosion and are losing genetic diversity due to the integration of local wide boars and the lack of a breeding plan. An appropriate breeding program for Thai pig populations is urgently needed to maintain these indigenous pig populations. Thai indigenous pigs (TIPs) are important genetic resources. Crosses with exotic pig breeds and wild boars may cause genetic losses. To date, the physical characteristics of TIPs have been inconsistent. The classification of TIPs by genetic information is needed to pursue an appropriate conservation program. In this study, the genetic diversity, cluster analysis, and phylogenetic relationship of TIPs were investigated using twenty-nine pig microsatellite markers. Blood samples were collected from TIPs from three regions of Thailand: north (NT, n = 118), northeast (NE, n = 61), and south (ST, n = 75). The mean total number of distinct alleles and the effective number of alleles per locus were 11.851 and 5.497, respectively. The mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) and mean expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.562 and 0.837, respectively. The F values of the microsatellite loci were positive under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium at p < 0.001, with overall mean values of Fis, Fit, and Fst of 0.247, 0.281, and 0.046, respectively. A total of 5, 5, and 17 private alleles were found at frequencies greater than 0.050 in the NT, NE, and ST pigs, respectively. Three optimal clusters (K = 3) were proposed within the TIP populations. Pigs from the NT and NE regions were mixed in two clusters, while members of the ST region were clearly separated. The phylogenetic tree confirmed that the pigs from NT and NE were each divided into two subgroups, while the pigs from ST were clustered into one group. A microsatellite analysis revealed the high genetic diversity of the TIP populations and confirmed the genetic divergence of the TIPs from the European and Chinese breeds. A genetic admixture of the TIP with the local wild boars was detected.

AB  - Plants evolve diverse communication systems in adapting to complex and variable environments. Here, we examined the relationship between plant architecture, population density and inter-plant communication within tree species. We tested the hypothesis that trees of species with complex architecture or high population density (high population density: HPD) communicate among conspecifics via volatiles. In addition, we hypothesize that states of mycorrhizal symbiosis (arbuscular mycorrhizal or ectomycorrhiza) which relation to population density can predict the development of interplant communication in trees. We tested induced defense as an indicator of communication in saplings of nine tree species with various complexities of architecture (number of leaves per shoot) and either low (low population density: LPD) or HPD, either exposed for 10 days to volatiles from a damaged conspecific or not exposed. We evaluated the number of insect-damaged leaves and the area of leaf damage on these trees after 1 and 2 months in the field. Most exposed HPD trees had less leaf damage than controls. However, LPD trees did not differ in leaf damage between treatments. These results are partially supported by plant hormone analysis. In addition, the presence of inter-plant communication was positively correlated with both the number of leaves per shoot (complexity of plant architecture) and population density. The analysis which combined results of previous studies suggests that states of mycorrhizal symbiosis predict the development of interplant communication; interplant communication is common in ectomycorrhiza species. These results suggest the importance of plant architecture and population density as well as state of mycorrhizal symbiosis in the development of interplant communications within tree species.

AB  - As communities assemble, species establishment can be driven by multiple factors. Two such factors, nutrients and consumers, are predicted to interact, but few studies have explored whether this interaction results from synergistically altering the same biotic and abiotic mediators or complementarily altering different mediators.To test this, I added seeds of multiple native species to old field communities in which I experimentally manipulated soil nutrients, leaf litter and consumers (insect herbivores and fungal pathogens). Using Bayesian hierarchical modelling, I evaluated the degree to which changes in light and water availability, fungal disease and insect herbivory, and community functional composition influenced seedling establishment and the richness of colonizing species and were driven by experimental treatments. I then examined whether nutrients, litter and consumers interactively determined the success of colonizing species with different resource allocation strategies.Contrary to expectation, nutrient addition and consumer exclusion reduced, and litter removal increased, seedling establishment and colonizer richness independently and via different pathways. Also contrary to expectation, seedling resource allocation strategy did not interact with nutrient addition and consumer exclusion to alter establishment success. Rather, as community damage (foliar fungal disease + insect herbivory) increased, seedlings with high % leaf nitrogen (a proxy for an acquisitive resource allocation strategy) become increasingly disadvantaged relative to seedlings with low % leaf nitrogen (a proxy for a conservative resource allocation strategy).Synthesis: These results indicate that seedling establishment is unlikely to be interactively impacted by nutrients and consumers (fungal pathogens + insect herbivores) because these two drivers act on different environmental pathways to influence community assembly.
   Nutrients and consumers are important drivers of plant community assembly, which are often predicted to act synergistically. In this study, nutrients and consumers acted independently of one another to alter the success of native seedlings. This may have occurred because nutrient addition primarily impacted the availability of other resources, like light and water, while consumer exclusion primarily impacted biotic interactions, like disease and herbivory. Better understanding context-dependence in community assembly will be important for predicting community responses to global change.image

AB  - Sexual differences in foraging behaviour of African elephant are comparatively well studied. However, the behaviour is known to vary between savannas due to differences in plant and herbivory communities which determine the level of forage selection and competitions. The sexual variation in foraging behaviour is attributed by sexual dimorphism, where male elephants are larger than females. The different body sizes result in divergent foraging strategies due to the differential scaling coefficients of metabolism and gut size, where the larger bodied individuals can tolerate greater quantities of low-quality forage. We studied the foraging behaviour of male and female elephants in Serengeti National Park, a nutrient-rich savanna in Tanzania, based on the forage selection and the scramble competition hypotheses. Data were collected for 2 months in 2014 by driving in road transects and make visual observations of browsing elephants within 50 m from the road. We recorded the number of bites taken per tree, parts of the tree browsed, browsing height, and tree species. Females targeted a wider range of wood species, browsing at lower heights compared to males. The sexes had a comparable length of browsing bouts, spending an average of 4 min per tree. The results support the scramble competition hypothesis through the feeding height stratification and the forage selection hypothesis through the higher diversity of tree species utilised by females. We suggest that sexual differences in forage requirements interact with forage quality and competing herbivore communities in shaping the foraging behaviour of elephants.

AB  - Restoration of native shrub species is challenging but direly needed in arid and semiarid rangelands globally as native shrubs provide critical habitat for wildlife and livestock forage. Restoration of antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata Pursh DC), a wildlife-important shrub, is often a priority on western US rangelands. One challenge to bitterbrush restoration is competitive exotic annual grasses. Exotic annual grasses can be successfully controlled with pre-emergent herbicides, but the effects of controlling exotic annual grasses with pre-emergent herbicides on bitterbrush survival and growth are unknown. We evaluated the effects of applying a pre-emergent herbicide, imazapic, to control exotic annual grasses on planted bitterbrush seedlings and existing vegetation for 2 yr post treatment at five sites in southeastern Oregon. Imazapic application reduced exotic annual grass cover and density but did not improve bitterbrush establishment. Exotic annual grass control did lead to an increase in native perennial bunchgrass cover. We suspect the lack of treatment effect was caused by high mortality of bitterbrush seedlings from drought in the first year. By the second year, bitterbrush was largely lost across the study sites with only four individuals surviving. The high bitterbrush seedling mortality observed in this study highlights that multiple barriers to restoration success likely exist in arid and semiarid rangelands. For successful restoration, land managers and restoration practitioners need to have a plan and resources for overcoming multiple barriers, which may require several restoration attempts should initial attempts be unsuccessful.

AB  - Tidal stream environments exhibit fast current flows and unique turbulent features occurring at fine spatio-temporal scales (metres and seconds). There is now global recognition of the importance of tidal stream environments for marine megafauna. Such areas are also key to the development of marine renewable energy due to the reliable and predictable nature of tidally driven flows. Bed-derived turbulent features, such as kolk-boils, transport organic material to the surface and may increase the availability of prey species (fish) for foraging marine megafauna (seabirds and marine mammals). Quantification of animal association and interactions with turbulent features is required to understand potential environmental impacts of tidal energy developments in these sites. Downward-facing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was collected within the Pentland Firth, UK. Resulting imagery was used to quantify the density distribution of pursuit-diving seabirds, called auks (of the family Alcidae), distribution in comparison relation to concurrent surface imagery of kolk-boils and, analyse evaluate spatial relationships with individual kolk-boil features, and quantify body orientation relative to the water flow. Although variability was present, auk density distribution was generally correlated with that of kolk-boils throughout the study area; however, spatial analysis highlighted an overall trend of finer-scale dispersion between individual auks and kolk-boils. Auk orientation on the surface was primarily observed across the flow throughout ebb and flood tidal phases. These results suggest that auks may be associating with kolk-boil peripheries. Similarly, it may be energetically beneficial to orientate across the flow while maintaining observation of current flow or searching for shallow prey species and potential threats in the environment. This work demonstrates that UAV imagery was appropriate for quantification of fine-scale biophysical interactions. It allowed for concurrent measurement of hydrodynamic and predator metrics in a challenging environment and provided novel insights not possible to collect by conventional survey methodology. This technique can increase the evidence base for assessment of potential impacts of marine renewable energy extraction on key marine species.

AB  - Monitoring ground layer biomass, and therefore forage availability, is important for managing large, vertebrate herbivore populations for conservation. Remote sensing allows for frequent observations over broad spatial scales, capturing changes in biomass over the landscape and through time. In this study, we explored different satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) for their utility in estimating understorey biomass in semi-arid woodlands of south-eastern Australia. Relationships between VIs and understorey biomass data have not been established in these particular semi-arid communities. Managers want to use forage availability to inform cull targets for western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus), to minimise the risk that browsing poses to regeneration in threatened woodland communities when grass biomass is low. We attempted to develop relationships between VIs and understorey biomass data collected over seven seasons across open and wooded vegetation types. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to describe relationships between understorey biomass and VIs. Total understorey biomass (live and dead, all growth forms) was best described using the Tasselled Cap (TC) greenness index. The combined TC brightness and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) ranked best for live understorey biomass (all growth forms), and grass (live and dead) biomass was best described by a combination of TC brightness and greenness indices. Models performed best for grass biomass, explaining 70% of variation in external validation when predicting to the same sites in a new season. However, we found empirical relationships were not transferrable to data collected from new sites. Including other variables (soil moisture, tree cover, and dominant understorey growth form) improved model performance when predicting to new sites. Anticipating a drop in forage availability is critical for the management of grazing pressure for woodland regeneration, however, predicting understorey biomass through space and time is a challenge. Whilst remotely sensed VIs are promising as an easily-available source of vegetation information, additional landscape-scale data are required before they can be considered a cost-efficient method of understorey biomass estimation in this semi-arid landscape.

AB  - Reintroducing apex predators is an important approach in ecosystem restoration; however, it is challenging. Wolves (Canis lupus) were exterminated in Japan around 1900, and since then, there has been a lack of top predators throughout the country. Currently, the wild ungulate population is increasing, causing agricultural and forest damage. This has triggered an ongoing debate among researchers and nongovernmental organizations on whether wolves should be reintroduced to promote self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems. We conducted a nationwide survey to examine public attitudes toward wolf reintroduction (WR) in Japan. We sent online questionnaires to 88,318 citizens across the country. Among the 12,028 respondents, excluding those with invalid or incomplete answers and unqualified respondents, we obtained and analyzed 7500 responses that were representative of Japanese citizens in terms of some key sociodemographic attributes. More respondents disagreed with WR (39.9%) than agreed (17.1%), and many respondents (43.0%) were undecided. Structural equation modeling revealed that risk perceptions affected public attitudes, implying that the greater the perceived threat of wolf attacks, the less likely people are to support WR. In contrast, attitudes toward wolves (e.g., "I like wolves.") influenced by wildlife value orientation and beliefs about the ecological role of wolves (e.g., controlling deer populations) positively affected public attitudes toward WR. Those who had a positive attitude toward WR showed intentions to engage in behaviors that support WR. Our results suggest that the dissemination of information related to the ecological role of wolves and the development of a more mutualistic mindset in people could positively influence public support for WR in Japan.

AB  - Fire ants (Solenopsis spp.) have increasingly been reported from carrion in the southeastern United States and are now a part of the normal succession community. There have been previous observations of these ants altering carrion and preying on other carrion-attendant fauna; however, the overall effects of these activities on carrion decomposition rates, community composition, and blow fly larval development are poorly understood. Alteration of these ecological processes by fire ants could affect the forensic interpretation of entomological data. We conducted a study in Mississippi and Florida whereby portions of the succession fauna were excluded from access to pig carrion to study the relative effects of fire ants and blow flies on carrion decomposition and succession: a control with all fauna having access, a second treatment where fire ants and other geophilic taxa were excluded, and a third treatment in which blow flies and other large organisms were excluded. Fire ants inflicted lesions in the carrion, buried portions that touched the ground, and preyed on some members of the succession fauna. Their exclusion did not affect carrion decomposition rates that were measured but slightly affected the overall carrion community, and strongly affected the oviposition and development of blow flies. Despite the presence of fire ants early in the control, blow flies were eventually able to overcome predation of eggs and larvae, continue colonization, and complete development; however, the delay in the colonization of blow flies on carrion could affect the determination of postmortem intervals when development rates of blow flies are considered in the calculation.

AB  - The admixture of domestic pig into French wild boar populations has been monitored since the 1980s thanks to the existence of a cytogenetic difference between the two sub-species. The number of chromosomes is 2n = 36 in wild boar and 2n = 38 in pig, respectively. This difference makes it possible to assign the "hybrid" status to wild boar individuals controlled with 37 or 38 chromosomes. However, it does not make it possible to determine the timing of the hybridization(s), nor to guarantee the absence of domestic admixture in an animal with 2n = 36 chromosomes. In order to analyze hybridization in greater detail and to avoid the inherent limitations of the cytogenetic approach, 362 wild boars (WB) recently collected in different French geographical areas and in different environments (farms, free ranging in protected or unprotected areas, animals with 2n = 36, 37 or 38 chromosomes) were genotyped on a 70K SNP chip. Principal component analyses allowed the identification of 13 "outliers" (3.6%), for which the proportion of the genome of "domestic" origin was greater than 40% (Admixture analyses). These animals were probably recent hybrids, having Asian domestic pig ancestry for most of them. For the remaining 349 animals studied, the proportion of the genome of "wild" origin varied between 83% and 100% (median: 94%). This proportion varied significantly depending on how the wild boar populations were managed. Local ancestry analyses revealed adaptive introgression from domestic pig, suggesting a critical role of genetic admixture in improving the fitness and population growth of WB. Overall, our results show that the methods used to monitor the domestic genetic contributions to wild boar populations should evolve in order to limit the level of admixture between the two gene pools.

AB  - Aim: Research on population genetic patterns and potential distribution dynamics can provide insights into the development of pest management strategies. Herein, we integrated population genetic analyses with the climatic niche approach to investigate spatial population genetic variations and potential geographical distribution (PGD) of the herbivorous pest Phytomyza horticola. We also analysed its population response patterns to both late Pleistocene climatic events and future climate change.Location: China.Methods: We analysed the patterns of genetic diversity distribution in 29 populations from 19 regions across China using three mitochondrial (COI, COII and Cytb) genes as markers. We estimated demographic histories using neutrality tests, mismatch distributions and Bayesian skyline plots. Changes in PGD were assessed using an ecological niche model.Results: High genetic diversity was found in most populations, and the northern population exhibited higher haplotype diversity. The population genetic structure included the Tibet lineage and a large lineage comprising the remaining populations. Demographic analyses indicated that rapid population expansion occurred during the cold Last Glacial Maximum. In addition, our projections suggested that P. horticola currently has a vast PGD in China, for which the human influence index was the strongest variable. Large areas of cold northern regions were highly suitable for its survival. Under future global warming, highly suitable habitats will shift towards the higher latitudes.Main conclusions: P. horticola is widely distributed across varied environments, which may be attributed to its high degree of genetic variation. Human activities likely facilitated the current PGD and the frequent gene flow that homogenized differentiation among most populations. In addition, P. horticola exhibits strong adaptability to cold climates and environments from the past to the future. Considering future climatic changes, prevention and control should focus on high-latitude regions, and vigilance regarding human-mediated pest dispersals and outbreaks should be maintained.

AB  - Background and aimsAgroecology practices can induce profound positive changes in soil physical and chemical properties, and inevitably influence soil biological properties and soil functioning. However, we still lack understanding of how soil biodiversity responds to agroecology practices and to what extent such practices, alone or combined, can be beneficial for soil functioning and ecosystem services. Understanding soil biological activities under different agroecology practices is important for predicting carbon cycling in agroecosystems.MethodsBy taking advantage of a long-term agricultural experimental research station in northern France, we monitored soil microbes, nematodes and soil respiration over three to five years in response to agroecology practices that varied in the rate of nitrogen (N) fertilization (low vs high), the tillage type (deep vs reduced), and the crop residue management (retain vs removal).ResultsShifting from conventional to agroecology practices had a strong effect on microbial biomass, nematode community and soil respiration. Specifically, reduced N and reduced tillage significantly increased microbial biomass carbon, bacterivore and fungivore density. Perennial biomass crop significantly decreased total nematode density and herbivore density, but increased microbial biomass carbon. Perennial biomass crop also significantly increased the structure and maturity index, but decreased the plant parasite index. Structural equation modelling showed that microbial biomass carbon had a positive correlation with soil respiration in reduced nitrogen, reduced tillage, and residue removal treatments. Bacterivores had a positive correlation with omnivores/predators and soil respiration, while herbivores had a negative correlation with soil respiration in all the treatments.ConclusionsThe different agroecological practices tested in this 5-year trial revealed the resilience of nematode communities and associated functions like CO2 respiration according to practices.

AB  - Mineral and organic fertilizers as well as microbial inoculations are crucial to maintain and to improve soil health and quality, ecosystem functions, and fruit yield in Camellia oleifera plantations. However, how these fertilizers shape the life strategies and functions of microbial communities in soil is unclear. Here, we conducted a one-year field experiment with three types of fertilizers: mineral (NPK), manure (Man), and microbial (MicrF), and analyzed soil properties, bacterial and fungal communities to assess microbial life strategies, functional traits and their determinants. The application of MicrF strongly increased the diversity of both soil bacterial (by 6.4%) and fungal communities (by 23%). Organic matter inputs from Man and MicrF had greater effects on the life strategies of bacteria than fungi: the dominant r-strategy bacteria (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria) increased with Man and MicrF, but K-strategists (Acidobacteria) decreased. Conversely, the abundance of rstrategy fungi (Ascomycota) decreased, but that of K-fungi (Basidiomycota) increased. Predictions of the functions indicated that microbial fertilization accelerated the bacterial carbohydrates, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, while also increasing the prevalence of wood saprotrophic fungi. The changes in the taxonomic and functional characteristics of the microbial communities induced priming effects by co-metabolism, which were mainly regulated by contents of soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and ammonium nitrogen, as well as carbon to nitrogen ratio. The application of MicrF is an effective approach to increase the diversity and multi- functionality of soil microbial communities in Camellia oleifera plantations, including organic matter decomposition, carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These findings provide valuable insights into the fertilizer regimes based on microbial ecological strategies and functional profiles in Camellia oleifera plantations.

AB  - Tree-dwelling hair lichens in the genus Bryoria provide crucial late-winter forage for Deep-Snow Mountain Caribou (DSC), an imperiled ungulate endemic to south-central British Columbia, Canada. Because DSC survival requires continuous access to heavy hair lichen loadings, conservation efforts can benefit from an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to such loadings. Here we quantify the relation of Bryoria abundance to stand spacing by testing an "Angle-To-Canopy-Skyline" (ATCS) protocol as a measure of stand openness and a proxy for ventilation. Fieldwork conducted in 60-year-old conifer forests on a 250-m conical volcano within the range of DSC yielded three principal findings: (1) Bryoria abundance strongly increases with increasing stand openness; (2) Pinus contorta supports much heavier Bryoria loadings than other local host trees; and (3) ATCS is a powerful predictor of arboreal hair lichen abundance in general across a wide range of environmental settings, but does not predict the abundance of foliose lichens. We suggest that canopy openness, at least within the range of DSC, complements stand age as a key factor in the development of heavy Bryoria loadings, consistent with the hypothesis that Bryoria benefits from rapid drying after rain. The possibility that anomalously high Bryoria abundance on Pinus may hold promise for accelerated DSC habitat restoration following clearcut logging is explored but rejected.

AB  - Invasive insects facilitate secondary invasive species by altering forest structure and function. Specifically, invasive insect herbivores may promote the establishment and growth of invasive plants by creating canopy gaps. Such secondary invasions may be influenced by ecological integrity - the degree to which ecosystem composition, structure, and function deviate from their natural or historical range of variation. Here we investigate (i) whether emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) induced ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality facilitates European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) - an invasive, shade-tolerant shrub, and (ii) the role of ecological integrity in this relationship. We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to calculate an index of ecological integrity and a zero-altered negative binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to describe European buckthorn occurrence and abundance. European buckthorn occurrence is influenced by canopy gaps, independent of EAB-induced gap formation. Ecological integrity and EAB-induced ash mortality interact to control European buckthorn abundance, with high ecological integrity limiting EAB-facilitated buckthorn invasion. This is the first evidence for EAB-facilitated buckthorn invasion and for an interaction between a secondary invasion and ecological integrity. Thus, ecological integrity plays an important role in the EAB-buckthorn system and may be used to manage the impacts of secondary invasions.

AB  - Olfaction in vertebrates plays pivotal parts in many aspects, such as localizing prey or food, mating behavior, avoiding predators, and social communication. Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only Bos species that can thrive in high-altitude areas. In view of the critical role of olfactory receptors (ORs) in the specific recognition of diverse stimuli, investigating the evolutionary dynamics of ORs in the yak means a lot. In this study, we used the chromosome-level genome of the yak to identify the ORs genes and discussed the effects of high altitude on the yak's olfaction by comparing the yak with other low-altitude living Bos species (Bos frontalis (gayal), Bos gaurus (gaur), Bos indicus (zebu) and Bos taurus (cattle)). The yak had 400 OR genes, including 264 functional genes, 16 partial genes and 120 OR pseudo genes. There were 387 OR genes mapped to yak 31 chromosomes, and chro-mosomes 13 and 8 had the most OR genes and functional OR genes. Among these five Bos species, yak had the least number of OR gene subfamilies, OR genes and functional OR genes, while the total number of OR genes in gayal (n = 784) was almost twice as many as that of yak, indicating that the olfaction of yak may be less developed. In addition, the phylogenetic relationships of the functional Bos OR genes were illustrated, which comprised 79 families and 466 subfamilies distributed in two classes (Class I and Class II). There were 76 OR gene subfamilies shared by these five Bos species and 17 OR gene subfamilies were unique to the yak. The potential odor specificity of 44 yak OR genes was identified through the similarity to human OR protein se-quences. Remarkably, yak lacks beta-ionone and Isovaleric acid(IVA)-related ORs, which may be related to the decline of high-altitude herbaceous plant diversity and underdeveloped yak sweat glands. The conserved motifs of OR genes were highly conserved in Bos species. These results provided a solid foundation for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of the yak's adaptation to the high-altitude environment in olfaction.

AB  - Evolution should favour plasticity in dispersal decisions in response to spatial heterogeneity in social and environmental contexts. Sex differences in individual optimization of dispersal decisions are poorly documented in mammals, because species where both sexes commonly disperse are rare. To elucidate the sex-specific drivers governing dispersal, we investigated sex differences in condition dependence in the propensity and distance of natal dispersal in one such species, the roe deer, using fine-scale monitoring of 146 GPS-collared juveniles in an intensively monitored population in southwest France. Dispersal propensity increased with body mass in males such that 36% of light individuals dispersed, whereas 62% of heavy individuals did so, but there was no evidence for condition dependence in dispersal propensity among females. By contrast, dispersal distance increased with body mass at a similar rate in both sexes such that heavy dispersers travelled around twice as far as light dispersers. Sex differences in the strength of condition-dependent dispersal may result from different selection pressures acting on the behaviour of males and females. We suggest that females disperse prior to habitat saturation being reached, likely in relation to the risk of inbreeding. By contrast, natal dispersal in males is likely governed by competitive exclusion through male-male competition for breeding opportunities in this strongly territorial mammal. Our study is, to our knowledge, a first demonstration that condition dependence in dispersal propensity and dispersal distance may be decoupled, indicating contrasting selection pressures drive the behavioural decisions of whether or not to leave the natal range, and where to settle.

AB  - Lowlands hold important potential for sustainable agriculture in South Sumatra. High acidity of soil and water and practice of domestic waste disposal in the area could be associated with a higher level of micro minerals in forages and grazing animals. This study aimed to evaluate the concentration of copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) in the water, forage, and buffalo hair, to compare the concentration of the metals in the forage on residential area and grazing area and to evaluate relationships between age and concentrations of the heavy metals in the buffaloes' hair. The concentrations of the minerals were Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd in the water, Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd in the forage and Fe > Mn > Cu > Zn > Pb > Cd in the buffalo hair. Concentrations of Pb in water and forages exceeded the permissible limits for drinking water and feeds of livestock. The levels of the heavy metals in forages on the residential and grazing areas were not different and no significant correlation between ages of the animals and concentrations of the metals in the hair.

AB  - Erosion of coral substrate plays a crucial role in reef calcium carbonate budget, but little is known about erosion in subtropical corals. In a 2-year study of coral substrate erosion, we deployed Porites skeletal blocks at nine sites across subtropical Hong Kong waters. External erosion varied from 0.05 to 3.07 kg m- 2 yr- 1 and accounted for 23.4-99.2% of the total erosion. More than half of the study sites had substantial external erosion (> 1 kg m- 2 yr- 1), and the values were positively correlated with density of the sea urchin Diadema setosum. Excluding urchins from access to the skeletal blocks using cages reduced external erosion by more than 90%. Overall, our study revealed that external erosion caused by urchin grazing contributed predominantly to the total coral skeletal loss in Hong Kong waters. Control of sea urchin population is needed to reduce coral erosion in places with high urchin density. (149 words).

AB  - Global declines in wildlife are increasing the vulnerability of Indigenous communities to food insecurity. Meanwhile, many colonial policies continue to ignore social-ecological relationships that have traditionally maintained a balance between wildlife and Indigenous Peoples' subsistence needs. We provide a case study on perspectives and insights from three Anishinaabe Nations in Ontario, Canada on the importance of a traditional food, moose (mooz [Nishnaabemowin]; Alces alces), and how changes in the moose population are affecting food security, well-being, and ways of life. In partnership with each Nation, we conducted interviews with community members and related observations on change in the moose population to estimates of moose abundance and non-Indigenous harvest collected by the Ontario provincial government over a 16-year time frame (2001-2016). Moose was described as important for subsistence needs as well as for maintaining Anishinabek culture, traditions, and identity within each community. A decline in the moose population was observed by most participants, which corresponded with provincial data on moose abundance. Additionally, the number of non-Indigenous hunters per moose harvested on traditional territories increased linearly over time, and community members expressed concern over how the province was managing moose. The effects of moose decline in the communities included reduced food security and health, increased financial costs due to both relying more on store-bought foods and having to travel further to harvest moose, as well as a decline in the practice of traditions and ceremonies surrounding moose harvest and passing this knowledge on to younger generations. Despite the potential impacts on Indigenous subsistence harvest, there is a lack of collaborative decision-making with Indigenous communities on moose population and harvest management in Ontario. Using community perspectives and insights, we discuss how autonomous moose monitoring can support and facilitate co-management and collaborative decision-making to reinstate Indigenous food sovereignty.

AB  - This study investigated the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map)-the causative agent of paratuberculosis-isolated from different host species in Germany. A total of 500 isolates from 243 cattle herds and 9 other host species originating from 13 federal states were genotyped. A multi-target approach was applied, comprising IS900-RFLP with BstEII and PstI digestion; MIRU-VNTR; and SSR1, SSR8, and SSR9 analysis. In total, 93 combined genotypes were identified, 84 in cattle and 21 in non-cattle isolates. Ninety genotypes were assigned to the C-type group, and three genotypes (three from sheep and one from cattle) were assigned to the S-type/subtype III group. Cluster analysis divided genotypes into subgroups similar to those shown for WGS-SNP-based phylogenetic trees. New genotypes were revealed, including INMV262-267 and a specific sequence at locus VNTR7. Five genotypes that were predominant in cattle were also detected in sheep, goats, and deer. The majority of genotypes [61%] were identified only once. Polyclonal infections were observed in individual animals and herds, and various potential Map transmission linkages were uncovered. This high genotype richness of Map reflects the long history of paratuberculosis in Germany and intensive nationwide animal movement and international trading activity.

AB  - In cleaning associations, individuals known as "cleaners" remove and feed on parasites and pests found on, or around, other animals known as "clients." While best documented in marine environments and as mutualisms, cleaning associations are widespread in terrestrial systems and range along a spectrum of obligate to facultative associations. In African savannas, cleaning associations primarily comprise facultative interactions between mammals and birds that remove attached parasites. Few reports, however, exist on cleaning associations that involve the removal of unattached pests. In this short note, I report a novel facultative bird-ungulate cleaning association involving the removal of unattached pests, between the African paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis) and two species of spiral-horned antelope (Tragelaphus spp.): greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and Cape bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus). On multiple occasions, I observed African paradise flycatchers hawking flying insects around greater kudu and a Cape bushbuck during the dry season at the Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia, Kenya. These observations document a rare feeding strategy for the African paradise flycatcher and are among the few records on cleaning interactions involving the removal of unattached pests.

AB  - Over-exploitation of wildlife especially bushmeat trade is the second most important threat to animal biodiversity. This also applies to Northern Angola but data on bushmeat and hunting techniques for this region are rare. Therefore, we study the most common hunting techniques, frequently captured species, and their economic value, and discuss the local resource use in relation to Angolan law and urgent global crises like the loss of biodiversity, the food supply in South African countries, and the risk of zoonoses. We recorded bushmeat hunting in 27 localities in the province of Uige, accompanied hunters along their snare lines and interviewed additional 20 locals. Seven main types of snares and traps and their characteristics were defined. Hunters own on average 92 +/- 128.7 snares and traps and capture about 25.3 +/- 23.6 animals monthly. In total, respondents recognized 28 species of mammals of which one is considered as extinct and two as very rare. The majority of recorded species are hunted regularly. Rodents are most commonly caught followed by primates and duikers. Harvesting rates decrease with species' body size, leading to high economic value of and achievable prices for rare, large animals. Overall, our results document the hunting pressure on mammals and the persisting popularity of bushmeat in Northern Angola which poses an imminent threat to remaining mammal populations. Moreover, it endangers ecosystem integrity, rural livelihoods, and human health through the risk of new zoonoses. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions. The Angolan government should play a more active role in enforcing existing hunting legislation to reduce illegal bushmeat trade.

AB  - Understanding factors influencing the spatio-temporal patterns of apex predators is prerequisite for their conservation. We studied space use and diel activity of tigers (Panthera tigris) in response to prey availability and anthropogenic activities with trail cameras in Nepal during December 2022-March 2023. We used hierarchical occupancy models to evaluate how prey availability (space use of prey species) and anthropogenic activities (number of humans and livestock) contributed to the tigers' space use, while accounting for landscape effects on their detection probability. We calculated the diel activity overlap between tigers and each prey species, as well as with humans and livestock. Overall, tigers had relatively high space use (0.540 +/- 0.092) and detection probability (0.742 +/- 0.073), and were most influenced by space use of wild pig (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus) and number of livestock detections. Tigers exhibited extensive temporal overlap with their prey, but not with humans or livestock. Our study demonstrates that humans and tigers can co-occur in a landscape by altering diel activity and potentially moving cryptically in certain landscapes, provided adequate prey is available. Management actions that ensure adequate prey availability can benefit tiger conservation.

AB  - Soil nutrient transformation and the microbial metabolism are primarily regulated by soil microorganisms, including fungi and bacteria, which exhibit distinct growth patterns, energy substrate utilization, and survival strategies. Despite their significance, our understanding of the key microorganisms governing the soil microbial metabolism and multifunctionality in subtropical woodlands remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a large-scale investigation and assessment of the soil microbial metabolic limitation and soil multifunctionality in Camellia oleifera Abel and Pinus massoniana Lamb. woodlands in subtropical China. Our results reveal that the microbial phosphorus limitation was more severe in C. oleifera compared to P. massoniana woodlands. Nonetheless, the pattern of carbon metabolic limitation for microbes and soil multifunctionality was similar in both types of woodland. Specifically, the microbial carbon limitation was positively associated with both bacterial and fungal richness, while the microbial phosphorus limitation was significantly correlated with fungi including the richness and community structure in the P. massoniana woodland. By contrast, we did not observe significant correlations between microbial metabolic limitation indices and microbial parameters in C. oleifera woodlands. Regarding soil multifunctionality, the results reveal a strong positive correlation between the soil multifunctionality and fungal community in both P. massoniana and C. oleifera woodlands. Furthermore, our structural equation modeling revealed that the soil fungal community, rather than the bacterial community, had a significant effect on the microbial metabolic limitation and soil multifunctionality. Overall, our study provides profound insights into the relative importance of bacterial and fungal communities in shaping the soil microbial metabolic limitation and soil multifunctionality in subtropical woodlands. The findings of our study have important implications for the management and conservation of subtropical woodlands.

AB  - AimMyanmar, an Indo-Burmese biodiversity hotspot, lacks baseline data on species occurrence and distribution. This hinders biodiversity monitoring and optimisation of conservation and development plans. We aim to document baseline mammal occupancy, interactions with environmental factors and scale-dependent responses.LocationHkakaborazi National Park, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park, Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range, Say Taung and Myinmoletkhat Key Biodiversity Areas distributed across Myanmar.MethodsCamera trap data throughout Myanmar were used to analyse species occupancy. We conducted a multiscale hierarchical spatial modelling process, using local and pooled data across Myanmar. We also optimised spatial scale across five scales and six predictors, using univariate occupancy models. We then selected scale-optimised variables for multivariate modelling, repeating this process for each species across local, regional and national datasets.ResultsThe study identified 47 terrestrial species and observed strong scale-dependent nonstationarity in occupancy estimates. Relationships with environmental variables differed among species and were highly scale dependent. Importantly, occupancy estimates produced by pooling data across sites were greatly different from any of the estimates for the individual sites, suggesting that high heterogeneity in occurrence and abundance across sites among species requires local or nested occupancy estimates to account for spatial heterogeneity and variation.Main ConclusionsFuture conservation efforts should focus on Northern Myanmar if range-restricted and rare species are to be protected, while focus should still be given to common species which serve as potential indicators of overall community structure. The nonstationarity of occupancy results from different datasets underscores the potential for misleading interpretations from aggregated data in nonstationary ecological systems. Metareplicated analyses of local, geographically and ecologically proximal regional datasets provide an important view of spatial variation in occupancy patterns guiding conservation design and improving understanding of the drivers of biodiversity patterns and change across large regions, such as Southeast Asia.

AB  - The ecological integrity of US national parks and other protected areas are under threat in the Anthropocene. For Yellowstone National Park (YNP), the impacts that global change has already had on the park's capacity to sustain its large migratory herds of wild ungulates is incompletely understood. Here we examine how two understudied components of global change, the historical increase in atmospheric CO2 and the spread of nonnative, invasive plant species, may have altered the capacity of YNP to provide forage for ungulates over the last 200-plus years. We performed two experiments: (1) a growth chamber study that determined the growth rates of important invasive and native YNP grasses that are forages for ungulates under preindustrial (280 ppm) versus modern (410 ppm) CO2 levels and (2) a field study that compared the effect of defoliation (clipping) on the shoot growth of invasive and native mesic grassland plants under ambient CO2 conditions in 2019. The growth chamber experiment revealed that modern CO2 increased the growth rates of both invasive and native grasses, and invasive grasses grew faster regardless of CO2 conditions. The field results showed a continuum of positive to negative responses of shoot growth to defoliation, with a subgroup of invasive species responding most positively. Altogether the results indicated that the historical increase in CO2 and the spread of invasive species, some of which were planted to provide forage for ungulates in the early and mid-1900s, have likely increased the capacity of forage production in YNP. However, rising CO2 has also resulted in regional warming and increased aridity in YNP, which will likely reduce grassland productivity. The challenge for global change biologists and park managers is to determine how competing components of global change have already affected and will increasingly affect forage dynamics and the sustainability of Yellowstone's iconic ungulate herds in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Trace elements are the essential mineral nutrients in grassland, however, we still know little about the distributions of trace elements in grassland with long-term grazing exclusion. The contents, stocks, and proportions of iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), and boron (B) in green plant-litter-root-soil were evaluated by enclosing for 18, and 39 years inside the fence (F18 and F39) and grazing outside the fence (F0) in Inner Mongolia grassland. The results showed that F18 and F39 decreased the stocks of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant and root compared to F0 (p < .05), while increased the stocks of them in litter (p < .05). The stock of Fe, Al, and Mn in green plant at F39 was 28.6%, 13.9%, and 39.2% higher than that at F18. The stocks of four trace elements in first layer litter at F39 were increased by 12.7%-52.2% compared to F18, whereas the stocks of them in third layer litter were decreased by 32.2%-42.5%. The F18 obviously increased the stocks of Fe and Mn in soil, especially B (p < .05). While the stocks of these trace elements in soil at F39 were 9.1%-28.0% lower than that at F18, especially B (p < .05). In conclusion, the trace elements were mainly shifted from green plant and root to soil and third layer litter with 18-year grazing exclusion. Compared to 18-year grazing exclusion, the trace elements were shifted from third layer litter and soil to root with 39-year grazing exclusion.

AB  - Amidst global shifts in the distribution and abundance of wildlife and livestock, we have only a rudimentary understanding of ungulate parasite communities and parasite-sharing patterns. We used qPCR and DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to characterize gastrointestinal nematode (Strongylida) community composition and sharing among 17 sympatric species of wild and domestic large mammalian herbivore in central Kenya. We tested a suite of hypothesis-driven predictions about the role of host traits and phylogenetic relatedness in describing parasite infections. Host species identity explained 27-53% of individual variation in parasite prevalence, richness, community composition and phylogenetic diversity. Host and parasite phylogenies were congruent, host gut morphology predicted parasite community composition and prevalence, and hosts with low evolutionary distinctiveness were centrally positioned in the parasite-sharing network. We found no evidence that host body size, social-group size or feeding height were correlated with parasite composition. Our results highlight the interwoven evolutionary and ecological histories of large herbivores and their gastrointestinal nematodes and suggest that host identity, phylogeny and gut architecture-a phylogenetically conserved trait related to parasite habitat-are the overriding influences on parasite communities. These findings have implications for wildlife management and conservation as wild herbivores are increasingly replaced by livestock.

AB  - Changes in body size have been documented across taxa in response to human activities and climate change. Body size influences many aspects of an individual's physiology, behavior, and ecology, ultimately affecting life history performance and resilience to stressors. In this study, we developed an analytical approach to model individual growth patterns using aerial imagery collected via drones, which can be used to investigate shifts in body size in a population and the associated drivers. We applied the method to a large morphological dataset of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) using a distinct foraging ground along the NE Pacific coast, and found that the asymptotic length of these whales has declined since around the year 2000 at an average rate of 0.05-0.12 m/y. The decline has been stronger in females, which are estimated to be now comparable in size to males, minimizing sexual dimorphism. We show that the decline in asymptotic length is correlated with two oceanographic metrics acting as proxies of habitat quality at different scales: the mean Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, and the mean ratio between upwelling intensity in a season and the number of relaxation events. These results suggest that the decline in gray whale body size may represent a plastic response to changing environmental conditions. Decreasing body size could have cascading effects on the population's demography, ability to adjust to environmental changes, and ecological influence on the structure of their community. This finding adds to the mounting evidence that body size is shrinking in several marine populations in association with climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Our modeling approach is broadly applicable across multiple systems where morphological data on megafauna are collected using drones.
   We investigated the trend in the body size of gray whales using a distinct foraging ground along the NE Pacific coast and tested its association with two climatic indices at multiple scales. We detected a strong decline in maximum length, which started around the year 2000 and has been stronger in females. We found that this decline was correlated with a decadal index of ocean climate oscillation and, at smaller scales, the balance between productivity and nutrient retention. Our results contribute to the mounting evidence that marine predator body size is shrinking in association with climate changes.image

AB  - Conservation management is often integrated into a broader tourism context, and under some conditions allows wildlife trophy hunting to support its goals. In such cases it is generally acknowledged that the direct impact of hunting requires careful monitoring and regulation with respect to the size and dynamics of hunted populations. However, hunting may also affect the behaviour of local wildlife, including their reaction to the approach of humans. Thus, hunting may have broader consequences on tourism and conservation management if animals respond by changing their behaviour in a way that makes them more difficult to monitor or for tourists to observe. We examined the potential impact of trophy hunting on vigilance and flight behaviour of Blue Sheep (Bharal: Pseudois nayaur) in Nepal, by comparing their behavioural responses in conservation areas with contrasting management approaches: the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR) where male Blue Sheep have been trophy hunted since the 1980 s, and the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) where hunting is forbidden. Blue Sheep in the DHR had higher levels of vigilance than sheep in the ACA (10 % versus 8 % of their time respectively). Sheep in the DHR were also much more difficult to approach on foot, with Blue Sheep groups in the DHR having an average flight initiation distance of 96 +/- 7 m versus 39 +/- 3 m for the ACA, and subsequently moving much greater distances when disturbed (flight movement distance in the DHR versus ACA: 79 +/- 3 m versus 26 +/- 2 m respectively). These results suggest that hunting impacts on tourism and conservation may extend well beyond the population dynamic consequences of trophy animal removal. These behavioural effects suggest additional consideration is required when balancing wildlife hunting and observation tourism activities in the same area. It would also be valuable to assess the impacts of hunting-induced behaviour changes on the effectiveness of wildlife monitoring in such areas.

AB  - Efforts to identify suitable habitat for wildlife conservation are crucial for safeguarding biodiversity, facilitating management, and promoting sustainable coexistence between wildlife and communities. Our study focuses on identifying potential black rhino (Diceros bicornis) habitat within the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), Tanzania, across wet and dry seasons. To achieve this, we used remote sensing data with and without field data. We employed a comprehensive approach integrating Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images, vegetation indices, and human activity data. We employed machine learning recursive feature elimination (RFE) and random forest (RF) algorithms to identify the most relevant features that contribute to habitat suitability prediction. Approximately 36% of the NCA is suitable for black rhinos throughout the year; however, there are seasonal shifts in habitat suitability. Anthropogenic factors increase land degradation and limit habitat suitability, but this depends on the season. This study found a higher influence of human-related factors during the wet season, with suitable habitat covering 53.6% of the NCA. In the dry season, browse availability decreases and rhinos are forced to become less selective of the areas where they move to fulfil their nutritional requirements, with anthropogenic pressures becoming less important. Furthermore, our study identified specific areas within the NCA that consistently offer suitable habitat across wet and dry seasons. These areas, situated between Olmoti and the Crater, exhibit minimal disturbance from human activities, presenting favourable conditions for rhinos. Although the Oldupai Gorge only has small suitable patches, it used to sustain a large population of rhinos in the 1960s. Land cover changes seem to have decreased the suitability of the Gorge. This study highlights the importance of combining field data with remotely sensed data. Remote sensing-based assessments rely on the importance of vegetation covers as a proxy for habitat and often overlook crucial field variables such as shelter or breeding locations. Overall, our study sheds light on the imperative of identifying suitable habitat for black rhinos within the NCA and underscores the urgency of intensified conservation efforts. Our findings underscore the need for adaptive conservation strategies to reverse land degradation and safeguard black rhino populations in this dynamic multiple land-use landscape as environmental and anthropogenic pressures evolve.

AB  - The ever-growing human population along with the expansion of settlements and land use, and effective hunting methods increasingly influence wildlife populations. Knowledge of management responses to re-establishing large carnivores is important to understand the overall impact of humans on large carnivores and their prey populations. We examined the response of moose (Alces alces) harvest, but also population size and composition in relation to wolf (Canis lupus) territory density along a latitudinal gradient in two bordering countries in northern Europe. Moose harvest density was negatively related to wolf territory density with model estimates showing that harvest was 35% (Norway) to 39% (Sweden) lower in moose management units (MMUs) with average wolf territory density, compared to MMUs without wolves during the previous five years. The corresponding model estimates for moose observation rate was 21% lower in Sweden and 1% lower in Norway. In both countries, management actions were taken to reduce the total moose mortality (reduced harvest) as well as to maximize productivity in the population (reduced harvest of adult females) in response to increased wolf territory density. Annual changes in quotas were related to fulfilment of last year<acute accent>s quota and wolf territory density in the previous two years. The annual change in harvest were affected by actual harvest the previous year and by set quotas, showing that harvest followed management plans. Abilities to adjust to new conditions is a key in wildlife management where conflicting societal objectives such as forestry, sustainable ungulate harvest yield, and carnivore conservation should be balanced.

AB  - In the absence of environmental heterogeneity, spatial variation among local communities can be mostly attributed to random dispersal, demographic stochasticity and species interactions causing historical contingency in colonization (e.g. priority effects). The consequences of demographic stochasticity and random dispersal are highly dependent on community size, regional richness and local richness, which, along with historical contingency can be strongly affected by spatial isolation and the presence of predators. Here, we tested whether and how the presence of a generalist predatory fish and spatial isolation can change spatial community variability in artificial ponds by manipulating the presence/absence of fish (redbreast tilapia) at three different distances from a source wetland. We then used null models to compute how much the observed community variability within treatments deviates from the expected from randomly reassembled communities (i.e. beta-deviation). We found that spatial isolation can have both negative and positive effects on community variability, and their importance may depend on the presence of predatory fish. Negative effects likely occurred because predatory insects cannot always successfully colonize highly isolated ponds, causing the abundance of herbivores and detritivores to increase, consequently increasing community size, which is known to decrease the importance of demographic stochasticity. However, when fish are absent, the more isolated communities exhibit more community variability than is expected from random community assembly. We believe that such an increase in variability is most likely due to an increase in the importance of historical contingency in colonization, generating more distinct communities in isolated ponds. Such effects were absent in the presence of generalist predatory fish, likely because fish prevented any early colonizing taxa from becoming too abundant. Our findings show that the presence of generalist predators can change how community variability responds to spatial isolation.

AB  - Taxonomic diversity is insufficient to fully characterize species co-existence in forest ecosystems. Incorporating trait-based and phylogenetic data into studies of communities provides insight into the mechanisms by which coexistence emerges and is maintained in forest landscapes. We integrated trait-based and phylogenetic models of community structure to gain insight into community processes in deciduous, mixed, and evergreen forests. We also explored how phylogenetic community structure may vary across environmental gradients within deciduous, mixed, and evergreen forests using a null model approach. Plants appeared to transition from being acquisitive within dry, deciduous forest plots atop fertile soils to becoming more conservative in moist, infertile soil conditions in evergreen forests. We present this as strong evidence of environmental filtering mediating plant community composition. Our models suggest a strong influence of environmental filtering in deciduous forests and competitive exclusion and random processes in mixed and evergreen settings. Besides, thicker leaves, lower SLA, and higher WD in evergreen forests than deciduous forests may reflect adaptation to chronic herbivore pressure-a key biotic filter shaping trait distribution in different forest systems. Our results suggest that phylogeny and functional traits represent different lenses through which one may view community assembly, which should be viewed independently of each other. We suggest future research incorporating both phylogenetic and trait-based perspectives, and possibly even more axes (stress tolerance, etc.) is necessary to provide insight into community assembly.

AB  - Species of the genus Oestrus Linnaeus, 1758 (Diptera: Oestridae) are obligate parasites that affect the nasal and pharyngeal cavities of mammals, causing significant harm to both livestock and wildlife. In this study, the complete mitogenome of Oestrus sp., a bot fly parasitizing the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica Schinz, 1838), has been sequenced and assembled. A comparison with the mitogenome of Oestrus ovis Linnaeus, 1758 revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of gene organization and nucleotide composition, and phylogenetic analyses confirmed the close evolutionary relationship between them. Additionally, the entire rDNA cistron, including the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2), was characterized for both species, revealing considerable variation in the length of ITS1, while the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA genes showed high sequence conservation. These results provide information about molecular markers of 2 Oestrus species. Furthermore, the findings offer insights that could facilitate the diagnosis and management of parasitic infestations of Oestridae species in both domestic and wild hosts.

AB  - Ecosystem functions such as biological pest control are mediated by the richness and abundance of service providers i.e., biological control agents (BCAs), relative contributions of individual taxa and community struc-ture. This is especially relevant in the native range of agricultural herbivores, where a speciose community of co- evolved BCAs can prevent them from attaining pest status. Here, we use a powerful graphical approach to assess the functional structure of BCA communities of the fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on maize in the Neotropics. Drawing upon a curated database of all-time field and laboratory studies, we graphed patterns in the functional contribution, abundance and niche breadth for a respective 69, 53 and 3 taxa of resident parasitoids, predators and pathogens. Regardless of varying taxon coverage and rigor of the underlying studies, functional structure follows a saturating relationship in which the first three taxa account for 90-98% of aggregate biological control function. Abundance-functionality matrices prove critically incomplete, as more than 80% of invertebrate taxa miss empirically derived efficiency metrics while associated FAW infestation data are scarce. Despite its methodological shortfalls and data gaps, our work pinpoints Chelonus insularis, several taxa of egg parasitoids, Doru spp. and Orius spp. as taxa with outsized (average) functionality and conservation potential. This is also exemplified by the highly variable aggregate function across studies, with dispersion indices of 1.52 and 2.14 for invertebrate BCAs. Our work underlines the critical importance of functional ecology research, networked trials and standardized methodologies in advancing conservation bio-logical control globally.

AB  - Seagrasses are one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. Posidonia oceanica, an endemic Mediterranean seagrass, is under high and constant anthropogenic and natural pressures, including climate change and the introduction of invasive species. Percnon gibbesi, a small crab with a tropical and subtropical distribution, was first reported in the Mediterranean Sea in 1999, and today is established across the entire Mediterranean Basin, inhabiting the shallow rocky infra-littoral zone. Given that P. gibbesi and P. oceanica can co-occur in the same environments, an experiment was set up to study their plant-herbivore interaction. Using two experiments at two different temperatures (19 degrees C and 25 degrees C), the incidence of herbivory on the seagrass tissues (fruits, leaves, rhizome, and whole shoot) by the invasive crab was assessed. The fruits along with the rhizome were the most consumed tissues, and the leaves of P. oceanica were the least consumed, which could be a consequence of tissue structure characteristics and/or nutrient quality. The incidence of herbivory on the leaves of P. oceanica was not affected by temperature. The herbivory pressure of the exotic crab P. gibbesi on native seagrass P. oceanica will likely be limited to a shallow bathymetric range; however, given the large scale of the invasion, the consumption of P. oceanica could become a relevant ecological issue in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Mercury biomagnification in aquatic ecosystems is a global issue. Biomagnification patterns and drivers in alpine regions remain poorly understood. Hg biomagnification in the aquatic food web of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Q-T Plateau) was investigated. A total of 302 fish and macroinvertebrate tissue samples were analysed for total mercury (THg) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios. Overall, 26.75% of fish individuals exceeded the USFWS consumption guidelines. A total of 52.17% of the sampling sites covering different habitats exhibited a significantly positive THg-delta N-15 relationship, which confirmed the Hg biomagnification potential of Q-T Plateau aquatic ecosystems. The Q-T Plateau Hg biomagnification rates were generally far higher than global averages regardless of the habitat type. Hg in sediments, elevation and population density were positively related to the Hg biomagnification magnitude on the Q-T Plateau, which could be attributed to the disproportionate response of Hg concentrations in macroinvertebrates and fishes along environmental gradients. Our findings offer empirical evidence that fish consumption on the Q-T Plateau poses a substantial Hg exposure risk to people living along river and lake shores. Higher biomagnification rates could further disproportionately accelerate Hg pollution in Q-T Plateau aquatic ecosystems under future anthropogenic activities and climate warming trajectories.

AB  - The rapid expansion of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) throughout the United States has been fueled by unlawful introductions, with invasive populations causing extensive crop losses, damaging native ecosystems, and serving as a reservoir for disease. Multiple states have passed laws prohibiting the possession or transport of wild pigs. However, genetic and phenotypic similarities between domestic pigs and invasive wild pigs-which overwhelmingly represent domestic pig and wild boar hybrids-pose a challenge for the enforcement of such regulations. We sought to exploit wild boar ancestry as a common attribute among the vast majority of invasive wild pigs as a means of genetically differentiating wild pigs from breeds of domestic pig found within the United States. We organized reference high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes (1039 samples from 33 domestic breeds and 382 samples from 16 wild boar populations) into five genetically cohesive reference groups: mixed-commercial breeds, Durocs, heritage breeds, primitive breeds, and wild boar. Building upon well-established genetic clustering approaches, we structured the test statistic to describe the difference in the likelihood of a given genotype's ancestry vectors (sensu genetic clustering analysis) if derived strictly from the four described domestic pig reference groups versus allowing for admixture from the wild boar group. By fitting statistical distributions to test statistics of reference domestic pigs, we characterized the distribution of the null hypothesis that a given genotype descends strictly from domestic pig reference groups. We tested the approach with simulated genotypes and empirical data from an additional 29 breeds of domestic pig represented by 435 unique genotypes; all associated test statistics for simulated and empirical domestic pig challenge sets fell within the distribution of reference domestic pigs. We then evaluated 6566 invasive wild pigs sampled across the contiguous United States, of which 63% exceeded the maximum threshold for domestic pigs and could be statistically classified as possessing wild boar ancestry. This approach provides a scientific foundation to enforce regulations prohibiting the possession of this destructive invasive species. Further, this computationally efficient and generalizable approach could be readily adapted to quantify gene flow among ecological systems of conservation or management concern.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The Earth's population is projected to rise to 9.7 billion by 2050 resulting in mounting pressure to increase agricultural yields in a sustainable manner. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may be important players in this agricultural transition given their capacity to improve soil and plant health. Benefits gained by crops hosting AM fungi can be cultivar-specific and also affected by insect herbivory, although the combined effect of these factors remains unclear. Here, we show that, in an economically and socially significant tri-partite system, there is interplay between crop cultivar, AM colonisation and aphid herbivory on plant growth and nutritional status. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are critical components of the rhizosphere across nearly all terrestrial biomes. AM fungi associate with most plants, including major crops, usually increasing plant access to soil nutrients and enhancing defence against pests and pathogens in return for photosynthetic carbon (C). However, plant growth responses to AM fungi vary according to species and genotype, an issue pertinent in agro-ecosystems where crop cultivar can play an important role in AM function. Evidence suggests other biotic interactions, including with sap-feeding aphids, impact the function of AM symbioses in plants. Nonetheless, whether these biotic factors alter genotype (or cultivar)-specific plant growth and nutritional responses to colonisation by AM fungi remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether mycorrhizal responsiveness of three cultivars of wheat (Triticum eastivum L.) to colonisation by a ubiquitously occurring AM fungus (Rhizophagus irregularis) differ in the presence or absence of bird cherry-oat aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi), a major pest of cereals. Our findings show that although AM fungal colonisation and AM-mediated plant growth responses were not affected by aphid feeding, there was variation between cultivars in the benefits gained by host plants in terms of nutrient acquisition and root growth, while aphid abundances also differed between wheat varieties. Understanding what causes cultivar-specific outcomes and how they ultimately impact plant growth promotion, crop yields and food production represent key future research goals in agroecology.

AB  - Recently, the northward movement of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Yunnan, China, has attracted international attention. Climate change or human disturbances have been proposed to be the key drivers, but these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested. In this study, we quantified the relationship between climate change and human impacts on the recent range expansion of Asian elephants in southwest China. We found that the first observation probability of this species in a new place during 1959-2021 had a significant and positive association with change in air temperature and human density, resulting in a movement toward a high-latitude region with a warmer climate and higher human density; however, its association with precipitation was scale-dependent in time: positive or negative during the past 10 or 5 years, respectively. Under the enforced protection policy, human-dominated areas became preferred habitats for elephants. Our results indicate that climate change and enforced protection efforts in human-dominated landscapes in the last few decades are significant drivers of the recent range expansion of Asian elephants in Yunnan, China. It is necessary to expand the current protected areas or habitat corridors toward the north or set up new reserves in the north and set up barriers between human settlements and elephant habitats to facilitate elephant movements and minimize human-elephant conflicts under accelerated global change.

AB  - Anthropogenic change has increased extinction events to an estimated 100 times background rates, amplifying the need for conservation interventions to protect biodiversity. Rare plant research not only provides roadmaps for species protection, but also foundational understanding of how interacting stressors drive decline and the mechanisms by which extinctions occur. Pectis imberbis (Gray) is a recently listed endangered forb found in the biodiverse Sky Island Archipelago in the southwestern U.S. We investigated both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of decline for this species by relating multiple stressors to vital rates calculated for the nine known P. imberbis populations of sufficient size to allow for demographic analysis. We observed an extraordinary recruitment event in 2022 and concomitantly high population growth across most populations. Despite this, long-term analysis reveals that only two populations have growth rates at or above replacement levels and indicates the importance of stochastic recruitment events in maintaining viability. Climate change is implicated in decline of P. imberbis, though evidence also suggests that browse by ungulates and competition with co-occurring plants depress vital rates. Conservation recommendations vary by population, due to positionality and jurisdictional management, but include reduction of co-occurring stressors, like installing fencing to prevent herbivory, and re-establishment of P. imberbis in climatically suitable areas. Long-term demographic monitoring of this species is warranted to quantify the contribution of stochastic events to viability, examine impacts of interacting stressors, and to project how populations will respond to climate change in this arid, biodiverse region.

AB  - Due to its social, economic, and ecological importance and because it is an area of intense human interaction, this study sought to assess the Crustacea, Decapoda fauna of the urban beach of Boa Viagem, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, and, consequently, to understand the anthropogenic interaction of this fauna. From August 2016 to July 2017, monthly trawl collections were made in macroalgae meadows associated with sandstone reefs at two points, considering beach occupancy, time of day and seasonality as factors. A total of 665 specimens were collected, distributed among 23 decapods species. Acanthonyx petiverii and Epialtus bituberculatus were the most frequent species at the points investigated, and between periods of day, Hippolyte obliquimanus and Callinectes spp. were most frequent in the area with the greatest amount of phytal, Point 2. Point 1/Diurnal was found to have the lowest richness, abundance, and density. Both Margalef's and Shannon's diversity indices were low between points and periods of day; however, Point 1/Diurnal had the lowest indices, in contrast to Simpson's index. At Point 2, higher values were found for the calculated indices. Significant differences were only found in abundance between Point 1 and Point 2. Thus, Boa Viagem beach is an important area for the conservation of decapod crustacean fauna; however, the integrity of the macroalgal assemblage is a crucial factor for these animals.

AB  - The Philippine mouse deer (Tragulus nigricans) is an endangered ungulate species, endemic to the Balabac Islands in the Palawan Faunal Region of the western Philippines. Despite its conservation importance, it has received little attention from local authorities and conservation biologists, with limited studies conducted on the species. Here we provide a preliminary report on the species distribution, population and conservation status, based on our recently completed surveys. We used a combination of line transect distance sampling, opportunistic searching on targeted habitats, and informal community interviews to assess the species' status. We recorded a total of 25 sightings of mouse deer during our transect surveys. All records, including recent sightings of mouse deer, were from two islands, mainland Balabac and Bugsuk. No mouse deer were recorded on other islands that we surveyed, suggesting that the populations have been markedly reduced due to a nearly complete conversion of natural habitat, such as Ramos Island, or perhaps some islands are too small to permanently support populations. Our analyses revealed that the species occurs at low density (0.219 +/- 0.084/ha), particularly on Balabac. The mean population estimate based on Bayesian analysis is 2525 (95% Highest Density Interval, 1635-3461). However, this number is highly uncertain because of the low probability, highlighting the need for more information on the species' population. Several conservation efforts are being implemented now, but more intensive in situ conservation programs would benefit the species, along with other threatened endemics found in the region.

AB  - Land use change, agricultural and urban expansion, and anthropogenic climate change are the major drivers of biodiversity loss across the globe. Big cats (a casual term including species such as tigers, lions, mountain lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, and cheetahs) are impacted by these global changes. As human settlement and activity increasingly overlap with big cat habitat, the frequency of human conflict over wildlife is rising, often precipitating direct costs to people living near big cats. Big cats are rare, they play many critical roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often flagship conservation species because they are poster-charismatic megafauna. As many of the costs of conservation are borne by locals, local acceptance of big cats on the landscape is fundamental to the success of in-situ conservation of these species. Here, we explore this issue by conducting a systematic literature review of articles that directly measure local perceptions (or acceptance) of big cats quantitatively. We normalized all perception data so we could synthesize results across places and species. The final set of data included the views of 14 253 locals from 45 papers, interrogating five different question types on local perceptions of big cats. Across these studies, we found that locals generally hold neutral or slightly positive perceptions of big cats - particularly for tigers and mountain lions. On average, livestock owners have more negative perceptions of big cats compared to non-livestock owners. Geographically, there are large portions of big cat population ranges where no research on local perceptions exist. These results call for two things (1) rethinking the perception that locals largely hold negative views toward big cats across their ranges and (2) more systematic research across big cat species ranges to better understand local perceptions, what drives those perceptions, and how they impact the outcomes of conservation approaches.

AB  - Inland saline waters in Central Asia constitute an important part of steppe ecosystems, providing considerable ecological functions and ecosystem services. Here we aim to present a multi-spatial scale analysis of nutrient cycling and transport waterbird guilds, and the environmental attributes of saline-soda aquatic ecosystems in Kazakhstan. The density, biomass, and diversity of waterbird guilds was determined in the case of three nutrient cycling and transport guilds: a) net-importer (IM), b) importer-exporter (IMEX), c) net-exporter (EX), according to the Boros's guild classification method, and for several traditional feeding guilds: carnivorous, herbivorous, invertebrate eater, omnivorous and piscivorous. Our results revealed that waterbird guilds, as predictors represented by the complete waterbird community, are in close relationship with several (N = 12) environmental attributes of inland saline waters through complex trophic linkages of waterbird populations on multi-spatial scales. The density and the biomass of the IM and IMEX guilds are strongly and positively correlated (i) with the productivity metrics of habitats (e.g., CHL, GPP), indicating their trophic position, and (ii) with water depth. We found significant correlations among guild density, biomass, diversity and environmental attributes on multi-spatial scales for IMEX and EX. Our results revealed that IMEX predicts the surrounding environment of aquatic habitats, whereas EX species are substantial environmental predictors of aquatic ecosystems. However, the diversity metric had valid models only with EX. The herbivorous and omnivorous guilds, that feed chiefly on plant materials consist mainly of IMEX and EX duck species, which were positively related to grassland coverage and the shoreline development index.

AB  - Exotic plants are becoming increasingly common worldwide, often driven by ecological factors such as domestic livestock grazing and soil fertilization. In temperate grasslands, native C4 and exotic C3 grasses are generally expected to coexist due to their distinct temporal niches, which should reduce direct competition. However, their differing abilities to exploit limited resources or tolerate vertebrate herbivory can create fitness imbalances, favoring exotic forage species over native species and potentially undermining their long-term coexistence. Few studies have explored how seasonally distinct groups of native and exotic plants interact, especially under the simultaneous manipulation of biotic factors - such as grazing and species interactions - and abiotic factors - such as soil nutrients. We conducted short- and long-term manipulative experiments in a temperate Pampa grassland in Argentina to investigate how herbivore exclusion, fertilization, and their combination influence plant invasion by altering interactions between native warm-season (C4) and exotic cool-season (C3) grasses. Despite their phenological differences, native C4 and exotic C3 grasses interact, and their interactions were weak under grazing. However, with herbivore exclusion and nutrient addition, interactions shifted towards strong competition, particularly in spring. This competition resulted in a slight increase in exotic grass cover over natives after two years. However, fourteen years after the onset of the long-term herbivore exclusion, exotic grasses, particularly Festuca arundinacea, had become dominant, suggesting potential risks to the coexistence of native and exotic species. Our study uniquely reveals that even when niche differentiation is expected to prevent direct competition, biotic and abiotic changes can trigger interactions that favour exotic species' dominance, challenging assumptions about the stability of coexistence between phenologically distinct grasses.

AB  - Predators and prey engage in games where each player must counter the moves of the other, and these games include multiple phases operating at different spatiotemporal scales. Recent work has highlighted potential issues related to scale-sensitive inferences in predator-prey interactions, and there is growing appreciation that these may exhibit pronounced but predictable dynamics. Motivated by previous assertions about effects arising from foraging games between white-tailed deer and canid predators (coyotes and wolves), we used a large and year-round network of trail cameras to characterize deer and predator foraging games, with a particular focus on clarifying its temporal scale and seasonal variation. Linear features were strongly associated with predator detection rates, suggesting these play a central role in canid foraging tactics by expediting movement. Consistent with expectations for prey contending with highly mobile predators, deer responses were more sensitive to proximal risk metrics at finer spatiotemporal scales, suggesting that coarser but more commonly used scales of analysis may miss useful insights into prey risk-response. Time allocation appears to be a key tactic for deer risk management and was more strongly moderated by factors associated with forage or evasion heterogeneity (forest cover, snow and plant phenology) than factors associated with the likelihood of predator encounter (linear features). Trade-offs between food and safety appeared to vary as much seasonally as spatially, with snow and vegetation phenology giving rise to a "phenology of fear." Deer appear free to counter predators during milder times of year, but a combination of poor foraging state, reduced forage availability, greater movements costs, and reproductive state dampen responsiveness during winter. Pronounced intra-annual variation in predator-prey interactions may be common in seasonal environments.

AB  - The wild yak Bos mutus was believed to be regionally extinct in Nepal for decades until our team documented two individuals from Upper Humla, north-western Nepal, in 2014. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) seeks further evidence for the conclusive confirmation of that sighting. We conducted line transects and opportunistic sign surveys in the potential wild yak habitats of Humla, Dolpa, and Mustang districts between 2015 and 2017 and collected genetic samples (present and historic) of wild and domestic yaks Bos grunniens. We also sighted another wild yak in Upper Humla in 2015. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses based on mitochondrial D-loop sequences (similar to 450 bp) revealed that wild yaks in Humla share the haplotype with wild yaks from the north-western region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China. While hybridization with domestic yaks is a major long-term threat, illegal hunting for meat and trophy put the very small populations of wild yaks in Nepal at risk. Our study indicates that the unprotected habitat of Upper Humla is the last refuge for wild yaks in Nepal. We recommend wild yak conservation efforts in the country to focus on Upper Humla by (i) assigning a formal status of protected area to the region, (ii) raising awareness in the local communities for wild yak conservation, and (iii) providing support for adaptation of herding practice and pastureland use to ensure the viability of the population.

AB  - Low inflows cause predominantly hypersaline conditions in Baffin Bay, TX (USA), which are inhospitable for oysters, the dominant reef-builder in other northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries. Instead, extensive biogenic reefs contain dense aggregations of the ubiquitous tube-building serpulid worm, Hydroides dianthus. The distribution and size of these reefs have declined over the last several decades. Although serpulid reef habitats have increased in conservation importance, there is a need for ecological knowledge to inform resource management and habitat restoration planning. This study examined spatial and temporal recruitment patterns of serpulid worms and other encrusting species over an 18-month-long period, using recruitment tiles, and live serpulid reef as a reference. Recruitment of H. dianthus occurs year-round; however, the greatest recruitment occurs between September and December. No consistent differences in serpulid recruitment were detected among locations within Baffin Bay, which could be because salinity and temperature were similar among locations, and/or because sampling replication was low. H. dianthus cover was greater on the lower surface of horizontally oriented recruitment tiles (28% cover), whereas Amphibalanus eburneus (barnacle) cover dominated the upper surface of tiles (34% cover). Furthermore, there is no evidence that predation by megafauna (> 1 cm) is hindering serpulid recruitment. There is sufficient larval supply of H. dianthus to suggest that the restoration of serpulid reefs can be successful by providing additional substrate with appropriate microhabitat complexity. Study findings can be used to support planning and successful implementation of serpulid reef restoration.

AB  - 1.Visibility (viewshed) plays a significant and diverse role in animals' behaviour and fitness. Understanding how visibility influences animal behaviour requires the measurement of habitat visibility at spatial scales commensurate to individual animal choices. However, measuring habitat visibility at a fine spatial scale over a landscape is a challenge, particularly in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. forests). As a result, our ability to model the influence of fine-scale visibility on animal behaviour has been impeded or limited. 2.In this study, we demonstrate the application of the concept of three-dimensional (3D) cumulative viewshed in the study of animal spatial behaviour at a landscape level. Specifically, we employed a newly described approach that combines terrestrial and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure fine-scale habitat visibility (3D cumulative viewshed) on a continuous scale in forested landscapes. We applied the LiDAR-derived visibility to investigate how visibility in forests affects the summer habitat selection and the movement of 20 GPS-collared female red deer Cervus elaphus in a temperate forest in Germany. We used integrated step selection analysis to determine whether red deer show any preference for fine-scale habitat visibility and whether visibility is related to the rate of movement of red deer. 3.We found that red deer selected intermediate habitat visibility. Their preferred level of visibility during the day was substantially lower than that of night and twilight, whereas the preference was not significantly different between night and twilight. In addition, red deer moved faster in high-visibility areas, possibly mainly to avoid predation and anthropogenic risk. Furthermore, red deer moved most rapidly between locations in the twilight. 4.For the first time, the preference for intermediate habitat visibility and the adaption of movement rate to fine-scale visibility by a forest-dwelling ungulate species at a landscape scale was revealed. The LiDAR technique used in this study offers fine-scale habitat visibility at the landscape level in forest ecosystems, which would be of broader interest in the fields of animal ecology and behaviour.

AB  - The Teuchitlan River in Mexico is a hotspot of fish diversity, with 3 endemic species. Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus has been introduced into the river, but its trophic impact on the system is unknown. We determined the importance of each food item in the diet of P. bimaculatus with a relative importance index, their feeding behavior using an omnivorous index, the trophic position with the TrophLab program, and the niche breadth using the standardized Levin index. We performed Permanova analyses to compare diet between size classes, sites, and seasons. We analyzed 631 P. bimaculatus individuals. The species consumed mainly terrestrial insects, but presented an herbivorous trend in some sites. A generalist trophic behavior was presented in the wet season and a specialist behavior in the dry season occupying different trophic levels and presenting variable trophic width. This flexible feeding strategy enables P. bimaculatus to exploit resources from different trophic levels. The high consumption (%RII > 50) of terrestrial insects could indicate that P. bimaculatus may transport allochthonous energy into the river. Furthermore, the high invasive potential of the species represents a risk for the freshwater ecosystems of central Mexico, a region that has been recognized as a hotspot for freshwater fish conservation.

AB  - Forage and browse are a valuable natural resource in Malawi that can be used to support livestock production which, in turn, can contribute towards delivering income and nutrition to households and communities. However, the quality and quantity of forages can be poor, especially during the dry season. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional composition of naturally available forages across smallholder livestock systems in Malawi, with particular focus on seasonal differences in quality and quantity. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over 17 months, across four sites (30 farms/smallholders) in central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre and ash/organic matter. NDVI obtained from satellite imagery was used as a proxy for forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability were most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. There were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, likely due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season along with a reduction in forage biomass represents a seasonal nutritional feed gap that may impact productivity within livestock systems.

AB  - Regeneration and recruitment are primordial for stand sustainability. However, natural regeneration is usually only evaluated by density and height, so no details are provided regarding the individual traits of the saplings/seedlings. Hence, the findings of these regeneration studies are of limited selection power in future management. The main goal of this study was to develop a new methodology that enables the evaluation of individual quality traits of regeneration in the early stages of stand development so that their future potential development can be assessed. Natural regeneration (NR) was evaluated in each field plot using the conjugation of two new methods: first using the natural regeneration density (NRD) method and second using the new natural regeneration tree classification (NRTC). NRTC is composed of a set of criteria with categorical variables that allow the evaluation of traits of individuals and their potential for future recruitment. In this classification system, five criteria were used, namely, upper story influence to evaluate the competition of the trees of the upper story cast on the regeneration individuals, crown isolation to characterize the competition between saplings, height as a surrogate of sapling development, diameter as a proxy of growth, and tree habit as a proxy of the habit of saplings. To test both methods, we applied them in a case study of Quercus ilex in the montado agroforestry system in Portugal, where different degrees of crown cover coexist. Our results indicated that in 85% of the plots with a crown cover higher than 30%, we could find good-quality natural regeneration oak saplings suited to be recruited and located outside of the upper story crown projection. Only 15% of the plots with a crown cover higher than 30% were dominated by Cistus ladanifer and had almost no oak saplings. In future, we suggest that the NRTC be used in all NR individuals in the forest inventory when the NR density is less than 200 NR individuals ha(-1).

AB  - Context Movement of individuals and resources among habitat patches are key processes at the landscape scale. While these subsidies are primarily studied separately, coupled movement of species and resources, for example by animal vectors, may reinforce or dilute natural landscape heterogeneity, with consequences for the spatial distribution of biodiversity. Objectives We examine how transport of nutrients and seed by consumers' feces corresponds to productivity gradients in the landscape, and whether herbivores and carnivores differ in the types of seeds they transport. Methods In California, we surveyed fecal deposition by vertebrates in 10 serpentine grassland fragments of varying productivities. We analyzed nitrogen content of feces before performing a germination assay to identify species transported therein. Results Herbivores deposited substantial amounts of nitrogen in serpentine grasslands via their feces, while carnivore scat was a high-quality but less predictable resource subsidy. Neither trophic group's fecal deposition reinforced or diluted productivity gradients in the landscape. Rather, unproductive fragments received minimal nutrients, while more productive fragments had the chance of receiving higher resource inputs. Feces from both types of consumers contained viable seeds, but herbivores and carnivores transported non-overlapping subsets of plant species. Conclusions Consumers play different roles connecting plant communities in the landscape according to trophic level. Small herbivores are a continuous source of nutrient cycling, and their feces contains serpentine-adapted plant species, potentially serving as vectors for stepping-stone dispersal. While carnivores may be important vectors for long-distance seed dispersal, their movement patterns also make them more likely to deposit seeds in unsuitable environments.

AB  - Context Domesticated animals play a central role in agricultural landscapes. However, livestock has been scarcely studied from a spatial perspective. Mapping of livestock diversity has been limited by the lack of distribution and demography data. This shortfall limits both the reach of actions aimed to conserve threatened breeds and their consideration as a tool for improving sustainability in livestock landscapes. Objectives To analyse environmental drivers of local grazing livestock breed-those autochthonous to a specific region-distributions and delineate livestock ecoregions, i.e. areas where certain groups of breeds exhibit similarly response to environmental factors in their distribution. Methods We used non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering to explore the distribution of the areas of origin of 119 local livestock breeds of the bovine, ovine, caprine, equine and asinine species. In addition, we performed randomisations and preference index to establish livestock ecoregions. Results Our results show contrasting spatial distributions of grazing local breeds across the studied species, explained by environmental factors. The distribution of cattle breeds is determined by the temperate influence of Atlantic Ocean, while sheep breeds are related to more continental climates, especially to those of the central Iberian plateau. Goat breeds are associated with limiting factors in the context of the Mediterranean climate, such as the seasonality of precipitation, and equine breeds are adapted to particular regions, reaching areas at the environmental extremes. The partitioning of the geographic and environmental space is reflected in the livestock ecoregions. Conclusions Livestock intraspecific diversity has acted as an adaptive response of domesticated grazing animals to specific environmental conditions. Our delineation of livestock ecoregions could aid to move towards more sustainable agricultural and livestock landscapes and help in the conservation of agrobiodiversity.

AB  - Forests of the eastern US have exhibited widespread taxonomic shifts involving decreasing abundances of many species of Quercus, Pinus and Carya and increasing abundances of many species of Acer, Fagus, Prunus as well as other genera. These taxonomic changes have been called mesophication and explained variously as decreased tolerance of fire, drought, and heat; decreased palatability for deer browsing; and increased tolerance of shade. The major driver of those shifts in taxonomy and ecological traits has been attributed to decreased surface burning due to Native American depopulation, cessation of settler-colonial land clearance, larger deer populations, and decreased drought, among other drivers. We endeavored to test which traits exhibited the most mesophication and which environmental factors best predicted that mesophication. We collected size-stratified taxonomic data for 2488 trees from 160 plots, converted that into measures of mesophyticness for each trait in each plot, and then inferred mesophication in each plot as the difference between the mesophyticness of small trees and large trees. Mesophyticness of each trait ranged from zero for a xerophytic trait to one for a mesophytic trait. We also collected site-specific data for 22 potential environmental predictors of trait changes (including abiotic, biotic, anthropogenic, and spatial predictors). All traits exhibited strong mesophication; these are, in descending order of percent of sites with strong mesophication: fire tolerance, white-tailed deer browse preference, Native American diet tree, cold tolerance, shade tolerance, drought tolerance, and general browse preference. For all traits, mesophication of small relative to large trees was greatest in plots where large trees were xerophytic, and least where large trees were mesophytic. We further found that mesophication was similar for plots regardless of the abundance or presence of Quercus, indicating that mesophication is not the same as oak decline. A diverse set of predictors best explained mesophication of taxonomic and ecological traits, but three were consistently chosen: cooler summer temperature, higher small tree density, and shorter distance to pre1700 Native American towns. In addition to mesophication, there was also some evidence of xerophication, most strongly for an increase in heat tolerance as might be expected due to recent climate change. Our results show that forest mesophication is a complex syndrome involving changes in independent species traits that are driven by many environmental factors, creating a challenge for land managers.

AB  - Simple Summary Water buffalo meat and milk consumption has increased in recent years. This species is difficult to stun due to its skull conformation, affecting proper and effective stunning using conventional equipment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the stunning procedure of water buffaloes, using pneumatic mechanical stunning equipment most used in the American continent, by assessing an adequate site for frontal stunning. The results showed that the anatomical site proposed by the authors had a 95% effectiveness at the first shot. This finding is highly important as it significantly improves the welfare of water buffaloes taken to slaughter, one of the most stressful stages of their lives, providing a prompt unconscious state, as in cattle. An effective frontal stunning procedure in water buffaloes was assessed using a pneumatic penetrating captive bolt (PPCB) with high air pressure. The study contemplated two phases; first, 352 buffaloes and 168 post-mortem heads were evaluated to determine the most effective anatomical site for stunning. Then, the second phase (n = 182) was used to validate the stunning procedure at the discovered anatomical site in the first phase, which was located 8 cm dorsal above the middle of the forehead on an "X" formed between the eyes and the base of the contralateral horns, and 2 cm lateral, avoiding the midline, where the skull tended to narrow. A total of 95.1% of buffaloes received effective stunning at the first shot with evidence of the presence of collapse, absence of rhythmic breathing, and absence of ocular reflexes (corneal and palpebral). There were no differences in the stunning efficacy by sex, breed, or skull thickness. These findings demonstrated that stunning with a PPCB at pressures of 1379-1516.8 KPa (200-220 pounds per square inch (psi)) in the site reported here produces a highly effective stunning at the first shot in water buffaloes.

AB  - Understanding which variables mediate people's attitudes towards wildlife species is fundamental for improving human-wildlife coexistence in increasingly human-dominated landscapes. Based on questionnaire responses (a total of n = 589 responses, of which n = 459 were complete and used for statistical analysis), we investigated the attitudes of visitors to two wildlife parks located in different states of Germany towards three returning wildlife species: European bison (Bison bonasus), moose (Alces alces) and grey wolf (Canis lupus). We used a principal component analysis (PCA) and summarized responses to 13 questions pertaining to attitudes towards each species. Using the loadings of the first dimension of each species-specific PCA as the response variable, we fitted generalized linear models to assess how sociodemographic background and formal knowledge influenced people's attitudes. Our comparative, multi-species approach revealed the presence of both species-specific and universal factors influencing attitudes towards wildlife species. Respondents' gender, exposure, and negative experiences with a target species all had varying effects across species-specific models. Effects of age, residential context, and knowledge of wildlife were relatively consistent for all three species. Older visitors (>= 60 years of age) had more negative attitudes compared to other age groups; positive attitudes were more prevalent in respondents residing in urban areas while negative attitudes were linked to people residing in rural areas, and higher knowledge of wildlife species was associated with more positive attitudes. While all species-specific models explained relatively small amounts of the observed variation in people's attitudes to these iconic wildlife species, our findings provide quantitative evidence that enhancing people's knowledge about wildlife could be a key strategy for improving attitudes towards wildlife. Hence, environmental education programs and outreach activities are likely a crucial first step towards creating awareness, ultimately contributing to more sustainable human-nature relationships.

AB  - The Japanese serow, Capricornis crispus, is a species endemic to Japan, residing in the mountainous forests of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Gunma Prefecture, situated in central Honshu, is one of its habitats. To evaluate the genetic diversity and interrelationships among local populations in Gunma Prefecture, we examined the mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of 364 individuals. Our analysis, using all accessible Japanese serow sequences, revealed that they can be broadly categorized into four clades, labeled I to VI. Within Gunma Prefecture, we identified 15 distinct haplotypes, which can be classified into three haplogroups: G1, G2, and G3. G1, included in clade I, is associated with those reported in northeastern Honshu. G2, which forms clade IV on its own, is predominantly endemic to Gunma Prefecture, with a frequency of 90% in Showa Village at the western base of Mt. Akagi. In contrast, G3, included in clade V, forms a sister group to the haplotype discovered in the Japanese Alps. The haplotype composition exhibited a stark contrast between the regions on the west and east sides of the Kanto Plain, indicating that the Kanto Plain serves as a dividing line for Japanese serow populations. In Tsumagoi Village, 134 out of 144 animals shared the same haplotype, resulting in extremely low haplotype diversity, as indicated by a significant negative value in neutrality tests. This finding aligns with the observed rapid increase in serow in Tsumagoi.

AB  - Aim: Plant populations are declining in their native ranges around the globe through the expansion of agriculture, urbanization, and plant invasions. We test the hypothesis that animal species that have spent more of their evolutionary history in a region are more dependent on native plants, particularly those plants that have spent more of their evolutionary history in the region, and are therefore more negatively impacted by native plant decline.
   Location: Yarra Valley landscapes, Australia.
   Methods: We test the presence and pattern of phylogenetic signal in native bee community responses to local flower density of ancient Australian plant lineages and the amount of native vegetation in the surrounding landscape across farm and native vegetation sites. We also test phylogenetic signal in the frequency of bee visitation to flowers from ancient Australian plant lineages. We compare the patterns of phylogenetic signal to the current understanding of bee biogeographic histories to evaluate our hypothesis.
   Results: There was significant phylogenetic signal in responses to flower density of plants from ancient Australian lineages, and the frequency of visitation to these flowers, with most species from the ancient Australian bee Glade being positively associated with these flowers. This is consistent with our hypothesis. Significant phylogenetic signal in response to native vegetation in the surrounding landscape was driven primarily by the more recently arrived bee linages, with ancient lineages able to persist on some farms where ancient Australian flowers were present (e.g. on roadsides).
   Main conclusions: Bee species that have spent more of their evolutionary history in Australia are more dependent on ancient Australian plant lineages and so most negatively impacted by the decline of these plants. This may be a broader phenomenon because phylogenetic conservatism in host plant use, the main assumption underlying our hypothesis, is common among herbivorous arthropods (similar to 500,000 species).

AB  - Ecological and environmental factors can influence the transmission of infectious diseases. They can accomplish this via effects on host susceptibility and exposure to infection, which are governed by host physiology and behavior, respectively. To better inform disease control, more information is needed about how extrinsic factors affect physiological and behavioral processes that determine transmission. We investigated how heterospecific competitors and seasonality may influence host susceptibility and intraspecific contact rates using a directly transmitted disease system, the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)-Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) system. In grasslands of western Montana, USA, deer mice compete with dominant voles (Microtus spp.) and shrews (Sorex spp.) and experience a seasonal temperate climate. Higher SNV transmission occurs primarily during spring/summer, when changes in physiology and behavior may serve as influential contributors. We hypothesized that (1) voles, and to a lesser extent shrews, will induce chronic stress, suppress immunity, and may change contact rates of deer mice; and (2) during spring/summer, deer mice may experience chronic stress, suppressed immunity, and higher contact rates, which may help explain the reported seasonality in SNV transmission. Over two years, we trapped small mammals at four grids in western Montana. Deer mice were sampled for feces and blood and evaluated for scar numbers, demography, and body condition scores (BCSs). We evaluated stress physiology with fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs), neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratios and BCSs, immunity with white blood cell (WBC) counts, and contact rates with scar numbers. We found that shrew density was negatively associated with stress response FCMs, suggestive of chronic stress. Additionally, although complex interactions existed, shrew and vole densities were negatively associated with BCSs, but differentially with scar numbers. N/L ratios were higher in spring/summer, whereas WBC counts were lower in summer, suggestive of chronic stress and suppressed immunity, respectively. Our results suggest that (1) heterospecific competitors may differentially influence disease transmission via stress physiology and contact rates, and that (2) chronic stress, suppressed immunity, and higher contact rates may help explain why higher SNV transmission has been previously reported during spring/summer in Montana. Our findings may extend to other directly transmitted disease systems.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict has emerged as a nexus of diverse factors. Although the conservation plans have successfully increased the density of wildlife, such as tigers and rhinos in Nepal, the human-wildlife conflict remained inevitable. This article reviews several articles based on the status and patterns of human-wildlife conflict in Nepal and its mitigating measures. The human population is steadily increasing, as is the desire for infrastructure, resulting in the deterioration and loss of wildlife habitats such as forests. These processes have increased wildlife competition for food and territory, shifting their habitats towards the farmlands and human settlements. Likewise, climate change has increased wildlife's environmental, physiological, and hormonal stress, causing them to become more aggressive and threatening human-wildlife harmony. In this scenario, the actions on biodiversity conservation would reach the climax only if the necessary approaches are sought to manage the conflicts. An appropriate relocation approach with post-monitoring and health surveillance in wildlife-friendly landscapes could control human-wildlife conflicts with the support of the local communities and relevant governmental and non-governmental authorities. Likewise, transboundary coordination with neighboring countries, cooperation among all related stakeholders, and transparent science-based conservation management can help reduce human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Subtropical coral reefs such as the lagoonal reefs of Norfolk Island in the remote South Pacific are vastly understudied, with many benthic species unrecorded in the scientific literature. Here we report on ascidian populations from 2021 to 2023 at Norfolk Islands inshore reefs. Quantitative assessments spanning that period were conducted to assess ascidian presence, cover, and benthic interactions. We show ascidian cover remained persistently low and stable across the lagoonal reefs during the study period. We find adjacent reef site, Cemetery Bay showed variation in ascidian cover over time, where we measure a 3.2-fold increase in cover over 2 years. Ascidians were associated primarily with sand and sediment substrates at all reef locations. Recorded interactions between hard corals and ascidians were low. This study provides valuable insights into the population dynamics of ascidians within subtropical reef ecosystems. Ongoing ascidian population monitoring can provide a comprehensive understanding of ascidian dynamics whilst also providing insight of theimpact of anthropogenic stressors on benthic communities. Together, this can aid in informing management and conservation strategies for subtropical reefs.

AB  - The morphological plasticity of the Sus scrofa wild-domestic species complex is evident in both free-ranging morphotypes and domestic breeds. The Brazilian Pantanal feral hog ("porco-monteiro") evolved after a long-term feralization process and represents a significant proportion of the mammalian biomass in the region. Its coexistence with native fauna brings several ecological impacts, which are mitigated by the Brazilian Pantanal wetland vastness and resource availability. They are a local subsistence game resource but also impact crops and pastures. Around the 2000s to mid-2010s, numerous European wild boar were introduced in Brazil to fulfill a demand for gourmet meat. Wild boar was also introduced to the Brazilian Pantanal as a game species and to breed with porco-monteiro feral hogs in a commercial venture to produce an even more exotic meat. The craze for wild boar meat has since dwindled, but their populations remain widespread and uncontrolled. Moreover, the full impact of the wild boar introduction on feral hog populations is still unknown. This study analyzes the skulls of porco-monteiro feral hogs from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s to assess possible morphological and functional variations along with skulls of wild boar and hybrids from Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil. The results indicate a trend of broadening of feral hog skulls at the coronal plane and a progressive reduction of the semispinalis capitis muscle scars over the decades. Biomechanical analysis denoted a decrease in head-elevation force that could affect the rooting performance of the latest feral hog morphotypes. Taken together, results show that wild boars likely influenced the evolution of the Pantanal feral hog skull. The magnitude of ecomorphological implications of these morphofunctional changes is unknown, as well as its effects in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland ecology.
   Pantanal Wetland feral hogs have coexisted with indigenous mammal species for about 175 years in Central Brazil. In the last 20 years, European wild boars were introduced in this region as game species and started to breed with these feral hogs leading to unpredictable morphological and ecological alterations.
   A plasticidade morfol & oacute;gica da esp & eacute;cie Sus scrofa fica evidente na complexidade dos morfotipos de vida livre e das ra & ccedil;as dom & eacute;sticas. O porco feral do Pantanal brasileiro (porco-monteiro) evoluiu ap & oacute;s um processo de feraliza & ccedil;& atilde;o de longo prazo e tem peso significativo na biomassa regional de mam & iacute;feros. Sua conviv & ecirc;ncia com a fauna nativa traz diversos impactos ecol & oacute;gicos, que s & atilde;o mitigados pela vastid & atilde;o do Pantanal brasileiro e pela disponibilidade de recursos. Eles s & atilde;o um importante recurso como ca & ccedil;a de subsist & ecirc;ncia, mas tamb & eacute;m impactam planta & ccedil;& otilde;es e pastagens. Por volta dos anos 2000 e meados de 2010, o javali europeu foi massivamente introduzido no Brasil para atender uma demanda por carne gourmet. Tamb & eacute;m foi introduzido no Pantanal brasileiro como esp & eacute;cie cineg & eacute;tica e para procriar com o porco-monteiro em um empreendimento comercial para produzir uma carne ainda mais ex & oacute;tica. A mania pela carne de javali diminuiu, mas diversas popula & ccedil;& otilde;es ficaram dispersas e sem controle. Ainda assim, a extens & atilde;o total do impacto da introdu & ccedil;& atilde;o de javalis nas popula & ccedil;& otilde;es de porcos selvagens & eacute; desconhecida. Este estudo analisou cr & acirc;nios de porcos ferais pantaneiros das d & eacute;cadas de 1990, 2000 e 2010 para avaliar poss & iacute;veis varia & ccedil;& otilde;es morfol & oacute;gicas e funcionais. Tamb & eacute;m analisamos cr & acirc;nios de javalis e h & iacute;bridos da Argentina, Uruguai e Sul do Brasil. Os resultados indicam uma tend & ecirc;ncia de alargamento no plano coronal do cr & acirc;nio dos porcos ferais, mas uma redu & ccedil;& atilde;o progressiva das cicatrizes do m & uacute;sculo semispinalis capitis ao longo das d & eacute;cadas.

AB  - Organic amendments can improve soil fertility and microbial diversity, making agroecosystems more resilient to stress. However, it is uncertain whether organic amendments will enhance the functional capacity of soil microbial communities, thereby mitigating fluctuations in microbial respiration caused by environmental changes. Here, we examined the impacts of long-term organic amendments on the dynamics of microbial catabolic capacity (characterized by enzyme activities and carbon source utilization) and microbial respiration, as well as their interrelationships during a period with fluctuating temperature and rainfall in the field. We then subjected the field soil samples to laboratory heating disturbances to further evaluate the importance of microbial catabolic capacity in explaining patterns of microbial respiration. In both field and laboratory experiments, organic amendments tended to increase the stability of microbial catabolic capacity, but significantly increased the vulnerability of microbial respiration to environmental changes. However, the direction and driving factors of microbial respiration affected by environmental changes differed between the field and laboratory experiments. Environmental changes in the field suppressed the promotional effects of organic amendments on microbial respiration mainly through reducing microbial catabolic capacity, while laboratory heating further enhanced microbial respiration mainly due to increased soil resource availability. Together, these findings suggest that increased microbial respiration variations under organic amendments may potentially increase the uncertainty in predicting soil carbon emissions in the scenario of ongoing climate/anthropogenic changes, and highlight the necessity of linking laboratory studies on environmental changes to field conditions.

AB  - Naturally fragmented indigenous forests in the southern Cape of South Africa are particularly understudied in terms of beetle diversity. This study therefore aimed to determine whether southern Afrotemperate forest dung and carrion beetle diversity differs between continuous forest and naturally occurring forest patches. Beetles were sampled from sixteen sites: eight within a continuous forest and eight within forest patches using three baited pitfall trap types (carrion, pig dung, and carrion plus pig dung). A total of 500 individual beetles were sampled from forest patches and 272 individual beetles from continuous forests. Forest patches supported a richer diversity of dung and carrion beetles (8 spp.) compared to continuous forests (3 spp.), and also supported a higher abundance of generalist species. More individuals and species were collected with a combination of carrion and pig dung while no species exclusively preferred the carrion bait. Body size of two beetle species differed between forest patches and continuous forests, though the pattern was contradictory. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis may explain these results, as forest patches often have human- or animal-made paths that traverse them, increasing their permeability. Predictably, the provision of ecosystem services is thus maintained, or even enhanced, in forest patches, highlighting their conservation significance.

AB  - Algal turfs significantly influence coral reef ecosystems by impacting benthic community structure and overall reef health through sediment trapping and accumulation, which are vital for nutrient retention and sediment stabilization. This study examines the spatial dynamics of algal turf height and sediment thickness across eight sites in the Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, covering an inshore-offshore gradient (1-62 km) from reefs near urbanized Makassar city to remote reefs. Measurements of algal turf height and sediment thickness on hard substrates and coral rubble at two depths revealed a clear inshore-offshore pattern. Reefs closer to the mainland had taller algal turfs and thicker sediment layers, transitioning from long sediment-laden algal turfs (LSATs) inshore to short productive algal turfs (SPATs) offshore. Algal turfs were taller on coral rubble but had thicker sediment on hard substrates. The study showed that algal turf height had strong positive associations with both organic and inorganic sediment loads, sediment thickness, and substrate type, but was negatively associated with relative organic loads. Algal turf height was negatively correlated with reef rugosity, indicating taller algal turfs are found where reef complexity is lower, which characterized reefs closer to the mainland. These results highlight a dual role of algal turfs: increasing total sediment trapping (absolute loads) but favouring inorganic sediment deposition more than organic sediment deposition as height increases. Herbivorous fish biomass did not significantly correlate with algal turf height, suggesting that bottom-up factors, rather than top-down control, may play a more critical role in this area. These findings highlight the intricate interactions between anthropogenic influences, environmental stressors, and reef ecosystem dynamics in the Spermonde Archipelago.

AB  - Background Locomotion is often a necessity for animal survival and can account for a large proportion of an individual's energy budget. Therefore, determining the energy costs of locomotion is an important part of understanding the interaction between an animal and its environment. Measures of animal acceleration, specifically 'dynamic body acceleration' (DBA) has proved to be a useful proxy of the energy cost of locomotion. However, few studies have considered the effects of interacting factors such as the animal's speed or changes to the terrain slope on the putative acceleration versus energy expenditure relationship and how this may affect the relationship between DBA and energy expenditure. Methods Here we conducted a methodological study to evaluate the ability of the metric 'vectorial dynamic body acceleration', VeDBA, obtained from tri-axial accelerometer data loggers, to act as a proxy for energy expenditure in non-uniform environments. We used indirect calorimetry to measure the oxygen consumption (V?O-2) of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) that were exposed to different ambient temperatures when immobile (resting) and that walked at various speeds (0.8 to 2.9 km h(-1)) and slope angles (- 6 degrees to 6 degrees) on a treadmill while simultaneously measuring tri-axial acceleration recorded at 40 Hz by body-mounted tags. Results The lower critical temperature of sheep was identified as 18 degrees C, and V?O-2 when they were immobile was 3.67 mL O-2 kg(-1) min(-1). There were positive relationships between V?O-2,O- VeDBA, and speed of walking. However, VeDBA correlated less well with V?O-2 when the terrain slope either inclined or declined. Conclusions We advocate caution when using DBA metrics for establishing energy use in animals moving over uneven terrain and suggest that each study species or location must be examined on a case-by-case basis. Reliance upon the relationship described between acceleration and energy expenditure on horizontal-surface treadmills can lead to potential under- or over-estimates of energy expenditure when animals walk on uneven or inclined ground.

AB  - The spatial distribution of resources affects ecological processes at alllevels of biological organization. However, it remains to be tested how thespatial configuration of belowground resources affects the communitydynamics of soil organisms and resulting plant-soil feedbacks. We used Agrostis stolonifera plants in different spatial configurations inmesocosms to study the dispersal patterns of soil nematodes and rotifers.Plant-soil feedbacks were later assessed by re-sowing the mesocosms withLolium perenne and Plantago lanceolata after removing all the initial A. stolonifera plants from the mesocosms. Bacterial-feeding nematodes androtifers spread fast, whereas plant-feeding nematodes barely dispersed fromthe release sites. These spread patterns of nematodes and rotifers dependedon the life-history traits and not on the spatial pattern of the plants.However, more clustered plants developed a higher total biomass and caused a reduced growth of the subsequent vegetation. Our results demonstrate that the mere spatial pattern of a single plantspecies can alter the strength of plant-soil feedbacks. This has importantimplications for understanding the impact of planting or replanting schemesand other changes in the spatial configuration of plants on long-termvegetation development and succession.

AB  - Black Carp Mylopharyngodon piceus were imported into the United States in the 1970s and 1980s for use in aquaculture; escape occurred and reported wild captures increased. Lacking species-specific capture methods, we assessed fisheries dependent incidental Black Carp catches for a common method, hoop nets, by kernel density analysis to identify an area of increased reporting and compare frequency of reports for water temperature, river stage, and capture date to identify seasonality. We then used fisheries independent effort to identify co-occurrence of species via non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and fit Black Carp catch and environmental covariates by generalized linear models to assess site-specific environmental covariates facilitating capture. The best approximating distribution was refitted for predictions and inference. The greatest density of fisheries dependent hoop net captures (39 %) was near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, primarily from July-September. Captures were characterized by median water temperature 26.7 degrees C, river stage 5.02 m, and 223 day-of-year (DOY; mid-August). Ordination of fisheries independent catch identified similarity in environmental covariates of Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus and Black Carp. The probability of capturing >= 1 Black Carp increased with DOY, decreased with increasing current velocity, and increased with depth. Most captures occurred in outside bends (87 %) or side channels (12 %). Probability of Black Carp capture was low but increased in summer and early fall when stage is lower, facilitating reduced current velocity and access to deeper areas. Results may be validated beyond this river segment to test if site-specific hydrology or habitat characteristics facilitated increased commercial and biologist capture and for replication.

AB  - The Indian bison, commonly called gaur (Bos gaurus gaurus), is native to South and Southeast Asia. In all its distribution ranges, the conservation status of the gaur lies between "vulnerable" and "endangered". In this study, we genotyped 70 free-ranging wild gaurs from the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), one of the first nine tiger reserves created in 1972 for tiger conservation in India. Fourteen microsatellite loci were genotyped in DNA extracted from the dung samples. An observed average heterozygosity of 0.726, evidence of gene flow was observed in the wild gaur population sampled from 11 locations in MTR. The effective population size (N-e) was 52.7. Approximate Bayesian computation analysis revealed population decline in the wild gaur population with the rise of mature Indus civilization similar to 2880 years ago. The population decline intensified during the reign of the medieval Monarch, extending further with the arrival of the British similar to 250 years ago. Our analyses detect population recovery in the free-ranging gaur population of MTR around 66 years ago, a time period coinciding with the independence of India followed by the implementation of the Indian wildlife protection act in the year 1972. The genetic data were discussed in the background of anthropology, archaeology and history of the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - Fish biologists have long assumed a link between intestinal length and diet, and relative gut length or Zihler's index are often used to classify species into trophic groups. This has been done for specific fish taxa or specific ecosystems, but not for a global fish dataset. Here, we assess these relationships across a dataset of 468 fish species (254 marine, 191 freshwater, and 23 that occupy both habitats) in relation to body mass and fish length. Herbivores had significantly relatively stouter bodies and longer intestines than omni- and faunivores. Among faunivores, corallivores had longer intestines than invertivores, with piscivores having the shortest. There were no detectable differences between herbivore groups, possibly due to insufficient understanding of herbivorous fish diets. We propose that reasons for long intestines in fish include (i) difficult-to-digest items that require a symbiotic microbiome, and (ii) the dilution of easily digestible compounds with indigestible material (e.g., sand, wood, exoskeleton). Intestinal indices differed significantly between dietary groups, but there was substantial group overlap. Counter-intuitively, in the largest dataset, marine species had significantly shorter intestines than freshwater fish. These results put fish together with mammals as vertebrate taxa with clear convergence in intestine length in association with trophic level, in contrast to reptiles and birds, even if the peculiar feeding ecology of herbivorous fish is probably more varied than that of mammalian herbivores.

AB  - The creation and expansion of protected areas, coupled with wildlife reintroductions, are increasingly used as conservation measures to combat wildlife declines worldwide. Although these types of restoration efforts are expected be beneficial to wildlife populations, variable species management and interactions among species within complex food webs have the potential to lead to unintended species-specific responses to reserve expansion which can counteract the anticipated positive effects. We used a multi-season camera trap study to investigate community-wide responses of wildlife to a reserve expansion and associated wildlife releases in South Africa. We analyzed the camera trap data using community occupancy and N-mixture models to assess how the occupancy and intensity of use of individual species changed in the four seasons following reserve expansion. We found species-specific responses to reserve expansion, although responses were generally positive in occupancy and intensity of use but un-sustained. The apex predator, the lion (Panthera leo) and the majority of managed herbivores exhibited sustained or delayed positive responses, whereas most subordinate predators and unman-aged herbivores had short-lived, fluctuating, or neutral responses. Interactive effects of top-down suppression, competitive pressure, and increased space and food resources likely resulted in the temporally-variable responses of most species. Although no species responded negatively to reserve expansion and mammal reintroductions, the lack of sustained positive responses for most species indicates the complexities of implementing conservation actions to benefit multiple wildlife species. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring the entire wildlife community following management actions such as reserve expansion or wildlife reintroductions.

AB  - The natural regeneration of the temperate oak forests is often insufficient. Acorns of the oak serve as the basis of the recruitment and key food resources in these ecosystems, thus the crop size, the germination success and seed predators have crucial roles in the process. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is often considered as one of the main mitigating agents in oak regeneration. Therefore, in our study we analyzed and compared the spatial patterns of the acorn density and the patches rooted by wild boar within and among the different examined time intervals in a 28 ha Turkey-sessile oak (Quercus cerris, Q. petraea) forest stand. Data were collected between 2016 October and 2019 December. In the acorn density patterns, intra-annual similarities were recognized mainly, regardless of the crop size. Meanwhile, rooting patterns showed inter- and intra-annual similarities in mast years and intra-annual overlaps in non-mast years, indicating that masting is a fundamental driver of wild boar foraging behavior. However, a direct local connection between the rooting intensity and the acorn density could not be shown, as wild boars never fully depleted the acorns, even in intensively used patches. This study can help in predicting the intensively rooted forest patches, providing opportunities to manage wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are designated as Threatened or Endangered in Canada, with many populations being at risk of extirpation. Approaches for caribou conservation can be both invasive and expensive. For example, maternity penning involves the relocation of pregnant females to a predator-free fenced enclosure where they are held for 20-22 weeks. This activity greatly reduces the risk of predation for adult females and their dependent calves, but requires the construction, maintenance, and monitoring of a penning facility as well as the risk associated with the capture and transport of adult caribou. With only four maternity pen trials within the last decade, there has been little study of the potential influence of maternity penning on the distribution and habitat use of caribou after release. We used Brownian Bridge Movement Models to examine changes in range fidelity and overall range use of the Klinse-Za caribou herd in north-central British Columbia, Canada, following eight years of maternity penning. We generated annual home range utilisation distributions and examined the space use of caribou among years and between penned and unpenned animals, as well as pre-penning and post-penning time periods. We found that following penning, caribou shifted distribution to areas near maternity pens and expanded their overall use of range. However, caribou did not shift their distribution relative to the elevation of their mountainous habitats. Our results suggest that caribou can adapt to capture and forced displacement without altering patterns of instinctual or learned habitat use.

AB  - While substantial nitrogen (N) input from yak urine in intensively grazed grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is well documented, the species-specific responses of dominant forage plants-particularly regarding N uptake efficiency, environmental impacts, and associated microbial dynamics-remain poorly understood. This study investigated Elymus nutans (Gramineae) and Kobresia graminifolia (Cyperaceae), two ecologically dominant species, to elucidate the divergent nitrogen transformation features under urine deposition. During the growing season, we simulated yak urine input by applying 640 mL urine per 40 cm x 40 cm patch in natural grasslands. Over six weeks, we measured total plant N uptake and soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and evaluated soil nitrification rates through a 2-week indoor incubation experiment. To elucidate the underlying microbial mechanisms, we analysed the abundance and composition of rhizosphere ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB). Results showed that K. graminifolia exhibited significantly lower soil nitrification rates and N2O emissions but higher total N uptake compared to E. nutans. Furthermore, K. graminifolia soil had lower AOB and higher AOA abundances. Specifically, the relative abundances of Nitrosophaera and Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus within AOA, as well as Nitrosovibrio and Nitrosomonas within AOB, were higher in K. graminifolia soil. These findings indicate that variations in nitrifier populations may be key drivers of differences in N uptake and N2O emissions across dominant forage species. This study provides valuable insights for developing effective management strategies for intensively grazed grasslands on the QTP.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - 1. Few empirical studies have described social-ecological systems (SESs) in transition. Some studies focused on external drivers that impact the SES and communities' responses to adapt to changes, including economic, land and conservation policies. Others have considered the effect of social and cultural changes on communities' capacity to sustain their activities. While sociocultural changes are increasingly common through globalization and world-wide economic development, there is an urgent need to better understand and document how these changes affect individual and community agency to adapt or transform a system that is facing a combination of powerful internal and external forces.
   2. The human-Asian elephant relationship appears particularly illustrative of a complex SES because of the dual status of the elephant being wild or under human care, and the entanglement of ecological, cultural, social and economic dimensions. The ongoing and rapid political, socio-economic and environmental changes occurring in Laos for the last decades have strongly affected this relationship.
   3. We conducted an ethnological survey to assess how the SES has evolved in Laos and its consequences for human-wild-captive elephant interactions and elephant handling practices. We show that in the 1990s, the SES was based on the principles of common access to natural resources and social control over nature and spirits, and led to a form of elephant handling with close interactions between captive and wild elephants. Husbandry practices then could be likened to pastoralism as a mode of production associated with a mode of relation close to seasonal freedom.
   4. Since the turn of the present century, the commodification of nature and of increasingly divided access to natural resources led eventually to the segregation of wild elephants and captivity of their working conspecifics. With the intensification of workload, owners switched to a ranching-like economy, based on the accumulation of monetary capital from the employment of elephants in logging or tourism.
   5. We discuss how the combination of external drivers, such as economic liberalization, land and conservation policies, and internal drivers linked to sociocultural changes could affect a SES in transition, leading to a fading interest of the new generation in their family heritage.

AB  - An overabundance of western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) can detrimentally impact agriculture and compete with threatened fauna for food resources. In Paruna Wildlife Sanctuary, south-western Western Australia, kangaroos are common and widespread. By contrast, the endangered black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) are spatially constrained to rock refuges. Weinvestigated the potential for dietary competition between these two species by measuring the overlap in their diets, spatial overlap in their foraging patches, and comparing their diets with food resource availability. A combination of scat analysis, passive IR camera trapping and vegetation surveys were employed around rock outcrops used by rock-wallabies within the sanctuary. Rock-wallaby diets were dominated by forbs, overlapping 56% with kangaroo diet, which included mostly browse and forbs. Some of their shared preferred food resources were spatially and/or temporally limited, suggesting potential competition for these food plants. There was also a 33% spatial overlap of foraging patches between the two species. The dietary and spatial overlap detected between rock-wallabies and kangaroos suggest there is potential for resource competition, which may be exacerbated if kangaroo numbers increase. Future conservation actions include monitoring western grey kangaroo densities and food plant availability. Population control for kangaroos may be required, particularly for increasingly hot and dry years, as predicted under climate change.

AB  - The livelihoods of local farmers and game ranchers in Africa - and the communities these businesses support - are threatened by tick-borne diseases that kill and weaken livestock. Understanding the local ecology of ticks may inform cost-effective and sustainable techniques for controlling tick populations. Our objective was to describe differences in tick abundance, species richness, and community structure in three different habitats from June-July 2022 on a game reserve in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Ticks were sampled using the drag method, in 54 30 m x 5 m transects evenly distributed across bushveld, long grass, and short grass habitats. Total tick abundance and species richness were significantly greater in long grass than in bushveld and short grass. Although there were no significant differences among the habitats in Simpson's diversity, the composition of the communities did vary significantly, with the relative abundances of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi evertsi peaking in long grass, Amblyomma hebraeum peaking in bushveld, and R. decoloratus peaking in short grass. Differences in habitat suitability for ticks and habitat use by ungulate hosts may explain the significant effect of habitat on tick abundance, species richness, and community structure.

AB  - This paper investigates the paleoecology of the Neogene savanna in the northern Black Sea region during the late Miocene, focusing on the "Hipparion fauna" that inhabited the area. The study explores the dietary habits of various ungulates and carnivorans through dental mesowear and microwear patterns, aiming to infer aspects of trophic interactions and ecological niches occupied by different species. The research covers three sites that span from the late Khersonian (late Tortonian; MN11) to the late Maeotian (Messinian; MN13) stages. We report catastrophic bone accumulation at the Grebeniki and Cioburciu 1 sites. Results indicate a significant dietary diversity that is challenging the traditional assumptions about the "Hipparion fauna". Rhinoceroses, specifically Chilotherium schlosseri and Aceratherium incisivum, are identified as true grazers, contradicting previous beliefs about their preference for forested or swampy ecosystems. The hipparions, traditionally considered open landscape foragers, are revealed as browsers or mixed-feeders. The study also highlights the diverse dietary traits among small antelopes, giraffids, and suids, emphasizing their adaptability to various environmental conditions. Data obtained on the hyaenid Adcrocuta eximia indicate a diet very similar to that of the bone-cracking spotted hyena. The microwear pattern of the cubs was very different from both adults and any other carnivorans used for comparison. The large felid Machairodus copei was characterized by a hypercarnivorous diet similar to lions, while smaller-size Ictitherium viverrinum was characterized by a more opportunistic feeding strategy. These findings suggest similarities and differences in feeding patterns between modern and Neogene savanna mammals. The presence of both grazing and browsing herbivores indicates a more heterogeneous landscape, with a mixture of open grasslands and denser vegetation. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the changing paleoenvironment, suggesting a transition from wooded grasslands to open landscapes during the late Miocene. Overall, this research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the Neogene savanna ecosystem and challenges existing perceptions of the paleoecology of the "Hipparion fauna" in the northern Black Sea region.

TI  - Understanding the co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and non-native species can inform more effective approaches to conservation: the example of pigs (pua'a; Sus scrofa) in Hawai'i

AB  - Indigenous resource management (IRM) is dynamic and ever evolving, in part because it is based on co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and the biodiversity around them. Forms of conservation imposed on Indigenous people and places by settler-colonialism tend to idealise pre-human and human-excluded environments, leading to conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Indigenous communities detrimental to conservation goals. Conservation efforts that align with IRM and acknowledge the co-evolutionary relationships at the foundation of Indigenous culture can lead to more effective conservation efforts. In Hawai'i, the evolving relationship between Kanaka (Hawaiians) and pua'a (pigs; Sus scrofa) has been the flash point of conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Hawaiian communities. This paper examines the co-evolving relationships between Hawaiians and pigs in an effort to better balance the conservation efforts aimed at controlling invasive species with the State of Hawai'i's obligation to support Indigenous practices and public hunting. We conducted this research by investigating archival Hawaiian language resources, which allowed us to resurrect knowledge lost to time and pinpoint key historical changes over the past 250 years. Our results elucidate this co-evolutionary relationship that shifted from an animal-husbandry relationship to a hunter-prey relationship in the first half of the 19th century. This change in the trajectory of the co-evolutionary relationship was a result of various shifts throughout Hawaiian socio-ecological systems, and therefore necessitates adaptive governance relating to management of and access to pigs. We conclude that Indigenous perspectives offer opportunities to transform conservation biology through multi-objective approaches that address both hunting and conservation goals.

AB  - An analysis of United States national forest inventory observations in the Laurentian Mixed Forest reveals a marked increase in forest disturbance between 1999 and 2015. The Laurentian Mixed Forest Province ecological subregion spans the northern sections of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin and includes forest area of between 16.7 and 17.5 million hectares depending on the year. Forest disturbance ranges from a low of 0.13 million hectares (0.8% of forest area) in 2000 to a high of 2.09 million hectares (11.9% of forest area) in 2014. The year 2015 is notable for being the first year since 2000 where forest disturbance declines, albeit modestly (11.4% of forest area). The marked increase is attributable to disturbances occurring continuously over time between remeasurement. Disturbances with the highest annual averages are insect damage to trees, disease damage to trees, and deer/ungulate at 291 thousand, 189 thousand, and 126 thousand hectares per year, respectively. Disturbances occurring in a specific year, what we term discrete disturbances, show no discernible trend during the period. The most extensive discrete disturbances are wind in 1999, 2011, and 2012 at 108 thousand, 62 thousand, and 61 thousand hectares, respectively. Standard estimates from national forest inventory lack specificity as to the actual year of the disturbance. The estimates reported here are actual annual estimates of disturbance that apply estimation methods accounting for the retrospective nature of the disturbance observation. The timing (year) and location (ecological section) of the two most extensive wind events coincide with historical records.

AB  - Parasitic plants are mostly viewed as pests. This is caused by several species causing serious damage to agriculture and forestry. There is however much more to parasitic plants than presumed weeds. Many parasitic plans exert even positive effects on natural ecosystems and human society, which we review in this paper. Plant parasitism generally reduces the growth and fitness of the hosts. The network created by a parasitic plant attached to multiple host plant individuals may however trigger transferring systemic signals among these. Parasitic plants have repeatedly been documented to play the role of keystone species in the ecosystems. Harmful effects on community dominants, including invasive species, may facilitate species coexistence and thus increase biodiversity. Many parasitic plants enhance nutrient cycling and provide resources to other organisms like herbivores or pollinators, which contributes to facilitation cascades in the ecosystems. There is also a long tradition of human use of parasitic plants for medicinal and cultural purposes worldwide. Few species provide edible fruits. Several parasitic plants are even cultivated by agriculture/forestry for efficient harvesting of their products. Horticultural use of some parasitic plant species has also been considered. While providing multiple benefits, parasitic plants should always be used with care. In particular, parasitic plant species should not be cultivated outside their native geographical range to avoid the risk of their uncontrolled spread and the resulting damage to ecosystems.

AB  - Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP), the largest national park of Canada, has unique and complex ecosystems that depend on specific water quantity and quality. We characterize groundwaters and surface waters in WBNP by determining their chemical compositions and water types, the dominant hydrochemical processes affecting their compositions, and their hydrochemical characteristics in relation to interpreted groundwater flow systems. Total Dissolved Solid concentrations in groundwaters and surface waters range from <= 10 mg/L to >= 300,000 mg/L. Four distinct water type groups are found: (1) Ca-SO4-type waters occur in multiple clusters across the area in outcrop areas of Devonian evaporites; (2) Na-Cl-type waters predominantly occur in the Salt plains region along the central eastern boundary, overlapping evaporite and carbonate-dominated bedrock formations; (3) Ca-HCO3-type waters dominate the Peace-Athabasca Delta-region in the south and most of the central region; and (4) "mixed" waters. Solutes in the waters originate from three main processes: dissolution of halite, dissolution of sulphate minerals, and dissolution of carbonates. The spatial occurrence of hydrochemical characteristics correlate with hypothesized groundwater flow systems, i.e., Ca-SO4 and Na-Cl-type waters coincide with discharge areas of intermediate to regional groundwater flow paths, and Ca-HCO3-type waters overlap with recharge areas. The findings of this study contribute to advancing knowledge on the hydrochemical characteristics of this remote and highly protected region of Alberta, Canada, and are important components of any further, comprehensive assessment of the natural water conditions.

AB  - Grazing exclusion is a common management strategy for improving grasslands degraded due to overgrazing. Although previous meta-analyses proved that grazing exclusion improved soil carbon (C) storage of grasslands in China, we know little about its effect on grassland ecosystems elsewhere and whether litter accumulation induced by grazing exclusion regulates soil C storage. Using meta-analysis, we integrated 91 publications to examine the effects of grazing exclusion on community litter and soil C storage, accompanied by analysis of the regulating roles of body size of herbivore, climatic conditions, and grazing exclusion duration. We found that grazing exclusion enhanced litter biomass and decomposition rate but did not change litter chemical quality. Generally, grazing exclusion enhanced plant production and soil C storage across grassland worldwide. Exclusion of medium and small herbivores had stronger effects on aboveground litter production and soil C storage than exclusion of large herbivores, and grazing exclusion's enhancement on litter production and soil C storage tended to increase as grazing exclusion proceeded. Notably, grazing exclusion-induced increase in aboveground litter biomass was attributed to the increase in biomass of graminoids, while root biomass, not aboveground litter biomass, primarily regulated the increase in soil C storage. The stimulating effect of grazing exclusion on soil C storage was enhanced possibly due to enhanced root biomass response along a precipitation gradient. Generally, our study provided new insights that management practice under grazing exclusion should take plant community dynamics, grazing exclusion duration, preceding grazer type, and climate conditions into account simultaneously.

AB  - Prey animals must balance the benefits of foraging in a particular area with their risk of predation in that area and often prioritize indirect cues to predation risk over direct cues of predators when making decisions about foraging under the risk of predation. Researchers using giving-up density (GUD) as a metric to assess perceived predation risk have found that it is affected by microhabitat, with certain animals willing to spend more time foraging (i.e., lower GUD) in relatively dense microhabitats and less time foraging (i.e., higher GUD) in relatively open microhabitats. This phenomenon has been attributed to those animals perceiving less predation risk when near or under shelter. However, the measurement has often confounded microhabitat density with distance from shelter in species without conspicuous dens. We measured GUD in foraging small mammals while experimentally manipulating microhabitat density and controlling for spatial location of the forager. Small mammals increased foraging (i.e., decreased GUD) as expected when we increased microhabitat density, but they did so despite those manipulations being randomly permuted spatially over the course of four rounds of data collection. Our results indicate that experimentally controlling for the potentially confounding effect of the forager's distance to a safe location, such as dens, nests, or other shelters, did not remove the effect of microhabitat density on perceived predation risk. Thus, our results suggest that an animal's perception of risk is likely mediated by both their location in their home range and the microhabitat at that location. We provide suggestions for further work.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change affects biological diversity by altering their suitable habitat ranges. The Himalayan region is one of the world's most sensitive biodiversity hotspots to global climate change. The Chitwan Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) in the central Himalayas serves as a vital north-south linkage among the protected areas in central Nepal and provides suitable habitats for threatened mammals in different ecological zones, such as snow leopards (in the alpine zone), Himalayan red panda (in the temperate zone), and one-horned rhinoceros (in the lowland tropical zone). The biodiversity of CHAL is threatened by climate change and land use alterations. This study assessed the potential impacts of climate and land cover changes on the above three key threatened mammals in CHAL by employing maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to predict the current potential habitat and project it for future climate change scenarios under different greenhouse gas concentrations. Further, we used the cellular automata and Markov Chain models to simulate and predict the temporal and spatial changes in land cover of CHAL. Our results indicate that the snow leopard and Himalayan red panda will experience more significant vulnerability than the one-horned rhinoceros in all future climate scenarios. Approximately 36.3% and 41.8% of the suitable habitat of the snow leopard and 32.5% and 56% of the Himalayan red panda in CHAL are projected to be lost in 2050 and 2070, respectively, under representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0). Climate refugia, representing areas of suitable habitat for 2070 (under the RCP6.0) in CHAL, are projected to cover 958 km2 (80.37% of the current range), 1052 km2 (43.73% of the current range), and 2375 km2 (58.21% of the current range) for one-horned rhinoceros, Himalayan red panda, and snow leopard, respectively. Among the land cover attributes in CHAL, snow cover is predicted to decrease by 24% in 2070. Our findings indicate that species inhabiting alpine and temperate environments are more susceptible to human-induced climate change than those inhabiting lowland tropical areas. These findings will help to implement the adaptation actions that are crucial to addressing future conservation challenges arising from climate and land cover change.

AB  - The temperature-humidity index (THI) has been commonly used to analyse heat stress in dairy cattle, but little is known about its effects on buffaloes. In this study, daily milk yield (MY), fat percentage (FP), protein percentage (PP) and somatic cell count (SCC) data from 808 buffalo cows plus environmental temperature and relative humidity were used to investigate the consequence of heat stress. Two mixed models were used to evaluate the impact of THI on MY, FP, PP and log transformed SCC (SCS). The effect of THI was significant for PP, FP and SCS, whereas its interaction with parity was statistically significant for PP and SCS. The relationship between PP and FP and THI was positive but of different magnitude according to the parity. When THI was below 62, an unfavourable effect was observed, especially in primiparous buffalo cows. A significant interaction between SCS and THI across parities was also observed. The effect of THI on MY across parities was not definite but overall a favourable relationship was observed. Our findings depict a susceptibility of buffaloes to low values of THI, suggesting an optimal THI range for water buffaloes between 59 and 63, although some deleterious effects were observed in primiparous buffaloes at THI values lower than 62. Additional investigations are needed to better elucidate the influence of THI on buffalo species.

AB  - Insect herbivores can directly affect plant reproduction by feeding on reproductive tissues, or indirectly by feeding on vegetative tissues for which plants are unable to compensate. Additionally, early arriving herbivores may have cascading effects on plant reproduction by altering the later arriving community. However, the dynamic interplay between plant development and the assembly of herbivore communities remains underexplored. Hence, it is unclear whether non-outbreak levels of ambient herbivory early in the development of plants can impact plant fitness and to what extent these effects are mediated through changes in plant development and subsequent herbivory. By excluding the herbivore community in an exclosure experiment and by manipulating early-season herbivory in a common garden field experiment replicated across four Brassicaceae species and 2 years, we tested whether early-season herbivory by caterpillars (Pieris rapae) or aphids (Myzus persicae) affected development, reproduction, and the herbivore communities associated with individual plants. In addition, we tested a causal hypothesis to assess the relative importance and temporal interplay between variation in herbivore communities and variation in plant development in determining plant reproduction. Early-season herbivory affected plant reproduction in the exclosure experiment, with effects being highly dependent on the plant species, the herbivore species and the year. However, we found no such effects in the field experiment. The exploratory path analysis indicated that variation in plant reproduction is best predicted by variation in plant development, explaining 80% of the total effect on seed production. This suggests early-season herbivory had limited effects on later plant development, and plants were able to attenuate the impact of early-season herbivory. However, no clear compensatory mechanism could be identified. While early-season herbivory has the potential to affect plant reproduction through changes in plant development or the subsequent development of the associated community, these effects were small and varied across closely related species. This suggests that plant species may be exposed to different levels of natural selection by early-season herbivores through plant- or community-mediated effects on reproduction.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - A Macrozone is a socioecological region with shared geographic and demographic characteristics. Within the Chilean Austral Macrozone (43 degrees to 56 degrees SL), the native temperate forests serve as a crucial resource, offering multiple ecosystem services to local communities. These forests significantly support animal husbandry practices involving cattle, horses and sheep. However, introducing these exotic species affects natural regeneration and compromises their long-term sustainability. This study proposes a new classification of the temperate forests in the Chilean Austral Macrozone based on structure parameters and determine their relationships with animal husbandry and natural regeneration. Data were obtained from Chile's National Forest Inventory (NFI) (2001-2010), including 195 inventory plots (500 m(2)) with 21 tree species. We redefined the forest categories described in NFI according to the proportional basal area of each tree species at each plot. We used two levels of analysis: forest composition (Level 1), which includes general categories such as mono-specific (dominated by a single tree species), bi-specific (dominated by two tree species), and multi-specific forests (dominated by multiple tree species), and forest type (Level 2), which includes specific species (e.g., Nothofagus pumilio) or species groups (e.g., N. pumilio - N. dombeyi) with economic relevance. We evaluated the data using univariate and multivariate analyses. We found 18 forest types in the Austral Macrozone, in contrast to the three traditionally recognized forest types used in the NFI (e.g., lenga, evergreen, coihue de Magallanes). Livestock was observed in all forest types, where Nothofagus forests showed that regeneration in N. antarctica and N. pumilio were higher with livestock than without livestock breeding (Hedges' g > 0.51). The natural regeneration of the studied forests was influenced by animal husbandry, environmental variables (bioclimatic and topographic factors), and forest structure. Our data suggested the importance of using more forest types than the three classics to generate tools or recommendations that are more focused on the particularities of each one. The classification must be based on forest parameters obtained during NFI. The proposed forest type classification reflects the complexity and richness of the forests in a better way, which could improve forest management and the development of public policies related to climate change and sustainability. Finally, although livestock pressure was observed in all forest types, the impact over some areas (e.g., N. antarctica) needs special attention in the forest management and conservation planning for the Chilean Austral Macrozone.

AB  - Assessments of the potential responses of animal species to climate change often rely on correlations between long-term average temperature or precipitation and species' occurrence or abundance. Such assessments do not account for the potential predictive capacity of either climate extremes and variability or the indirect effects of climate as mediated by plant phenology. By contrast, we projected responses of wildlife in desert grasslands of the southwestern United States to future climate means, extremes, and variability and changes in the timing and magnitude of primary productivity. We used historical climate data and remotely sensed phenology metrics to develop predictive models of climate-phenology relations and to project phenology given anticipated future climate. We used wildlife survey data to develop models of wildlife-climate and wildlife-phenology relations. Then, on the basis of the modeled relations between climate and phenology variables, and expectations of future climate change, we projected the occurrence or density of four species of management interest associated with these grasslands: Gambel's Quail (Callipepla gambelii), Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamat), Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni), and American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). Our results illustrated that climate extremes and plant phenology may contribute more to projecting wildlife responses to climate change than climate means. Monthly climate extremes and phenology variables were influential predictors of population measures of all four species. For three species, models that included climate extremes as predictors outperformed models that did not include extremes. The most important predictors, and months in which the predictors were most relevant to wildlife occurrence or density, varied among species. Our results highlighted that spatial and temporal variability in climate, phenology, and population measures may limit the utility of climate averages-based bioclimatic niche models for informing wildlife management actions, and may suggest priorities for sustained data collection and continued analysis.

AB  - Understanding how water limitation affects the performance of herbivorous insects is relevant in a context of worldwide alterations of rainfall regimes due to climate change. Apart from its influence on insect growth and development, water availability has also been considered a cue for color polyphenism in some species. This is the case of the grassland-inhabiting admirable grasshopper (Syrbula admirabilis), for which water content in plant tissues, a potentially reliable cue to predict future vegetation conditions, has been proposed to determine the frequency of green-brown color morphs. We performed an experiment that manipulated water content of the diet (dry/wet treatment) in a group of individually monitored admirable grasshoppers to explore the effects on imago size, timing of female first mating, and coloration. Our results showed that grasshoppers in the wet treatment achieved larger sizes, and females mated comparatively earlier, than their counterparts in the dry treatment. We also found that hue (the dominant color) in imagines was significantly lower (browner) than in nymphs, but the magnitude of this color shift did not differ between treatments. This study supports the idea that water limitation has a negative impact on grasshopper growth and development, but rules out dietary water content as a cue for color polyphenism. This result encourages additional research to assess the actual contribution of environmental and genetic factors to color determination in admirable grasshoppers. Such information could help to better understand how color polymorphism is maintained in natural populations and to predict how it could evolve in a future in which environmental conditions will become more unpredictable.

AB  - Kelps dominate rocky shores in temperate latitudes, acting as important foundation species. Recently, kelp forests have received growing attention for their decline around the world. Climate change is one of the main drivers of their deforestation, both through abiotic stress and/or distortion of biotic interactions. In NW Spain, golden kelp (Laminaria ochroleuca) forests have recently declined in some areas due to excessive grazing. To further investigate the mechanisms behind this decline, a thorough 1-year seasonal demographic study was carried out on eight golden kelp reefs: four healthy and four degraded by herbivory. Kelps covered the full range of size classes throughout the year on healthy reefs. By contrast, only small, newly recruited kelps were found on degraded reefs in spring-summer, because excessive herbivory in autumn-winter caused a total collapse of kelp populations on a reef-scale (i.e., all kelps reduced to inviable stubs with no blade and no growth meristem). Bite marks in kelps covering all size classes showed that fishes, instead of invertebrates, were the culprits of the excessive herbivory. Recent studies, mostly conducted in the Indo-Pacific, also found that fish herbivory, alone or in combination with abiotic stressors, can maintain a canopy-free state in kelp reefs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that fish is also shown to cause the collapse of entire kelp forests on a reef scale in the temperate Atlantic. The implications of this finding for the management and potential recovery of degraded reefs are discussed.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) has emerged as a growing concern for animal and public health due to its role as a reservoir for multiple pathogens, many notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health, and its high invasive potential. In countries like Argentina, this species poses a persistent threat to the swine industry. The potential introduction of exotic diseases, such as African swine fever, into wild boar populations presents a serious risk to national food security and international trade. The interface between wild boars and domestic pigs represents a critical spatial overlap where disease transmission may occur. Although risk mapping can support surveillance and control efforts, it remains challenging in data-scarce contexts. To address this, we applied expert elicitation within a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to identify areas at highest risk for wild boar-domestic pig interactions in Argentina. Model validation confirmed its effectiveness in identifying risk zones, with high and medium-risk areas mostly concentrated in C & oacute;rdoba, San Luis, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, La Pampa, and Entre R & iacute;os provinces. While most of the country exhibited an absence of risk, the identified medium- and high-risk areas warrant targeted mitigation efforts and active surveillance. This study provides a practical tool to guide surveillance strategies and demonstrates a replicable, knowledge-driven modeling approach suitable for data-limited environments.

TI  - Phenology of antler velvet shedding in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from central Nebraska
T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA  - English
KW  - NUTRIENT
AB  - Deer hunting is an important cultural attribute and economic contributor in the United States. Many states provide hunting opportunities for harvesting antlered males-some states as early as September, when males may retain velvet on antlers. Antler velvet is indicative of antler growth that occurs annually in male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Shedding of velvet occurs during a window between late August and September, but this time frame has not been formally described in wild populations from the United States. Herein, we established a baseline for velvet shedding in white-tailed deer in central Nebraska and compared shedding between different-aged males. This study used camera traps in riparian woodlands along the Platte and Loup rivers in areas with deer. Velvet shedding spanned about 35 days, with 95% of velvet shedding occurring by 17 September. The earliest observation of velvet shedding occurred on 22 August, whereas the latest observation of velvet retained on antlers was 25 September. Percentage of velvet-shed deer differed between 2 age groups through time (P < 0.01), with males >= 2.5 years old shedding velvet 13% sooner on average compared to 1.5-year-old males. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first documented antler-shedding phenology for a wild population of white-tailed deer in the United States. Our findings serve as a baseline for spatial and temporal comparisons between states and can be used by managers and wildlife agencies as they evaluate regulations and opportunities related to harvesting deer during early hunting seasons.

AB  - Grasslands cover one-third of the terrestrial area, though half of them have been degraded and primarily due to overgrazing. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is home to the largest area of alpine grassland on Earth, experiencing a typical degradation-restoration story over the past three decades. With the large-scale implementation and longterm duration of ecological projects aimed at restoring degraded grasslands by fencing across the TP, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of changes in the carbon (C) sink function. To address this, we combined ten pairs of systematic field observations at the site scale with literature compilation, aiming to clarify whether restoration still contributes to C uptake and its driving factors. Our results show that after a decade of restoration, living biomass was enhanced by over 80 %, and litter accumulation increased by 3.68 +/- 1.25 times across all ecosystem types, although these changes were barely reflected in soil C. Litter caused consistent negative impacts on CO2 uptake across all vegetation types, despite restoration having increased CO2 uptake by half in alpine steppes and alpine meadows. This negative impact was more evident in alpine wetlands, where the quantity of litter was double the living biomass. The thick layer of litter produced a shading effect that further limited the photosynthetic yield of living plants, regulating the restoration-induced CO2 gain or loss. Combining 246 cases across the TP further highlights the need to shorten the duration of restoration to maximize CO2 uptake while also benefitting sustainability, which is deserving of attention from both the scientific community and policy-makers.

AB  - Hunting for bushmeat in the tropics has become a major issue in terms of conservation and human health, especially in western and central Africa. In Cote d'Ivoire, despite a ban on hunting since 1974, the bushmeat trade is widespread. This situation has been exacerbated by the long-term socio-political unrest in Cote d'Ivoire, resulting in the lack of effective protection of protected areas (PAs). Our study was carried out in the central-west Department of Daloa. We conducted standard interviews with the six main traders of the markets to trace the geographical origin of the bushmeat, and quantify the number of animals sold by direct observations twice a week during 52 weeks. We used multiple regression analyses to identify combinations of variables (proportion of animals killed, mean body mass, total biomass, price of carcass, price per body mass) that influenced poaching pressure. A total of 955 carcasses were recorded in the central market of Daloa. This number includes 948 mammals (99 %), six reptiles (0.6 %), and one bird (0.1 %). Rodentia were the most frequently sold taxons by number of individuals (58 %), followed by Artiodactyla (35 %), Carnivora (4 %), and Primates (1 %). Almost half of the game originated from the Department of Zoukougbeu (42 %; N = 404), followed by the Departments of Daloa (29 %; N = 275) and Segu ' ela (13 %; N = 123). Over 75 % of all the carcasses appearing in the market consisted of greater cane rats and bushbuck. In contrast, over 68 % of the total biomass (23028.75 kg) entering the market was supplied by Bushbuck and Common warthog. Game diversity by catchment area was the highest in Seguela and Gregbeu and the lowest in Guezon and Maminigui. Our data indicated that hunting was unequally distributed throughout the central-western region of Cote d'Ivoire or markets are unequally provisioned by hunters. Human population density of the catchment areas affected the quantity and the quality of bushmeat observed at the urban market. Increasing hunting pressure in the Departments of Zoukougbeu proximate to the Haut Sassandra forest reserve indicates that the local authority in charge of the surveillance of this reserve has to reinforce its protection to avoid further faunal depletion. Because most of the ungulates and rodents found on the market occur at high density in disturbed habitats, their relative frequencies in the carcasses provisioning the market could be used as indicators of site over-exploitation.

AB  - Demography of herbivorous mammal populations may be affected by changes in predation, population density, harvesting, and climate. Whereas numerous studies have focused on the effect of single environmental variables on individual demographic processes, attempts to integrate the consequences of several environmental variables on numerous functional traits and demographic rates are rare. Over a 32-year period, we examined how forage availability (vegetation assessed through NDVI) and population density affected the functional traits and demographic rates of a population of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus), a herbivorous hibernating rodent. We focused on mean population phenology, body mass, breeding success, and survival. We found a negative effect of population density on demographic rates, including on breeding success and pup and adult survival to the next year. We found diverging effects of vegetation phenology on demographic rates: positive effects of a later start of the growing season on adult and yearling female survival, and juvenile survival, but no clear effect on male survival. Interestingly, neither population density nor vegetation affected population phenology or body condition in the following year. Vegetative growth rate had a positive influence on female mass gain (somatic investment) over a season, but both vegetative growth rate and biomass, surprisingly, had negative effects on the survival of young through their first hibernation. Thus, ground squirrels appeared to benefit more from later timing of vegetation than increases in vegetative biomass per se. Our study provides evidence for complex ecological effects of vegetation and population density on functional traits and demographic rates of small mammal populations.

AB  - Structural variations (SVs) are important DNA polymorphisms that contribute to genetic diversity and evolution in humans, animals, and plants. In this study, we present a novel swine SV dataset of 79,919 deletions, 23,638 duplications, and 9333 inversions with average sequence depths of 24.1x from 24 varieties of worldwide pig populations, encompassing 305 individuals. Genotypes of SVs, particularly deletions, can accurately group individuals based on their population identity. We showed that exon-covering deletions were subject to negative selection. Fixation index and differential allele frequency analysis identified highly differentiated SVs between European and Asian indigenous pigs, including deletions in NR6A1 and PLAG1, which are significantly associated with vertebrate numbers and growth performances, respectively. The growth-enhancing allele at the deletion in PLAG1 was shared by European commercial pigs and Northern Chinese indigenous pigs including Laiwu and Min pigs, suggesting potential introgression from European commercial breeds into Chinese indigenous breeds. Moreover, we uncovered highly differentiated SVs in 139 genes between domesticated pigs and wild boars in Asia, temperature and altitude adaptation-associated SVs in 41 genes, and population-specific SVs in 718 genes. This study provides novel insights into the role of porcine SVs in domestication, environmental adaptation, and breed formation.

AB  - Development phases are important in maturing immune systems, intestinal functions, and metabolism for the construction, structure, and diversity of microbiome in the intestine during the entire life. Characterizing the gut microbiota colonization and succession based on age-dependent effects might be crucial if a microbiota-based therapeutic or disease prevention strategy is adopted. The purpose of this study was to reveal the dynamic distribution of intestinal bacterial and fungal communities across all development stages in yaks. Dynamic changes (a substantial difference) in the structure and composition ratio of the microbial community were observed in yaks that matched the natural aging process from juvenile to natural aging. This study included a significant shift in the abundance and proportion of bacterial phyla (Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria) and fungal phyla (Chytridiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota) across all development stages in yaks. As yaks grew older, variation reduced, and diversity increased as compared to young yaks. In addition, the intestine was colonized by a succession of microbiomes that coalesced into a more mature adult, including Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Romboutsia, Prevotellaceae_UCG-004, Blautia, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Ruminococcus_1, Ruminiclostridium_5, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Alloprevotella, Acetitomaculum, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, Bacteroides, Treponema_2, Olsenella, Escherichia-Shigella, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, and fungal communities Mortierella, Lomentospora, Orpinomyces, and Saccharomyces. In addition, microorganisms that threaten health, such as Escherichia-Shigella, Mortierella, Lomentospora and Hydrogenoanaerobacterium, Corynebacterium_1, Trichosporon, and Coprinellus, were enriched in young and old yaks, respectively, although all yaks were healthy. The significant shifts in microflora composition and structure might reflect adaptation of gut microbiome, which is associated with physicochemical conditions changes and substrate availability in the gut across all development periods of yaks.

AB  - L, The inaugural Pacific Ecological Security Conference (PESC) was held in October 2022, bringing together over 100 island leaders, policy-makers, natural resource managers and global and regional invasive species experts to prioritise the critical issue of invasive species in the Pacific Islands Region. Participants confirmed that invasive species are a major threat to building and maintaining climate resilience and adaptability of Pacific Island ecosystems, as well as food security, biodiversity, sustainable livelihoods and the protection of cultural resources and way of life. Three region-wide strategic action plans were developed to guide interventions focused on the topics of invasive ants, coconut rhinoceros beetle and the use of biological control as a pest and weed management tool. These plans were the major outcome of the PESC and, when implemented, will result in coordinated activities that take a "whole-of-Pacific" approach to invasive species biosecurity and management. Here, we briefly describe the background, planning and engagement process for the three plans, summarise any country- and territory-level data obtained through the process and detail what is planned to occur over the next few years. In addition to the adoption and implementation of the strategies as a result of this inaugural PESC, we anticipate that the PESC will become the premier regional conference aimed at reducing the entry and impacts of invasive species to improve sustainability of environments and peoples of the Pacific.

AB  - Non-native pests in North America are a growing threat to native trees and forest communities. Theory suggests that a less specialised niche, as reflected by a pest's broad host range, may facilitate successful pest invasions. Incorporating a pest's host range characteristics along with life-history traits may thus help us better predict future invasions and impacts. We quantified the host range of North American tree pests using indices of host taxonomic richness and the standard effect size of the mean pairwise distance between hosts, then compared the host ranges of non-native and native pests. We next examined whether non-native and native pests tended to be associated with phylogenetically distinct sets of host tree lineages. Finally, we evaluated whether pest impacts were associated with pest host ranges, nativity or pest type (i.e. insect vs. pathogen). We found that the set of tree hosts impacted by non-native pests was phylogenetically distinct from hosts of native pests, and that non-native insect pests had significantly broader host ranges than native insect pests, perhaps due to an innate ability to associate with diverse tree species. We also found that pathogens generally had broader host ranges than insect pests-possibly a result of more frequent host range expansion. While severity was not associated with pest nativity per se, non-native pathogens had the greatest impact on their hosts across all pest subsets. Synthesis. We identified important differences in the host ranges of native and non-native pests, with non-native pests associated with a broader range of hosts, and this difference was most evident in comparisons between insect pests. We suggest a broad host range might facilitate non-native pest establishment. We also highlight the need for further research on pest life histories and impacts to better understand the consequences of pest invasions.

AB  - Global change drivers such as habitat fragmentation, species invasion, and climate warming can act synergistically upon native systems; however, global change drivers can be neutralized if they induce antagonistic interactions in ecological communities. Deadwood comprises a considerable portion of forest carbon, and it functions as refuge, nesting habitat and nutrient source for plant, animal and microbial communities. We predicted that thermophilic termites would increase wood decomposition with experimental warming and in forest edge habitat. Alternately, given that predatory ants also are thermophilic, they might limit termite-mediated decomposition regardless of warming. In addition, we predicted that a non-native, putative termite-specialist ant species would decrease termite activity, and consequently decomposition, when replacing native ants. We tested these hypotheses using experimental warming plots (similar to 2.5 degrees C above ambient) where termites, and their ant predators, have full access and vary in abundance at microscales. We found that termite activity was the strongest control on decomposition of field wood assays, with mass loss increasing 20% with each doubling of termite activity. However, both native and non-native ant abundance increased with experimental warming and, in turn, appeared to equally limit termite activity and, consequently, reduced wood decomposition rates. As a result, experimental warming had little net effect on the decomposition rates-likely because, although termite activity increased somewhat in warmed plots, ant abundances increased more than five times as much. Our results suggest that, in temperate southern U.S. forests, the negative top-down effects of predatory ants on termites outweighed the potential positive influences of warming on termite-driven wood decomposition rates.

AB  - The diversity of specialized molecules produced by plants radiating along ecological gradients is thought to arise from plants' adaptations to local conditions. Therefore, closely related species growing in similar habitats should phylogenetically converge, or diverge, in response to similar climates, or similar interacting animal communities. We here asked whether closely related species in the genus Haplopappus (Asteraceae) growing within the same elevation bands in the Andes, converged to produce similar floral odors. To do so, we combine untargeted analysis of floral volatile organic compounds with insect olfactory bioassay in congeneric Haplopappus (Asteraceae) species growing within the same elevation bands along the Andean elevational gradient. We then asked whether the outcome of biotic interactions (i.e., pollination vs. seed predation) would also converge across species within the same elevation. We found that flower odors grouped according to their elevational band and that the main floral visitor preferred floral heads from low-elevation band species. Furthermore, the cost-benefit ratio of predated versus fertilized seeds was consistent within elevation bands, but increased with elevation, from 6:1 at low to 8:1 at high elevations. In the light of our findings, we propose that climate and insect community changes along elevation molded a common floral odor blend, best adapted for the local conditions. Moreover, we suggest that at low elevation where floral resources are abundant, the per capita cost of attracting seed predators is diluted, while at high elevation, sparse plants incur a higher herbivory cost per capita. Together, our results suggest that phytochemical convergence may be an important factor driving plant-insect interactions and their ecological outcomes along ecological gradients.

AB  - Disturbance can induce some dams to abandon their neonates, whereas others continue parental investment. Understanding the variability of the dam-neonate bond and parental investment of large, mobile species, reclusive during calving, such as moose (Alces alces), can be challenging. Advances in global positioning system (GPS) collar technology and analytical approaches allowed us to better understand the role that dam-neonate proximity plays in maintaining the maternal-neonate bond and maternal investment. In 2013 and 2014, we used movement behavior of 50 free-ranging GPS-collared dams and their 74 GPS-collared neonates during 96 hr postcapture/release of neonates to examine home range (HR) sizes, overlap of their HRs, reunions (<= 26 m), and dynamic interactions of their movements. Mean area of 95% kernel density estimator (KDE) HRs of neonates (23.5 ha) not abandoned by their dams was more than 2 times that of abandoned neonates (10.4 ha). Mean HR area of dams continuing to invest in their neonates (104 ha) was smaller than that (897 ha) of abandoning dams. Mean overlap of core (50% KDE) and 95% KDE HRs of dam-neonate pairs when investment continued was 38.7% and 42%, whereas corresponding overlap of HRs associated with abandonment was 0.1% and 2.7%. Mean proportion of pairwise hourly location-fixes indicative of reunions of dams investing in their neonates was 0.37 and occurred at a mean interval of 2.7 hr. A stronger (p <= .05) interaction of mean hourly distances moved (di(d)) between dams investing in their neonates was associated with closer proximity compared with dams abandoning neonates. Our collective data indicate that the spatial proximity of dams investing in their neonates, and their stronger bond, nurtured neonate vitality in a way that reinforced continued investment. In contrast, the abandoning behavior of more distant dams had a diminishing influence on viability of their neonates via nutritional deprivation and limited reciprocal stimulation.

AB  - Cities are among the most extreme forms of anthropogenic ecosystem modification, and urbanization processes exert profound effects on animal populations through multiple ecological pathways. Increased access to human-associated food items may alter species' foraging behavior and diet, in turn modifying the normal microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), ultimately impacting their health. It is crucial we understand the role of dietary niche breadth and the resulting shift in the gut microbiota as urban animals navigate novel dietary resources. We combined stable isotope analysis of hair and microbiome analysis of four gut regions across the GIT to investigate the effects of urbanization on the diet and gut microbiota of two sympatric species of rodents with different dietary niches: the omnivorous large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and the relatively more herbivorous gray red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). Both species exhibited an expanded dietary niche width within the urban areas potentially attributable to novel anthropogenic foods and altered resource availability. We detected a dietary shift in which urban A. speciosus consumed more terrestrial animal protein and M. rufocanus more plant leaves and stems. Such changes in resource use may be associated with an altered gut microbial community structure. There was an increased abundance of the presumably probiotic Lactobacillus in the small intestine of urban A. speciosus and potentially pathogenic Helicobacter in the colon of M. rufocanus. Together, these results suggest that even taxonomically similar species may exhibit divergent responses to urbanization with consequences for the gut microbiota and broader ecological interactions.

AB  - In forestry, glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) is applied to some logged areas to remove deciduous and herbaceous vegetation competing with commercial coniferous trees. Glyphosate has the potential to form insoluble complexes with metal ions, altering the bioavailability of metals in soil and water. The aim of this study was to determine if GBH influenced the concentrations of available nutrients in forest plants. We sampled willow (Salix sp.), red osier dogwood (Cornus sericea), and fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium) from forests up to 12 years after GBH applications. Across the three focal species, only Mn consistently increased with GBH treatment. Significant positive correlations between nutrient and glyphosate concentrations within plant tissues were found for Mn and Zn, while negative correlations were found for Ba, Ca, Mg, and Ni. B, Ca, Mn, and species were significant predictors of GBH treatment. A greater number of significant differences between controls and treated samples were noted in nutrients of fireweed and red osier dogwood at year one post-treatment, while willow showed greater differences between controls and treated samples at year 12 post-treatment. The analyses conducted indicate a relationship between GBH treatment and resulting nutrient regimes after GBH applications, yet it is complex and variable. It is clear that there are species specific trends within the dataset. Due to this complexity, more research should be conducted, as many questions remain unanswered. Further research is needed to disentangle both short and long-term impacts of widespread use of GBH products in modern silviculture.

AB  - Bark stripping damage reduces timber quality due to fungal infection and structural defects. Weakened stems may break and induce the death of trees, which strongly affects forest stability. Some tree species, such as Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), are highly susceptible to bark stripping, but Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) has been studied to a lesser extent. The objective of this study was to predict the effect of the degree of bark stripping damage and rot on the production parameters of Scots pine and to determine the influence of climatic factors on various damaged trees. The research was conducted on 15 pine forest stands aged 40-42 years with a numerous sika deer (Cervus nippon nippon) population in the western part of the Czech Republic (425-492 m a.s. l.). The results showed significant differences in tree diameter and volume (but not height) between healthy and extensively damaged trees according to 417 pines measured. However, no differences were found between lightly damaged trees. Similarly, circumference damage did not significantly affect mean tree stem volume, in contrast to previously reported results for Norway spruce. The trees were first damaged by deer at the age of 18.5 years on average. According to the prediction model based on 40 felled and sampled trees, rot did not reach a distance > 50 cm from the site of the bark stripping on the stem, with a mean speed of vertical spreading of 0.9 cm yr(-1). Concerning the effect of climatic factors on radial growth (60 core samples taken), the difference between healthy and minor to extensively damaged trees was negligible. However, healthy trees responded more to the effects of temperature, and damaged trees were more sensitive to the precipitation amounts. Scots pine appears to be a suitable tree species for afforestation in areas with high game pressure during continuing climate change.

AB  - Identifying determinants of key phenotypic indicators driving animal population dynamics is fundamental to address measures aimed at mitigating human-wildlife interactions. In Mediterranean areas, summer drought reduces the availability of water and food resources for wild ungulates, potentially affecting body conditions. Since summer is a crucial period for the nursing/weaning of offspring, a seasonal bottleneck for ungulates would be expected to occur, especially in females. However, data on fluctuations of ungulate body mass during summer are scarce. We investigated the effects of summer progression, aridity, population density, and land use on body mass variation of adult/yearling wild boar (Sus scrofa) in a mixed forested-rural Mediterranean protected area, over a 16-year period (2007-2022). Data were gathered from individuals harvested during population control management actions, in summer. In contrast with our predictions, no consistent mass loss was observed throughout the summer. According to expectations, body mass was favored by decreasing aridity in the previous 3 months. In males, the positive effect of rainfall was mitigated by population density. Females experienced mass gain in non-arid years, mass loss in arid years, and no change in "average" years. The importance of edge habitats located at the interface between wooded and cultivated areas was confirmed by a positive relationship between female body mass and ecotone availability. The results indicate that, in a mixed forested-rural area, wild boar could maintain, or even increase, their body mass during summer. Moreover, findings emphasize the crucial role of rainfall in modulating a key driver of population dynamics for this ungulate in Mediterranean areas.

AB  - Tropical regions are undergoing rapid land use change, with major implications for global biodiversity. Selective logging and agroforestry are particularly widespread across tropical forests, often occurring in close proximity. But while a number of studies have addressed their impacts separately, few have directly compared how they influence forest vertebrates. Here, we assessed the occurrence of medium- to large-bodied mammals in logged forest, unlogged forest, and agroforestry areas in three study areas in interior Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. We detected 34 species across 99 camera trap locations and used multi-species occupancy models to estimate species-specific occurrence while accounting for imperfect detectability, spatial autocorrelation, natural habitat heterogeneity, and metrics of site accessibility (distance to human infrastructure) as proxies for potential hunting pressure. We found that species occurrences were unaffected by the distance to the nearest road or village and only responded to elevation and the distance to the nearest river in a single species each. Detection rates tended to vary with micro-habitat characteristics such as the size of tree stumps and the prevalence of trees and rattan palms, which are often not considered in camera-based occupancy studies. Occurrence rates of five species varied across habitat types but were not detectably lower in agroforestry sites than in unlogged forest for any species. Our results indicate that without unsustainable hunting, agroforestry and logged forest provide usable habitat for some, though not all, rainforest mammals. We also suggest that camera trap studies may benefit from the incorporation of fine-scale habitat information into detectability estimation. Abstract in Malaysian is available with online material.

AB  - Understanding the extent to which species' traits mediate patterns of community assembly is key to predict the effect of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem functioning. Here, we apply a trait-based community assembly framework to understand how four different habitat configurations (kelp forests, Sargassum spp. beds, hard corals, and turfs) shape the trophic and energetic dynamics of reef fish assemblages in a tropical-temperate transition zone. Specifically, we tested (i) the degree of trait divergence and convergence in each habitat, (ii) which traits explained variation in species' abundances, and (iii) differences in standing biomass (kg ha(-1)), secondary productivity (kg ha(-1) day(-1)) and turnover (% day(-1)). Fish assemblages in coral and kelp habitats displayed greater evidence of trait convergence, while turf and Sargassum spp. habitats displayed a higher degree of trait divergence, a pattern that was mostly driven by traits related to resource use and thermal affinity. This filtering effect had an imprint on the trophic and energetic dynamics of reef fishes, with turf habitats supporting higher fish biomass and productivity. However, these gains were strongly dependent on trophic guild, with herbivores/detritivores disproportionately contributing to among-habitat differences. Despite these perceived overall gains, turnover was decoupled for fishes that act as conduit of energy to higher trophic levels (i.e. microinvertivores), with coral habitats displaying higher rates of fish biomass replenishment than turf despite their lower productivity. This has important implications for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, questioning the long-term sustainability of ecological processes and fisheries yields in increasingly altered marine habitats.

AB  - Herbivory plays a significant role in regulating many contemporary terrestrial plant ecosystems, but remains an imperfectly understood component of past ecosystem dynamics because the diagnostic capability of methods is still being tested and refined. To understand the efficacy of a multiproxy approach, we compare the sensitivity of pollen and coprophilous fungal spores (CFS) to changes in grazing intensity over the last 100-150 years in six peat cores from three UK upland areas, and apply faecal lipid biomarkers to two of the cores, using agricultural census data to calculate an independent record of herbivore density. Rising sheep density adversely affected moorland ecology over the last century, which therefore provides a suitable period to test the sensitivity of these proxies. In particular, we assess whether CFS can be used to track variations in large herbivore densities over time, since this has received less attention than their ability to identify high grazing levels. At selected sites, we test whether faecal lipid biomarkers can be used to identify which herbivore species were present. Our results highlight the differential sensitivity of each proxy, demonstrating on peat-and moorlands (i) that peak CFS abundance is a more consistent indicator of ecologically influential (high) herbivore levels than variations in animal density through time; (ii) when recorded with high CFS values, the decline or disappearance of grazing-tolerant pollen taxa is a reliable indicator of high herbivory; and (iii) at low herbivore densities, faecal lipid biomarkers are not an effective indicator of herbivore presence or identity. Quantitative reconstructions of past herbivory and identifying grazer species therefore remain challenging. However, our findings indicate that pollen and CFS provide complementary evidence for high intensity grazing, and emphasise that studies using CFS should aim to define 'high' herbivore levels in terms of the grazing sensitivity of the ecosystem, rather than relative animal abundance.

AB  - Establishing adequate nature reserves and managing them effectively requires an enormous amount of resources, and is particularly challenging when species and communities are believed to have diverse needs. Decision -makers need to understand how wildlife survives in human-disturbed habitat and how they can coexist with anthropogenic activities. Forest livestock grazing is one of the main sources of income for many local commu-nities in Yunnan Province, China, but its association with endangered green peafowl (Pavo muticus) is largely unknown. We linked our field survey data with satellite imagery and conducted occupancy modeling and diel activity analysis to examine the spatio-temporal response of green peafowl to free-ranging livestock in Yubaiding Nature Reserve. Although it is widely believed that many grazing practices should be prohibited in green peafowl habitat, we found that green peafowl occurrence probability was positively associated with moderate cattle and goat abundance. Our temporal analysis also showed that green peafowl did not avoid livestock grazing or in-dividual people. In contrast to green peafowl tolerance to ordinary human activities, we found significant negative associations between green peafowl and major infrastructure. Our findings show that limits on grazing intensity are a possible management strategy for conserving green peafowl habitat instead of an outright grazing ban. Our study will contribute immediately to green peafowl conservation planning in China. Our study also has implications for the conservation plans for other species in other locations, because our findings convey that conservation targets can promote the synergy between species conservation and human activity.

AB  - Ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities represent one of the greatest causes of biodiversity loss. However, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are not felt equally among species. Here, we examined how habitat loss influenced the diversity and abundance of species from different trophic levels, with different traits, by taking advantage of an inadvertent experiment that created habitat islands from a once continuous forest via the creation of the Thousand Island Lake, a large reservoir in China. On 28 of these islands with more than a 9000-fold difference in their area (0.12-1154 ha), we sampled plants, herbivorous insects, and predatory insects using effort-controlled sampling and analyses. This allowed us to discern whether any observed differences in species diversity were due to passive sampling alone or to demographic effects that disproportionately influenced some species relative to others. We found that while most metrics of sampling effort-controlled diversity increased with island area, the strength of the effect was exacerbated for species in higher trophic levels. When we more explicitly examined differences in species composition among islands, we found that the pairwise difference in species composition among islands was dominated by species turnover but that nestedness increased with differences in island area, indicating that some species are more likely to be absent from smaller islands. Furthermore, by examining trends of several dispersal-related traits of species, we found that species with lower dispersal propensity tended to be those that were lost from smaller islands, which was observed for herbivorous and predatory insects. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating within-patch demographic effects, as well as the taxa and traits of species when understanding the influence of habitat loss on biodiversity.

AB  - Background Ghana is one of the six bat diversity hotspots on the African continent, yet its caves have not been fully explored for the bats they host. Research Aims We aimed to assess the species composition and diversity of five caves in central Ghana and identified those needing immediate conservation attention. Methods Using mist-nets, we captured bats over 102 full nights between October 2010 and July 2012 from the Upper Guinean forest and Savannah regions in central Ghana. Results A total of 10,226 bats belonging to nine species were recorded. PERMANOVA suggested significant variation in species composition among the caves. A SIMPER analysis revealed Coleura afra and Hipposideros jonesi to be the main discriminating species between caves, with a dominance of Hipposideros cf. ruber in all caves. The Bat Cave Vulnerability Index (BCVI) revealed Mframabuom cave from the Upper Guinean forest region as a high priority cave hosting threatened species, yet highly disturbed. The remaining caves were identified as medium priority caves. Conclusion The results of the study suggest the need for further research and an immediate conservation strategy as essential for approaching national conservation goals.

AB  - Background and aims: A detailed and updated vegetation map is necessary to land use planning. Given the need for a land-use plan for the C??rdoba mountains, we decided to: make a vegetation map of these mountains; describe the vegetation of the mapped classes; interpret their distribution along the elevation gradient, and discuss the implications for land use planning. M&M: We elaborated a preliminary map from satellite images and field information, where we discriminated 14 vegetation units. Then, after a field control, we performed the final map, grouping the vegetation units into seven classes. Results: In the final map we identified: native forests, exotic forests, native scrublands, grasslands, lawns, grasslands with rock and/or bare soil and rocky areas. These classes were discriminated with an overall 82.6% precision. In addition, we separated water bodies, flood areas, crops and urban areas. The scrublands were the most widespread class, covering 37% of the landscape, followed by crops, covering 23% of the territory. Native forests only occupied 5.5% of the area. Scrublands and forests decreased along the elevation gradient, while grasslands and rocky areas increased. Conclusions: We suggest that land use planning should promote the restoration of native forests to occupy 20-40% of the landscape, the control of the advance of urban areas and crops, and the management of invasive alien species to limit their expansion.

AB  - Across a species' range, populations are exposed to their local thermal environments, which on an evolutionary scale, may cause adaptative differences among populations. Helminths often have broad geographic ranges and temperature-sensitive life stages but little is known about whether and how local thermal adaptation can influence their response to climate change. We studied the thermal responses of the free-living stages of Marshallagia marshalli, a parasitic nematode of wild ungulates, along a latitudinal gradient. We first determine its distribution in wild sheep species in North America. Then we cultured M. marshalli eggs from different locations at temperatures from 5 to 38(degrees)C. We fit performance curves based on the metabolic theory of ecology to determine whether development and mortality showed evidence of local thermal adaptation. We used parameter estimates in life-cycle-based host-parasite models to understand how local thermal responses may influence parasite performance under general and location-specific climate-change projections. We found that M. marshalli has a wide latitudinal and host range, infecting wild sheep species from New Mexico to Yukon. Increases in mortality and development time at higher temperatures were most evident for isolates from northern locations. Accounting for location-specific parasite parameters primarily influenced the magnitude of climate change parasite performance, while accounting for location-specific climates primarily influenced the phenology of parasite performance. Despite differences in development and mortality among M. marshalli populations, when using site-specific climate change projections, there was a similar magnitude of impact on the relative performance of M. marshalli among populations. Climate change is predicted to decrease the expected lifetime reproductive output of M. marshalli in all populations while delaying its seasonal peak by approximately 1 month. Our research suggests that accurate projections of the impacts of climate change on broadly distributed species need to consider local adaptations of organisms together with local temperature profiles and climate projections.

AB  - Deer can slow the natural succession of forests from light-demanding to shade-tolerant species or even keep forests in an early successional stage. This study examined the effects of bark stripping by deer (Cervus nippon) on the stand dynamics in a Larix kaempferi-Abies veitchii subalpine forest in central Japan. Bark stripping by C. nippon was concentrated on smaller A. veitchii individuals, and the number of stems with stripped bark increased over the study period (2007-2019). Unlike other tree species in the study plot, the main mortality factor of A. veitchii was bark stripping. In addition, the mortality factors of A. veitchii clearly differed among tree sizes: smaller A. veitchii trees (diameter at breast height <= 15 cm) died owing mainly to bark stripping, whereas larger individuals died owing mainly to uprooting, snapping, and standing dead trees. At this forest site, bark-stripping deer preferred the late-successional species (A. veitchii) to the early-successional species (L. kaempferi), and consequently, the progress of succession was disturbed.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the abundance and diversity (alpha, beta, assemblage composition, and indicator species) of marine shrimp near the Mar Virado and Couves Islands on the Northern Coast of S & atilde;o Paulo State, Brazil, over two years (1998-1999). We tested the hypothesis that the abundance and diversity of penaeoid shrimps are higher in areas adjacent to islands with a greater proportion of muddy sediments. The spatiotemporal associations of the Penaeoidea assemblage were examined in relation to environmental factors, including bottom temperature, salinity, organic matter, and sediment texture. A total of 1859 individuals were captured, representing three families and nine species. Mar Virado Island showed the highest shrimp abundance and diversity, a pattern associated with the predominance of fine sediments and higher temperatures. Xiphopenaeus spp., Penaeus schmitti, and Rimapenaeus constrictus were predominantly found near Mar Virado, whereas Penaeus paulensis and Penaeus brasiliensis were dominant near Couves Island. These findings highlight the critical role of island-specific sediment characteristics and water temperature in shaping shrimp distribution and diversity, with significant implications for fishery management and conservation strategies in these areas.

AB  - It is difficult to predict and manage the ecological consequences of multiple water quality stressors on our freshwater systems. This is due to the dynamism of the source-stressor-response relationships and multiple factors including lack of data, complex impact pathways and risks, and uncertainties that are difficult to parameterise. We present a risk-based probability modelling approach using a Bayesian network (BN), to manage multiple water quality stressors at multiple spatial scales. We illustrate the use of this approach, by evaluating the probable ecological effects of altered water quality associated with multiple sources in three case study rivers in South Africa. Water quality and land use activity were used to describe conceptual risk pathways, parameterise the BNs and model the probable consequences of multiple water quality stressors. The BN model demonstrated that the endpoints that were selected for the study reflected the risks associated with the levels of the input water quality variables. The model further demonstrated that the electrical conductivity BN was just as sensitive as the more complex salt model. The BN model was further able to accurately represent risks to all systems irrespective the water quality data base size. This approach can contribute towards more sustainable water resource management.

AB  - ContextLarge herbivores contribute to biogeochemical cycling across spatial scales. Nutrient transport by herbivores is often linked to their movements between habitats preferred for foraging (nutrient intake) and resting (nutrient excretion).ObjectivesWe investigated whether movement decisions of free-ranging red deer (Cervus elaphus) lead to changes in plant-available soil nutrients. We hypothesised that concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium would increase in forest relative to grassland with increasing red deer use. Additionally, we tested whether soil nutrient concentrations are positively related to the intensity of deer resting behaviour.MethodsOur study was conducted in the Grafenw & ouml;hr military training area, Germany. We collected 200 soil samples from semi-natural grasslands and forests in three zones with varying red deer use. Using GPS telemetry and accelerometer data from 25 red deer, we classified their relocations into active (foraging, travelling) and passive (resting) and calculated a utilisation distribution for resting behaviour.ResultsPhosphorus and potassium were significantly enriched in forest compared to grassland soil in the zone with the highest red deer use, and potassium also in the intermediate zone. Nutrient concentrations in forests, where red deer spent more passive than active time contrary to grasslands, increased with resting intensity. This suggests that the differences in nutrient concentrations between forest and grassland are related to deer resting behaviour in forest and associated excrement deposition.ConclusionBy combining data from soil tests, telemetry and activity sensors, we showed that movement decisions of wild ungulates result in nutrient transfer from grassland to forest, contributing to nutrient-poor conditions in grassland favourable to biodiversity. Ungulate effects in forests go beyond browsing as nutrient subsidies could increase forest soil fertility.

AB  - The disparities in the ecology and behavior of marine megafauna may influence their susceptibility to solid waste ingestion; however, this relationship has been underestimated along the Brazilian coast. We analyzed a dataset of 7261 marine megafauna (45 species) necropsied to investigate the influence of their foraging strategies on solid waste ingestion. A total of 1240 specimens ingested solid waste with over 55 % (689) that ingested plastic. Sea turtles were the most impacted taxa, while cetaceans present the lowest frequency. Some characteristics such as regurgitation (e.g., Suliformes and Charadriiformes seabirds) or possess complex foraging strategies (e.g., ceta-ceans echolocation) may mitigate the negative effects of solid waste ingestion. Also, the variability over the monitoring program likely was influenced by the volume of pollutants transported to the ocean during flood periods, and level of staff training. This study serves as a valuable baseline for solid waste management actions and marine megafauna conservation efforts.

AB  - Marine protected area (MPA) designs, including large-scale MPAs (LSMPAs; > 150,000 km2), mobile MPAs (fluid spatiotemporal boundaries), and MPA networks, may offer different benefits to species and could enhance protection by encompassing spatiotemporal scales of animal movement. We sought to understand how well LSMPAs could benefit nine highly-mobile marine species in the tropics now and into the future by: 1) evaluating current range overlap within a LSMPA; 2) evaluating range overlap under climate change projections; and 3) evaluating how well theoretical MPA designs benefit these nine species. We focused on Palmyra Atoll and Kingman Reef, a 2000 km(2) area within the 1.2 million km(2) U.S. Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRIMNM) that contains marine megafauna (reef and pelagic fishes; sea turtles; seabirds; cetaceans) reflecting different behaviors and habitat use. Our approach is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of the Palmyra-Kingman MPA and PRIMNM in protecting these species, and tropical LSMPAs in general, and for informing future MPA design. Stationary MPAs provided protection at varying scales. Reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi), grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and bottlenose dolphins (Tur-siops truncatus) had overall small ranges (< 100 km from Palmyra-Kingman) and could benefit from stationary MPAs that contained heterogenous reef habitats. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus), red-footed boobies (Sula sula), great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), and melon-headed whales (Peponocephala electra) navigated complex oceanographic processes and may benefit most from mobile MPAs that shift with features including thermal fronts, cyclic regions of elevated productivity, and eddies, if relationships with these features are established and predictable. All species had capacity to travel to nearby reef systems, illustrating potential benefits of MPA networks and protected corridors. Suitable habitats will likely contract for all species as warm water expands under climate change scenarios (species habitats were predicted to decrease by 4-49% at Palmyra-Kingman) and MPAs may not protect suitable habitats into the future.

AB  - Mammalian communities living in tropical forests, particularly those in ecological transition zones, are under constant threat from human activities. In many regions, baseline data on mammal richness, occupancy, detection probability and the environmental factors that influence these metrics are lacking. As a key metric for guiding conservation decisions, species richness can be underestimated due to varying detection probabilities, leading to species being overlooked. Advances in technology and methodology have revolutionised wildlife monitoring, fostering the increase of multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) for efficient studies of community, shifting focus from single species to entire communities. MSOMs, hierarchical models that share information across species via random effects, address imperfect detection to provide accurate and unbiased species richness estimates. To fill this information gap, we used cameras trap data from Mpem and Djim National Park, Central Cameroun. We used generalised linear models and a model selection approach to evaluate factors affecting species detection events. Similarly, we used MSOMs within a Bayesian hierarchical framework to evaluate our initial species richness estimate at each camera trap location and to understand the influence of environmental covariates on the occupancy and detection probability of 19 vertebrates recorded in the area to inform management decisions for these species. From 915 independent photographic events obtained over 1700 days of capture, the study results highlight the importance of habitat, distance to river, normalised difference vegetation index and topographic position index (TPI) in explaining patterns of detection events. We found that forest (GLM: B 0.31, IRR 1.36, CI 0.14-0.48, p < 0.001), NDVI (GLM: B 0.31, IRR 1.36, CI 0.21-0.41, p < 0.001) and TPI (GLM: B 0.17, IRR 1.19, CI 0.08-0.26, p < 0.001) were positively associated with species detection events, whereas distance to river (GLM: B -0,19, IRR 0.83, CI 0.0.27 to (-0.11), p < 0.001) was negatively associated with species detection events. However, the mean probability of community occupancy was 0.33 +/- 0.10 [2.5%-97.5% CI: 0.17, 0.54], while the mean probability of community detection was 0.07 +/- 0.02 [2.5%-95% CI: 0.04, 0.12], indicating that, on average, approximately 33% of the sites are likely to be occupied by the community of interest, with a 7% probability of detection at occupied sites. After accounting for imperfect detection, the maximum occupancy and detection probability estimated from the MSOMs were 0.88 +/- 0.07 (2.5%-97.5% CI: 0.71-0.98) and 0.22 +/- 0.2 (2.5%-97.5% CI: 0.18-0.27) for Philantomba monticola, respectively. Globally, the community responses were close to zero and relatively weak, probably due to mixed responses at the species level. Despite their weak effect, distance to road (beta: -1.53 +/- 1.97 [2.5%-97.5% CI: -1.72-5.62]) and NDVI (beta: -0.09 +/- 0.22 [2.5%-97.5% CI: -0.50-0.38]) had a negative significant effect on occupancy. However, there were significant responses at the species level with Cephalophus nigrifrons, for example, exhibiting a strong response to NDVI. This study contributes to baseline information on the ecology of mammal communities in Central Cameroon and supports the need for future multi-season surveys to understand the influence of temporal factors on community occupancy and richness in the area.

AB  - Habitat selection models are the basis of an increasing number of conservation and management programs. Decision-makers rely on accurate models to assess animal distribution over space and time, and to recommend suitable actions that can alleviate human-wildlife conflicts. Despite a rapidly growing number of field studies on habitat selection, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence that selection is a density-dependent process that can impact males and females differently. Based on 11 years of monitoring, we demonstrate that the response of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) to land-cover types varied with population size, and that density -dependent adjustments differed between sexes. Specifically, our longitudinal follow-up of GPS-collared ele-phants revealed that elephants gradually decrease their selection for open woodlands and forests, as the popu-lation increased and the availability of palatable browse species decreased. Both sexes - though males more strongly - increased their travel rate together with their relative probability of selection of roads for travel. Also, elephants displayed a density-dependent increase in their selection of infrastructures, a response that was stronger for males than females. The risk of human-elephant conflicts thus increased with population size, with males being particularly prone to be involved in such conflicts. Overall, we provide rare empirical evidence that density-dependence in fine-grain habitat selection can differ between sexes. This information can be critical to accurately forecast potential human-wildlife conflicts, and for taking targeted and effective conservation and management actions.

AB  - Despite contributing to the ongoing collapse of native mammal populations across northern Australian savannas, we have limited understanding of the ecological constraints of feral cat population density in this system. Addressing such knowledge gaps is a crucial step towards mitigating the impacts of feral cats, and is particularly important for the large islands off northern Australia that remain as strongholds for numerous species vulnerable to cat predation. Here, we investigated cat density across Melville and Bathurst Island, two large islands in Australia's monsoon tropics. We deployed large grids (similar to 13 km(2)) of 70 camera-traps at four locations to investigate how feral cat density varies under different combinations of fire frequency, and feral herbivore presence. Using spatially-explicit capture-recapture models, we estimated feral cat density on Melville Island to be 0.15 cats km(-2). We did not record any cat detections on Bathurst Island. Using simulations, we predicted that if cat density on Bathurst Island was equal to that on Melville Island, we would have expected to record 27.9 detections of 9.9 individual cats. Our results, coupled with other recent surveys, suggest that the density of cats is much lower on Bathurst Island than the adjacent Melville Island. The absence of feral herbivores on Bathurst Island may have contributed to this variation in cat density. Management that enhances understorey vegetation density, through feral herbivore control, as well as fire management, could help mitigate the impact of feral cats on northern Australian savanna biodiversity.

AB  - The macrofauna in the intertidal zone of sandy beaches provides the trophic connectivity between land and sea, by linking microbiome, meiofauna, and megafauna, representing a food source for several terrestrial animals, including shorebirds and mammals. However, the macrozoobenthos in urbanised beaches is subjected to intense disturbances, such as breakwater barriers and tourism, which limit or impede the energy transfer from the marine to the terrestrial habitats. Because the information about diversity and abundance of the macrozoobenthos of the intertidal zone on the Mediterranean sandy coasts is scant, the main objective of this study is to increase the knowledge on the macrofauna living in this habitat and to identify taxa sensitive to cumulative human-induced stresses. To achieve this purpose, the structure and dynamics of macrozoobenthic communities from (1) a highly frequented beach characterized by breakwater barriers and (2) a marine protected area (MPA) in the Adriatic Sea were compared. The hypotheses that macrofauna composition and abundance changed in the two sites and over time were tested. Results highlighted that the macrozoobenthos in the MPA is mainly dominated by juvenile bivalves, which peaked from autumn to winter, and to a lesser extent by ostracods and mysids. Conversely, ostracods and the bivalve Lentidium mediterraneum (O. G. Costa, 1830) are particularly abundant in the highly disturbed beach, while the gastropod Tritia neritea (Linnaeus, 1758) increased only during summer. A possible combined effect of breakwater barriers and intense trampling has been theorized to explain the main differences between the two sites especially in the summer.

AB  - Roads and associated traffic have significant impacts on wildlife, from direct mortality caused by vehicle col-lisions to indirect effects when wildlife avoid roads, restricting access to important resources. Road mitigation measures such as constructing wildlife passages over or under the road with directional fencing have proven effective at reducing wildlife vehicle collisions while also enabling wildlife to safely cross the road. Highway mitigation projects are led by transportation agencies with a primary purpose of improving motorist safety. More recently, through the discipline of road ecology, considerations have included safe wildlife passage through transportation corridors. To prioritize road sections for mitigation, data sources include animal vehicle collision data collected by transportation agencies and connectivity models generated by wildlife professionals. We used a third data source, pronghorn observations collected by citizen scientists, and demonstrated its value to prioritize potential wildlife mitigation sites. Our results clearly demonstrate a misalignment of road mitigation sites using animal-vehicle collision data and those of rarer species of interest.

AB  - Migration provides an adaptive strategy to improve fitness by allowing individuals to exploit gradients of resources and changes in predation risk. In recent decades, the extent and prevalence of migration has declined in numerous ungulate species including many populations of elk (Cervus canadensis). Resident elk are often more closely associated with human activity, are more readily involved in agricultural conflicts and may contribute to overgrazing on some ranges. We evaluated migratory trends, survival rates, and causes of mortality in a partially migratory elk population in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, and compared these parameters with data from a 1982-1996 study from the same area. Analysis of 201 animal-years (n = 78 collared cow elk) between 2016 and 2022 showed a ratio of 52% migratory to 48% resident elk, similar to what was found during the 1982-1996 study (55% migratory to 45% resident; n = 40 cows). Among the migrants, 55% were standard migrants (traveling moderate to longer distances and changing little in elevation), 35% elevational, and 10% mixed/atypical. We detected a 14% yearly switching rate between migratory and resident strategies. We recorded 30 mortalities: 47% from human causes, predominantly elk-vehicle/train collisions (33% of mortalities), apparent starvation/old age (17%), and predation (17%). Notably, while mortality from natural causes was similar between strategies, human-caused mortality was nearly twice as high in resident elk. Signs of nutritional stress and lower pregnancy rates indicated potential forage limitations. Migrants had higher average survival rates (0.90) compared to residents (0.83), a shift from the 1982-1996 study that recorded higher resident survival rates (0.98), the same migrant survival rate (0.90), and fewer elk-vehicle/train collisions. Cow elk in our study made fewer and shorter movements into upper mountain tributaries and greater use of mine properties than observed during the 1982-1996 study. Wildlife managers should consider opportunities to enhance elk forage within traditional high-elevation summer ranges and mitigations to reduce elk-vehicle/train collisions. Further research is needed to quantify reproductive success, monitor calf survival, and determine relative forage quality among summering areas between migratory strategies, and determine winter ranges of long-distant migrants.

AB  - Nature-based tourism nets roughly 8 billion annual travelers globally to all regions of Earth, with many visiting around 200,000 formally protected areas. Financially well-off tourists pay for playful activities and effects on wildlife are potentially large and relatively uncertain. Our commentary makes 3 points. First, variation in resource privileges and associated benefits characterizes not only humans but other species. Among animals, well-nurtured populations engage in more playful and leisurely activities than do those nutritionally impoverished. Privilege depends partially on birth sites, parents, and local conditions, but for humans recreation expands with monetary advantage. Second, nature-based tourism has 2 generalizable effects on wildlife, each involving degree of habituation. Among non-habituated populations, local site abandonment is frequent and modulated by seasonality, individuals' physiological states, and whether recreation is motorized or not. For habituated populations, tolerance emerges to increasing recreational exposure with some populations of species learning to rely on humans to shield as a buffer against possible predation. Third, desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) offer a robust example of the issues surrounding the effects of tourism on wildlife because of the geographically complicated relationship between recreational pursuit and wildlife on public lands of the western United States. While protected for decades, females have failed to habituate to different forms of recreation at certain sites. The result has been flight or site abandonment. Biodiversity protection at numerous scales has made strong gains but is still needed where progress is stymied by income disparities, privilege, and increasing recreation ventures.

AB  - This paper documents our comparative study on the community environments of giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca between Wolong National Nature Reserve (Wolong NNR), Tangjiahe NNR, and Heizhugou NNR in Sichuan, China using infrared camera data collected from 2017 to 2021, in an attempt to explore the ecological relations of the giant panda with other animals. Results showed that the giant panda belonged to the species association networks of Tangjiahe lower altitude network (Tangjiahe LAN) and Wolong LAN. In Tangjiahe LAN, the giant panda had symmetric associations with two species: the Asiatic golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) and Temminck's tragopan (Tragopan temminckii). In Wolong LAN, the panda was directly associated with six species. Three types of associations were found in Wolong NNR. The first type was mutually asymmetric association between the panda and the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellanae), in which the two species benefited from each other. The second type was a uni-directional asymmetric association between the giant panda and the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), in which the giant panda benefited from the red panda. The third type was symmetric association between the giant panda and other four species, including the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula), sambar (Rusa unicolor), and tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), in which they competed for similar ecological resources. In Heizhugou NNR, species didn't form a network and the giant panda was not directly associated with any species. Accordingly, it is suggested that conservation resources be invested on Wolong NNR in the case of resources shortage, because it will ensure the giant panda to further survive easier and, at the same time, will also benefit more other species in surviving. It is also suggested that the state budget currently made for ecological restoration be made with priority to Heizhugou, helping the natural community to recover in the NNR.

AB  - Large terrestrial mammals have generally declined due to human activity, but the recovery of some populations poses new issues for coexistence. Few studies to date have investigated drivers of this recovery and its impacts on human societies at the national scale. Here we assessed the range expansion of six large terrestrial mammal species over 40 years-sika deer, wild boar, Japanese serow, Japanese macaque, Asiatic black bear, and brown bear-by comparing newly occupied and unoccupied areas using distribution data in Japan. We found evidence that increased agricultural abandonment and decreased snowfall drove these range expansions. The range of all six species expanded from mountainous landscapes to those closer to human settlements, leading to increased conflicts that threaten people's property and safety. We predict that accelerating depopulation and climate warming could further expand the range of these species, and call for measures to mitigate conflicts and achieve coexistence with them.

AB  - Utility-scale solar energy (USSE) has become an efficient and cost-effective form of renewable energy, with an expanding footprint into rangelands that provide important habitat for many wild ungulate populations. Using global positioning system data collected before and after construction, we documented the potential impacts of USSE on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), including direct habitat loss, indirect habitat loss, and barrier effects to both resident and migratory population segments. Our case study highlights the challenges that USSE poses to ungulate conservation, including (1) impermeable security fencing that blocks access to and reduces connectivity between formerly available habitats, and (2) the lack of guidelines for minimizing USSE impacts on ungulates. Improved siting and ungulate-specific best management practices would help to minimize habitat loss and retain landscape connectivity. Ungulate biodiversity and ecosystem services (for example, services provided by long-distance migratory species) in arid rangelands are important considerations when balancing the global benefits of renewable energy with local wildlife impacts.

AB  - Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa), also called feral swine or wild hogs, are recognized as among the most destructive invasive species in the world. Throughout the United States, invasive wild pigs have expanded rapidly over the past 40 years with populations now established in 38 states. Of the estimated 6.9 million wild pigs distributed throughout the United States, Texas supports approximately 40% of the population and similarly bears disproportionate ecological and economic costs. Genetic analyses are an effective tool for understanding invasion pathways and tracking dispersal of invasive species such as wild pigs and have been used recently in California and Florida, USA, which have similarly long-established populations and high densities of wild pigs. Our goals were to use molecular approaches to elucidate invasion and migration processes shaping wild pig populations throughout Texas, compare our results with patterns of genetic structure observed in California and Florida, and provide insights for effective management of this invasive species. We used a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to evaluate population genetic structure. Genetic clusters of wild pigs throughout Texas demonstrate 2 distinct patterns: weakly resolved, spatially dispersed clusters and well-resolved, spatially localized clusters. The disparity in patterns of genetic structure suggests disparate processes are differentially shaping wild pig populations in various localities throughout the state. Our results differed from the patterns of genetic structure observed in California and Florida, which were characterized by localized genetic clusters. These differences suggest distinct biological and perhaps anthropogenic processes are shaping genetic structure in Texas. Further, these disparities demonstrate the need for location-specific management strategies for controlling wild pig populations and mitigating associated ecological and economic costs.

AB  - BackgroundSoil-dwelling organisms populate the spaces-referred to as interstices-between the litter on the soil surface and the pores in the soil's organo-mineral matrix. These organisms have pivotal roles in soil ecosystem functions, such as the breakdown and decomposition of organic matter, the dispersal of bacterial and fungal spores and biological habitat transformation. These functions, in turn, contribute to broader ecosystem services like carbon and nutrient cycling, soil organic matter regulation and both chemical and physical soil fertility.This study provides morphological data pertaining to a range of soil organism sizes, specifically in Argiudol soils subjected to varying levels of agricultural activity in the Rolling Pampas Region, one of the world's most extensive and fertile plains.The primary focus is on soil microarthropods-namely, Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails)-with a body width of less than 2 mm. These organisms constitute the majority of life in the intricate soil pore network. Additionally, the study documents species of earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitelata), recognised as ecosystem engineers for their ability to create physical channels in the soil matrix and to distribute organic matter. Moreover, the study includes measurements of morphological traits of soil-dwelling "macrofauna" (organisms with a body width greater than 2 mm), which are also implicated in various soil ecosystem functions. These include population regulation by apex predators, organic matter decomposition, biogenic structure formation, nutrient mobilisation and herbivory.

AB  - The European bison continues to be a conservation dependent species, as it inhabits small reserve areas that require strict management. To ensure the species' long-term viability, it is imperative to expand both its population size and geographical range. However, achieving this expansion within its historical range poses challenges due to intensive land use and dense human populations. The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of the European bison beyond its historical range, specifically in the boreal zone of Europe. Utilizing the maximum entropy method alongside bioclimatic variables and land use analysis, the research revealed a significant expanse of suitable territory. This suggests the feasibility of establishing a contiguous habitat capable of supporting a substantial European bison population. Factors such as ongoing global warming, deforestation, and agricultural decline are further enhancing the creation of favorable habitats for the species.

AB  - The yak serves an important role in the Himalayan ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Current management practices, and the change to more intensive farming methods, are a concern for their welfare especially in terms of behavioural expression. While focus has been on yaks within the context of the ecosystem, their behaviour has not been widely documented. The aim of this review is to evaluate the status quo on yak behaviour and welfare, and to synthesise the existing information on yak behaviour (domesticated and wild) to provide an ethogram that can benefit future empirical studies. Peer-reviewed literature was retrieved from three databases while making no restriction on language. We included 39 Chinese language papers, 19 English and 1 German source (total n = 59). Studies mostly considered grazing behaviour and activity time budgets. Other topics included reproductive and social behaviour and animal welfare. The data showed that yaks graze for nearly the full daytime when on summer pasture (11 h), with variations in behavioural patterns depending on the season. Social and reproductive behaviour occur limitedly when outside the mating season. Welfare issues are, amongst others, the lack of veterinary services, painful and stressful management procedures, and heat stress due to climate change. From the overall review a clear picture emerges about the behaviour of yaks, which was summarized into a comprehensive ethogram. However, there are still many knowledge gaps regarding yak welfare as well as known welfare issues that require urgent change in practice. We aspire that this review will open up discussion on yak welfare and their possibility for behavioural adaptation, especially in the light of climate change and new management systems.

AB  - Rumen content stratification and the degree of dissociation of particle and fluid retention in the reticulorumen differ between 'moose-type' and 'cattle-type' ruminant species. These differences are not strictly linked to diet, except for a seeming limitation of 'moose-type' ruminants to a browsing niche. Nevertheless, these differences can be plausibly linked to other observed differences in ruminants, such as the intraruminal papillation pattern, or the size of the omasum. However, many of the corresponding measures are still only available for a restricted number of species. Here, we investigated the dry matter (i.e., the inverse of the moisture) concentration in forestomach contents of 10 blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) and 7 Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica), and quantified the rumen papillation pattern. The blackbucks had distinct rumen contents stratification, with more moisture in ventral than in dorsal contents (difference 3.6% units, P < 0.001), whereas this difference was much less pronounced in the sand gazelles (0.6% units, P = 0.227). While reticulum contents were particularly moist in both species, omasum contents were particularly dry in sand gazelles, but did not differ in moisture from rumen contents in the blackbuck. This species is an outlier among ruminants due to its extremely small omasum. The intraruminal papillation pattern did not differ between blackbucks and sand gazelles and showed a surface enlargement factor (SEF) in the dorsal rumen of 27-28% of the SEF in the Atrium ruminis. Compared to data on digesta retention in the same species, the findings are in line with the overall concept of a high fluid throughput causing a distinct stratification of rumen contents and intraruminal papillation, and necessitating a large omasum for fluid re-absorption. However, the data also show that individual species may not correspond to all the assumptions of the concept, suggesting taxon-specific differences between species. Reasons for these differences cannot be linked to a dietary grass-browse spectrum, but may lie in evolutionary contingency.

AB  - Species with irruptive population dynamics, that undergo dramatic outbreaks during which they invade normally unoccupied areas, provide a useful template with which to view rare or novel species interactions. Here we document biotic interactions during a population irruption of the long-haired rat (Rattus villosissimus) into the Simpson Desert, Australia. The rat is the largest extant rodent in arid Australia (average body mass: 134 g) being 3-4 times heavier than resident rodents. The study examined direct predation on and/or displacement of resident rodent species (using 21 years of monitoring data, 1999-2020) and examined if browsing caused damage and/or mortality of the sapling population of the dominant tree Acacia peuce (using 40 years of monitoring (1979-2019) of a sapling population of 146 individuals). Over 21 years, all but three records of R. villosissimus were during a period of 31 months (June 2010 to December 2012). Three distinct effects of the rats on the ecosystem were detected, specifically, potential displacement of resident rodent populations (Notomys alexis, Pseudomys australis) by R. villosissimus, direct predation on other rodents, and browsing impacts on A. peuce that ranged from moderate through severe damage to outright mortality in 7% of monitored saplings. The rare interactions produced by the rat outbreak did not have lasting effects on small mammals. By contrast, A. peuce sapling vigour and population growth may be negatively impacted by R. villosissimus should outbreaks occur more frequently as a result of changing climate.

AB  - In a study conducted in 2018-2020, we tested the hypothesis that the wolf in Osogovo Mtn was selecting its prey opportunistically, with a preference for the most abundant prey (apostatic selection). To achieve this, scat analysis was performed simultaneously with prey density assessment through objective camera traps data, Random Encounter Model (REM) and selectivity analysis. The results showed that the wild boar was the most preferred prey by the wolf, complemented by the domestic horse. The roe deer had a smaller, close to insignificant share. The selectivity index also confirmed the wild boar dominance in the wolf diet, which was consistent through the years and seasons. The active selection towards wild boar was anti-apostatic in nature as the wild boar densities were 10-times lower than those of the roe deer. Our results differed from those obtained by a previous study in the same region in 2002-2003, where the roe deer accounted for 71.9% of the wolf diet. This study also showed anti-apostatic selection towards smaller prey probably formed by the decrease of the wild boar abundance in the past.

AB  - The Barda Wildlife Sanctuary (Barda WLS) is a semi-arid ecosystem that plays an important role in the conservation of mammalian carnivores. It is essential to evaluate the population of important wild prey species in Barda, which has conservation implications for mammalian predators and themselves. We assessed the density, biomass, and population structure of wild prey species by surveying road (n = 10) and trail (n = 8) transects using the distance sampling framework method. We used male-to-female sex ratios and the percent contribution of each age class to assess population structure. Mean group size (MGS), median group size (Mdgs), and mean crowding (Mc) were calculated to analyze group size. Of the species studied, Indian peafowl had the highest density (51.61 +/- 7.08 individuals/km2), followed by wild pig (10.77 +/- 4.59), blue bull (3.50 +/- 0.51), Indian hare (3.03 +/- 0.73), and spotted deer (0.62 +/- 0.04). The male-to-adult female sex ratio was biased towards females, except for Indian peafowl. All species had small group sizes except wild pigs. The results of this study can aid in its development as one of the important protected areas in Gujarat for the conservation of mammalian predators, along with framing conservation strategies for Barda WLS.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) shape vertebrate communities and structure food webs in many terrestrial ecosystems. However, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of LMH on other vertebrates are poorly under-stood. In France, domestic LMH have grazed alpine and mountain grasslands for thousands of years, profoundly influencing landscapes and wildlife. As LMH modify habitat structure, favour coprophagous insects and compete with herbivorous insects, the diet of insectivorous alpine birds may be deeply influenced by LMH grazing in-tensity. To investigate this, we sampled common insectivorous birds faeces (water pipit Anthus spinoletta and wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe) in sites characterized by different levels of grazing intensity by domestic and wild herbivores, in the open landscapes of the southern French Alps and the western Pyrenees. We used isotopic discrimination based on nitrogen stable isotope ratios as an indicator of the trophic level of the arthropods found in bird faeces. From isotopic ratios, we found that bird diets shift from mainly herbivorous arthropods at sites of low grazing intensity, to one mainly composed of other groups, such as predatory, detritivorous or coprophagous arthropods, at sites of higher grazing intensity. This result highlights the strong trophic link between LMH and insectivorous birds in open landscapes, contributing to a better understanding of interactions between domestic grazing, an activity that has historically modelled European landscapes, and biodiversity, with particular rele-vance for landscape management and bird conservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems are increasing worldwide, causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and driving species towards risk of extinction. To protect vulnerable species and habitats, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly established worldwide as conservation measures. Seahorses act as flagship species for coastal ecosystem conservation due to their charismatic appearance and high vulnerability to habitat degradation. Here, the habitat suitability of the two European seahorse species, Hippocampus hippocampus and Hippocampus guttulatus, was assessed along the western Iberian Peninsula, using an ensemble species distribution modelling approach. Furthermore, the coverage of their core habitat (relative habitat suitability (HS) >= 0.5) with MPAs was estimated. The results show that the main drivers for habitat suitability were distance to the coast, aspect of the seafloor, tidal amplitude, and temperature. However, the importance differed between the two species. The suitable habitat of H. hippocampus extended to higher distances to the coast, while H. guttulatus were mostly restricted to areas in the vicinity of the coast and facing away from the open sea (i.e., the westerly aspect of the seafloor). Furthermore, temperature contributes more to the variation in habitat suitability in H. hippocampus than in H. guttulatus. The areas with the highest habitat suitability are estuarine or inlet waters and sheltered coasts in northwestern Spain, central and south of Portugal. Both species' core habitats are covered by about 19-20 % with implemented protected areas in Portugal. In comparison, there is less coverage for both species in Spain, with 12 % for H. guttulatus and 6 % for H. hippocampus. Besides, zones of full protection cover less than 0.5 % of the core habitat while the rest of the protected areas provide only moderate to low restrictions and do not specifically address the protection of seahorses in their management plans. The results provide useful information on the distribution and the different habitat preferences of the two species, indications for further monitoring of populations, and recommendations for efficient spatial conservation areas that can protect the species and other associated vulnerable species and habitats.

AB  - Identification of highly biodiverse areas has become a crucial step in protecting species richness, especially considering the rapid collapse of biodiversity and the limited funds available to avert, far less to reverse, these trends. Therefore, we aimed to identify the most important areas for the conservation of specified mammalian groups in Southern Asia, a region rich in biodiversity hotspots threatened by increasing rates of habitat loss and other anthropogenic activities. To achieve this, we modelled the occupancy of ungulates and of small, medium and large carnivorans at 20 study sites across the region and identified hotspots of species richness. We analysed the variation of estimated space use between different species groups and ranked areas according to their predicted importance for mammalian species conservation. Our results reveal a significant positive correlation in the spatial utilization patterns of competitive carnivores, yet no correlation among carnivores and their prey species, suggesting that anthropogenic impacts in the region are constraining species to coexist in only the few remaining suitable areas, superseding interactions between species guilds. Although the rank of site importance varied amongst species groups, we were able to identify a consensus on sites that are crucial for the conservation of all groups considered. Most of these top-ranking sites were located in the peninsular region of Thailand. We argue that, of the areas assessed, these sites represent the most important refuges for species conservation in the region, and their protection is critical for the maintenance of the biodiversity in Southern Asia.

AB  - A photographic seabed survey conducted off the Antarctic Peninsula region provided the opportunity to study spatial patterns, abundance and behaviour of the notothenioid benthic fish fauna. Overall, a total of 12,715 images taken with the Ocean Floor Observation System (OFOS) along 26 transects in three ecoregions (Joinville Island, Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage) were analysed. The fish fauna consisted of at least 34 species belonging to four families of both low-Antarctic and high-Antarctic origin. Nototheniids showed the highest relative abundance and species richness, followed by channichthyids, bathydraconids and artedidraconids. Direct in-situ observations in OFOS seabed images allowed descriptions of fish behaviour, such as aggregation of individuals (Notothenia coriiceps), specific body postures (Cygnodraco mawsoni and Cryodraco antarcticus) and parental care (Chaenodraco wilsoni, Chionodraco rastrospinosus, Pagetopsis macropterus and Trematomus hansoni). Fish density and species richness was primarily correlated with the occurrence of bryozoans, ascidians, and large cup-shaped sponges, providing a three-dimensional habitat suitable for fish settling, foraging, breeding and refuge from predators. Fish diversity was higher (a) off Joinville Island and in Bransfield Strait than in Drake Passage, where almost exclusively low-Antarctic species were recorded, and (b) between 100 and 600 m than at greater depths. Overall, the benthic fish fauna off the northern Antarctic Peninsula is zoogeographically composite and widespread, with well-structured spatial partitioning.

AB  - Niche variation at population level mediates niche packing (i.e. patterns of species' spread within the niche space) and species coexistence at community level. Competition and ecological opportunity (resource diversity) are two of the main mechanisms underlying niche variation. Dense niche packing could occur through increased niche partitioning or increased niche overlap. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data of 635 individual rodents from four species across nine sites in the montane region of a subtropical island to test the effects of competition and ecological opportunity on population isotope niche size, inter-individual niche difference within population and interspecific niche overlap within community. We used the Bayesian Standard Ellipse Area (SEAB, the ellipse area enclosed by carbon and nitrogen isotope values of organisms on a bi-plot) to estimate population niche size and interspecific niche overlap. Inter-individual niche difference within population was quantified as isotopic divergence and isotopic uniqueness. We used rodent abundance (the number of unique individuals captured) to measure competition and plant isotope niche size (plant SEAB) to measure ecological opportunity. The rodents experienced competition as evidenced by a negative relationship between population change rate and conspecific abundance. Rodent population niche size increased with ecological opportunity but not competition. The inter-individual niche difference (isotopic uniqueness) increased with competition (interspecific competition only) but not ecological opportunity. At community level, interspecific niche overlap (herbivore-omnivore pair only) increased with competition (the combined abundance of the pair) but not ecological opportunity. This study demonstrated that isotope niche variation of the rodents could be hierarchically influenced by ecological opportunity and competition, with the former setting the limit of population niche size across communities and the latter shaping inter-individual niche difference and interspecific niche overlap within communities. Under strong intraspecific competition and limited ecological opportunity for niche expansion, individuals may choose to increase their isotopic uniqueness from conspecifics at the cost of overlapping with heterospecifics of different trophic roles within the community niche space as overall competition increases. Denser niche packing of these rodent communities might be achieved through increased niche overlap.

AB  - Introduction: Passive and active restoration approaches have been often considered as different alternatives to achieve the ecological restoration of a degraded site. This false dichotomy has been overcome in terrestrial ecosystems, for which a range of restoration approaches have often been applied within the same restoration project, creating a continuum of interventions. In the marine environment, the combined approach based on passive and active restoration is less studied. Methods: Here, we tested the possibility of actively restoring a macroalgal population in a historically polluted industrial site, subjected to decadal passive restoration (i.e., unassisted, or spontaneous recovery following cessation of industrial activity), in theMediterranean Sea. Recently, it has been demonstrated that in the site under scrutiny, there is no longer any sign of the historical contamination or impact on benthic fauna therefore the environmental conditions are indistinguishable from surrounding non-impacted areas. We used artificial breakwater barriers already present in the site to restore a population of the brown algae Gongolaria barbata. The intervention was conducted by applying an in situ recruitment approach and a complementary action using cages to exclude the herbivores. The G. barbata recruits were transplanted on the artificial reefs and after they reached the maximum growth inside the cages, one cage was opened and another one was completely removed to also test the grazing pressure. The associated benthic assemblages were also analysed in terms of meio- and macrofaunal abundance, the richness of taxa, and taxonomic composition. Results and discussion: Our results indicate that, at least over a relatively short period (i.e., 6 months), the use of the cages represents a useful tool to let the macroalgae grow enough to counterbalance the herbivory pressure. The associated fauna below the macroalgae was characterized by a different taxonomic composition when compared to controls (i.e., artificial reefs without the macroalgae), particularly when considered the rare taxa. In conclusion, the combination of passive and active restoration can be considered a useful approach to restore marine sites degraded by historical industrial activities.

AB  - Grassy openings are relatively uncommon on the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, and the limited sites that do exist contribute disproportionately to the diversity and biological heritage of the region by providing habitat for locally uncommon plant species. Three grassy openings with areas of 0.1-0.2 ha are present on limestone-capped ridgetops at Strouds Run State Park in Athens County, Ohio. Although previous inventories of the park have documented the presence and character of these openings, the sites had not been thoroughly surveyed. Here we describe the vascular flora and soils of the openings and recommend management activities to conserve grassy openings within the park. The openings were surveyed monthly during the 2013 growing season, with frequent additional visits during the growing seasons in 2014-2019. Soils were collected from the openings and adjacent forest for analysis of pH, texture, and bulk density. We documented 135 species of vascular plants across the three sites; 27 were nonnative. The openings were dominated by forbs and grasses intermixed with woody species characteristic of limestone glades (e.g., Celtis pumila and Juniperus virginiana) and other open habitats. Andropogon gerardi was the dominant grass and openland forbs such as Asclepias tuberosa, Lithospermum canescens, and Ratibida pinnata also occurred in the three openings. Soil pH was significantly higher in openings and edge zones than in the forest matrix, suggesting that soils are a contributing factor shaping the grassy communities. However, woody plant encroachment was progressing inward from the edges of the openings, suggesting that a lack of disturbance is threatening the persistence of these unique communities. We suggest selective thinning of woody species to maintain the character and diversity of these sites; the practicality of controlled burns in small sites at close proximity to residential structures is limited.

AB  - Although nesting behavior and activity patterns of the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) during the breeding season are crucial for offspring survival, previous studies have partially investigated these aspects; however, further research is needed to integrate existing findings and address remaining gaps. This study aimed to explore the behavior and activity patterns of Chinese alligators at their nests in a natural environment during the breeding season. Data collection occurred in two different regions (A and B) using cameras and camera traps. Region A is an agricultural area, while Region B is a hilly and mountainous area. A total of 23 species were recorded visiting Chinese alligator nests, including primary (hog badger and wild boar) and potential (Siberian weasel) predators. Chinese alligators successfully repelled predators' attacks during the breeding season and prevented nest destruction. The degree of habitat disturbance influenced the frequency and duration of nest visits by Chinese alligators. Specifically, the disturbance levels were higher (P < 0.01) in Region A compared to Region B. Moreover, nest visit patterns were linked to the visitation patterns of other species. Furthermore, Chinese alligators exhibited strong parental care behaviors, such as assisting hatchlings in emerging from nests and transporting them to water, which were critical for successful young hatching. In conclusion, this study enriched the behavioral information of crocodilian species during the breeding season and provided valuable insights into the adaptive nesting behaviors of Chinese alligators. Understanding these behaviors is crucial for endangered species' survival and population recovery.

AB  - Mammal studies in the South of the Yucatan Peninsula often focus on local diversity, abundance, or subsistence hunting impacts. Our study uniquely examines the effects of water availability and human disturbance on medium- and large-sized terrestrial mammal diversity. Using 109 camera traps across two areas, Silvituc and Centenario, with differing human influence and water availability, we recorded 4,105 independent events representing 23 species. Silvituc, with higher water availability and lower hunting pressure, exhibited slightly greater species diversity (D1) than Centenario. Rank-abundance curves and NDMS analysis highlighted differences in mammal community structure between the two areas. Our findings suggest that water availability and hunting pressure may influence the presence of certain species, with potential impacts on habitat-dependent mammals. These results underscore the need for tailored management strategies in the Natural Protected Area, particularly to address anthropogenic effects in the Centenario area.

AB  - The habitat accommodation model (HAM) is a theoretical framework that predicts wildlife community recovery based on their habitat requirements. While post-fire habitat-related research is well documented in the Mediterranean basin, studies specifically focusing on HAM are scarce. Here, we described the small mammal assemblage in a Mediterranean area 3 years after a fire, specifically examining three functional small mammalian categories: ground-foraging insectivorous, ground-foraging herbivorous/granivorous, and arboreal-foraging species. The study was conducted in Monte Pisano (Italy), where fire burnt 12 km(2) in September 2018. A stratified random sampling was adopted, basing on burnt status and forest type. In each of the 50 sites, during late spring-summer 2021, 12 hair-tubes were deployed, and collected hairs were taxa-attributed based on morphology. A presence/absence dataset was built, and db-RDA was used to explore assemblage composition, and single-species occupancy models to test specific hypotheses. The relative abundance of ground-foraging herbivorous/granivorous was higher in the burnt area, characterised by a dense undergrowth, which could be related to anti-predatory strategies and food opportunities. Insectivorous could be in a recolonisation phase, masking their earlier absence, which could explain why their abundance was not associated with any factor tested. Arboreal-foraging species were associated with forest type, indicating a primary role for tree cover and other factors such as rocky cover and likely in situ survival. The HAM was overall confirmed also in Mediterranean basin ecosystems. This may facilitate predictions about post-fire animal successions, which in turn may provide valuable insights into post-fire management practices and biodiversity conservation strategies.

AB  - Tea trees (Camellia sinensis), a quintessential homestead agroforestry crop cultivated in over 60 countries, hold significant economic and social importance as a vital specialty cash crop. Accurate nationwide crop data is imperative for effective agricultural management and resource regulation. However, many regions grapple with a lack of agroforestry cash crop data, impeding sustainable development and poverty eradication, especially in economically underdeveloped countries. The large-scale mapping of tea plantations faces substantial limitations and challenges due to their sparse distribution compared to field crops, unfamiliar characteristics, and spectral confusion among various land cover types (e.g., forests, orchards, and farmlands). To address these challenges, we developed the Manual management And Phenolics substance-based Tea mapping (MAP-Tea) framework by harnessing Sentinel-1/2 time series images for automated tea plantation mapping. Tea trees, exhibiting higher phenolic content, evergreen characteristics, and multiple shoot sprouting, result in extensive canopy coverage, stable soil exposure, and radar backscatter signal interference from frequent picking activities. We developed three phenology-based indicators focusing on phenolic content, vegetation coverage, and canopy texture leveraging the temporal features of vegetation, pigments, soil, and radar backscattering. Characteristics of biochemical substance content and manual management measures were applied to tea mapping for the first time. The MAP-Tea framework successfully generated China's first updated 10 m resolution tea plantation map in 2022. It achieved an overall accuracy of 94.87% based on 16,712 reference samples, with a kappa coefficient of 0.83 and an F1 score of 85.63%. The tea trees are typically cultivated in mountainous and hilly areas with a relatively low planting density (averaging about 10%). Alpine tea trees exhibited a notably dense concentration and dominance, mainly found in regions with elevations ranging from 700 m to 2000 m and slopes between 2 degrees to 18 degrees. The areas with low altitudes and slopes hold the largest tea plantation area and output. As the slope increased, there was a gradual decline in the dominance of tea areas. The results suggest a good potential for the knowledge-based approaches, combining biochemical substance content and human activities, for national-scale tea plantation mapping in complex environment conditions and challenging landscapes, providing important reference significance for mapping other agroforestry crops. This study contributes significantly to advancing the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) considering the crucial role that agroforestry crops play in fostering economic growth and alleviating poverty.

AB  - Simple Summary Human-animal interactions in dairy species are frequent, as milking is routinely performed twice per day. When buffalo cows are stressed, even by minor changes in their milking routine, a decline in the oxytocin supply is observed, which is strongly associated with reduced milk ejection. As a consequence, a high number of farms are administrating oxytocin injections to ensure complete emptying of the udder, which in turn impairs the resumption of a new ovarian cycle and represents an animal welfare concern. The overall objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of the milking temperament of water buffaloes on milking traits, animal-based welfare indicators, and reproductive performance. We found that milking temperament of buffalo cows has a significant influence on the milk production and on milking speed, with calmer animals outperforming their nervous counterparts. No effects of the milking temperament on reproduction efficiency and animal-based welfare parameters were observed. In conclusion, selection for calmer water buffalo would result in higher milk yields and improved milk ejection, while reducing the need of oxytocin administration, which would in turn improve reproduction and animal welfare. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effects that milking temperament (MT) of water buffaloes has on milking traits, welfare indicators, and reproductive outputs. The study was performed on 60 multiparous buffalo cows (6.7 +/- 0.6 lactations) at the beginning of their lactation (100 days in milk, DIM). Each buffalo cow was scored by two independent observers using a temperament scoring system (1: extremely calm, 2: calm, 3: alert, 4: reactive, and 5: aggressive), and then grouped as 'calm' (scores 1, 2, and 3; n = 42) or 'nervous' (scores 4 and 5; n = 18). Additionally, the milk yield at 100 DIM (MY), milking speed (MS), calving interval (CI), age at first calving (AFC), body condition score (BCS), animal-based welfare parameters, and infrared thermography data (IRT) were evaluated. The MT significantly influenced the MY (p = 0.0082), with calmer cows outperforming their nervous counterparts. The MS was significantly influenced by the MT (p = 0.0015), with calmer animals having a higher milk ejection rate. The MT of the cows had no influence on the CI, AFC, or BCS. The evidence from this study suggests that the responsiveness of buffalo cows during milking affects their milk yield and milking speed, with no associations being found for reproduction efficiency indicators or animal-based welfare indicators.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have experienced dramatic declines in both range and population size across Canada over the past century. Boreal caribou (R. t. caribou), 1 of the 12 Designatable Units, has lost approximately half of its historic range in the last 150 years, particularly along the southern edge of its distribution. Despite this overall northward contraction, some populations have persisted at the trailing range edge, over 150 km south of the continuous boreal caribou range in Ontario, along the coast and nearshore islands of Lake Superior. The population history of caribou along Lake Superior remains unclear. It appears that these caribou likely represent a remnant distribution at the trailing edge of the receding population of boreal caribou, but they may also exhibit local adaptation to the coastal environment. A better understanding of the population structure and history of caribou along Lake Superior is important for their conservation and management. Here, we use high-coverage whole genomes (N = 20) from boreal, eastern migratory, and barren-ground caribou sampled in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec to investigate population structure and inbreeding histories. We discovered that caribou from the Lake Superior range form a distinct group but also found some evidence of gene flow with the continuous boreal caribou range. Notably, caribou along Lake Superior demonstrated relatively high levels of inbreeding (measured as runs of homozygosity; ROH) and genetic drift, which may contribute to the differentiation observed between ranges. Despite inbreeding, caribou along Lake Superior retained high heterozygosity, particularly in genomic regions without ROH. These results suggest that they present distinct genomic characteristics but also some level of gene flow with the continuous range. Our study provides key insights into the genomics of the southernmost range of caribou in Ontario, beginning to unravel the evolutionary history of these small, isolated caribou populations.

AB  - Reintroduction of European bison into the natural environment is one of the most important conservation measures applied for this species. After creating a free herd of European bison, spatial monitoring is crucial. It allows for observation of the population, as well as the detection of potential threats and needs for intervention. In 2016, a new free herd of European bison was introduced to the Zednia District in Knyszynska Forest. After a few months spent in the acclimation enclosure, the animals were released. The course of their acclimatisation was observed with GPS collars during the next 7 years. Thanks to telemetry monitoring, we could determine the moment when the herd stabilised its home range within available habitats. Monitoring performed for 7 years after the release of the herd confirmed the previously established home range. The fact that the animals remain close to the release site and that there is no damage to the winter crops confirms that the reintroduction site was well chosen.

AB  - ContextThe forestry industry provides important goods, services and economic benefits, but timber harvest can adversely impact ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat. Timber harvest planning can integrate wildlife habitat quality through multi-objective optimization for timber harvest and wildlife habitat suitability.ObjectivesOur objective was to develop a method to find optimal solutions for timber harvest and wildlife habitat suitability individually and concurrently, then apply the method to Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) on Afognak Island, Alaska.MethodsWe developed three seasonal habitat suitability models using elk locations and landscape variables including historical timber harvest on Afognak Island, Alaska. We used threshold-accepting optimization over a 50-year planning horizon to maximize timber harvest yield and habitat suitability in each season, then used multi-objective goal-deviation optimization to simultaneously maximize timber harvest volume and seasonal habitat suitability.ResultsThe optimal solution for timber yield decreased seasonal average habitat suitability by 5.7%. Elk habitat suitability and corresponding optimal solutions varied seasonally; elk generally selected open landcovers and early- to mid-successional timber stands over late-successional and mature stands. Therefore, in the optimal solutions, stands were harvested before they reached maximum volume and few stands were harvested in early planning periods, resulting in a seasonal average loss of 17.5% yield. Multi-objective optimization decreased seasonal average suitability by 3.9% and yield by 1.4% compared to single-objective optimization.ConclusionsOur multi-objective optimization approach that incorporates data-driven habitat suitability models using open-source software can enable managers to achieve desired quantity and quality of wildlife habitat while providing for resource extraction.

AB  - The record of severe defoliation caused by lepidopteran larvae in mangrove forests has increased in recent decades and has caused concern because the mangrove is an ecosystem already threatened by several stressors. In this study, we used Sentinel-2 spatial data to quantify the extent and assess the health of the mangrove forest of the Mamanguape River estuary, Paraiba State, Brazil, in response to severe defoliation of Avicennia germinans and Avicennia schaueriana caused by caterpillars of the invasive exotic moth Hyblaea puera. The caterpillar outbreak was recorded in the period from May to July 2020 and satellite images referring to the years 2019-2021 were evaluated. Mangrove mapping was performed using supervised classification and forest health was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Supervised classification indicated that about 10% of the total mangrove area was intensely affected by defoliation caused by H. puera caterpillar infestation. Proportionally, the area of the A. schaueriana stand was more affected by defoliation than the A. germinans stand. NDVI indicated degraded health of the A. germinans and A. schaueriana stands in October 2020 while an improvement in biomass production was observed in June 2021. The results showed that the A. germinans stand is more resilient than the A. schaueriana stand. The consequences of severe defoliation, caterpillar characteristics, mangrove species details, and methodological issues are discussed.

AB  - Identifying and understanding how resilience is generated in a local socioecological system is essential for the design of future conservation strategies. The Linca sheep represents one of the most important - but least known - biocultural legacies of the Mapuche people in Patagonia. These sheep, which arrived in the region along with the conquistadors more than three centuries ago, have been almost completely displaced by the Merino sheep breed. In this work we analyse the principal components that characterise the producers of Linca sheep. These components are the key for the conservation of this traditional practice and takes a substantial part of local zoological knowledge (LZK). Interviews with artisans (n = 51) who know, require or use Linca wool, either know the breeders, enabled us to contact and interview 13 families who preserve these sheep. Based on an interpretative study we identified 3 biocultural components and 11 analytical variables. Through this analysis of the archetypes, within this universe of producers, we recognized three profiles: Veteran, Tenacious, and Emotionally Attached. The families who have preserved this ancient practice were assigned to one of the three groups based on the shortest Euclidean distance and information obtained from the interviews. Among the main characteristics of these producers the important role played by women stands out, as they preserve and transmit knowledge of the textile language and maintain the diversity of the Linca sheep, transforming their family units into guardians of the biocultural inheritance of this local breed.

AB  - Recycling of solid biowaste and manure would reduce the dependence of agriculture on synthetic products. Most of the available studies on the effects of exogenous organic matter (EOM) application to soil were focused on nutrients and crop yield, with much less attention to microbiological processes in soil, especially using modern molecular methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various types of manure, sewage sludge and bottom sediment on the biochemical activity and biodiversity of soil and plant yield in a pot experiment. The soil was treated with a range of EOM types: six types of manure (cattle, pig, goat, poultry, rabbit and horse manure; two bottom sediments (from urban and rural systems); and two types of municipal sewage sludge. All EOMs stimulated dehydrogenases activity at a rate of 20 t ha(-1). Alkaline phosphatase was mostly stimulated by poultry manure and one of the sludges. In general, the two-fold greater rate of EOMs did not further accelerate the soil enzymes. The functional diversity of the soil microbiome was stimulated the most by cattle and goat manure. EOMs produce a shift in distribution of the most abundant bacterial phyla and additionally introduce exogenous bacterial genera to soil. Poultry and horse manure introduced the greatest number of new genera that were able to survive the strong competition in soil. EOMs differentiated plant growth in our study, which was correlated to the rate of nitrate release to soil. The detailed impacts of particular amendments were EOM-specific, but in general, no harm for microbial parameters was observed for manure and sludge application, regardless of their type. There was also no proof that the PAH and pesticide contents measured in manure or sludge had any effect on microbial activity and diversity.

AB  - Arunachal Pradesh is one of the most bio-diverse and forested states in India. The state is home to 26 tribal groups and 110 sub -tribes. Traditionally, hunting has been a major part of the tribal communities in Arunachal Pradesh. Hunting is conducted majorly for food, recreation, games, trophies collection and for religious beliefs in the area. In this study, we aimed to collect baseline data on hunting rates and the reasons for hunting through primary surveys conducted in 4 major villages of West Siang district in Arunachal Pradesh. The sampling sites also coincided with the proposed locations for the construction of five future hydroelectric power projects in Arunachal Pradesh. We found a total of 34 trophies/hides in the study area with average hunting rates of 0.68 animal/household/annum and 0.97 animal/active hunter/annum. Sus scrofa cristatus (Wild Boar) was the most hunted species, followed by Naemorhedus sp. (Goral) and Ursus thibetanus (Black Bear). Among the most hunted species, 5 belonged to the 'Vulnerable' category of IUCN. Our findings also revealed that if the proposed Environment Management Plans (EMPs) of the 5 hydroelectric power projects were properly implemented, a total of 2000 jobs could be provided to the 2243 families in this study area. This has the potential to alleviate hunting pressures in the area. Besides, the EMPs of all the major hydroelectric power projects have provisions for community awareness and community education programmes. We propose that together with the state governments and non -governmental organizations, the hydroelectric project developers can play a very constructive role in decreasing hunting pressures and mitigating biodiversity losses in Northeast India.

AB  - Context. Understanding the home-range size and the ecological drivers that influence the spatial distribution of feral pigs is of paramount importance for exotic-disease modelling and the improvement of pest management programs. Aims. To investigate various factors affecting home-and core-range size and test selection of habitat, to better inform disease modelling and pest management programs. Methods. In this study, 59 GPS-collared feral pigs were tracked over four sites in eastern Australia between 2017 and 2021. Using minimum convex polygon (MCP) and the nearest-neighbour-local convex hull (k-LoCoH) as home-range estimators and foliage projective cover (FPC) as an estimator of landscape-scale shelter, we investigated the influence of sex, site, season, year and body weight on range size and tested selection of habitat by using chi-squared and Jacob's index tests. Key results. Home-range sizes were highly variable, with k-LoCoH90 (home) ranges between 0.08 and 54.97 km2 and k-LoCoH50 (core) ranges between 0.01 and 7.02 km2. MCP90 ranged between 0.15 and 242.30 km2, with MCP50 being between 0.07 and 60.61 km2. Sex and site both significantly (P < 0.001) influenced home range size, but season and year did not. Home-range size was shown to increase with body mass for both sexes (P = 0.001). Importantly, the data indicated that feral pigs prefer habitat within 20-40% FPC (woodland), whereas open forests (51-80% FPC) and closed forests (> 80% FPC) were actively avoided. Typically, use of open vegetation (1-10% FPC) was also avoided, but this behaviour varied and was dependent on site. Conclusion. Feral pig ranges are influenced by sex, site and body mass but not by season and year. Broad-scale selection for shelter indicated that feral pigs prefer habitat between 20% and 40% FPC. Implications. Targeting or avoiding such areas respectively for control or monitoring tool placement may result in improved, efficient outcomes to monitor or manage feral pig populations. Feral pig distribution modelling may also find benefit in the consideration and further study of the above factors and the influence of food and water sources on the activity ranges and behaviour of feral pigs.

AB  - Fish assemblages of different types of artificial reefs can differ greatly in abundance, biomass and composition, with some reef types harboring over five times more herbivores than others. It is assumed that higher herbiv-orous fish abundance results in a higher grazing intensity, affecting the benthic community by means of enhanced coral recruitment, survival and growth. Territorial fish species might affect this process by chasing away other fish, especially herbivores. In this study we compared the fish assemblage, territorial behavior and grazing intensity by fish on two artificial reef types: reef balls and layered cakes, differing greatly in their fish assemblage during early colonization. In addition, the effect of artificial reef type on benthic development and coral recruitment, survival and growth, was investigated. Although layered cakes initially harbored higher herbivorous fish biomass, this effect was lost during consecutive monitoring events. This seems to be the result of the higher territorial fish abundance around the layered cakes where almost four times more chasing behavior was recorded compared to the reef balls. This resulted in a more than five times lower fish grazing intensity compared to the reef-ball plots. Although macroalgae were effectively controlled at both reefs, the grazing in-tensity did not differ enough to cause large enough structural changes in benthic cover for higher coral recruitment, survival or growth. The high turf algae cover, combined with increasing crustose coralline algae and sponge cover likely explained reduced coral development. We recommend further research on how to achieve higher grazing rates for improved coral development on artificial reefs, for example by facilitating invertebrate herbivores.

AB  - The recovery and conservation of large carnivores can negatively impact the economy of traditional pastoralist societies, including indigenous reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herding communities. Quantifying the magnitude of predation on livestock is critical to evaluating governmental carnivore compensation schemes. We collaborated with two Sami herding communities in northern Sweden (2010-2012) to examine brown bear (Ursus arctos) predation patterns on semi-domesticated reindeer and quantify the economic impact of bear predation. Predation patterns were estimated by following 21 GPS proximity-collared bears and similar to 2500 transmitter-collared female reindeer during calving season. We calculated economic impact by multiplying the monetary value of reindeer by the expected number lost to bears. On average, bears killed 10.2 [8.6, 11.5] calves per bear, accounting for 39-62% of all calf mortality, while few adult reindeer were killed. Bear kill rates increased with time spent in the calving area, and varied widely by individual and reproductive status, e.g., females with cubs-of-the-year did not kill calves. Kill intervals increased over the parturition season, and were larger for sub-adults than adults. The mean reindeer calf predation rate was 16-27%, which resulted in an annual loss between similar to(sic)50,000 and similar to(sic)62,000 per herding group. Current compensation schemes for herding communities in Sweden are calculated as a fixed rate based on herding community land-area. The herding groups in our study were reimbursed for similar to 2% of realized monetary loss. Compensation schemes based on herding community area, rather than realized predation patterns, may be less effective at mitigating the economic impact of living with large carnivores.

AB  - Protected areas have long been recognized globally as an important strategy for conserving biodiversity. However, the establishment of protected areas has often adversely impacted local livelihoods, particularly where people and their livelihoods are exposed to wildlife threats. Understanding the magnitude and the types of human and livelihood losses to wildlife can help to reduce the losses in the future. Here we collected and analysed a large and comprehensive historical data sets on crop damage, livestock depredation, and human attacks over eight years from January 2015 to October 2022 from Serengeti District and Ngorongoro Conservation Area to understand human and livelihood losses to wildlife in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem (GSE). The data were government records of loss and compensation. Additionally, we performed individual interviews on what communities lose to wildlife in the area. We found that wildlife causes serious annual losses of crops (value estimated at USD 489,000) and livestock (USD 17,600). On average 22 people from villages beside or within the protected areas were injured each year and eight people were killed, usually by elephants. Compensation paid by the government to local communities only covered <20% of their total financial losses, and was also very little for the injury or loss of human life. Given our estimates are only for two administrative areas i.e. Serengeti District and Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the figure will be much higher if we include all districts around the GSE. These findings contribute to the broader conservation science field and the global discourse on human-wildlife conflict and coexistence. Protected area authorities should: a. take greater responsibility for protecting local communities and their assets from wildlife attacks, and b. assist the local communities with implementing deterrence and in establishing problematic animal prevention units in hotspot areas. In particular, we recommend that the Tanzanian Government should review the current compensation regulations to reflect the actual loss.

AB  - Context. Monitoring is an essential part of managing invasive species; however, accurate, cost-effective detection techniques are necessary for it to be routinely undertaken. Current detection techniques for invasive deer are time consuming, expensive and have associated biases, which may be overcome by exploiting new technologies. Aims. We assessed the accuracy and cost effectiveness of automated detection methods in comparison to manual detection of thermal footage of deer captured by remotely piloted aircraft systems. Methods. Thermal footage captured by RPAS was assessed using an algorithm combining two object-detection techniques, namely, YOLO and Faster-RCNN. The number of deer found using manual review on each sampling day was compared with the number of deer found on each day using machine learning. Detection rates were compared across survey areas and sampling occasions. Key results. Overall, there was no difference in the mean number of deer detected using manual and that detected by automated review (P = 0.057). The automated-detection algorithm identified between 66.7% and 100% of deer detected using manual review of thermal imagery on all but one of the sampling days. There was no difference in the mean proportion of deer detected using either manual or automated review at three repeated sampling events (P = 0.174). However, identifying deer using the automated review algorithm was 84% cheaper than the cost of manual review. Low cloud cover appeared to affect detectability using the automated review algorithm. Conclusions. Automated methods provide a fast and effective way to detect deer. For maximum effectiveness, imagery that encompasses a range of environments should be used as part of the training dataset, as well as large groups for herding species. Adequate sensing conditions are essential to gain accurate counts of deer by automated detection. Implications. Machine learning in combination with RPAS may decrease the cost and improve the detection and monitoring of invasive species.

AB  - The moose hunting ban in Poland resulted in a dramatic growth in population number which is now the cause of major damage to forests and farmlands and numerous traffic accidents. The lack of well-documented data pertaining to moose numbers constitutes the prime barrier to reopening the hunting season. In February 2020, the population density and number of moose were estimated in the August & oacute;w Forest, a large (1102.0 km(2 )) forest complex in north-eastern Poland. Observations made by a 30-person research team recorded moose numbers in 20 sampling plots on 91.5 km(2 ) of the total area. The average population density amounted to 1.22 +/- 0.19 moose/ km(2 )((X)- +/- SE), indicating that 1344 animals were living in the study area. In autumn, among 609 adults, the sex ratio was 1:1.17 in favour of females and the number of calves per 100 females was estimated as 71.3 individuals. In the 2001-2020 period, the number of moose in the study area increased from 211 to 1344 individuals. The annual finite population increase rate (lambda) estimated on this basis for the subsequent time intervals (Nt, Nt+1) attained the value of 1.102 of the initial number, i.e. 10.2% per year. Reasons of low annual increase in population numbers are discussed.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is an important driver of biodiversity loss and can be remediated through management actions aimed at maintenance of natural connectivity in metapopulations. Connectivity may protect populations from infectious diseases by preserving immunogenetic diversity and disease resistance. However, connectivity could exacerbate the risk of infectious disease spread across vulnerable populations. We tracked the spread of a novel strain of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in a metapopulation of desert bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis nelsoni in the Mojave Desert to investigate how variation in connectivity among populations influenced disease outcomes. M. ovipneumoniae was detected throughout the metapopulation, indicating that the relative isolation of many of these populations did not protect them from pathogen invasion. However, we show that connectivity among bighorn sheep populations was correlated with higher immunogenetic diversity, a protective immune response and lower disease prevalence. Variation in protective immunity predicted infection risk in individual bighorn sheep and was associated with heterozygosity at genetic loci linked to adaptive and innate immune signalling. Together, these findings may indicate that population connectivity maintains immunogenetic diversity in bighorn sheep populations in this system and has direct effects on immune responses in individual bighorn sheep and their susceptibility to infection by a deadly pathogen. Our study suggests that the genetic benefits of population connectivity could outweigh the risk of infectious disease spread and supports conservation management that maintains natural connectivity in metapopulations.

AB  - Non-native species can affect ecosystems by influencing native predator-prey dynamics. Therefore, management interventions designed to remove non-natives may inadvertently lead to increased predation on native species. Feral horses are widely distributed throughout the arid parts of western North America. A growing body of research indicates that horses can be an important prey species to mountain lions in ecosystems where they overlap. In December 2020, the Bureau of Land Management removed 455 horses from the Delamar Mountains, Nevada, USA. We leveraged this management intervention to implement a before-after-control-impact study to test hypotheses about predation on horses and native ungulates. We predicted (1) that horses would comprise an important part of the diet in this mixed-prey community, (2) following removal, the proportion of horses in the diet would decrease and native ungulates would increase, and (3) mountain lion home ranges overlapping the treatment areas would increase in response to decreased prey availability. From 2018 to 2022, we investigated 1360 clusters from 29 GPS-collared lions and identified 1056 prey items. To model the probability of a predation event (a kill), we fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for ungulate prey as a function of lion sex, treatment area (in/out), and treatment period (pre-/post-removal). We used a log-linear regression model to evaluate changes in home range size. The most common prey were mule deer (55%), feral horses (32%), and coyotes (4%). Twenty-two of 29 lions consumed horses, although the rate of horse consumption was highly variable across individuals. Horses of both sexes and all age classes were predated. In contrast to predictions, our models detected no effect of removals on diet composition (beta(interaction) = 0.30 +/- 1.1), nor did the removal influence home range size (beta(interaction) = 0.02 +/- 0.02). Despite a 46% reduction in horse abundance, we found no evidence for prey-switching following the horse removal treatment. Removal magnitude, rapid horse immigration, and/or behavioral specialization of individual mountain lions may help explain these results. Our findings have important implications for mountain lion and feral horse management in arid environments characterized by high prey diversity, but low prey abundance.

AB  - Although genetic diversity and species diversity in a community often covary, the direction and strength of the covariation vary. However, this variation in the relationship of these two diversities is poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of host-specific herbivores in generating species-genetic diversity relationship in plant communities. We quantified host specificity for Fagaceae plants-acorn weevil bipartite networks in a subtropical forest and modeled the effect of weevil herbivory on the relationship. The results showed a consistently negative relationship between Fagaceae species diversity and the genetic diversity of the dominant species, Lithocarpus glaber. Our analysis showed this negative relationship arose from a positive effect of weevil host-specificity on Fagaceae plant richness on the one hand and the negative effect of weevil host-specificity on the genetic diversity of L. glaber on the other hand. This latter negative effect was possibly due to differentiated selection of weevils on different genotypes of L. glaber. Our study highlights the importance of considering trophic interactions and herbivore host-specificity in explaining the species-genetic diversity relationship.

AB  - Pathogens can cause host extinction, affect population dynamics and influence natural selection. Host susceptibility to pathogens can vary by species, demographics and genetics which affect epizootic and population dynamics, ultimately determining population trends and evolution. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neuro-degenerative prion disease of cervids, has varying host susceptibility conferred by polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP) at codon 96 for white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Deer with the homozygous Glycine allele (96GG) are most susceptible and a single Serine allele (96GS/96SS) reduces the risk of infection and mortality. We developed epizootiological models that demonstrate CWD infection and disease-associated mortality were higher for the more susceptible (96GG) genotype; and, infection was higher for males than females. We used population models to evaluate future shifts in genotype frequencies under alternative harvest and infection rate scenarios. Genetic shifts towards less susceptible genotypes were predicted as CWD prevalence increased during the course of an outbreak. This further increased CWD prevalence, and likely environmental contamination from prion shedding, due to longer incubation periods. Alternative harvest management strategies directly influenced CWD prevalence and spread, the rate of genetic selection and deer population growth. Synthesis and applications. We show that chronic wasting disease (CWD) transmission varied by sex, age class and PRNP genotype, and that CWD disease-associated mortality varied by genotype. Together, these forces lead to CWD-mediated genetic selection for a white-tailed deer population. We predict that genetic selection pressure increases when hunter harvest pressure is lowered, and conversely, increasing hunter harvest can reduce genetic selection rates of antlered deer. Our results support the control of CWD prevalence by aggressive harvest of adult males, because they have the highest infection rates. Our results have strong implications for evolution, disease ecology, geographical spread, disease mitigation and cervid population management.

AB  - Human activities can affect the behaviour and fitness of wildlife. However, the response of animals to nonlethal human activities has not been well-studied in wild boar, Sus scrofa, even though it is a widespread species in Europe and has become of increasing concern because of crop damages and its vector capacity for diseases. We study the behavioural responses of GPS-collared wild boar to nonlethal experimental human approaches in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem along the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. We describe and quantify the flight responses of the animals and assess whether they vary with the distance to recreational paths and the occurrence of hunting in the area. We show that wild boar were disturbed and displaced by human approaches on foot in 69% of the trials, but the average flight initiation and escape distances were relatively small (93 and 256 m, respectively). The probability of a flight response decreased with distance from the paths and increased with the ruggedness of the terrain. In the non-hunting zone, the flight initiation distances and flight durations were shorter than in the hunting zone. Our results suggest a weak effect of nonlethal human disturbances on the movement of wild boar, although the animals were sensitive to the perceived risk in relation to recreation infrastructure and hunting. For the management of diseases such as African swine fever, it can be concluded that nonlethal disturbances are unlikely to accelerate the spread of the disease due to far-distance movements. Guidelines for restrictions in case of an outbreak might be adjusted accordingly.
   Menschliche Aktivit & auml;ten k & ouml;nnen das Verhalten und die biologische Fitness von Wildtieren beeinflussen. Die Reaktion von Tieren auf nicht-t & ouml;dliche menschliche Aktivit & auml;ten wurde jedoch bei Wildschweinen (Sus scrofa) nur unzureichend untersucht, obwohl diese Art in Europa weit verbreitet ist und wegen Sch & auml;den in der Landwirtschaft und der & Uuml;bertragung von Krankheiten zunehmend im Fokus steht. Wir untersuchten die Verhaltensreaktionen von mit GPS-Halsb & auml;ndern ausgestatteten Wildschweinen auf experimentelle menschliche Ann & auml;herungen im B & ouml;hmerwald-& Ouml;kosystem an der Grenze zwischen Deutschland und Tschechien. Wir beschreiben und quantifizieren die Fluchtreaktionen von Wildschweinen und evaluieren, ob diese mit der Entfernung zu Wanderwegen und jagdlichen Aktivit & auml;ten in einem Gebiet variieren. Wir konnten zeigen, dass Wildschweine in 69% der Versuche durch menschliche Ann & auml;herung zu Fu ss gest & ouml;rt und vertrieben wurden, jedoch waren die durchschnittlichen Fluchtinitiationsdistanzen und Fluchtstrecken relativ gering (93 m bzw. 256 m). Die Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Fluchtreaktion nahm mit der Entfernung von Wegen ab und stieg mit der Unebenheit des Gel & auml;ndes an. In der jagdfreien Zone waren die Fluchtinitiationsdistanz und Fluchtdauer k & uuml;rzer. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten auf einen schwachen Einfluss nicht-t & ouml;dlicher menschlicher St & ouml;rungen auf das Bewegungsverhalten von Wildschweinen hin, zeigen aber auch, dass die Tiere empfindlich auf das wahrgenommene Risiko in Bezug auf Erholungsinfrastruktur und Jagd reagieren. F & uuml;r den Umgang mit Krankheiten wie der Afrikanischen Schweinepest kann daraus geschlussfolgert werden, dass eine Beschleunigung der Ausbreitung einer Seuche durch nicht-t & ouml;dliche St & ouml;rungen unwahrscheinlich ist. Die Leitlinien f & uuml;r Einschr & auml;nkungen im Falle eines Ausbruchs k & ouml;nnten entsprechend angepasst werden.
   Human off-trail activities induced frequent flight responses of wild boar, but escape distances were relatively short, suggesting a limited impact on their movement. Wild boar adjusted their response according to terrain ruggedness, distance from paths and hunting zonation. These insights are valuable for wildlife management and disease control strategies, such as for managing African swine fever outbreaks.image

AB  - Buckspoor spiders (Araneae: Eresidae: Seothyra Purcell) are a distinct lineage of burrow-inhabiting web-building spiders endemic to the arid and semi-arid parts of southern Africa. We investigated the role of substrate and vegetation characteristics on site selection in Seothyra schreineri Purcell in the xeric Nama Karoo of the western Free State Province, South Africa. We studied web densities in two 0.5 ha plots in an open habitat grazed by sheep and found declining web densities with increasing distance from the border fence. Web densities in the 1 m2 plots were negatively correlated with increasing grass density, positively correlated with increasing percentage fine gravel, whereas shrub cover, litter, hard soil and stones had a very weak effect. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of fine gravel in Nama Karoo landscapes is a key factor determining the occurrence of S. schreineri, a finding that can guide future sampling efforts, leading to a more complete prediction of the species' distribution and, ultimately, its overall conservation status.

AB  - The alpine wetlands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have degraded in recent decades. However, the response of the soil food web to the degradation is still unclear. Four habitats including a wet meadow (WM), a grassland meadow (GM), a moderately degraded meadow (MDM) and a severely degraded meadow (SDM) (sandy meadows) were selected along the degrees of degradation. The soil macrofaunal biomass and the environmental factors of vegetation and soil were investigated. The soil macrofaunal community biomass increased significantly from WM to MDM and decreased to a very small amount in SDM, with most taxa disappearing. The biomass of the trophic groups of detritivores, herbivores and predators exhibited similar responses to soil macrofaunal communities. The relative biomass of detritivores increased from WM to MDM, but herbivores responded in an opposite manner, resulting in the dominant trophic group and trophic structure varying progressively from WM to GM to MDM. Soil properties but not vegetation determined the changes in trophic groups and trophic structure. The results implied that the higher trophic levels (carnivores or omnivores) responded more sensitively than the lower trophic levels (herbivores) to alpine wetland degradation. Our results also suggested that soil macrofauna have a habitat-specific characteristic trophic structure and can be used as indicators of soil health conditions. (C) Higher Education Press 2021

AB  - PurposeCryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis are zoonotic protozoan parasites that are widely seen in domestic and wild animals worldwide. While these pathogens, which affect the digestive system of the hosts, cause high economic losses in animal breeding, they are also considered an important public health problem. In recent years, molecular-based studies revealed that 120 genotypes belonging to 44 Cryptosporidium species and eight G. duodenalis assemblages (G. duodenalis A-H) circulate among hosts. The aim of the study was to determine the presence and prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiosis in buffaloes, for which there was only one previous study on the subject in T & uuml;rkiye.MethodsIn this study, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis were researched in water buffaloes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. A total of 510 water buffalo stool samples were obtained from Sivas province, an important water buffalo breeding center in T & uuml;rkiye.ResultsCryptosporidium spp. were detected in 20 samples (3.92%), whereas five samples (0.98%) were found to be infected with G. duodenalis. DNA sequence analyses of 18S rRNA and beta-giardin genes revealed that five Cryptosporidium species, C. occultus (n = 1), C. andersoni (n = 1), C. ryanae (n = 16), C. parvum (n = 1), and C. bovis (n = 1), and G. duodenalis assemblages E were circulated in water buffaloes in T & uuml;rkiye, respectively. In this work, C. ryanae was the most prevalent Cryptosporidium species, and DNA sequence analyses of these samples showed that 100% nucleotide identities were present between them. Cryptosporidium occultus (PP754270), C. andersoni (PP754271), C. ryanae (PP754272-PP754279, PP754281-PP754285, PP754287-PP754289), C. parvum (PP754280), and C. bovis (PP754286) obtained from water buffaloes in this study shared 98.59-100%, 99.88-100%, 99.49-100%, 99.62-100%, and 99.87-100% nucleotide similarity with isolates present in GeneBank, respectively. In addition, G. duodenalis (PP798352-PP798356) isolates had 99.56-100% (beta-giardin) nucleotide identities with G. duodenalis isolates.ConclusionThe existence of cryptosporidiosis (the five species) in water buffaloes was reported for the first time in the country. Moreover, one species (C. occultus) has been reported for the first time in T & uuml;rkiye.

AB  - Many researchers have adopted the use of indicator species to detect changes in the environment and predict future ecological modifications. Irrespective of the popularity of indicator species concept among scientists in recent times, there is less studies on the use of mega semi-aquatic mammals as indicator species, especially in Africa. This study determined the ecological role of Hippopotamus amphibius and how the mammal respond to environmental changes in an aquatic ecosystem, focusing on changes in biological diversity (fish and phytoplankton) and environmental factors (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total dissolved solids, hydrogen isotope, and oxygen isotope) by comparing pools harboring H. amphibius and pools without H. amphibius at the Bui National Park, Ghana. The results show that H. amphibius play an important ecological role by indicating high productivity in aquatic ecosystem and serving as influencers of the aquatic food web at Bui National Park. The results found significantly higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen in H. amphibius pools than pools without H. amphibius. Significantly higher diversity of fish and phytoplankton species were recorded in pools with H. amphibius. Common fish species identified during this study include, Oreohromis niloticus, Labeo coubie, Alestes dentex and Labeo senegalensis. Phytoplankton communities were dominated by Chlorophyceae (37.26%), Cyanophyceae (25.21%), and Bacillariophyceae (21.53%). The study results also showed that H. amphibius are sensitive to changes in depth of water, preferring areas with shallow pools. Managerial options for H. amphibius populations require strong support because of their socio-ecological benefits including potential ecosystem effects, increasing fishing and tourism value at the Bui National Park.

AB  - During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 30 to 16.5 ka ago), the Great Adriatic-Po Region (GAPR) was deeply affected by the spread of glaciers from the Alps to the southern foreland and by the dropping of the sea level to similar to -120 m amsl. The combination of these two events triggered the aggradation of the Great Po Plain (GPP), a vast flat area between the Alpine chain, the Italian Peninsula and the north-western Balkan Peninsula, physically and ecologically featured through a range of palaeogeographic and palaeoecological conditions. The low-elevated Prealpine sectors and the Alpine foothills supported more extensive forest stands, due to increased omgraphic rainfall. These were open boreal forests which persisted throughout the LGM, while open woodlands, steppes, semideserts and wetlands occupied the lowlands. A complex ecogradient, including both an Alpine and a continental timberline, is documented by the fossil records at the NE Alpine border, with a larch-pine forest-steppe belt, in contact with steppes and loess areas extending in the plain, on the dry extreme of the gradient. Still, edaphic wetlands occupied the waterlogged silty soils in the lowlands. Other areas, marked by active geodynamic processes, supported semideserts, i.e. grooves of xerophytic herbs and shrubs. Enhanced aridity and the development of deflation areas, prompted the accretion of loess cover at the northern and southern margins of the GPP. Fauna recorded the gradual disappearance of mammoth, woolly rhino and giant deer, together with cave bear. Gravettian and Epigravettian hunter-gatherer groups inhabited the GPP, although their presence and settlement dynamics at the margins and across this region has long been questioned. As a matter of fact, a handful of archaeological sites composes a patchy record of the peopling of the plain itself. At the northern rim of the GAPR, characterized by a well-developed karst region, several caves and rock shelters record the presence of hunters of bisons and horses at the margins of the GPP and ibexes and cave bears in some hilly landscapes. Nonetheless, evidence of contacts across this area is provided by the exploitation of chert sources and by stylistic and technical similarities in the lithic industries. The work resumes the currently available multidisciplinary data and adds new petroarchaeological evidence for reconstructing the settlement dynamics of the Gravettian - Epigravettian hunter-gatherers in this vast region up to the early Late Glacial, when the Prealpine and the Apennine foothills, along with the Dinarids, were persistently settled.

AB  - We describe the population density, biodiversity and vertical distribution in the sediment of benthic foraminifera, and their relationship to environmental parameters, in the Kveithola Trough (NW Barents Sea). Two staining methods, Cell Tracker Green (CTG) and Rose Bengal (RB), were used to distinguish between living and dead tests. CTG proved to be more effective than RB, and we therefore used this approach to document faunal assemblage variability along a transect of the Trough. The outer shelf shows a diverse benthic foraminiferal assemblage suggesting an oxygenated and oligotrophic environment. The central part appears to be a disturbed area due to rapid circulation changes and organic matter burial in sediments where opportunistic foraminifera colonize only the first centimetres. In contrast, the inner part of the Trough seems to be a stressed environment where species associated with organic-rich sediment and oxygen-depleted environments dominate the living assemblage. At all sites, delicate monothalamids species form part of the assemblage. The peculiar geomorphological and environmental conditions of this area, and the high regional primary and secondary production, are key drivers of foraminiferal assemblage distribution.

AB  - The vitality of European forests continues to decline due to new pests and diseases, climate-change related disturbances and high loads of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Deteriorating soil health is a major factor underpinning the low vitality of West-European forests. Selecting tree species with soil ameliorative traits is proposed as an avenue to counteract soil acidification and improve overall forest vitality. Here we evaluate the impact of black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), a known rich litter species, on the vitality of neighboring pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) in ten mixed forests on sand in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. We found that black cherry admixture increases foliar N and P to a surplus whereas it causes deficiencies in foliar Mg, thereby resulting in an overall negative effect on oak foliar nutrient concentrations. Contrary, defoliation of oak leaves by herbivory decreases with the proximity of black cherry. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we tested the hypothesized 'improved soil health' pathway. Our analyses showed that black cherry admixture leads to lower accumulation in the humus layer, resulting in higher soil base saturation which has a positive effect on foliar Ca yet a negative effect on total chlorophyll. Moreover, the SEM illustrated that herbivory of oak leaves decreases when black cherry is admixed, both via dilution and improved soil health. Indirect effects of black cherry on oak vitality via "improved soil health" in our SEM are however small in comparison to direct relations. Hence, our study showed that the combined positive and negative impacts of black cherry on oak vitality are limited, which tempers the potential benefits of using the rich litter species to counteract oak decline via improved soil health - yet, the concern of black cherry as an invasive alien species negatively affecting the vitality of mature pedunculate oak trees may also be exaggerated.

AB  - Newly germinated seedlings are vulnerable to biomass removal but usually have at least 6 months to grow before they are exposed to dry-season fires, a major disturbance in savannas. In contrast, plants are exposed to browsers from the time they germinate, making browsing potentially a very powerful bottleneck for establishing seedlings. Here we assess the resilience of seedlings of 10 savanna tree species to topkill during the first 6 months of growth. Newly germinated seeds from four dominant African genera from across the rainfall gradient were planted in a common garden experiment at the Wits Rural Facility and clipped at 1 cm when they were ~2, 3, 4 and 5 months old. Survival, growth and key plant traits were monitored for the following 2.5 years. Seedlings from environments with high herbivory pressure survived topkill at a younger age than those from low-herbivore environments, and more palatable genera had higher herbivore tolerance. Most individuals that survived were able to recover lost biomass within 12 months, but the clipping treatment affected root mass fraction and branching patterns. Synthesis. The impact of early browsing as a demographic bottleneck can be predicted by integrating information on the probability of being browsed and the probability of surviving a browse event. Establishment limitation through early browsing is an under-recognized constraint on savanna tree species distributions.

AB  - High host density combined with climate change may lead to invasion of harmful parasites in cervid (host) populations. Bot flies (Diptera: Oestridae) are a group of ectoparasites that may have strong impact on their hosts, but data on the current distribution, prevalence and intensity of the moose nose bot fly (Cephenemyia ulrichii) in Scandinavia are lacking. We estimated prevalence and intensity of nose bot fly larvae in 30 moose from southern and 79 moose from central Norway. All larvae detected were identified as the moose nose bot fly. We found surprisingly high prevalence in these areas, which are up to 1300 km south-southwest of the first published location in Norway and west of the distribution in Sweden. Prevalence (0.44-1.00) was higher in areas with higher moose density. Parasite intensity in hunter killed moose was higher in central Norway (mean 5.7) than southern Norway (mean 2.9), and in both regions higher in calves and yearlings than adults. Fallen moose had higher parasite intensity (mean 9.8) compared to hunter killed moose in the subsample from central Norway, suggesting a link to host condition or behavior. Our study provides evidence of parasite range expansion, and establishing monitoring appears urgent to better understand impact on host populations.

AB  - Sambar (Rusa unicolor) is the largest oriental deer and has a wide distribution across South and Southeast Asia. Despite its wide distribution range, little information on the genetics of this species is available to date. We examined the genetic variability of Sambar populations using a partial fragment of the mtDNA control region and reconstructed the phylogeographic association of Sambar populations across India. We detected 56 haplotypes with an overall haplotype diversity, Hd = 0.939 +/- 0.012 and nucleotide diversity, Pi = 0.029 +/- 0.002 in Sambar populations across India. The Sambar populations of Northeast India exhibits 30 localized mtDNA control region haplotypes with no haplotype sharing with other populations of India. We identified a 40 bp tandem repeat motif in the mtDNA control region with variable copy numbers ranging between three to six duplications. The Sambar populations across India exhibited phylogeographic differentiation based on the observed insertion and deletion patterns in the mtDNA control region. The 40 bp tandem repeat motif was associated with patterns of insertions and deletions among different populations of Sambar in India. The findings of this study provide baseline information on the mtDNA genetic variability of Sambar populations across India, which is crucial for future population genetic studies.

AB  - An individual whale shark (Rhincodon typus) was recorded on January 15, 2020, during the marine megafauna drone-monitoring. The animal was filmed for approximately 400 m of swimming at an average speed of 4.8 km/h, 650 m southwest of the mouth of a river impacted by the rupture of a mining tailing dam 5 years ago. The whale shark is a filter-feeding and highly migratory species. This is a rare record of this threatened species, representing the importance of recovering and protecting biodiversity in the Rio Doce river mouth region.

AB  - A severe marine heat wave (MHW) persisted in the California Current ecosystem from 2014 through 2016. The MHW featured record-high sea surface temperatures in 2015, with 2014 to 2016 being the warmest 3 yr period on record. Our decade-long (2010-2019) breeding and diet monitoring of the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata, a burrow-nesting seabird, at significant breeding colonies on Destruction Island (California Current) and Protection Island (Salish Sea) allowed us to compare reproductive and dietary responses to this MHW. Although the colonies are relatively close to each other, and their reproductive output is, on average, similar, the auklets' responses to the MHW differed. At Destruction Island, burrow occupancy rates were lower during the MHW (0.54 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.02 [mean +/- SE] in non-MHW years), suggesting that birds skipped breeding, but fledging success rates did not differ (0.85 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.03). At Protection Island, burrow occupancy remained at non-MHW levels (0.72 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.02), but reproductive success declined (0.71 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.02). Chick provisioning also showed different patterns. The energy (kJ) per bill load at Destruction Island showed no clear MHW effect, while at Protection Island, it was reduced. At the same time, bill-load prey item count rose at Protection Island, indicating increased foraging effort and/or a reduction in diet quality. Our results further suggest rhinoceros auklets may be more resilient than other seabird species to major climate perturbations. However, with MHWs predicted to become more frequent and severe, the auklets' ability to maintain these levels of breeding success will be tested.

AB  - Blowflies are often the first to colonize a cadaver, making them valuable forensic indicators for estimating the post-mortem interval (PMI). However, understanding the decomposition process by blowflies in practice presents challenges due to the direct influence of adults and larvae on the process. Environmental factors can either hinder or stimulate colonization by different species, leading to variability across different settings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the variation in the community of adult and immature stages of Calliphoridae blowflies during pig carcass decomposition in an island area of the Amazon rainforest. We identified changes in abundance, richness, and species composition separately for adults and larvae and measured the congruence between larval and adult communities. Our findings revealed that the peak abundance of adults preceded the peak abundance of larvae during carcass decomposition. Eleven species were collected within the first 4 days of decomposition, of which only seven colonized the carcass. Species composition differed between life stages and decomposition phases, with larvae associated with the skeletonization phase and adults with the colliquative phase. The species composition of adults collected from the decomposing carcass corresponded to that of larvae collected 1 day later. This is the first study conducted in an Amazonian island environment in the extreme north of Brazil to document the cadaveric fauna and analyze the congruence between adult and larval communities of blowflies. These insights contribute to forensic entomology understanding and assist forensic professionals, particularly in tropical regions with high rates of unsolved homicides like Brazil.

AB  - In contrast to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Antarctic salps (Salpa thompsoni) respond positively to warmer water temperatures and have the ability to create massive blooms under favourable conditions. Therefore, they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S. thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem management, protection, and conservation.

AB  - Local Ecological Knowledge and social perceptions of human communities that depend on natural resources can provide important baseline information on local threats and impacts at a fine scale for conservation management. Seahorses play important economic role in Brazilian mangroves, being sought-after for seahorse-watching tours. This touristic activity is not yet formally regulated and our work is a contribution to seahorse-watching management at three study sites located in two Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) - Jericoacoara National Park, and Delta do Parnaiba Environmental Protection Area - in the Brazilian northeast states of Ceara, Piaui, and Maranhao. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigated the perception of seahorse-watching operators regarding seahorse abundance, local threats, and conservation insights in mangrove ecosystems. We interviewed all 38 existing informants at the study sites. Approximately half of the informants rely exclusively on seahorse-watching as an income source. Overall, 55.3% highlighted declines in seahorse abundance, 100% believed that seahorses are threatened with extinction. Silting (57.9%), fishing (55.3%), and pollution (37%) were cited as main threats to seahorses and mangroves. Among the proposed conservation actions, environmental surveillance (57.9%), zoning (26.3%), education (26.3%) were the most cited. Respondents support the MPAs but would like to see greater engagement of management institutions towards the communities, considering their local needs. Some differences in perception between communities reflect local realities and social contexts, which should be considered for conservation and management effectiveness. Our study contributes supporting this approach, as local scale studies on social perceptions can improve conservation and local management, especially for data-poor species.

AB  - Climate change is increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation, and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in many ecosystems. As atmospheric carbon rises, plants may increase carbon-based defenses, such as phenolics, thereby potentially affecting food quality, foraging habits, and habitat suitability for mammalian herbivores. In alpine habitats, the American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a model species for studying effects of changing plant chemistry on mammals. To survive between growing seasons, pikas cache "haypiles" of plants rich in phenolics. Although they are toxic to pikas, phenolic compounds facilitate retention of plant biomass and nutrition during storage, and they degrade over time. Alpine avens (Geum rossii, Rosales: Rosaceae) is a high-phenolic plant species that comprises up to 75% of pika haypiles in Colorado. Here, we tested the hypothesis that contemporary climate change has affected the nutritional value of alpine avens to pikas in the last 30 years. Specifically, we compared phenolic activity, nutritional quality, and overwinter preservation of plants collected at Niwot Ridge, Colorado (USA), in 1992 to those collected between 2010 and 2018, spanning nearly three decades of climate change. Phenolic activity increased in alpine avens since 1992, while fiber and nitrogen content decreased. Importantly, overwinter preservation of plant biomass also increased, particularly on windblown slopes without long-lasting snow cover. Previous studies indicate that pikas at this site still depend on alpine avens for their winter food caches. Higher phenolic content in alpine avens could therefore enhance the preservation of haypiles over winter; however, if pikas must further delay consuming these plants to avoid toxicity or invest extra energy in detoxification, then the nutritional gains from enhanced preservation may not be beneficial.

AB  - Indigenous pig breeds are mainly associated with the adaptive capacity that is necessary to respond adequately to climate change, food security, and livelihood needs, and natural resources conservation. Livni pigs are an indigenous fat-type breed farmed in a single farm in the Orel region and located in the Central European part of the Russian Federation. To determine the genomic regions and genes that are affected by artificial selection, we conducted the comparative study of two pig breeds with different breeding histories and breeding objectives, i.e., the native fat-type Livni and meat-type Duroc breeds using the Porcine GGP HD BeadChip, which contains similar to 80,000 SNPs. To check the Livni pigs for possible admixture, the Landrace and the Large White breeds were included into the study of genetic diversity as these breeds participated in the formation of the Livni pigs. We observed the highest level of genetic diversity in Livni pigs compared to commercial breeds (H-U(E) = 0.409 vs. 0.319-0.359, p < 0.001; A(R) = 1.995 vs. 1.894-1.964, p < 0.001). A slight excess of heterozygotes was found in all of the breeds. We identified 291 candidate genes, which were localized within the regions under putative selection, including 22 and 228 genes, which were specific for Livni and Duroc breeds, respectively, and 41 genes common for both breeds. A detailed analysis of the molecular functions identified the genes, which were related to the formation of meat and fat traits, and adaptation to environmental stress, including extreme temperatures, which were different between breeds. Our research results are useful for conservation and sustainable breeding of Livni breed, which shows a high level of genetic diversity. This makes Livni one of the valuable national pig genetic resources.

AB  - International trade in croaker swim bladders or maws and incidental catches in fisheries targeting croakers for their maws pose a global problem that needs addressing to protect target croakers and globally threatened small cetaceans, sharks, rays and marine turtles.The lesson of the likely imminent extinction of the vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) in the Gulf of California, Mexico, owing to entanglement in gillnets targeting the totoaba croaker for its maw, is that the underlying threats to marine species must be addressed well before precipitous declines make their extinction inevitable.Opportunistic interviews with fishers and fish traders in Bangladesh indicate that the increasing demand for fish maws, selling for as much as 5,000 USD per kg, may be intensifying small-scale coastal fisheries and bycatches of globally threatened marine wildlife, especially due to the potential for a windfall profit.In 137 croaker catches made in gillnets, sharks were bycaught in 22%, marine turtles in 8% and rays in 3% of catches. Of particular concern were six bycatches of 125 Critically Endangered scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini), 11 bycatches of 20 Vulnerable (VU) olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) and two bycatches of 13 VU longtail butterfly rays (Gymnura poecilura).A recent IUCN Motion for 'Controlling and monitoring trade in croaker swim bladders to protect target croakers and reduce incidental catches of threatened marine megafauna' recommends conducting an analysis on the impacts of the demand for and trade in fish maws on croaker species and threatened marine megafauna, regulating trade in fish maws through national laws and developing a potential proposal to list croaker species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).To prevent species extinctions, additional measures focusing on fishery management will be needed.

AB  - The study area is situated at Robert Island, which is located in the South Shetland Islands in the northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula. The diatom samples were taken as part of the Turkish Antarctic Expedition (TAE-II) which took place between March and April 2018. The samples were collected from the surface of sediments (c. 5 cm) at a depth of approximately 20 cm, 50-100 cm from the littoral zones of an inland glacial lake (L1) and three coastal lakes (L2, L3 and L4) situated on glacier-free area on Robert Island. The main objective of this study was to reveal the diversity and the abundance of diatom communities in the littoral sediments of the lakes on Robert Island. The lakes were shallow and oligotrophic freshwater lakes, although the coastal lagoons had a high conductivity and nutrient concentration. Twenty-six diatom taxa belonging to Achnanthes (1), Fragilaria (1), Frustulia (1), Gomphonema (1), Halamphora (1), Hantzschia (1), Hippodonta (1), Humidophila (2), Luticola (3), Melosira (1), Nitzschia (4), Pinnularia (3), Planothidium (2), Psammothidium (2), Stauroneis (1) and Stephanopterobia (1) were identified in the samples from these lakes. The coastal lake L2 showed the highest richness of diatom communities among the in studied lakes, with 21 identified taxa.

AB  - The study of home range utilization of rewilded animals is important for informed reintroduction management. Sixteen Milu adult individuals (5 male 11 female) were reintroduced from Jiangsu Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve to Hunan East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve on February 28, 2016, out of which 11 Milu individuals (1 male 10 female) were wearing GPS satellite tracking collars. Subsequently, with the aid of GPS collar technology, combined with on-ground tracking observations, we tracked the reintroduced Milu for one year from March 2016 to February 2017. We used the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model to estimate the individual home range of the 10 rewilded Milu (1 male 9 female, 1 female individual was eliminated because its collar fell off) and seasonal home range of 5 rewilded female Milu (all tracked for up to one year). 95% level represented the home range, and 50% level represented the core areas. Temporal variation in normalized difference vegetation index were used to quantify changes in food availability. We also quantified resource use of rewilded Milu by calculating the selection ratio for all habitats within their core areas. The results showed that: (1) a total of 52,960 coordinate fixes were collected; (2) during the early stage of rewilding, the average home range size of the rewilded Milu was 17.62 +/- 3.79 km(2) and the average core areas size was 0.77 +/- 0.10 km(2); (3) the annual average home range size of the female deer was 26.08 +/- 5.21 km(2) and the annual average core areas size was 1.01 +/- 0.14 km(2) at the early stage of rewilding; (4) during the early stage of rewilding, the home range and core areas of the rewilded Milu were significantly affected by season, and the difference between summer and winter was significant (home range: p = 0.003; core areas: p = 0.008); (5) home range and core areas of the rewilded female deer in the Dongting Lake area in different seasons showed significant negative correlation with NDVI (home range: p = 0.000; core areas: p = 0.003); (6) Most rewilded female Milu showed a high preference for farmland in all seasons except winter, when they focused on using lake and beach. The home range of the rewilded Milu in the Dongting Lake area at the early stage of rewilding experienced significantly seasonal changes. Our study reveals seasonal differences in the home ranges of rewilded Milu and the resource use strategies of individual Milu in response to seasonal changes. At last, we put forward the following management recommendations: (1) to establish habitat islands; (2) to implement community co-management; (3) to reduce human disturbance; (4) to strengthen population monitoring for formulating species conservation plans.

AB  - Reassembling ecological communities and rebuilding habitats through active restoration treatments require curating the selection of plant species to use in seeding and planting mixes. Ideally, these mixes should be assembled based on attributes that support ecosystem function and services, promote plant and animal species interactions and ecological networks in restoration while balancing project constraints. Despite these critical considerations, it is common for species mixes to be selected opportunistically. Reframing the selection of seed mixes for restoration around ecological objectives is essential for success but accessible methods and tools are needed to support this effort. We developed a framework to optimize species seed mixes based on prioritizing plant species attributes to best support different objectives for ecosystem functions, services and trophic relationships such as pollination, seed dispersal and herbivory. We compared results to approaches where plant species are selected to represent plant taxonomic richness, dominant species and at random. We tested our framework in European alpine grasslands by identifying 176 plant species characteristic of the species pool, and identified 163 associated attributes affiliated to trophic relationships, ecosystem functions and services. In all cases, trophic relationships, ecosystem functions and services can be captured more efficiently through objective-based prioritization using the functional identity of plant species. Solutions (plant species lists) can be compared quantitatively, in terms of costs, species or objectives. We confirm that a random draw of plant species from the regional plant species pool cannot be assumed to support other trophic groups and ecosystem functions and services. Synthesis and Applications. Our framework is presented as a proof-of-concept to help restoration practitioners better apply quantitative decision support to plant species selection to efficiently meet ecological restoration outcomes. Our approach may be tailored to any restoration initiative, habitat or restoration targets where seeding or planting mixes will be applied in active treatments. As global priority and resources are increasingly placed into restoration, this approach could be advanced to help make efficient decisions for many stages of the restoration process.

AB  - Context Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii) was once widely distributed across Southeast Asia but is now endangered. The strong hold of the subspecies R. e. siamensis is largely restricted to north and east Cambodia, with only small, spatially isolated populations known to occur.Aims To assess if camera traps and spatial capture-recapture methodology can estimate population size of Eld's deer in Siem Pang Wildlife Sanctuary (SMWS).Methods Infra-red and white flash camera traps were set at 83 grid-point locations (83 km2) over a 5-month sampling period and used a Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR) model to estimate population size, relying on natural markings to identify males and using sex ratios to extrapolate a population estimate.Key results We estimated the number of Eld's deer in SMWS to be 272 (95% CI: 169-435). We affirmed that white flash camera traps are advantageous in identifying individuals without significantly affecting detection probability.Conclusions Monitoring the small and difficult to detect subpopulations of R. e. siamensis is challenging. Camera traps can be used although there are challenges to resolve when using the SECR model that can be improved by using white flash cameras to improve the identification of individuals, and assisted with sex and age determination.Implications The SPWS population may potentially be the largest of the R. e. siamensis subspecies in Southeast Asia and it is therefore of critical conservation importance that long term camera trap monitoring is established.

AB  - Natural processes and patterns are altered by human activity at different spatial and temporal scales, affecting species assemblages and population traits, modifying mechanisms or regulating dynamics at different scales. However, little is known about the influence of landscape structure on small mammal assemblages and populations on farms. Thus, in this work, we aimed to study the effect of landscape and environmental characteristics at the farm scale on the assemblage and populations of native and introduced small mammals in pig and dairy farms located in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Our results showed that farms in contexts of higher environmental diversity at the landscape scale have higher species richness. Our results also showed that variations in assemblage composition were associated with the quantity of water body surfaces, cattle food, small mammal refugia, and impervious surfaces at the farm scale-and with woodland, grassland, and natural vegetation cover at the landscape scale. The abundance of commensal murids was higher on farms near towns, with higher vegetation cover at the farm scale and/or in landscape contexts with fewer crops. The abundance of Akodon azarae was higher on farms with a lower amount of cattle food at the farm scale and crop patches in the landscape. The abundance of Didelphis albiventris was higher during spring on farms with a low proportion of bare ground, while that of Lutreolina crassicaudata was higher on farms with high vegetation cover and a lower number of water body surfaces. These results show the relevance of multiscale determinants in the development of ecologically based management strategies to control pest small mammals.
   Our research addresses the influence of landscape and farm structure on small mammals. Our results show multiscale determinants on small mammal assemblages and population abundances. Our findings reveal associations, linking water bodies, vegetation cover, and landscape structure to assemblage composition and abundance. Species richness increased with landscape heterogeneity.
   Los procesos y patrones naturales se ven alterados por la actividad humana a distintas escalas espaciales y temporales, afectando tanto a los ensambles de especies como a sus poblaciones, modificando mecanismos o regulando sus dinamicas en distintas escalas. Poco es lo que se sabe acerca de la influencia de la estructura del paisaje sobre dichos ensambles y poblaciones. En este trabajo, estudiamos el efecto del paisaje y de variables ambientales dentro de las granjas sobre el ensamble y las poblaciones de pequenos mamiferos nativos e introducidos, en criaderos de cerdos y tambos de la provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nuestros resultados muestran que establecimientos en contextos de mayor diversidad ambiental a escala de paisaje poseen mayor riqueza especifica. Ademas, muestran que las variaciones en la composicion de los ensambles estuvieron asociadas a las proporciones de agua, comida para ganado, refugio para pequenos mamiferos y superficies impermeables a escala de granja y a las proporciones de arboles, pastizales y parches de vegetacion natural a escala del paisaje. Las poblaciones de muridos comensales fueron mayores en establecimientos cercanos a las ciudades, con mayor cobertura vegetal alta y en contextos de paisajes sin cultivos. Las abundancias de Akodon azarae fueron menores en verano y mayores en establecimientos con menor proporcion de comida para ganado y de parches de cultivo en el paisaje. La abundancia de Didelphis albiventris fue mayor durante la primavera en establecimientos con baja proporcion de suelo desnudo, mientras que la abundancia de Lutreolina crassicaudata fue mayor en granjas con coberturas vegetales altas y con menor proporcion de agua. Estos resultados muestran la pertinencia de los analisis multiescala para la elaboracion de estrategias de manejo de pequenos mamiferos plagas basadas en fundamentos ecologicos.

AB  - Studies of aquatic macroinvertebrates in high-altitude rivers in the Andes are scarce, and little is known about the trophic role that these organisms play in these ecosystems. In the present work, the microhabitat preference of the aquatic macroinvertebrate community was studied and its trophic guilds was described through the analysis of stomach contents in two high Andean rivers of Peru. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between abundance, richness, Pielou equity index and effective number of species between the microhabitats studied in both rivers. The highest values of wealth in both rivers were found in the medium stone microhabitat, being the most abundant and diverse the members of the Diptera order. The lowest values of richness were found in the rock microhabitat. Four food items were identified: fine particulate organic matter (MOPF), microalgae (MA), animal remains (RA) and vegetable tissue (TV), of which MOPF was the predominant one in almost all the organisms analyzed, which shows that MOPF is the main food item consumed in both rivers. Spatially, it was the detritivores and herbivores that were in great proportion in almost all the microhabitats in both high Andean rivers.

AB  - Earthworms are an important part of terrestrial ecosystems that are often acknowledged for their diverse ecological functions. Mizoram, one of the northeastern regions (NER) of India, was assessed for earthworm diversity and genetic variability based on integrated taxonomical procedures using morpho-anatomical features and sequencing of the COI gene. For species delimitation, three barcoding approaches, i.e., ABGD, BIN, and barcode gap analysis (BGA), were employed, and the K2P intraspecific, as well as interspecific distances, were evaluated in MEGA X. Also, for phylogenetic studies, maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian interference (BI) trees were generated. The genetic variability and haplotype analysis were assessed using DnaSP and Network. The morpho-anatomical features revealed 20 species that belonged to 3 families (Moniligastridae, Megascolecidae, and Rhinodrilidae) across 5 genera: Drawida, Amynthas, Metaphire, Perionyx, and Pontoscolex. Furthermore, we reported 12 new earthworm records from Mizoram that includes Amynthas carinensis carinensis, Metaphire anomala, Perionyx rufulus, P. depressus, Pontoscolex corethrurus, Drawida bullata, D. victoriana, D. vulgaris, D. papillifer papillifer, D. nagana, D. periodosa, and D. assamensis species. The mean K2P intraspecific and minimum interspecific genetic distances were 9.59% and 13.97%. Moreover, the species P. depressus and M. houlleti showed deep intraspecific divergence and are composed of several cryptic species. ABGD proposed a barcode gap of 10-12%, whereas BGA suggested around 13%. All the species were strongly supported in MP and BI trees; however, P. depressus appeared polyphyletic and the paraphyly or polyphyly of genera Amynthas and Metaphire were supported. Furthermore, the network revealed 43 haplotypes, and the genetic diversity was highest in P. depressus and M. houlleti.

AB  - Migratory animals often transport allochthonous materials, energy or organisms from donor to recipient ecosystems, thereby affecting the dynamics of consumers, communities and ecosystems in the recipient systems. The biomass of migrants is commonly assumed to be equal to that of the allochthonous materials they transport, with the inherent assumption that migrant bodies are produced purely from allochthonous resources. However, the extent to which the body composition of many migratory animals consists of allochthonous materials [e.g., the proportion of total body mass consisting of allochthonous resources, hereafter degree of allochthony (DOA)] may gradually decrease if the animals consume autochthonous resources during their migration. Ignoring this process leads to an overestimation of the magnitude and temporal features of material subsidies. In this study, we quantified the DOA of nine amphidromous fish species that migrate from marine to rivers, using the sulphur stable isotope (delta 34S) analysis. The DOA varied substantially among species (11%-82%) and even within species (Sicyopterus japonicus had the highest DOA: 22%-97%). Species with larger body sizes tended to exhibit a lower DOA. This trend was also observed at the species level for six of the nine species, with five species showing an additional pattern of later migrating individuals with lower DOA. These results imply that quantifying DOA is important for accurately estimating material subsidies across ecosystems, owing to the upstream migration of amphidromous fish. Life-history studies of amphidromous fishes are crucial for elucidating the mechanisms behind inter- and intraspecific variation in DOA, which ultimately contributes to a better understanding of marine-river ecosystem linkages mediated by these fishes.

AB  - Home range of pampas deer in a human-dominated agro-ecosystem. The subspecies of pampas deer Ozotocerus bezoarticus uruguayensis is an endemic and endangered cervid from southeast Uruguay. However, knowledge regarding its home range requirements in agroecosystems is scarce. Our aim was to survey ten radio-collared pampas deer for two years to monitor their movements. The mean home-range size was 5.54 +/- 3.18 km(2). The core area size for all individuals monitored was 0.87 km(2) , which concurs with grazing crops for beef cattle. The population showed philopatric behavior and no significant differences were detected in the total area of occupation in respect to sex and season.

AB  - Simple Summary Our findings support the enemies hypothesis in urban agroecosystems. Local factors, including increased mulch coverage, crop richness, and percent of non-crop areas, are predictors of increased PH abundance and aphid parasitism rates. Our findings support and strengthen previous findings in UA research. Urban farmers should be encouraged to diversify urban agroecosystem spatial composition and implement APM practices to reduce pest impacts. Urban agriculture is practiced in spatially fragmented landscapes with unique characteristics that can impact species occurrence in time and space. As a result, biological control services, an ecosystem service from naturally occurring arthropod natural enemies, can be negatively impacted. Many urban farms forgo pesticides and utilize agroecological pest-management strategies that rely on natural enemies to help regulate pest populations. Understanding how these enemies are affected by landscape composition and on-farm management practices is critical to understanding agroecological pest management in UA and furthering our understanding of landscape-mediated population dynamics. Over two growing seasons, we sampled brassica crops in urban agriculture sites occurring on a spectrum of surrounding landscape imperviousness, spatial composition, size, and management practices to better understand parasitic Hymenoptera abundance, richness, and parasitism rates on the common cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae). We found that on-farm agroecological pest-management practices such as mulch coverage, floral richness, and overall crop-plant richness impacted parasitic Hymenoptera abundance. Larger proportions of on-farm noncrop area increased parasitoid abundance on urban farms. Aphid parasitism increased in relation to on-farm management practices, including increased crop-plant richness. These findings add to a growing understanding of urban agroecosystem function and support the enemies hypothesis in urban agroecosystems.

AB  - Chinese domestic pig breeds have abundant genetic resources, but definite information about the geogra-phic specificity and genetic structure is lacking. In this study, we analysed 359 mitochondrial D-loop sequ-ences, including 86 sequences from Chinese domestic pigs and the rest downloaded from GenBank. The haplotype and nucleotide diversity indices ranged from 0.467 +/- 0.132 (Duroc) to 1.000 +/- 0.500 (Thailand, North Korea and Cambodia) and 0.00067 +/- 0.00019 (Duroc) to 0.02000 +/- 0.01000 (Thailand), respectively. The neighbour-joining tree revealed two clads in the individual pigs, with a Chinese domestic breed distri-buted discontinuously among several breeds. The network data indicated that the gene pools of Chinese domestic pigs are likely related to Chinese, Japanese and some other Southeast Asian wild boars.

AB  - 1. Invasive plants are a major problem for land managers and have widespread and lasting environmental impacts. The invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is a pervasive and noxious plant in the Midwest region of the United States. 2. Despite this, many land managers may be uncomfortable with herbicide control of this and other invasive plants due to unknown impacts on ecosystem components including soils. 3.To examine if herbicide control of Amur honeysuckle impacts soil enzyme activity and soil communities, we treated Amur honeysuckle with Garlon((R)) 4 (triclopyr) suspended in Basal Bark Oil, Basal Bark Oil alone and untreated controls, then assessed soil community, soil enzyme activity and arbuscular mycorrhizal density changes among treatments and across the subsequent growing season. 4.We found that basal bark herbicide treatments of Amur honeysuckle do not negatively impact soil enzyme activity, nor do they impact fungal, prokaryotic or oomycotan diversity or community structure. There was a slight but likely ecologically unimportant effect on community structure associated with basal bark oil applications, but not with herbicide applications. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was negatively affected by herbicide use but this is likely due to reduction in host health and/or mortality. 5.Taken together, this suggests that herbicide control of Amur honeysuckle does not impact soils and land managers can treat these invasive plants without concern for negative soil outcomes.

AB  - Effective management of protected areas is crucial for addressing the global biodiversity crisis. In water-limited savannas, altered herbivory regimes contribute to ecosystem degradation, creating a need for tools to track herbivore impact on vegetation. Here, we present the Spatially and Temporally Explicit Herbivory Monitoring (STEHM) tool, a novel methodology for monitoring herbivory pressure in near real-time. This approach combines herbivore abundance estimates, derived using a detection algorithm (YOLO v10) performed on imagery collected with camera traps placed at waterpoints across protected areas, with satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) to classify vegetation cover. STEHM enables weekly herbivory assessments, facilitating adaptive herbivore management at scales down to a few square kilometers. By linking herbivore dynamics to surface water availability-a primary factor influencing large herbivore distributions-STEHM provides a framework to disentangle ecological drivers of plant-herbivore interactions. Over one year, we collected and applied STEHM to a total of 2,275,309 individual camera trap images across two case study sites in northern Namibia, leading to the detection of 100,826 waterpoint visits by ten focal species. These observations revealed consistent differences in herbivory pressure between waterpoints, with some areas experiencing concentrated pressure, and a seasonal decline in less waterdependent species during the rainy season, while water-dependent species remained present. Findings indicate that water availability manipulation can alleviate pressure in high-impact areas as non-selective grazers shift to other waterpoints. This refined monitoring capability supports adaptive conservation strategies, providing spatially explicit, near real-time data on herbivore densities to enable targeted management and promote savanna restoration.

AB  - Participatory modeling and fuzzy cognitive mapping of social-ecological systems offers a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems inclusive of multiple perspectives and diverse types of knowledge. Many Indigenous communities attribute recent declines in boreal moose populations to forestry disturbance and are insisting that their observations, knowledge, and values contribute more meaningfully to forestry and moose co-management. Here we describe a knowledge co-production approach documenting Cree social-ecological understanding of moose habitat quality in the Eeyou Istchee territory of northern Qu & eacute;bec, Canada, almost 20 years after the implementation of a forestry co-management regime. Thirty-seven fuzzy cognitive mapping sessions with 56 land-users from 4 Cree communities identified 18 categories that influence good moose habitat, including physical ("Climate & Weather"), ecological ("Habitat Features, Moose Forage"), and social contributors ("Hunting & Predation, Cree Culture"). Knowledge maps highlight the diverse interrelationships that land users know to influence moose habitat quality and point to key social variables (hunting activity, noise disturbance) that should be included in wildlife-habitat models, as well as specific aspects of forestry practice and management that Cree know to negatively impact moose populations despite the implementation of a co-management regime. Our findings highlight how fuzzy cognitive mapping can bring together individual expertise into a collective knowledge account, inclusive of multiple understandings and experiences that allows for the identification and ranking of variables and relationships. Fuzzy cognitive mapping summarizes the plurality of Cree social-ecological knowledge in a form that is accessible, applicable, and actionable within local, regional, and provincial co-management regimes.

AB  - Nowadays, in the era of automation of ecological measurements, more and more often we are dealing with large data sets in which various unexpected anomalies may occur. Their detection is often crucial for a proper assessment of ecological trends and processes. Therefore, methods allowing for identification of anomalous data are especially important for a deep understanding of ecological phenomena and their relationships in practical domains. In this study, we present an innovative application of information granules to the in-depth study of spatial behavior of the European bison (Bison bonasus), based on GPS data. As evidenced by a series of numerical experiments, this granular computing-based approach allows to detect both anomalies and regularities in the atypical behavior of the European bison, a species important for local ecosystems. The transformation of the original data space into a new semantic multidimensional space, defining the degree of membership in the anomaly class represented by new descriptors allows for more unambiguous analysis of non-standard animal behavior.

AB  - We analyzed long-term camera-trap data from Protected Areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to study activity patterns of coexisting peccary species (Tayassu pecari and Dicotyles tajacu) and the exotic wild boar (Sus scrofa). The highest pattern overlap was between D. tajacu and S. scrofa (Delta 1 = 0.78), followed by T. pecari and S. scrofa (Delta 1 = 0.64), and the lowest between D. tajacu and T. pecari (Delta 1 = 0.61). In the presence of feral pigs, collared peccary activity exhibited two distinct peaks, occurring in the late evening and early morning. When coexisting with white-lipped peccaries, their activity peaks early in the evening and again in the mid-morning, potentially enabling them to avoid overlapping with the activity peaks of white-lipped peccaries, which are distributed throughout the day. Our findings suggest a potential interference of wild boars in the temporal niche dynamics of native peccaries across various areas within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. Nonetheless, we emphasize the imperative for more focused investigations at both regional micro and macro scales throughout the Atlantic Forest, specifically delving into other dimensions of the niche, such as food and habitat utilization among the three species.

AB  - Eriophyoid mites are among the most species-rich superfamilies (Eriophyoidea) in the Acari, consisting of over 5000 named species. Although they exhibit a geographically uneven worldwide distribution, their regional spatiotemporal evolutionary patterns remain largely unknown. Here, we compiled a data set including 3058 occurrence records assigned into 1203 species in China. We found that eriophyoid mite species richness is higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest of China, coinciding with the 500-mm annual precipitation isoline. Using fragments of two mitochondrial genes (COI, 12S rRNA) and two nuclear genes (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA) of 304 eriophyoid mite species, we constructed a regional dated phylogenetic tree in China. Our spatiotemporal analysis revealed that mountains in eastern and southern China had high eriophyoid mite species richness and phylogenetic clustering, possessing both ancient and young mite lineages. Species distribution modelling (SDM) results showed that the predicted suitable area of eriophyoid mites slightly expanded from the last inter-glacial period to the last glacial maximum period. In comparison with the current SDM, a significantly larger distribution range was observed in future scenarios. These findings suggest that mountains in eastern and southern China acted as not only cradles-recent rapid speciation, but also museums-centre of gradual accumulation and preservation and provide insights into monitoring and conserving eriophyoid mites.

AB  - Trees growing outside their native geographic ranges often exhibit exceptional growth and survival due in part to the lack of co-evolved natural enemies that may limit their spread and suppress population growth. While most non-native trees tend to accumulate natural enemies over time, it remains uncertain which host and insect characteristics affect these novel associations and whether novel associations follow patterns of assembly similar to those of native hosts. Here, we used a dataset of insect-host tree associations in Europe to model which native insect species are paired with which native tree species, and then tested the model on its ability to predict which native insects are paired with which non-native trees. We show that native and non-native tree species closely related to known hosts are more likely to be hosts themselves, but that native host geographic range size, insect feeding guild, and sampling effort similarly affect insect associations. Our model had a strong ability to predict which insect species utilize non-native trees as hosts, but evolutionarily isolated tree species posed the greatest challenge to the model. These results demonstrate that insect-host associations can be reliably predicted, regardless of whether insect and host trees have co-evolved, and provide a framework for predicting future pest threats using a select number of easily attainable tree and insect characteristics.

AB  - Human-induced nutrient pollution threatens coral reefs worldwide. Although eutrophication disrupts coral microbiomes, often leading to coral mortality, it is unknown whether eutrophication impacts the microbiomes of other coral reef organisms. Of particular interest are herbivorous fishes, whose algae consumption is critical in maintaining healthy corals. To examine the effects of eutrophication on fish gut microbiomes, we experimentally enriched territories of Stegastes nigricans, a predominantly herbivorous damselfish that farms turf algae. Using 16S RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that hindgut and foregut microbiomes have significantly higher alpha diversity in nutrient-enriched territories as compared to unenriched controls. S. nigricans gut microbiomes also exhibited significantly different compositions across treatments. In contrast, these changes were not observed in the microbiomes of the turf algae consumed by S. nigricans, indicating that the gut microbiome changes were autochthonous. Combined, our results provide a novel example of endogenous microbial shifts in wild vertebrates caused by simulated anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Maintaining functional connectivity is critical for the long-term conservation of wildlife populations. Landscape genomics provides an opportunity to assess long-term functional connectivity by relating environmental variables to spatial patterns of genomic variation resulting from generations of movement, dispersal and mating behaviors. Identifying landscape features associated with gene flow at large geographic scales for highly mobile species is becoming increasingly possible due to more accessible genomic approaches, improved analytical methods and enhanced computational power. We characterized the genetic structure and diversity of migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus using 4051 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 406 individuals sampled across multiple habitats throughout Wyoming, USA. We then identified environmental variables associated with genomic variation within genetic groups and statewide using a stepwise approach to first evaluate nonlinear relationships of landscape resistance with genetic distances and then use mixed-effects modeling to choose top landscape genomic models. We identified three admixed genetic groups of mule deer and found that environmental variables associated with gene flow varied among genetic groups, revealing scale-dependent and regional variation in functional connectivity. At the statewide scale, more gene flow occurred in areas with low elevation and mixed habitat. In the southern genetic group, more gene flow occurred in areas with low elevation. In the northern genetic group, more gene flow occurred in grassland and forest habitats, while highways and energy infrastructure reduced gene flow. In the western genetic group, the null model of isolation by distance best represented genetic patterns. Overall, our findings highlight the role of different seasonal ranges on mule deer genetic connectivity, and show that anthropogenic features hinder connectivity. This study demonstrates the value of combining a large, genome-wide marker set with recent advances in landscape genomics to evaluate functional connectivity in a wide-ranging migratory species.

AB  - Resting is an integral component of animal behavior, contributing to one's fitness through careful optimization strategies. In large herbivores, resting periods are driven by availability of food, presence of predators, and thermoregulation. A combination of these drivers leads to high variability in resting behaviors and their time allocation throughout the day. However, these drivers are rarely evaluated in the wild. Megaherbivores, including giraffe (Giraffa spp.), adopt social resting strategies, which enable them to optimize the cost-benefit ratio, with rest and vigilance varying with group size and composition. We investigated resting behavior of the West African giraffe (G. camelopardalis peralta) living in a human-populated landscape dominated by agropastoralism activities in Niger. Through direct observation, we evaluated the influence of group size and composition, and presence of livestock and humans on giraffe resting behavior. We concluded that giraffe increased their resting time with shorter distance to other giraffe and livestock. Livestock did not negatively impact giraffe behavior; rather, they provided a kind of "safe environment". Human presence resulted in only minor changes in vigilance of giraffe and did not significantly affect their resting time. Our findings highlight a positive instance of human-giraffe coexistence in a human-dominated landscape, attributed to the long-term benefits of conservation efforts.

AB  - Effective wildlife management often requires data on population size, survival, sex ratios, and site fidelity; however, obtaining these metrics can be difficult in areas or years when traditional techniques such as aerial surveys are ineffective or prohibitive, resulting in a need for alternative sampling techniques. In this study, we developed a methodology for estimating demographics of an urban moose (Alces alces) population by combining reports from the public and genetic mark-recapture data. From 2018-2021, we elicited the public's help during a 3-day period in late February to locate moose for biopsy sampling in Anchorage, Alaska, USA. Each year, >800 reports from the public allowed us to obtain 891 biopsy samples. Combined with an additional 493 samples obtained from roadkilled or harvested moose, we identified 837 unique individuals with 433 recapture events (recapture rate = 59%). Using genetic mark-recapture techniques, we estimated there to be 306 (95% CI = 222-390) moose within Anchorage, a relatively high density (1.5 moose/km(2)) suggesting urban areas may have perceived advantages to moose such as reduced predation risks, greater foraging opportunities, or lower snow depths on plowed roads and groomed trails. Additionally, moose exhibited high winter site fidelity and moved <3.0 km between captures on average. However, survival rates of adults (73%; 95% CI = 60-83%) and calves (i.e., individuals surviving from 9 months of age to the subsequent February survey; 48%; 95% CI = 32-65%) were low, suggesting urban areas may act as an ecological trap due to mortality risks from vehicle collisions. This study showed that by eliciting public participation in an urban environment, genetic mark-recapture was a feasible alternative to traditional aerial surveys to estimate moose population demographics, a technique that could easily be adapted to other urban areas and wildlife species.

AB  - The Overberg area, Western Cape, South Africa is highly suitable for agricultural practices and has subsequently been severely transformed over the last four centuries. This has created a novel habitat for many wildlife species. The objective of this study was to determine the forage use of five antelope species and thereby assess their level of anthrodependence in terms of diet. The five species were bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), Cape grysbok (Rhaphicerus melanotis), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) and steenbok (Rhaphicerus campestris). To do this, we performed a histological analysis on dung samples collected. Our study indicated a high ratio of anthropogenic to natural vegetation in the diets of bushbuck, grey rhebok and steenbok, as anthropogenic vegetation presented a high nutrient food resource, which is easily accessible. However, Cape grysbok and common duiker indicated a higher use of natural vegetation. The results indicated that all the species benefit from the resources offered by the altered landscape and that some species may be dependent on these resources while others appear to be more dependent on the pockets of natural vegetation in the landscape.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus is a vector of dengue worldwide. Knowledge of the behavior of dengue vectors facilitates effective vector control. This is the first comprehensive analysis of selected vertebrate excreta of goat, cow and pig to identify the oviposition attraction and growth performance of Ae. albopictus in Sri Lanka. The current study revealed that Ae. albopictus gravid females are significantly attracted to goat excreta but are repelled by pig excreta. The oviposition preference was highest for the cow excreta and lowest for the pig excreta. For excreta combinations, the Cow+Goat combination increased the oviposition while the Pig+Goat combination reduced the oviposition. The oviposition preference of Ae. albopictus increased with the rate of fermentation. The pig excreta increased the Ae. albopictus larval mortality, larval and pupal duration and reduced adult fecundity, whereas the cow excreta positively affected all these aspects. Additionally, our findings suggest that a high abundance of Ae. albopictus in rural areas of Sri Lanka is possibly due to its oviposition attraction and the growth performance of the vertebrate excreta.
   Aedes albopictus is an important vector of dengue worldwide. Eliminating dengue in Sri Lanka depends entirely on controlling the vector and human-vector contact. Thus, studying the bionomics and behavior of Ae. albopictus is paramount. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the excreta of cow, goat and pig on the attraction, oviposition and development of Ae. albopictus. Bioassay chambers determined the mosquito stimulatory response. Ovitraps determined Ae. albopictus oviposition preference to excreta singly, in combination and on fermentation. The excreta effect on larval development was also determined. The results revealed that Ae. albopictus gravid females were significantly attracted to goat excreta but were repelled by pig excreta. The oviposition preference was highest for cow excreta and lowest for pig excreta. For excreta combinations, the Cow+Goat combination increased the oviposition while the Pig+Goat combination reduced the oviposition. The oviposition preference of Ae. albopictus increased with the rate of fermentation. The pig excreta increased the Ae. albopictus larval mortality, larval and pupal duration and reduced adult fecundity, whereas the cow excreta positively affected all these aspects. Our findings additionally suggest that a high abundance of Ae. albopictus in rural areas of Sri Lanka may be due to its oviposition attraction and growth performance for vertebrate excreta.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are often considered sustainable; but comprise 95% of global fishers and cumulatively evoke substantial ecosystem impacts that include collateral mortalities. Marine mammals and sea turtles are particularly vulnerable to SSF and have been the focus of conservation strategies. However, many strategies have fallen short of objectives. This study aimed to elucidate and help resolve associated issues by: compiling global efforts to mitigate marine-mammal and sea-turtle bycatches/fishing mortalities among SSF; identifying successful outcomes and influencing factors; and then suggesting steps for mitigating remaining problems. Among 150 articles, there was exponential temporal output, with gillnets the most studied gear (67%). Approximately 71% of all publications proposed mitigation measures but of these, efficacy was assessed in fewer than 2/3. While essential for conservation, community engagement was poorly initiated-although relevant studies have increased in the last decade, which may be correlated with studies describing management approaches instead of typical bycatch assessments. Mitigation measures were assessed in a 'strength-weaknesses-opportunities-and-threats' analysis. Mitigation measures should benefit multiple species ('strengths'), avoid high costs/maintenance ('weaknesses'), be supported by community engagement and governmental aid/enforcement ('opportunities'), and consider non-compliance ('threats'). Collateral mortalities can be reduced among SSF, but regional adoption of technology requires impetus that is best achieved via community engagement.

AB  - El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) events drive profound global impacts on marine environments. These events may result in contrasting conditions in the Southern Ocean, with differing effects on euphausiid species because of their diverse life histories, habitats, and feeding ecologies. We conducted oceanographic surveys during winter (2012-2016) around the northern Antarctic Peninsula and examined the dietary carbon sources, trophic position, and body condition of five euphausiid species (Euphausia crystallorophias, E. frigida, E. superba post-larvae and larvae, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura) in relation to environmental conditions each year. In addition to general patterns among taxa, we focused on how contrasting conditions during an ENSO-neutral year (2014) and an ENSO-positive year (2016) affected the type, quality, and distribution of food resources each year, as well as the body condition of each species. We observed high chlorophyll-a, low salinity, and shallow upper mixed-layer depths in 2014, and low chlorophyll-a, high salinity, and deep upper mixed-layer depths in 2016. Carbon sources varied among years, with most species enriched in delta C-13 when ENSO conditions were dominant. Trophic position and body condition also varied among years, with different responses among species depending on conditions; inter-annual variation in delta N-15 was minimal, while E. triacantha was the only species with notably lower body condition in 2016. We conclude that ENSO conditions around the northern Antarctic Peninsula may result in a more favorable feeding environment for all euphausiid species except E. triacantha, which may be the most negatively impacted by the predicted increase in ENSO conditions.

AB  - Allelopathic effects may be a contributing factor in the mixed success of legume re-establishment in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.)-dominated pastures. Under controlled conditions, we evaluated whether aqueous shoot or root extracts from Kentucky bluegrass would affect seed germination for three alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars after a 7-day incubation period. Both shoot and root extracts had an inhibitory effect on alfalfa seed germination for all cultivars. AAC Trueman was the least affected and AC Caribou the most affected by aqueous Kentucky bluegrass root extracts, suggesting that the capacity for rejuvenating old pastures may vary among alfalfa cultivars.

AB  - As the ecological security barrier in northwestern China, understanding how natural grassland (NG) utilization pattern transformation in the northern Qilian foothills affects soil quality and ecosystem multifunctionality supports regional ecosystem management. The study compared soil chemical and biological properties, soil quality index (SQI), and soil ecosystem multifunctionality (SMF) among four grassland utilization patterns in the northern foothills of the Qilian Mountains, Gansu Province, China. Soil samples were collected in early October 2024 following crop harvest from the following systems: traditionally grazed NG, monocropping Hordeum vulgare (barley; MHV), monocropping Avena sativa (oat; MAS), and Hippophae rhamnoides shrubland (sea buckthorn; HRS). The results showed that compared with NG, SQI was decreased by 52.69% (p = 0.000059) under MHV treatment and by 18.78% (p = 0.03) under MAS treatment, while HRS did not have a significant reduction in SQI. Under the three patterns of transformative utilization of NG, SMF followed the order of HRS (0.11) > MAS (-0.06) > MHV (-0.51). Overall, the establishment of restoration vegetation (sea buckthorn shrubland) retained SQI under different grassland utilization patterns in the study area, whereas long-term monocropping resulted in significant reductions in SQI and SMF due to compromised chemical and biological properties.

AB  - Wild boar (Sus scrofa) reappeared in Flanders, Belgium in 2006 after more than half a century of absence. Besides being a native and highly valued game species in Europe, wild boar are also known to be responsible for car collisions, crop damage, disease transmission, and ecological damage at high densities. The management of wild boar therefore seeks to balance these positive and negative impacts. Given the highly fragmented landscape in Flanders and its multifunctional use, coexistence with wild boar is only possible through integrated management involving relevant stakeholder groups. However, to be successful, this requires that the management objectives, the overall wild boar policy of the Flemish authorities, and management actions are supported by the stakeholders. To assess the support for the current management, we conducted a survey among members of the 3 key stakeholder groups: farmers, hunters, and conservationists. Our survey assessed the importance stakeholders attribute to different management objectives, their support for the current legal provisions, and how desirable the different stakeholder groups considered possible management actions. The potential for conflict index was used to analyze the (dis)agreement between and within stakeholder groups. Reducing or preventing crop damage and the risk for car accidents are indicated as being the most important management objectives by all 3 stakeholder groups. Stakeholder groups differ strongly in their support for the current legal provisions. Those stakeholders that have to implement the legal provisions or are mostly affected by these laws are less supportive than others. The desirability of the possible management actions strongly varied according to the different stakeholder groups. Contrary to other studies, the desirability of a possible management action was hardly influenced by the management objective it tried to achieve.

AB  - A 7-year multisite field experiment was performed to assess the relative importance of climate, soil, and mi-crobial properties of crop production in a wheat cropping system under contrasting fertilization management (i. e., continuous organic vs. chemical fertilization). The results showed that continuous organic application increased the annual grain yield and soil organic carbon by an average of 13.2% and 38.0%, respectively, compared to chemical fertilization. Continuous organic application increased the soil pH, which led to a sig-nificant increase in bacterial richness (i.e., Chao1) and diversity (i.e., Shannon index). Notably, organic appli-cation favored the growth of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria but reduced the abundances of Bacteroides, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria, which ultimately led to a more complicated bacterial co-occurrence network. Importantly, organic application increased the abundances of functional genes involved in C fixation (e.g., sdhD, ACO, and acsB), C degradation (e.g., pulA, celC, and CBH2), N fixation (e.g., anfG and amoC) and nitrification (e. g., nifK), as well as P transporters (e.g., ugpQ and phnC). The structural equation modeling (SEM) results indi-cated that the annual air temperature and soil pH under chemical fertilizer treatment and the bacterial com-munity structure and functional gene abundance under treatment with organic application were the primary drivers of the yield performance. Variance partitioning analysis further revealed that under chemical fertiliza-tion, climate, soil, the bacterial community, and potential function explained 32.0%, 26.7%, 19.9% and 21.4%, respectively, of the overall variance in crop productivity; however, these values shifted to 16.6%, 8.3%, 34.5% and 40.6%, respectively, when organic fertilizer was applied. These findings suggest that continuous organic application reduces the contribution of climate and edaphic conditions to crop yield compared to chemical fertilization but strengthens the associations between soil microbial function and crop production. Overall, this work provides new insights into the complexity of fertilization-induced climate-plant-microbial interactions and highlights the importance of intensified biological interactions for the sustainability of cropping ecosystems.

AB  - Plastic pollution is potentially a major threat to the health of terrestrial organisms, including megafauna, but its effects are relatively understudied compared to marine ecosystems. Here we document the presence of plastic macro-particles in the dung of the greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis) in the Terai landscape of Nepal. Field data were collected deep within Chitwan National Park and its fringe zone during the monsoon and post-monsoon season of 2020, 2021 and 2022. Over three years, we recorded plastic in similar to 10% of 258 rhino dungs piles. This is an underestimate since we did not record micro-particles or search entire dungs. More dungs located deep within the national park (core zone) contained plastic compared to the fringe zone and we recorded no difference in plastic incidence between riverine forest and floodplain grasslands. Rhinos do not appear to target garbage dumps as food sources but are exposed to plastic when foraging. The plastic is carried down river during monsoonal floods and deposited in rhino habitat as the flood waters recede. The relatively higher rate of plastic detection in rhino dungs from the core zone is probably due to details of rhino ranging, and is a potential threat to other wildlife in the river floodplains. We recommend more detailed studies on the patterns and effects of plastic ingestion by rhinos and other wildlife. A comprehensive waste management system within the landscape is required to reduce such threats.

AB  - The Small East African (SEA) goat are widely distributed in different agro-ecological zones of Tanzania. We report the genetic diversity, maternal origin, and phylogenetic relationship among the 12 Tanzanian indigenous goat populations, namely Fipa, Songwe, Tanga, Pwani, Iringa, Newala, Lindi, Gogo, Pare, Maasai, Sukuma, and Ujiji, based on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop. High haplotype (H-d = 0.9619-0.9945) and nucleotide (pi = 0.0120-0.0162) diversities were observed from a total of 389 haplotypes. The majority of the haplotypes (n = 334) belonged to Haplogroup A which was consistent with the global scenario on the genetic pattern of maternal origin of all goat breeds in the world. Haplogroup G comprised of 45 haplotypes drawn from all populations except the Ujiji goat population while Haplogroup B with 10 haplotypes was dominated by Ujiji goats (41%). Tanzanian goats shared four haplotypes with the Kenyan goats and two with goats from South Africa, Namibia, and Mozambique. There was no sharing of haplotypes observed between individuals from Tanzanian goat populations with individuals from North or West Africa. The indigenous goats in Tanzania have high genetic diversity defined by 389 haplotypes and multiple maternal origins of haplogroup A, B, and G. There is a lot of intermixing and high genetic variation within populations which represent an abundant resource for selective breeding in the different agro-ecological regions of the country.

AB  - The conversion of natural ecosystems due to anthropogenic activities has led to the destruction of natural habitats and to the deterioration of habitat quality. Top predators particularly respond sensitively to changes in habitat structures, including the availability of prey. The cheetah Acinonyx jubatus prefers small-medium-sized, wild ungulate prey due to the cheetah's morphological adaptations. However, the majority of the species' population is found beyond protected areas, where habitat structures, species abundances, and community composition are highly influenced by human activities. Only few studies have analyzed the diet preference of cheetahs in relation to prey availability and abundance for rangelands beyond protected areas in Eastern Africa. The study aimed to determine cheetah prey preference in the rangelands of south-eastern Kenya based on scat analyses. We compared dietary preference of cheetah with prey availability. For this purpose, we conducted standardized game counts. We analyzed 27 cheetah scat samples collected across the same study area where we also conducted game counts. We found that Grant's gazelle Gazella granti contributed the highest portion of cheetah's diet, although Thomson's gazelle Gazella thomsonii was the most abundant medium-sized ungulate prey in the study areas. We also recorded two primate species, yellow baboon Papio cynocephalus and vervet monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus, as well as the rock hyrax Procavia capensis in the cheetah diet. These species have never been documented as cheetah prey before. Furthermore, our results document livestock as potential prey for cheetahs. These observations underline that cheetah use diverse prey in rangelands outside protected areas, and that the abundance of specific prey does not influence cheetah prey preference.

AB  - Naturally or artificially created diverse vegetation habitats often promote natural enemies of crop pests. The abundance of natural enemies increases with response to increasing habitat complexity at various spatial scales. Against this backdrop, we assessed the contribution of shade trees to conserve beneficial predatory and parasitoid arthropods at local scale in a subtropical tea agroecosystem in Bangladesh. Arthropods viz., predators and parasitoids were captured using Malaise traps in plots with shade trees and in those without shade trees having three different densities of tea bushes due to naturally created gaps (large-gap, small-gap and control). The number of arthropods captured in each plot corresponded to shade-tree and tea-bush densities, such that arthropod abundance in the shade-tree plot was twice that of the control plot, which had similar tea-bush density but no shade trees. Predators were least abundant in the large-gap plot, which had the lowest tea-bush density and no shade-trees, while 2.4-3.8 folds predators were captured in the control and shade-tree plots. There was a negative correlation between mean light intensity and number of predators in the four plots. Similar trends were observed for parasitoids. Relative abundance of predatory Staphylinidae was more than twice in the shade-tree and small-gap plots compared to control and large-gap plots. Relative abundance of parasitoid Ichneumonidae was ranked as small-gap > shade-tree > control > large-gap plots. Our results suggested that shade trees may help conserve and promote beneficial arthropods such as predators and parasitoids in tea agroecosystems.

AB  - Merely designating new and/or expanding existing protected areas (PAs) does not guarantee the protection of critical ecosystems and species. The management of PAs must be effective to sustain meaningful conservational outcomes. We inferred the management effectiveness of PAs in Kenya based on the representation of ranges and distribution of multiple diversity dimensions of terrestrial mammals and their association with governance and designation types. We hypothesized that different governance types underlie variable management efficacies, such that stricter-managed PAs have better habitats that attract more wildlife, translating to higher species diversity compared to less strictly-managed PAs, especially for focal species groups (large carnivores, large herbivores, and endangered species). The results showed nearly all terrestrial mammals in Kenya represented in at least one PA. However, the relative proportion of represented ranges were low, and analysis of spatial conservation prioritization showed significant expansion beyond current PAs needed to achieve a one third coverage of focal species' ranges in a best-solution reserve system. Differences in PA governance and designation types were not systematically associated with diversity variances, and while there were more unique species in state-managed PAs than in privately-managed ones, averaged diversity coefficients were comparable between categories. Diversity variances explained by PA size and status year were low in a combined species pool but increased in focal species groups. These findings suggest that success in terrestrial mammal conservation in PAs in Kenya require clearly and formally streamlined definition, performance feedback, and collaboration terms between state-managed and privately-managed PAs.

AB  - Freshwater salinization is an increasing threat to lakes worldwide, but despite being a widespread issue, little is known about its impact on biological communities at the base of the food chain. Here we used a mesocosm set-up coupled with modern high-frequency sensor technology to identify short- and longer-term responses of phytoplankton to salinization in an oligotrophic lake. We tested the effects of salinization over a gradient of increasing salt concentrations that can be found in natural lakes exposed to road salt contamination (added salt range: from 0 to 1500 mg Cl- L-1). The high-frequency chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fluorescence measurements showed an increasing divergence of chl-a concentrations along the salinization gradient over time, with substantially lower concentrations at higher salt levels. At the sub-daily scale, we found a profound suppression of day-night signal cycles with increasing salinity, which could be related to physiological stress due to the impairment of photosynthesis via effects on the photosystem II or potential changes in the active migration of phytoplankton. Community analyses revealed a similar decline pattern for the total phytoplankton biomass and a collapse of the total zooplankton biomass. Interestingly, we found a loss of phytoplankton diversity coupled with a compositional re-organization involving the loss of dominant green algae but increased biomass of salt-tolerant cyanobacteria. Altogether, these results suggest that specific cyanobacterial taxa can benefit from freshwater salinization following the collapse of dominant phytoplankton competitors and zooplankton herbivores. The results also highlight the value of autonomous sensor technology to capture novel, small-scale ecological responses to freshwater salinization, and thereby to track fast changes in primary producer communities.

AB  - Herbivores form an important link in the transfer of energy within a food web and are strongly influenced by bottom-up trophic cascades. Current hypotheses suggest that herbivore consumption and impact on plants should scale positively with plant resource availability. However, depending on the effect of resources on plant quantity and quality, herbivore impact may vary with different types of resources. We test four alternative hypotheses for the relationship between plant biomass, herbivore impact on plant biomass and plant resource gradients, each based on how resources might affect plant abundance and quality to herbivores. We measured plant biomass for four non-consecutive years in a long-term grazing exclosure experiment in the Serengeti National Park that includes seven sites that vary substantially in rainfall and soil and plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our data supported the hypothesis that herbivore impact is controlled by plant quality, in this case driven by plant P, as herbivore effects on biomass decreased with higher rainfall but increased with greater plant P, but not N content. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to indicate that wild mammalian herbivory is associated with P availability rather than N. Synthesis. Our results suggest that P, in addition to water and N, may play a more important role in driving trophic interactions in terrestrial systems than previously realized. Given the uncertainties in rainfall due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic manipulations of global N and P cycles, our findings emphasize the need to consider multiple resources for understanding how trophic interactions might be influenced by environmental variables.

AB  - Plants face trade-offs between allocating resources to growth, while also defending against herbivores or pathogens. Species differences along defense trade-off axes may promote coexistence and maintain diversity. However, few studies of plant communities have simultaneously compared defense trade-offs against an array of herbivores and pathogens for which defense investment may differ, and even fewer have been conducted in the complex natural communities in which these interactions unfold. We tested predictions about the role of defense trade-offs with competition and growth in diversity maintenance by tracking plant species abundance in a field experiment that removed individual consumer groups (mammals, arthropods, fungi) and added nutrients. Consistent with a growth-defense trade-off, plant species that increased in mass in response to nutrient addition also increased when consumers were removed. This growth-defense trade-off occurred for all consumer groups studied. Nutrient addition reduced plant species richness, which is consistent with trade-off theory. Removing foliar fungi increased plant diversity via increased species evenness, whereas removal of other consumer groups had little effect on diversity, counter to expectations. Thus, while growth-defense trade-offs are general across consumer groups, this trade-off observed in wild plant communities does not necessarily support plant diversity maintenance.

AB  - Cropland expansion has been occurring over the last century, especially in South America, displacing non-crop areas mainly with soybean. Changes at a landscape level were followed by changes at a local scale, such as the adoption of insect-resistant transgenic crops. The homogenization of agroecosystem composition and agronomic practices have a great impact on arthropod predators and herbivore insects, which has not been quantified to a great extent in South America. We evaluate the effects of cover composition (1 km radii) as a landscape variable, and Bt adoption as a local variable on the quantity of the main predators and pests in soybean fields in Uruguay. Over a two-year period, we sampled 60 soybean fields with sweep net and beating sheet. We found that Bt and non-Bt soybean fields did not differ in the number of predators and stink bugs, while Bt fields were associated with less caterpillars' abundance. The proportion area of soybean negatively affected the quantity of some predators in this crop. In contrast, the landscape cover with natural grassland, commercial forest and maize positively affected some of these beneficial organisms. The number of stink bugs in soybean was highly affected by the surrounding cover composition. Arthropod responses depend on soybean's phenological period. We demonstrate the effects of the agriculturalization process on soybean predators and pests, suggesting that Bt adoption does not affect predators and each vegetation cover impacts them differentially. Different non-crop landscape cover and the abundance of predators in the field margin are positively associated with the abundance of predators in soybean fields.

AB  - Equatorial Guinea in central Africa hosts rich biodiversity and a network of protected areas (PAs). However, infrastructure development has facilitated access to previously remote forests. This has likely increased poaching in PAs, thereby complicating efforts of agencies tasked with protecting threatened mammals. Reserva Natural de Rio Campo (RNRC) in Equatorial Guinea was previously identified as a priority area for large mammals due to the presence of elephants and great apes and includes habitat for a diverse mammal community of commonly hunted species. To assess mammalian diversity in RNRC, we conducted a camera trap survey in 2017 and 2019. We used a two-step modelling approach to quantify environmental and anthropogenic factors influencing mammal groups. We detected 32 terrestrial mammal species, including endangered forest elephant, western gorilla, chimpanzee, giant pangolin and white-bellied pangolin. We found bushbuck and sitatunga closer to human-dominated areas, while other common species were, in general, further from development. Monkey and pangolin abundance increased inward from the RNRC boundary. Endangered species appear restricted to northeast RNRC which connects to Campo Ma'an National Park in Cameroon. We recommend using our inventory and distributions of threatened mammals as starting points to determine effectiveness of future anti-poaching and management strategies on mammal populations.

AB  - We assessed the spatial variability in the size structure of phytoplankton, community composition, primary production and carbon fluxes through the planktonic food web of the Gulf of Gabes (GG; Southeastern Mediterranean Sea) in the fall of 2017 during the MERMEX-MERITE cruise. High concentrations in nutrients, chlorophyll a (similar to 2-6 mu g L-1) and primary production (1816-3674 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) revealed an eutrophic status of the studied stations in the GG. In accordance with hydrodynamic features, inorganic nutrients showed increases in concentrations from North to South and from coast to offshore, these nutrient gradients impacting the spatial distribution of phytoplankton community. Size-fractioned phytoplankton biomass and production were the lowest in the northernmost zone where they were mainly sustained by pico-sized fraction. Concomitantly, in this area, small aloricate ciliates were dominant leading to a high microbivory. Conversely, higher biomass and production were measured towards the South and offshore with prevalence of larger phytoplankton (nano- and/or micro-sized fractions) supported by diatoms. The herbivorous protozooplankton and metazooplankton were more abundant in these zones, resulting in an increase of the herbivory. The vertical particulate organic carbon flux followed also a north-south and coast-offshore increasing gradient, with a higher contribution of phytoplankton, and zooplankton fecal pellets to the sinking organic matter in the southernmost area. Our results suggest that even in nutrient-rich and highly productive waters, a continuum of trophic pathways, ranging from microbial to multivorous and herbivorous food webs, may exist, which implies different efficiencies in carbon export and carrying capacity within the ecosystem.

AB  - Animal behavior is an important component of individual, population, and community responses to anthropogenic habitat alteration. For example, antipredator behavior (e.g., vigilance) and animal movement behavior may both be important behavioral responses to the increased density of habitat edges and changes in patch connectivity that characterize highly modified habitats. Importantly, edge density and connectivity might interact, and this interaction is likely to mediate animal behavior: linear, edge-rich landscape features often provide structural connectivity between patches, but the functional connectedness of patches for animal use could depend upon how edge density modifies animal vigilance and movement. Using remote cameras in large-scale experimental landscapes that manipulate edge density (high- vs. low-density edges) and patch connectivity (isolated or connected patches), we examined the effects of edge density and connectivity on the antipredator behavior and movement behavior of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Deer vigilance was 1.38 times greater near high-density edges compared to low-density edges, regardless of whether patches were connected or isolated. Deer were also more likely to move parallel to connected high-density edges than all other edge types, suggesting that connectivity promotes movement along high-density edges. These results suggest that increases in edge density that accompany human fragmentation of existing habitats may give rise to large-scale changes in the antipredator behavior of deer. These results also suggest that conservation strategies that simultaneously manipulate edge density and connectivity (i.e., habitat corridors) may have multiple effects on different aspects of deer behavior: linear habitat corridors were areas of high vigilance, but also areas where deer movement behavior implied increased movement along the habitat edge.

AB  - BackgroundForage quality is a fundamental determinant for livestock productivity in natural grasslands, and is sensitive to the variations in climate, soil, and plant community composition. However, the contributions of those factors to the regional variation of forage quality largely remain unclear. We examined forage quality of 45 alpine meadow communities over a 23.6 x 104 km2 area on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. We also examined the variations and drivers of multiple forage quality indicators across regional scale.ResultsThe results showed that the natural grasslands in this region had high crude protein and non-fiber carbohydrates content, and relative feed value, but low-fat content. Forage quality of forb-dominated grasslands was higher than grass- and sedge-dominated ones. There were substantial geographical variations of forage quality, which decreased with increasing longitude, and increased with increasing latitude and altitude. Climate and plant community composition directly controlled the geographical patterns of forage quality. Climate had larger contribution to forage quality than soil and plant community composition. Less sedge and more forb in community resulted in higher forage quality. Forage quality was higher in sites with colder, drier and more variable climate. Soil conditions indirectly affected forage quality by mediating the plant community composition.ConclusionsThis study highlights the role of climate in driving the variation of forage quality in the alpine grasslands. The findings could provide scientific supports for grassland management and sustainable development on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Neapolitan pizza is very popular worldwide and is registered on the traditional specialties guaranteed (TSG) list. This study was aimed at identifying the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint (CF) of a medium-sized pizza restaurant serving in situ or takeaway true Neapolitan pizzas conforming to the Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050 standard method. An average CF of ~4.69 kg CO2e/diner was estimated, about 74% of which was due to the production of the ingredients used (with buffalo mozzarella cheese alone representing as much as 52% of CF). The contribution of beverages, packaging materials, transportation, and energy sources varied within 6.8 and 4.6% of CF. The percentage relative variation of CF with respect to its basic score was of about +26%, +4.4%, and +1.6% or +2.1%, provided that the emission factor of buffalo mozzarella, fresh cow mozzarella (fiordilatte), Grana Padano cheeses, and electricity varied by +50% with respect to each corresponding default value, respectively. The specific carbon footprint for Marinara pizza was equal to ~4 kg CO2e/kg, while for Margherita pizza, it was up to 5.1, or 10.8 kg CO2e/kg when topped with fresh cow or buffalo mozzarella cheese. To help pizza restaurant operators select the most rewarding mitigation strategy, we explored how CF was affected by more sustainable buffalo mozzarella cheese production, lighter and reusable containers for beer, mineral water, and main fresh vegetables, newer diesel-powered vans, less air-polluting electric ovens instead of traditional wood-fired ovens, as well as renewable electricity sources.

AB  - The carbon sequestration efficiency of manure (CSE-manure) is critical for the accurate estimation of manuring-induced changes in soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the mechanisms of large-scale spatiotemporal changes in CSE-manure and their crucial drivers are unclear. To investigate these under various manure regimes, we performed field observation and collected relevant data using 1023 fields across China's main cropland, as well as collected data on high-resolution climate and soil properties. The experimental durations significantly (P < 0.001) affected CSE-manure. The CSE-manure values were 31.4% +/- 13.4 (mean +/- SD), 19.2% +/- 10.3%, and 16.1% +/- 9.4 at the experimental durations of < 10, 10-20, and > 20 years, respectively. In addition, the manure sources significantly affected CSE-manure. The CSE-manure values of the manures from horse (27.9% +/- 19.0) and sheep (26.9% +/- 11.0) and farmyard manure (25.7% +/- 14.8) were higher than those of the manures from pig (19.8% +/- 15.4), poultry (19.1% +/- 10.58), and cattle (23.1% +/- 13.1). The CSE-manure values varied as per the region; the values were higher in North China than in South China. Of all the investigated variables, carbon and nitrogen input from manure, soil bulk density, annual average air temperature and precipitation, and initial SOC and soil clay content were the most important drivers of CSE-manure. The results suggested that carbon sequestration potential was higher in the northeast region. The spatiotemporal CSE-manure values under various climate conditions were predicted using trained machine learning models. Simulation results suggested that by 2100, the rate of decrease in CSE-manure will be higher at RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 8.5, and climate change will have a great impact on CSE-manure due to high warming effects.

AB  - Logging is widely known to be one of the major drivers of the loss of timber resources in tropical rainforests. In order to assess the contribution of this activity to biodiversity and carbon storage in Cameroon's Forest Management Units, this study was carried out in three Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC), of which two were logged, AAC 1-1 (logged two years before), AAC 1-2 (logged one year before) and one unlogged (AAC 1-4). On each stand, 100 sampling plots of 20 m x 20 m were laid. The plot survey assessed the diversity indices, basal area, Aboveground Biomass, wood density, total height and importance value index of the tree species having >= 10 cm diameter at breast height. A total of 203 species belonging to 158 genera and 58 families were recorded. Piptadeniastrum africanum (7.21), Sterculia rhinopetala (23.35) and Ceiba pentandra (14.5) were the commonly traded species with the highest importance value index, respectively, for AAC 1-1, 1-2, and 1-4. Non-symmetric correspondence analysis (NSCA) revealed that the plots in AAC 1-4 are more diverse, containing more biomass than those in AAC 1-1 and 1-2. Although selective logging has reduced species richness, it remains important to develop enrichment of species removed for ecosystem restoration.

AB  - In northern hardwood stands, silvicultural treatments aimed at regenerating sugar maple and yellow birch, such as site preparation and mechanical control of American beech saplings, often results in the formation of dense thickets of beech regeneration. The objective of this study was to compare the growth and survival of beech regeneration originating from stump sprouts, root suckers and seedlings, with yellow birch and sugar maple regeneration in partially harvested stands under cervid browsing pressure. Over an eight-year period, 997 in-dividuals of the three species were monitored in three northern hardwood stands dominated by sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech in Quebec, Canada. Each stand included replicates of four partial harvesting treatments and a control, providing a gradient of light and competition conditions. Beech stump sprouts and root suckers had higher growth and survival probabilities than seedlings of all three species under all light and competition conditions. Results suggest that treatments triggering beech sprouts should be applied with caution and under conditions that ensure sufficient survival and development of desired species. This study also provides evidence that selective browsing by cervids could be an important overriding factor exacerbating the effect of beech competition on yellow birch regeneration.

AB  - We report the spatiotemporal increase in abundance of Anchoviella spp. (Engraulidae) through the diet of fish consumers after reservoir formation in the upper Tocantins River, Central Brazil. The increase in the abundance of this planktivorous fish evidences the growing importance of autochthonous herbivory food chains as the reservoir stabilized in this novel lentic ecosystem. These changes would otherwise remain unnoticed only through fish sampling, highlighting the importance of assessing trophic interactions to understand responses to damming at the community and ecosystem levels.

AB  - This study aimed at investigating woody vegetation structure and composition in relation to surface water availability in Mana Pools National Park (MPNP). Two study sites, namely the Zambezi River floodplain and seasonal water pans were selected. Sampling plots were systematically placed along transects from water pans at 100 m, 200 m and 500 m and thirty (30) different sampling plots of size 600 m(2) were used. Statistical analysis was done using STATISTICA 7. A total of 192 woody plants from 18 woody species were recorded. More woody tree species (n = 13) were recorded around seasonal water pans as compared to the Zambezi River zone (n = 5). Results obtained from Kruskal Wallis H test showed no significant difference in height, basal area and tree density along a distance gradient from the Zambezi River to the interior (inland). Stem density and diversity showed a significant difference along a distance gradient from the Zambezi River to the interior (p < 0.05). Woody species density and diversity increased as a function of distance from the Zambezi River channel, with species diversity higher around seasonal water pans. A comparison obtained from the Mann Whitney U test between the two sampling sites showed significant difference in all structural variables. Findings of this study showed that the woodlands along the Zambezi River were more degraded as compared to those around seasonal water pans. It is an indication that the concentration of herbivores is impacting woodlands along the Zambezi River. Management should consider establishing artificial water pans around the park to minimise herbivore pressure along the Zambezi River.

AB  - The present study assessed Cybister lateralimarginalis as a model species for ecotoxicological studies of metal(loid) bioaccumulation in freshwater ecosystems, by optimising protocols and analysing biomarker activities and metal (loid) concentrations from different sites and investigating their association. To accomplish this, levels of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) were analysed, as well as a set of biomarkers were evaluated, esterase activity and oxidative stress biomarkers: fluorescence- and glutathione-based. C. lateralimarginalis were sampled in the spring/summer of 2023 along the Sava, Drava and Danube floodplains in Croatia. C. lateralimarginalis samples from Sava floodplain (Muzilovcica) showed altered carboxylesterase (CES) activity, lower glutathione (GSH) levels, and elevated Hg and As concentrations. The Weighted Pollution Index (WPI) indicated moderate pollution at the Sava floodplain, possibly due to agricultural or petrochemical impacts. At the Drava floodplain (Podravlje), higher glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and elevated Cd, Hg, and As concentrations were observed, likely from soil accumulation, while Stara Drava beetles had lower GSH levels, suggesting agricultural impacts. Despite this, the Drava floodplain showed the lowest WPI. Higher GST activity was noted at the Danube floodplain (Kopacki rit and Topoljski Dunavac), with reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations (Kopacki rit and Podunavlje) possibly reflecting agricultural practices or illegal hunting. The present research successfully applied C. lateralimarginalis as a bioindicator species for assessing metal(loid)s in different environments, highlighting its reliability as an abundant apex predator, emphasizing the significance of integrating biomarker response evaluation into pollutant monitoring for efficient environmental risk assessment in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The loss of Mediterranean macroalgal populations dominated by Cystoseira sensu lato is driven by a multitude of pressures. In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, climate change and the establishment of Lessepsian herbivore species have further intensified the ongoing decline of these canopy-forming algae. Knowledge of the reproductive phenology, embryology and growth of Cystoseira species is the first step towards successful reforestation measures. Gongolaria montagnei is one of the most common canopy-forming algal species with a wide horizontal and vertical distribution along the Greek coasts. Mature receptacles were collected from Saronikos Gulf (Aegean Sea), and germlings were cultured in mesocosms for 34 days, reaching up to 1.30 mm in length. Divisions and early developmental stages of G. montagnei are described and possible implications for future restoration efforts are discussed. A new approach to growth rate modeling, based on surface measurements of embryos and germlings is presented.

AB  - On the Keweenaw Peninsula of Lake Superior, two stamp mills (Mohawk and Wolverine) discharged 22.7 million metric tonnes (MMT) of tailings (1901-1932) into the coastal zone off the town of Gay. Migrating along the shoreline, ca. 10 MMT of the tailings dammed stream and river outlets, encroached upon wetlands, and contaminated recreational beaches. A nearly equal amount of tailings moved across bay benthic environments into critical commercial fish spawning and rearing grounds. In the middle of the bay, Buffalo Reef is important for commercial and recreational lake trout and lake whitefish production (ca. 32% of the commercial catch in Keweenaw Bay, 22% along southern Lake Superior). Aerial photographs (1938-2016) and five LiDAR and multispectral over-flights (2008-2016) emphasize: (1) the enormous amounts of tailings moving along the beach; and (2) the bathymetric complexities of an equal amount migrating underwater across the shelf. However, remote sensing studies encounter numerous specific challenges in coastal environments. Here, we utilize a combination of elevation data (LiDAR digital elevation/bathymetry models) and in situ studies to generate a series of physical, chemical, and biological geospatial maps. The maps are designed to help assess the impacts of historical mining on Buffalo Reef. Underwater, sand mixtures have complicated multispectral bottom reflectance substrate classifications. An alternative approach, in situ simple particle classification, keying off distinct sand end members: (1) allows calculation of tailings (stamp sand) percentages; (2) aids indirect and direct assays of copper concentrations; and (3) permits determinations of density effects on benthic macro-invertebrates. The geospatial mapping shows how tailings are moving onto Buffalo Reef, the copper concentrations associated with the tailings, and how both strongly influence the density of benthic communities, providing an excellent example for the International Maritime Organization on how mining may influence coastal reefs. We demonstrate that when large amounts of mine tailings are discharged into coastal environments, temporal and spatial impacts are progressive, and strongly influence resident organisms. Next steps are to utilize a combination of hi-resolution LiDAR and sonar surveys, a fish-monitoring array, and neural network analysis to characterize the geometry of cobble fields where fish are successful or unsuccessful at producing young.

AB  - Aim: Central Africa shelters diverse and iconic megafauna, which is threatened by climate and land-use changes and increased hunting-induced defaunation. Though crucial for coordinating regional conservation actions, how species assemblages are spatially structured remains poorly understood. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap for mammals across central African forests.Location: Tropical moist forests from Nigeria to the Albertine Rift.Methods: An extensive compilation of forest-dwelling mammal species lists was made from wildlife and bushmeat-related surveys across central Africa. A beta-diversity approach enabling the clustering of surveys composed of similar species was implemented to identify and delimit zoogeographic districts, separately for three well-documented mammal orders: carnivores, primates and artiodactyls. Random forest classification models were then used to identify the environmental determinants of the district's distribution and to produce a continuous zoogeographic map (and associated uncertainties) critical to assess the conservation status of each district and their ongoing threats.Results: While carnivores do not present a clear spatial structure within central African forests, our findings highlight the structuring role of rivers on both primate and artiodactyl assemblages' distributions. We retained eight and six spatially congruent districts for primates and artiodactyls, respectively. These districts were shaped by the Ubangi-Congo River system, and the Cross and Sanaga Rivers, with a secondary role of insularity and precipitation identified for primates. Highly threatened districts were highlighted, especially in Nigeria and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the latter including vast areas that are understudied and poorly represented in the protected area network.Main Conclusions: Beyond refining our understanding of the diversity and uniqueness of mammalian assemblages across central African forests, our map of zoogeographic districts has far-reaching implications for the conservation of highly threatened taxa, allowing to target species and areas of interest for further sampling, conservation and rewilding efforts.

AB  - Bovine milk is a nutritious food commodity extensively produced and consumed in Punjab, Pakistan. This study assesses the concentration profile of organochlorine pesticides (OCP; 18 compounds) in buffaloes and cow's milk in eight major districts of Punjab, Pakistan and the potential impacts of such exposure. The total OCPs in buffaloes and cow's milk samples ranged from 3.93 to 27.63 ng mL(-1) and 14.64-77.93 ng mL(-1) respectively. The overall pattern of mean OCPs concentration in buffaloes and cows milk showed that Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) are predominant followed by Heptachlors and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs). So far, the concentration profile depicted that Sigma HCHs, Sigma DDTs and Sigma Heptachlors did not exceed the maximum residual limits set for buffaloes and cow's milk. The spatial trends in terms of cluster analysis depicted significant variation (p > 0.05) among the districts in one cluster probably owing to local conditions. Furthermore, recently used DDTs were also identified at some of the selected districts. The risk assessment suggests that the estimated daily intake for each OCP was in accordance with the acceptable daily intake, thus single compound exposure does not pose a significant carcinogenic risk. However, the hazard ratios indicated that the values for Sigma DDTs posed risk in adults consuming cow's milk whereas children may face carcinogenic risk on the consumption of both buffalo and cow's milk. The risk may be altered where mixture is considered, furthermore, regarding carcinogenic risks a continuous monitoring based ecological analysis is recommended in the future.

AB  - We conducted the first extensive breeding bird and habitat survey across 21 islands and islets spanning 600 km of the eastern Mediterranean coastline of Turkey in 2016. Eight of the 21 islands hosted breeding colonies of at least one of three seabird species: European Shag (Gulosus aristotelis) on four islands and two coastal cliffs with 9-29 breeding pairs, Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) on eight islands with 145-175 breeding pairs, and Audouin's Gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) on one island with 6-7 breeding pairs. Two Scopoli's Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) were also observed during the coastal cruise, but no conclusive breeding evidence was collected. The single Audouin's Gull breeding colony alternated between two nearby islands, and the breeding population fluctuated between 6-10 pairs between 2016 and 2023. Comparisons between previous population estimates and the present survey indicated that the Audouin's Gull breeding colony has suffered a similar to 65-80% population loss in the last five decades. Habitat surveys revealed that 13 islands had some vegetation cover. Bushes were the dominant vegetation and hosted the highest seabird nest abundance. However, the highest seabird nest density was observed in herbaceous vegetation, which had only marginal coverage on the islands, potentially due to overgrazing by introduced rabbits and goats. Furthermore, surveys revealed occasional mortality of gull eggs, chicks, and adults as well as anthropogenic pressures on seabird breeding habitats such as uncontrolled recreational use and introduced mammals. The islands also hosted 15 other breeding bird species, including large populations of Alpine Swift (Tachymarptis melba , similar to 270 pairs) as well as several raptor species. Overall, our results indicated that there is significant seabird breeding activity in the eastern Mediterranean coastline of Turkey and an urgent need for ecosystem management to protect the habitat quality of these islands for seabird breeding populations.

AB  - Intensifying climate change and an increasing need for understanding its impacts on ecological communities places new emphasis on testing environmental stress models (ESMs). Using a prior literature search plus references from a more recent search, I evaluated empirical support for ESMs, focusing on whether consumer pressure on prey decreased (consumer stress model; CSM) or increased (prey stress model; PSM) with increasing environmental stress. Applying the criterion that testing ESMs requires conducting research at multiple sites along environmental stress gradients, the analysis found that CSMs were most frequent, with 'No Effect' and PSMs occurring at low but similar frequencies. This result contrasts to a prior survey in which 'No Effect' studies were most frequent, thus suggesting that consumers are generally more suppressed by stress than prey. Thus, increased climate change-induced environmental stress seems likely to reduce, not increase impacts of consumers on prey more often than the reverse

AB  - A balanced equilibrium between carnivores and their prey is crucial for maintaining ecosystem sustainability. In this study, we applied the predator-prey power law equation to assess the balance between the biomass densities of carnivores and their wild prey within Nepal's lowland protected areas during 2013, 2018, and 2022. The estimated value of the power law exponent k for predator-prey biomass was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.39-1.05), indicating an approximate threefold increase in predator biomass density for every fivefold increase in prey biomass density. Consequently, this creates a systematically bottom-heavy predator-prey biomass pyramid. This finding, consistent with the k = 3/4 trophic biomass scaling across ecosystems, suggests that predator biomass is proportionally sustained by prey biomass, indicating a balance between top predators and their wild prey in Nepal's lowland protected areas. We further demonstrated it is possible to retain the overall power law exponent while jointly measuring intraguild competition between two predators with canonical correlation analysis. This understanding opens avenues for future research directed toward unraveling the factors that drive these consistent growth patterns in ecological communities.
   The study in Nepal's lowland protected areas found a balanced predator-prey relationship, with a power law exponent "k" of 0.7 indicating a significant increase in predator biomass density with rising prey density. This sublinear growth pattern aligns with established trophic biomass scaling estimates, emphasizing its importance for stabilizing predator-prey dynamics and guiding future ecosystem management and research efforts.image

AB  - Understanding how management actions affect target species is crucial for designing conservation strategies that meet recovery goals. In the context of Oregon silverspot butterfly (Speyeria = Argynnis zerene hippolyta) conservation, we used experimental habitat manipulations and mark-release-recapture methods to measure the effects of habitat restoration and population augmentation on butterfly vital rates. To understand the butterfly's response to management, we (1) measured larval survival in response to invasive grass and thatch removal, and (2) used mark-release-recapture methods to estimate phenology, adult survival, and female egg laying of both wild and captive-reared butterflies. We found that reducing the density of invasive grasses and associated thatch, increased larval survival by up to 50%. We also found that wild butterflies emerged, on average, three weeks before captive butterflies were released and lived up to a week longer than captive butterflies. This mismatch in timing resulted in observations of only 15% of captive females laying eggs as opposed to 45% of marked wild females, suggesting that captive-reared females are contributing very little to the overall population. For Oregon silverspot recovery efforts to succeed, continued management of invasive grasses is key, as is further work to match the timing of releases of captive butterflies with flight of wild butterflies.
   Implications for insect conservation Through hands-on manipulation of habitat and marking at-risk butterflies, we identified specific ways to improve current management actions to meet recovery goals. These techniques are necessary for developing conservation strategies that will save species from extinction

AB  - Like many savannas worldwide, pine savannas of the southeastern U.S. contain pyrophytic (fire-adapted) broadleaf woody plants (hardwoods), as well as mesophytic (fire-sensitive) hardwoods that persist through cycles of top-killing and resprouting. The persistence of mesophytes may be facilitated by anthropogenic fire regimes that top-kill hardwoods when they have higher carbohydrate reserves in roots, and the effects of fire timing may interact with herbivory. We investigated the resprouting response of pyrophytic and mesophytic hardwoods to fire in the four seasons by measuring the change in above-ground woody biomass between two fire-free intervals as a relative growth rate (RGR), with half of the plants protected from browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to assess potential interactions with herbivores. Spring fires similarly reduced RGR of both pyrophytes and mesophytes (difference between functional groups [Delta] = 0.02, p = 0.86), the summer (Delta = 0.66, p < 0.0001) and fall (Delta = 0.51, p < 0.0001) fires disproportionately disadvantaged mesophytes, and winter fires resulted in relatively high resprouting vigor for both groups (Delta = 0.31, p = 0.06). Similar patterns were shown by the biomass to which plants were predicted to equilibrate under a given fire regime (the persistence equilibrium). Herbivore access did not influence resprouting. Our results indicate that growing season fires, which correspond to historic fire regimes, inhibit the relative growth of mesophytes more effectively than dormant season fires. We recommend that fire season be considered in the restoration and maintenance of historic woody plant composition and structure in pine savanna ecosystems.

However, monitoring bats is challenging due to their small size, ability to fly, cryptic nature, and nocturnal activity. Recently, bioacoustic techniques have been incorporated into survey methods, either through passive acoustic monitoring or acoustic bat lures. Lures have been developed on the premise that broadcasting acoustic stimuli increases the number of captures in harp traps or mist nets. However, this is a relatively new, niche method. This study tested the efficacy of two commonly used acoustic bat lure devices, broadcasting two different acoustic stimuli, to increase forest understory bat captures in the tropics. This is the first time an acoustic bat lure has been systematically tested in a tropical rainforest, and the first study to compare two lure devices (Sussex AutoBat and Apodemus BatLure). Using a paired experimental design, two synthesized acoustic stimuli were broadcasted, a feeding call and a social call, to understand the importance of the call type used on capture rates and genus-specific responses. Using an acoustic lure significantly increased capture rates, while the type of device did not impact capture rates. The two acoustic stimuli had an almost even distribution of captures, suggesting that the type of call may be less important than previously thought. Results indicate a possible deterrent effect on Rhinolophous sp., while being particularly effective for attracting bats in the genera Murina and Kerivoula. This study highlights the effectiveness of lures, however, also indicates that lure effects can vary across genera. Therefore, lures may bias survey results by altering the species composition of bats caught. Future research should focus on a single species or genus, using synthesized calls of conspecifics, to fully understand the effect of lures.

AB  - Snow is understood to limit wildlife movements, often being the most important determinant of winter movement for animals in the boreal forest. However, the combined effect of snow and temperature on the movement ecology of animals at high latitudes is less understood. Here, we used GPS-collar data from a small population of wood bison (Bison bison athabascae Rhoads, 1898) in northeastern Alberta, Canada, to develop a series of generalized additive mixed models characterizing the effect of cumulative snow depth, daily change in snow depth, and temperature on movement rates. Our most supported model induded cumulative snow depth, temperature, and day of winter. Bison movements decreased in the first 75 days of winter during snow accumulation and dramatically increased in the final 14 days of winter during snow melt. Cumulative snow depth, not daily change in snow depth, reduced wood bison movement rates, and movement rates increased more rapidly in warmer temperatures than in temperatures below -6.4 degrees C. By quantifying both the direction and the magnitude of snow and temperature's effects on bison movement, our study fills critical knowledge gaps relating to the winter movement ecology of wood bison and contributes to a growing body of knowledge informing their conservation in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The Endangered Kashmir musk deer Moschus cupreus occurs in the western Himalayan region from Nepal to Afghanistan, but there is a lack of comprehensive and reliable information on its range. The region also harbours the Endangered Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, and this range overlap may have led to misidentification of the two musk deer species and errors in the delimitation of their ranges. Here, using genetic analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region, we examined the phylogenetic relationship among musk deer samples from three regions in India: Ganderbal District in Jammu and Kashmir, and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary and Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, both in Uttarakhand. The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicated a close genetic relationship between samples from Jammu and Kashmir, Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary and Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, validated by previously published sequences of Kashmir musk deer from Nepal. Our analyses confirmed the samples from Uttarakhand to be from the Kashmir musk deer, which was not previously known from this region. Therefore, we recommend further research in this area, to validate species identification and confirm the geographical distribution of the various species of musk deer. In addition, we recommend revision of the range of M. cupreus in the IUCN Red List assessment, to facilitate effective conservation and management of this Endangered species.

AB  - The COVID19 lockdown provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of human activities and conservation measures on wildlife. However, most lockdown studies were opportunistic and based on limited data, because this 'natural experiment' was unexpected and short-lasting. Replication of scientific results is the cornerstone of the scientific method and ensures that conclusions from such short-term studies are robust. Here, we test predictions arising from a previous study where we showed the impact of the lockdown-induced reduction in hunting disturbance on the body condition and behavior of greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens a.), a species whose management is crucial for the conservation of northern ecosystems. The analysis of two additional years of data confirmed our predictions. The return to a high hunting pressure in springs 2021-2022 (post-lockdown) reduced overall goose body condition compared to the lockdown year. Goose fattening in post-lockdown springs was very similar to pre-lockdown years, differing from 2020 when a high body condition was reached earlier in spring than in any other year. Radio-tracked birds spent more time in profitable but risky agricultural lands in 2021 compared to 2020, as was the case in the pre-lockdown year. Our study provides robust evidence confirming the impacts of spring hunting on greater snow goose physiology. It demonstrates the long-lasting efficiency of the spring conservation hunt established two decades ago to limit the size of the population with the aim of preserving Arctic ecosystems from overgrazing and associated negative impacts on other arctic-nesting birds.

AB  - The axis deer (Axis axis) is a species of ungulate native to the Indian subcontinent. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the axis deer was introduced to many regions of the world, where it established non-native free-ranging populations. The introduction of the axis deer to Croatia resulted in three populations that still live on the Adriatic islands. In this study, two new mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) haplotypes were identified in 39 axis deer samples from two Adriatic islands Rab and Dugi Otok in Croatia. Two distinct D-loop haplotypes found in Croatian axis deer populations indicate that axis deer in Croatia were introduced from at least two maternal lineages. Genetic differentiation between populations was quite low and not significant. Haplotype (0.497) and nucleotide (0.006) diversity of Croatian axis deer was similar to that of axis deer from Queensland, Australia (0.461 and 0.002, respectively). For a better understanding of the origin and genetic diversity of the introduced axis deer from Croatia, analysis of native populations and the addition of highly variable nuclear markers is required.

AB  - A marine forest of the annual kelp Saccharina japonica was monitored at three depth sites (6, 9 and 12 m) along a 200-meter-long transect in the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan from 2014 to 2021, during which the abundance of the kelp plummeted, and the forest shifted to a crustose coralline bed. Colder seawater temperature in the winter/spring (February and March), which is regulated by the extension of the cold Oyashio Current, plays an important role in establishing the kelp forest through reducing the grazing of herbivores during the critical period of kelp germination and early growth. The Oyashio Current reached the region in 2014 and 2015 but not from 2016 to 2021, making a fundamental change in the kelp forest. Macroalgal abundance was strikingly different between these two periods. Biomass of S. japonica reached up to 38.6-45.4 kg-ww m-2 in the first two years, whereas macroalgal biomass was less than 3.2 kg-ww m-2 in the latter 6 years except for in 2016 when the biomass reached 9.0 kg-ww m-2 at the 6 m site. Gonad and somatic growth of sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus declined during the kelp deforestation, while the density of the sea urchin moderately increased in 2017. Similarly, the density of abalone Haliotis discus hannai plummeted by about 90% and the mean shell length decreased from 83 mm in 2014 to 31 mm in 2020. Under the ocean warming scheme, ecosystems depending on the primary production of S. japonica are expected to be altered in the future, and thus urging the need of environmental monitoring.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As coral reefs face accelerating threats at global scales, examining how different coral species respond to local disruption from top-down and bottom-up forces can inform management at local scales. This may provide additional time for reducing global stressors. We conducted a full factorial experiment examining the effects of corallivory, herbivory, and fertilizer addition on 2 corals: Acropora pulchra and Porites rus, the former of which is faster-growing but more susceptible to predation, disease, and heat-induced mortality. Fertilizer addition enhanced corallivory but did not affect net coral growth. Consumer exclusion enhanced the net growth of A. pulchra by 18.1 times regardless of fertilizer treatment, while the net growth of P. rus did not differ among caging and fertilizer treatments. A. pulchra was rarely overgrown by algae regardless of treatment, while herbivore exclusion and fertilizer enrichment produced opposing effects on overgrowth of P. rus. In uncaged treatments, fertilizer enrichment led to greater herbivory but also 1.8 times greater algal overgrowth of P. rus relative to unfertilized treatments. However, in caged treatments, algal overgrowth of P. rus was 1.9 times higher in unfertilized versus fertilized treatments. Our results suggest that interactions between corallivory, herbivory, and fertilizer enrichment can have alternative effects on different coral species, with a hardier coral experiencing more negative impacts of fertilizer enrichment than a more sensitive coral, which was, in turn, more strongly suppressed by predation. Local stressors that disrupt top-down and bottom-up processes may increase the vulnerability of even the most robust corals, and it is these corals that have been predicted to become more common under future ocean scenarios.

AB  - Simple Summary Buffaloes, as a form of livestock, have a huge economic impact, especially in the Asiatic market. In Pakistan, the production of buffaloes for either their milk or meat has increased beyond the overall level of cattle production. The domestication of Nili-Ravi buffaloes from the Nili and Ravi breeds and their selection for their milk production also indicate the economic potential of buffalo breeds in Pakistan. However, very limited genetic information is available for their characterization. Therefore, to identify the selection markers relevant to Pakistani buffalo breeds, available genome sequences of Pakistani buffalo breeds and buffalo breeds from 13 other countries were retrieved from our previously published study. These data were then analyzed through our developed pipeline for potential breed-specific markers. The novel aspect of this pipeline is that it compares single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the same position for possible allele differences among breeds. This approach is different from other currently available tools, which select SNPs based on whether their position is present or absent in one breed compared with others. This study also highlights how the Nili breed, which was previously thought to be lost due to Nili-Ravi domestication, has maintained its separate breed status and requires a breed conservation program. Domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), known as water buffaloes, play a key role as versatile multipurpose agricultural animals in the Asiatic region. Pakistan, with the second-largest buffalo population in the world, holds a rich domestication history of buffaloes. The overall trends in buffalo production demand the genomic characterization of Pakistani buffalo breeds. To this end, the resequencing data of Pakistani breeds, along with buffalo breeds from 13 other countries, were retrieved from our previous study. This dataset, which contained 34,671,886 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was analyzed through a pipeline that was developed to compare possible allele differences among breeds at each SNP position. In contrast, other available tools only check for positional SNP differences for breed-specific markers. In total, 1918, 1549, 404, and 341 breed-specific markers were identified to characterize the Nili, Nili-Ravi, Azakheli, and Kundi breeds of Pakistani buffalo, respectively. Sufficient evidence in the form of phenotypic data, principal component analysis, admixture analysis, and linkage analysis showed that the Nili breed has maintained its distinct breed status despite sharing a close evolutionary relationship with the Nili-Ravi breed of buffalo. In this era of genome science, the conservation of these breeds and the further validation of the given selection markers in larger populations is a pressing need.

AB  - Carex meyeriana lowland meadow is an important component of natural grasslands in Hulun Buir. However, in Hulun Buir, fewer studies have been conducted on C. meyeriana lowland meadows than on other grassland types. To determine the most appropriate utilization mode for C. meyeriana lowland meadows, an experiment was conducted in Zhalantun city, Hulun Buir. Unused, moderately grazed, heavily grazed and mowed meadow sites were selected as the research objects. The analysis of experimental data from 4 consecutive years showed that relative to the other utilization modes, mowing and moderate grazing significantly increased C. meyeriana biomass. Compared with non-utilization, the other three utilization modes resulted in a higher plant diversity, and the moderately grazed meadow had the highest plant community stability. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that among the meadow sites, the mowed meadow had the most stable plant community and soil physicochemical properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that grazing pressure was less than 0.25 hm(2)/sheep unit and that plant biomass in C. meyeriana lowland meadow increases with increasing grazing intensity, temperature and precipitation.

AB  - A critical assumption of standard distance sampling is that sampling lines are located such that animals are uniformly distributed as a function of distance from the line. Failure to meet this assumption can introduce bias in the estimator. Many studies have used landscape features, such as roads or rivers, as lines, which can violate assumptions of distance sampling in two ways. First, animals may be attracted or repelled by the landscape feature due to human activity (e.g. along roads) or habitat characteristics associated with the feature (e.g. rivers). Second, sampling along landscape features may not be representative of the larger area of interest. We used auxiliary data to generalize the distance sampling estimator and relax assumptions of a uniform distribution of animals relative to distance from the line (i.e. density gradient) and to allow the distribution of animals to differ by habitat type. The generalized estimator provides unbiased estimates of density within the area sampled but may not be representative of the study area. To address the problem of landscape features providing unrepresentative sampling, we used a resource selection model to estimate the proportion of the population that occurred within the surveyed area to obtain an estimate of abundance for the desired area of inference. We demonstrate our modified distance sampling estimator using white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a 972-km2 study area. We conducted infrared surveys of deer from roads to collect distance-to-transect data. We used locations of radio-collared deer to model the distribution of deer relative to the transects and to develop a resource selection model of deer based on distance to roads, habitat type, elevation and slope to account for roads being a non-representative sample of the study area. Synthesis and applications. When using landscape features as survey lines, the density gradient and deer distribution can introduce either positive or negative bias, which makes it impossible to assess the bias introduced without auxiliary data. The estimator we developed can improve precision because we obtained a better fit to distance observations and accounts for non-random placement of transects with minimal loss of precision.

AB  - Controversy exists as to whether the Pleistocene vegetation in northern Sundaland was dominated by lowland tropical grasslands or rainforests, due to limited palaeoecological evidence recorded from the region. We describe a new Pleistocene large mammal fauna from Tham Kra Duk, a cave in the Tham Phedan mountain, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in Peninsular Thailand, with emphasis on its palaeoecological and palaeoenvironmental investigations using the stable isotope analysis of mammalian tooth enamel. The fossil site has yielded at least nine mammalian taxa almost comparable to late middle to latest Pleistocene faunas in the mainland, thus suggesting the same biogeographic mammal elements with a range extension south of the Kra Isthmus. The stable isotope results indicate that mixed woodland to grassland ecosystems were dominated by C-4 vegetation in the area. This supports the assumption that the expansion of Pleistocene tropical savanna ecosystems might have held the key to facilitating the southward distribution range of grazing mammals such as gaurs and Himalayan gorals into the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The presence of the Tham Kra Duk fauna was probably linked to some major biogeographic events of Pleistocene hominin and mammal migration through the land-bridge peninsula into the islands of Southeast Asia during a period of glaciation.

AB  - Climate change is expected to significantly impact bird species through changes to breeding and survival. Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) are threatened mound-building birds that persist in uncleared mallee and shrubland vegetation in semi-arid parts of southern Australia. Our aim was to understand the relationship between environmental factors and mound breeding activity (a proxy for population trends) to identify likely climate change impacts and possible proactive management actions. We compared annual activity at grids that encompassed groups of mounds at six sites in South Australia for up to 24 years with a range of environmental and habitat variables, focussing on variables predicted to change with a warming climate. Mound activity declined significantly over the study period at five of the six sites. Activity was positively associated with increased cumulative rain in the previous 2 years, lower average maximum temperatures in the winter, higher-than-average Southern Oscillation Index (i.e. more rain) 2 years before breeding and greater winter vegetation cover. These results suggest that moisture and vegetation cover are important for higher breeding activity. Climate change is predicted to lead to drier conditions and more frequent fires in our study region, suggesting that Malleefowl populations will continue to decline. We urge conservation practitioners to minimise climate change impacts through implementing proactive management actions that increase habitat quality for Malleefowl: fire management to reduce the scale of fire events and controlling introduced and overabundant native herbivores to preserve vegetation cover, retain soil moisture, increase food resources and protect from temperature extremes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the grazing and utilization of feed resources by dromedary camels in the Saharan rangelands around Ouargla Algeria, and to illustrate how camels contribute to the maintenance and improvement of their environment despite the limited vegetation. The research methodology employed the tooth strikes method, involving direct observation of biting. In this study, a camcorder was used for the first time as a means to record camel activity on the range, aiming to prevent any loss of information. Recording sessions of 1 hour each were conducted in the morning and afternoon for each female camel, under conditions of decreasing vegetation availability during each season. The monitoring results revealed that dromedaries exhibit a distinct attitude toward plants. They allow the regeneration of less abundant species by taking small bites while consuming more extensively from the more abundant species. Statistical analysis demonstrated a highly significant relationship between species abundance and grazing probability ( P < 0.001). According to the "Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector" method, species with an abundance exceeding 13% have a sampling probability with a precision of 76.8%. In contrast, species with an abundance between 6% and 13% have a 45% probability of grazing, while those with an occurrence rate of 6% have a 7% probability of grazing. Likewise, the analysis of variance test indicated a highly significant relationship between plant height and grazing time ( P < 0.000). Consequently, the number of plant parts consumed was found to be proportional to the plant's height. The camel's behavior toward its environment facilitates the regeneration and preservation of plant cover in its pastures.

AB  - Comprehensive mapping of Ecosystem Services (ES) is necessary to understand the impact of global change on crucial ES and to find strategies to sustain human wellbeing. Economic valuation of ES further translates their biophysical values into monetary values, which are then comparable across different ES and easily understandable to decision makers. However, a comprehensive synthesis of methods to measure ES indicators in grasslands, a central element of many landscapes around the globe, is still lacking, hampering the implementation of grassland ES-multifunctionality surveys. To identify suitable and recommendable methods, we reviewed the literature and evaluated labor intensiveness, equipment costs and predictive power of all methods. To facilitate the translation of biophysical ES into monetary terms, we further provide an overview of available methods for the economic valuation of ES.
   This review resulted in a toolbox comprising 85 plot-scale methods for assessing 29 different ES indicators for 21 provisioning, regulating, supporting or cultural ES. The available methods to measure ES indicators vary widely in labor intensiveness, costs, and predictive power. Based on this synthesis, we recommend 1) to choose direct over indirect methods and ES indicators, 2) to use the most accurate methods to estimate ES indicators, 3) to take into account that one ES indicator can have implications for more than one final ES, and 4) to utilize the wealth of available methods and indicators to assess as many ES for ES-multifunctionality studies as possible, especially including cultural ES. Moreover, the overview of approaches that can be used for the economic valuation of different grassland ES shall facilitate economic ES-multifunctionality assessments. Thus, this methodological guidance will considerably support researchers and stakeholders in setting up ES comprehensive assessments and monitoring schemes in grasslands and shall ultimately help overcome incomplete or superficial surveys based on single or few ES only.

AB  - Landslide and debris flows, a serious geological disaster, are common at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, and damage the surface vegetation. Like other natural disasters, landslide and debris flows cause a shift in local ecological conditions, which can have profound impacts on the habitat of non-human primates. This study investigated the characteristics of surface vegetation found within the debris field of a landslide and debris flow that occurred in 2008 at Gehuaqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve ten years later. We calculated the surface area of the debris field to be 71672.96 m(2), affecting around 312500 m2 of the known home range of a resident Yunnan snub-nosed monkey group. A field survey was conducted to sample the vegetation within the area of the landslide and debris flow after it had been allowed to grow for ten years. In total, 27 plant species were observed within the debris field, all classified as either shrubs or herbaceous plants. Gnaphalium hypoleucum had the highest importance value of the herbs (27.48%), while Leycesteria formosa had the highest importance value of the shrubs (17.33%). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was significantly higher in the lower section and the Bray-Curtis distance was significantly lower, suggesting vegetation recovery has progressed faster on the lower end of the debris field. The speed of restoration within the landslide and debris flow area is important for the protection of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys living at Gehuaqing. A reasonable plan for vegetation restoration according to the composition of the surrounding community could mitigate population reductions in the monkeys and other local wildlife.

AB  - For the first time in Togo, we used camera trapping to investigate the mammal community in Fazao-Malfakassa National Park (FMNP), a forest and savannah mosaic landscape subject to poaching and other detrimental anthropogenic activity. We compiled a species inventory, that is species occurrence, habitat use and activity patterns during dry and wet seasons. Based on images from >80 locations during 9,007 camera days, we identified 32 mammal species, which, when combined with other published studies, increases the total number of mammals (excluding bats) historically reported to 57 species. Our results confirm the presence of five mammal species evaluated as threatened according to the IUCN Red List, highlighting the significant conservation value of the FMNP. Specifically, it appears to be the only protected area in Togo where the African savannah elephant and the African forest elephant occur sympatrically, and only the second site currently known with direct observations of Walter's duiker. We also report the presence of poachers and other anthropogenic activity within the FMNP. We recommend that continued survey efforts should be combined with detailed ecological data collection, effective law enforcement, community outreach and eco-tourism development, to safeguard the remaining mammal species communities necessary for a functioning ecosystem in the park.

AB  - Introduction The loss of genetic diversity is a critical factor in the extinction process, exacerbated by anthropogenic pressures and demographic stochasticity, particularly in small populations. Traditional population restoration methods, such as individual translocation and ecological corridors, present challenges, including high costs, adaptation difficulties, pathogen introduction, and outbreeding risks. Embryo reintroduction has emerged as a potential strategy for genetic rescue. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of embryo transfer as a genetic rescue tool in the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), a species classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.Methods Following the construction of the S & eacute;rgio Motta Hydroelectric Power Plant (UHSM) in 1998, a population of over 1,000 marsh deer was impacted, leading to the capture of 93 individuals for ex situ (82) and in situ (11) conservation efforts. Between 1998 and 2001, an experimental reintroduction program established a new population in a 2,000-hectare wetland near the Jata & iacute; Ecological Station (EEJ) in Luis Ant & ocirc;nio, S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Over time, this population reached a carrying capacity of 25 individuals but experienced genetic diversity loss. To address this, we conducted an embryo transfer experiment using a female from the reintroduced population as a receipt for embryos from the captive population. The female, captured during late pregnancy, was subjected to estrous cycle synchronization for embryo transfer after giving birth and being apart from its fawn. Two embryos from a captive population were implanted, and the female was re-released after 10 days. Monitoring was conducted via radio transmitter collar (GPS-GSM) and helicopter tracking.Results The female did not give birth to the implanted embryos but was recaptured nine months later for an ultrasonographic evaluation, which indicated a six-month pregnancy. This suggests that the implanted embryos were lost early in gestation, but natural fertilization occurred approximately three months post-release.Discussion This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of embryo reintroduction as a genetic rescue strategy, even though pregnancy was not carried to term. The ability to capture, temporarily hold, and successfully reintroduce a free-ranging female suggests minimal disruption to natural behaviors. Future improvements in embryo quality, hormonal protocols, and pregnancy confirmation prior to release could enhance the success rate of this method. Embryo reintroduction presents a promising alternative to traditional reintroduction methods, offering a novel approach to mitigating genetic risks in small, isolated populations.

AB  - Birds often prey on agricultural pests, potentially making them effective pest management agents; thus, changes in bird populations may have impacts on plant health. Using an exclosure treatment, we test whether birds reduce herbivore damage and increase crop yield on the island of Luta in the Mariana Island chain. We focused on Luta because the nearby island of Gu & aring;han has experienced widespread bird loss due to an invasive snake, and thus, this experiment simulating bird loss could provide an indication of potential cascading impacts to agriculture on Gu & aring;han. We planted two crops-eggplant and long bean-within bird exclosure and control treatments at three working farms, and measured herbivore damage, crop yield, and spider web abundance in the presence and absence of birds. The influence of birds varied among crops and farms. Herbivore damage did not differ between treatments in long bean, but damage was greater for eggplant in the absence of birds at one farm ("Farm 3"). Yield of eggplant did not differ between treatments, but yield and weight of long bean was lower in the absence of birds at Farm 1. Spider webs were 270% greater in the absence of birds at Farm 1, whereas spider webs were more abundant in the presence of birds at the other two farms. These results suggest that birds may control pest populations, but the effects vary depending on the crop and environmental context.

AB  - Many large-herbivore populations are regulated at least in part by bottom-up forces, and thus relationships between herbivores and their habitat are of fundamental importance to wildlife managers. Variation in nutritional resources-and how herbivores respond to that variation-influences rates of nutrient intake, which directly affect nutritional condition, pregnancy rates, timing of parturition, offspring birth mass, and survival. Accordingly, nutrition-focused research holds great potential for uncovering the mechanisms that govern population performance of large herbivores and for assessing the nature and magnitude of bottom-up limitations. We quantified relationships between the foodscape (i.e., spatiotemporal variation in forage quality and abundance) in southwestern Oregon, USA, and black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) behavior and performance, with a focus on the influence of maternal nutrition on fawn survival. We hypothesized that black-tailed deer performance (i.e., fawn birth mass and survival) is influenced by the availability of high-quality forage during spring and summer and patterns of foodscape use exhibited by individual deer. From 2016-2023 we monitored movement and survival of adult female black-tailed deer and their offspring. We also conducted intensive vegetation sampling and used generalized additive modeling to map the foodscape available to deer in spring and summer. Suitable forage biomass (i.e., maximum biomass of forage that together exceeded quality thresholds for supporting one fawn) was highly variable across space and time, and our top foodscape model explained 70% of the variation in suitable biomass (adjusted R2 = 0.70). We observed a strong, positive relationship between use of the foodscape by maternal females prior to parturition and fawn birth mass. Although maternal foodscape use after parturition did not influence the probability of fawn survival, survival increased with increasing birth mass. These results suggest that the effects of nutrition on fawn survival in our study system are indirectly mediated by maternal behavior (i.e., use of the foodscape) and the corresponding effects on birth mass of fawns. Our study adds to a growing body of literature supporting a fundamental link between foodscape use and population performance of large herbivores. Wildlife managers can use the dynamic models we developed to assess habitat quality and to make quantitative predictions about how different management actions (e.g., forest thinning) are likely to influence habitat quality and performance of black-tailed deer.

AB  - Restoration has now emerged as a global priority, with international initiatives such as the "UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030)". To fulfill the large-scale global restoration ambitions, an essential step is the monitoring of vegetation recovery after restoration interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of remotely sensed vegetation indices, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), to monitor the progress of forest regeneration across a tropical forest restoration project area in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Using the chronosequence approach, results indicated non-linear patterns in NDVI and EVI across the first 25 years of recovery. Both NDVI and EVI increased for the first 10 years of forest regeneration. This 'greening' phase could be used as the indicator of the successful onset of forest recovery. In particular, the decline of elephant grass, and the consequent arrival of shrubs and trees, can be detected as an increase in NDVI. Primary forests differed from the 25-year-old regenerating forests based on the unique combination of low mean and low seasonal variation in EVI. Our results, therefore, suggest that the long-term success of forest restoration could be monitored by evaluating how closely the combination of mean, and degree of seasonal variation in EVI, resembles that observed in the primary forest.

AB  - Overkill of large mammals is recognized as a key driver of Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in the Americas and Australia. While this phenomenon primarily affected mega-mammals, its impact on large Quaternary reptiles has been debated. Freshwater turtles, due to the scarcity of giant forms in the Quaternary record, have been largely neglected in such discussions. Here we present a new giant podocnemidid turtle, Peltocephalus maturin sp. nov., from the Late Pleistocene Rio Madeira Formation in the Brazilian Amazon, that challenges this assumption. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses of the holotype, a massive partial lower jaw, reveal close affinities to extant Amazonian species and suggest an omnivorous diet. Body size regressions indicate Pe. maturin possibly reached about 180 cm in carapace length and is among the largest freshwater turtles ever found. This finding presents the latest known occurrence of giant freshwater turtles, hinting at coexistence with early human inhabitants in the Amazon.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgo, Maidenhair tree) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the International Biological Flora: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and global heterogeneity. Globally, Ginkgo survives a wide range of mean annual temperature (-3.3 to 23.3 degrees C) and annual precipitation (34-3925 mm) conditions, according to a meta-analysis. It prefers a warm, humid, open-canopy and a well-drained environment. The species shows strong tolerance to drought, freezing, fire, air pollution, heavy metals and low-level salt, whereas it is intolerant to long-time shade and waterlogging. Six Ginkgo trees even survived the atom bomb in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. Ginkgo is susceptible to few diseases. Those occurring in nursery seedlings and juvenile trees involve stem rot and leaf blight. The former is caused by Macrophomina phaseoli, which could lead to a mortality rate of 5%-12% (up to 31.8%) for seedlings. This disease can be mitigated by a 4-h shading treatment and applying organic fertilisers. The pathogens inducing leaf blight include Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Pestalotia ginkgo, which may infect 100% juvenile trees in some regions. The application of 45% carbendazim or 50% Tuzet can effectively prevent leaf blight. Ginkgo biloba is one of the world's most distinctive trees with an important position in plant evolution and human society. It is a tall deciduous dioecious tree native to China. Refugial populations were identified in three glacial refugia located in eastern, southern and south-western China, respectively, with a patchy distribution pattern and a small population size. It typically grows along flood-disturbed streamsides in warm-temperate deciduous (and evergreen mixed) broadleaved forests. Ginkgo may have been introduced repeatedly out of China since the sixth century. It has been planted as a landscape tree world-wide, except in Antarctica. Ginkgo is also of great value for edible nuts, herbal medicine, religion and art. It is a natural and cultural symbol of China.

AB  - This study aims to estimate variance components, heritability, and repeatability of lactation yield (270 day), as well as estimated breeding value for 879 water buffalo lactation records for 615 animals belonging to the water buffalo breeding project using BUGA software. The model was constructed by using all available the pedigree information. Herd, season and year were used as fixed effects while lactation length and age were used as covariate. Random environment variance, genotypic variance and permanent environment variance values were estimated as 48388.61 +/- 0.0003 kg2, 12003.08 +/- 0.0003 kg2 and 9567.92 +/- 0.0003 kg2 while heritability (h2) and repeatability (r) of lactation yield were estimated as 0.17 +/- 0.162 and 0.30, respectively. The study concluded that the heritability of milk yield was low and in order to achieve more effective genetic improvement, the project should be organized in a way that allows for the identification of sire records for the animals involved. In addition, the environmental conditions in which buffalos are raised must be brought closer to the conditions required by the animals.

AB  - Increasing human-wild boar interactions have led to damage to agricultural crops, traffic collisions and disease transmissions. Dividing natural areas in zones with differential hunting pressure is one of the currently adopted management strategies. However, the effectiveness of this approach is under debate. Hence, there is a need to better understand how to mitigate negative human-wild boar interactions effectively.Camera traps are cost-efficient, and non-invasive tools to monitor animal populations. N-mixture models can reliably estimate spatial variation in relative abundances when animals are imperfectly detected and/or cannot be individually identified. Thus, they are useful tools to infer the impacts of several factors on the land-use intensity of wild boar, based on camera trap data. In a nature area in central Belgium, we compare "summer" (April-September) land-use intensity of wild boar from 2018 until 2021 between three zones: a hunting free core zone, a winter hunting zone where hunting only takes place between November and March, and a year-round hunting zone. The latter is also close to the forest edge, agricultural crops and settlements. We compare spatial abundance models that capture these zone effects, or attractive effects of croplands, repulsive effects of hunting and repulsive effects of non-lethal human disturbances.We reveal between zone differences in wild boar land-use intensities across all summers. Additionally, we find that non-lethal human disturbance and croplands also explain variation in wild boar land-use intensity, but do not find negative associations with hunting locations. Our results suggest that the effects of zoning on wild boar land-use patterns are relevant in medium-sized natural areas. Moreover, we identify the need to install additional cameras outside of the managed area in order to assess the impacts of hunting in combination with non-lethal human activities on wild boar to mitigate negative human-wild boar interactions in the future.

AB  - Sika deer is indigenous to East Asia. Currently the species is extinct or are nearing the verge of extinction, in numerous places. Reduced population size is sensitive to climate change and has poor adaptation as a result of inbreeding. In this study genome-wide Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using double-digest restriction site associated digestion (ddRAD) approach and annotated further to identify genes related to fitness. A total 85,001 SNPs were retained following the quality control. Composite Likelihood Ratio (CLR) statistics found 13 stronger selective sweeps, identified sweeps overlapped with genes related to adaptation, reproduction, cellular functions. Average heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity were 0.27 and 0.29 respectively. Admixture analysis furnished a single cluster indicating no further sub-divergence of Sika deer. These findings would help fabricate appropriate genetic improvement programs by inclusion in the SNP chips, in order to get deeper insights into deer genetics, evolution, domestication and conservation.

AB  - Megaherbivores play a critical role in the ecology of African savannas and grasslands. In addition, these systems are forecast to experience more frequent and severe droughts as a product of changes in the global climate. Thus, the continued conservation of megaherbivores and their associated ecosystems will require a better understanding of how megaherbivores respond to drought by shifting their movement, diet and social behaviour. We address this need by investigating the factors affecting changes in the abundance of common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; hereafter: 'hippos') throughout the six major rivers of Kruger National Park, South Africa, during and following the severe drought of 2015/2016. Specifically, we aimed to understand the role of two environmental characteristics that have relevance to hippos and that changed in response to drought: vegetation condition and the extent of pooled surface water. In addition, we investigated the extent to which pre-drought density affected changes in hippo abundance. Although vegetation and daytime refugia both appeared to influence pre-drought hippo abundance, these factors were less important to the change in hippo abundance related to the drought. Instead, the response to drought was most strongly related to the pre-drought abundance of hippos, where river segments supporting more than 50 individuals prior to the drought in 2015 decreased by more than half on average. Furthermore, we show that the degree of aggregation decreased from 2015 to 2016 because of the drought, but then began to increase again as the rains returned in 2017. Our results suggest that in addition to the large pools that support large aggregations of hippos in typical years, additional smaller pools are likely important for accommodating this drought-induced dispersion. However, maintaining this distribution of pools will likely become more challenging as southern Africa's population and water demands increase.

AB  - This study aimed to reveal the main environmental factors affecting PH, SOM, SOC, TN, and AHN in mountainous areas of Beijing, using the Chaoguan Xigou watershed as the research object. The relationship among pH, SOM, SOC, TN, AHN, topographic factors, and vegetation factors was analyzed by correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that altitude was significantly positively correlated with vegetation types in the study area (p < 0.01). Menhinnick richness index (D), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), and Alatalo evenness index (E) ranged from 0.35-0.79, 0.86-1.73, and 0.39-0.7, respectively, indicating moderate variations. E was significantly positively correlated with stand type (p < 0.05), altitude (p < 0.05), and H (p < 0.01). The variation ranges of PH, SOM, SOC, TN, and AHN in soil were 5.78-7.13, 54.73-90.38 g/kg, 23.77-60.25 g/kg, 1.71-4.22 g/kg, and 95.64-223.26 mg/kg, respectively. All soil nutrient indexes had medium variation except for pH (weak variation). In this study, RDA results showed that altitude is the main environmental factor affecting the soil pH, SOM, SOC, TN, and AHN in this area and could explain 25.9% of the total variance. However, the effects of factors associated with altitude on pH, SOM, SOC, TN, and AHN need to be further studied.

AB  - Feral deer are widespread throughout Australia with the capacity to impact livestock production via transmission of parasites. Samples of Dama dama (fallow deer), Rusa unicolor (sambar deer), Cervus elaphus (red deer) and an unidentified deer were sourced from various locations in south-eastern Australia for examination for parasites. Adult nematodes were collected from the lungs of all deer species across four separate geographical locations. The nematodes were identified as species of Dictyocaulus through both morphological and molecular means. Species identification based on morphological features was difficult, with many measurements from described species overlapping. Molecular analyses targeting three markers, namely 18S rRNA, ITS2, and cox1 revealed the presence of two distinct species: Dictyocaulus cervi and Dictyocaulus skrjabini. These are the first genetically confirmed reports of species of Dictyocaulus in feral deer in Australia, and although cross-transmission of species of Dictyocaulus with livestock has not yet been reported, it cannot be completely discounted without further research.

AB  - Cave biodiversity and ecosystems are underexplored. To guide conservation needs for visitor management, we surveyed the 2,158 m long Danial Cave in northern Iran for vertebrate fauna. We identified four mammalian and two amphibian species in the cave: the greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Blasius's horseshoe bat Rhinolophus blasii, the lesser mouse-eared myotis Myotis blythii, the Hyrcanian field mouse Apodemus hyrcanicus, the Hyrcanian wood frog Rana pseudodalmatina and the Eurasian marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus. Considering the increasing tourism pressures at Danial Cave, information on cave fauna is imperative for the conservation management of unique and endemic cave species.

AB  - Duzlercami Wildlife Reserve Area (WRA) is the last natural habitat of fallow deer (Dama dama) in the world. Fallow deer is native to Turkey, however, its geographical range is currently confined to Duzlercami WRA, Antalya. To date, a detailed habitat investigation of fallow deer distribution has not been conducted. This study is vital for the last surviving populations of fallow deer in Turkey. Therefore, we studied the habitat suitability and utilization of fallow deer in the Duzlercami WRA. Vegetation and wildlife inventory was surveyed across a total of 304 sample areas between 2015 and 2017. Plant species were recorded according to the Braun-Blanquet method and wildlife surveys were based on footprints, feces, and other signs of fallow deer. Classification and regression tree techniques, as well as MAXENT, were used to model vegetation and fallow deer habitat. Topographic position index, terrain ruggedness index, roughness index, elevation, and bedrock formation were also calculated and included in the models. Based on our results, we drafted a habitat protection map for fallow deer. To ensure sustainability of habitats where populations of fallow deer are found in Turkey, we developed recommendations such as closuring human access of the 1st-degree Protection Area and reintroduction of the species to other potential habitats.

AB  - Coastal mangrove ecosystems have been degraded due to changes in land use and grazing. Here, we assess the differences in population characteristics and sediment organic carbon (SOC) stocks and carbon sequestration rates (CSR) at Avicennia marina protected and grazed locations along the southern Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia. Tree density per unit area were counted (tree 100 m(- 2)) and maximum tree height and crown diameter (cm) were measured. Sediment bulk density (SBD, g cm(- 3)), sediment organic carbon (SOC) content (g C kg(- 1)), total SOC stocks (kg C m(- 2)) to a depth of 75 cm, and CSR (g C m(- 2) year(- 1)) were estimated. Protected A. marina trees had significantly (p < 0.05) higher tree height and crown diameter (119.5 +/- 8.3 and 209.6 +/- 17.1 cm, respectively) than those of the mangrove trees at the grazed locations (76.8 +/- 7.5 and 148.0 +/- 23.5 cm, respectively). Sediment of the A. marina trees that are growing at the protected locations had significantly (p < 0.05) higher SOC content, SOC density, SOC stock to a depth of 75 cm, and CSR (21.6 +/- 0.5 g C kg(- 1), 30.5 +/- 0.6 kg C m(- 3), 22.9 +/- 1.1 kg C m(- 2), and 6.7 +/- 0.1 g C m(- 2) year(- 1), respectively) than those of the grazed locations (9.6 +/- 0.2 g C kg(- 1), 14.6 +/- 0.2 kg C m(- 3), 10.9 +/- 0.4 kg C m(- 2), and 3.2 +/- 0.0 g C m(- 2) year(- 1), respectively). Our results provide strong evidence of the vital need to continue conserving A. marina's population for accumulating more blue carbon for mitigation of global warming and offset greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Theory of Change (ToC) and Social Return of Investment (SROI) are planning tools that help projects craft strategic approaches in order to create the most impact. In 2018, the Management & Ecology of Malaysian Elephants (MEME) carried out planning exercises using these tools to develop an Asian elephant conservation project with agriculture communities. First, a problem tree was constructed together with stakeholders, with issues arranged along a cause-and-effect continuum. There were 17 main issues identified, ranging from habitat connectivity and fragmentation, to the lack of tolerance toward wild elephants. All issues ultimately stemmed from a human mindset that favors human-centric development. The stakeholders recognize the need to extend conservation efforts beyond protected areas and move toward coexistence with agriculture communities for the survival of the wild elephants. We mapped previous Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) management methods and other governmental policies in Malaysia against the problem tree, and provided an overview of the different groups of stakeholders. The ToC was developed and adapted for each entity, while including Asian elephants as a stakeholder in the project. From the SROI estimation, we extrapolated the intrinsic value of the wild Asian elephant population in Johor, Malaysia, to be conservatively worth at least MYR 7.3 million (USD 1.8 million) per year. From the overall calculations, the potential SROI value of the project is 18.96 within 5 years, meaning for every ringgit invested in the project, it generates MYR 18.96 (USD 4.74) worth of social return value. There are caveats with using these value estimations outside of the SROI context, which was thoroughly discussed. The SROI provides projects with the ability to justify to funders the social return values of its activities, which we have adapted to include the intrinsic value of an endangered megafauna. Moreover, SROI encourages projects to consider unintended impacts (i.e., replacement, displacement, and deadweight), and acknowledge contributions from stakeholders. The development of the problem tree and ToC via SROI approach, can help in clarifying priorities and encourage thinking out of the box. For this case study, we presented the thinking process, full framework and provided evidences to support the Theory of Change.

AB  - The potential impact of climatic deterioration on societal breakdowns in prehistory is often based on the mere coincidence of archaeological and palaeoclimatological proxies. For a more profound discussion, climate-sensitive archaeological parameters need to be identified. As agriculture and livestock are significantly affected by the recent climate crisis, the analysis of archaeobotanical and archaeozoological remains can deepen our understanding of this topic. Here, we analyze regional trajectories in subsistence and seasonal precipitation variability across southern Iberia focusing on well-known prehistoric breakdowns around 2200 and 1600 BCE. Results suggest that the ratios of the importance of sheep/goat versus swine and sheep/goat versus cattle, respectively, may serve as a proxy for prehistoric mobility. The importance of hunting deer represents a proxy for societal turnover. While no direct link is evident between climate deterioration and the archaeozoological data, archaeobotanical data reveals a potential relation to precipitation variability. In particular, a close connection to reductions in cold-season precipitation in south-east Iberia appears likely for the ratio between barley and naked wheat. The increased importance of drought-tolerant barley correlates with a trend to reduced cold-season precipitation levels after ca. 2700 BCE. We hypothesize that prehistoric people in south-east Iberia cultivated more barley in order to adapt to periods of drier cold-season climate.

AB  - Alpine meadow and alpine steppe are crucial ecosystem types in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, due to ecosystem fragility and human disturbance, the nutrient imbalance between plant and soil leads to grassland degradation. From a systematic perspective, there needs to be a comprehensive understanding of the plant and soil traits within these two ecosystem types. This study addressed this gap by constructing plant-soil trait networks for alpine meadow and alpine steppe, identifying bridge traits, and comparing the stability and distinctions of the two trait networks. The results demonstrated a significant difference in the distribution of network structure edge weights between the alpine meadow and steppe. In the network of alpine meadow, the soil organic carbon was responsible for linking plant and soil traits, exhibiting the highest impact. Conversely, the network of alpine steppe revealed an increasing negative correlation between plant and soil traits. The results of bridge traits agreed with the optimal distribution hypothesis. The bridge traits of the alpine meadow were aboveground traits (AGB or PlantC), while those of the alpine steppe were belowground traits (BGB and RootN). Based on our findings, different management measures could be taken. The alpine meadow could be primarily restored through natural processes, and climate warming would enhance its carbon sequestration capacity. The alpine steppe ecosystem exhibits low nitrogen availability, which could be augmented through fertilisation or the return of yak manure.

AB  - Our awareness of air-borne sounds in natural and urban habitats has led to the recent recognition of soundscape ecology and ecoacoustics as interdisciplinary fields of research that can help us better understand ecological processes and ecosystem dynamics. Because the vibroscape (i.e., the substrate-borne vibrations occurring in a given environment) is hidden to the human senses, we have largely overlooked its ecological significance. Substrate vibrations provide information crucial to the reproduction and survival of most animals, especially arthropods, which are essential to ecosystem functioning. Thus, vibroscape is an important component of the environment perceived by the majority of animals. Nowadays, when the environment is rapidly changing due to human activities, climate change, and invasive species, this hidden vibratory world is also likely to change without our notice, with potentially crucial effects on arthropod communities. Here, we introduce ecotremology, a discipline that mainly aims at studying substrate-borne vibrations for unraveling ecological processes and biological conservation. As biotremology follows the main research concepts of bioacoustics, ecotremology is consistent with the paradigms of ecoacoustics. We argue that information extracted from substrate vibrations present in the environment can be used to comprehensively assess and reliably predict ecosystem changes. We identify key research questions and discuss the technical challenges associated with ecotremology studies.

AB  - The late Middle Pleistocene archaeological site of Casal de' Pazzi (MIS 7,-240-200 ka) in central Italy provided a complex of paleontological (both fauna and flora) and archaeological evidence, as well as a cranial fragment of Homo heidelbergensis.Here, we investigated the stable carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of tooth enamel from six herbivore species (Palaeoloxodon antiquus, Hippopotamus amphibius, Bos primigenius, Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis, Equus ferus, and Dama Dama) to contribute to the understanding of the paleoenvironment of the site through the reconstruction of the diet and habitat of Pleistocene mammals. Our results indicate that the analyzed taxa fed on C3 plants and exploited both closed and open environments. This is consistent with the macro-botanical remains (leaf fossil impressions of Zelkova sp., Laurus nobilis, and Cercis siliquastrum) found at Casal de' Pazzi and pollen evidence from the nearby lake of Valle di Castiglione. The area around the site was characterized by diversified Mediterranean evergreen forest tree species, accompanied by mesophilic elements of the mixed deciduous oak and beach forest, alternating with diversified wooded/forested vegetation and xeric vegetation. This was the environmental context in which the late Middle Pleistocene Homo lived. Comparisons with published isotopic data from other European archaeological localities between-600 and 125 ka evidenced considerable environmental differences through time and space, according to the general climate trends and local factors, such as latitude, temperature, and vegetation composition.

AB  - Pontederia crassipes remains a highly invasive weed globally, posing significant threats to aquatic ecosystems. Megamelus scutellaris, , a biological control agent released in South Africa effectively manages this weed, even at eutrophic, and high-elevation cool sites. Biological control of P. crassipes at Hartbeespoort Dam, a hypertrophic system in South Africa plagued by nuisance macrophyte growth, was followed by the invasion of an aquatic fern, Salvinia minima. . This study explains the population dynamics of P. crassipes and S. minima at Hartbeespoort Dam, as a function of M. scutellaris herbivory to P. crassipes. . Competition and herbivory effects on both species were evaluated using an additive series analysis in mesocosms. Multiple regression analyses indicated that in the absence of herbivory on P. crassipes, , its interspecific competition coefficient was 4 times greater than that of S. minima. . The competitive vigour of S. minima more than doubled in the presence of herbivory on P. crassipes. . Consequently, in the presence of the biological control agent, no statistically significant difference in interspecific competition for both species could be found. These results highlight how biological control of one species can alter the population dynamics between two competing species. While biological control of S. minima is under consideration in South Africa, in the absence of nutrient remediation, the system will remain vulnerable to further invasion.

AB  - Density is a fundamental ecological parameter that is often difficult to estimate in large herbivores due to the wide spatial extent of their populations and imperfect detectability of individuals. We searched Google Earth imagery using an independent double-observer protocol to estimate elk Cervus elaphus density in Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA, on summer range that had never been systematically surveyed. Detectability of elk was high at 0.836 (95% CRI: 0.769, 0.909) producing high precision in our density estimates. Elk density estimates ranged from a minimum of 8.9 elk km(-2) over a 214.8 km(2) search area (95% CRI: 7.9, 10.9) to a maximum of 14.0 elk km(-2) over 98.5 km(2) of nonforested, alpine terrain (95% CRI: 13.5, 14.9). These estimates of elk density are comparable to the highest elk densities ever recorded in Yellowstone which primarily derive from winter, at low elevations, prior to wolf Canis lupus reintroduction. A log-linear positive effect of open landcover on density suggested preference for open terrain. Multiple survey designs may be possible with satellite imagery that would allow further refinement of noninvasive abundance estimation over large scales.

AB  - The Sardinian population of wild boar (WB, Sus scrofa meridionalis) has evolved on this Mediterranean island since its arrival in Neolithic age. Climate and land use vary across the island; high temperatures and dryness represent limiting factors for the development and reproduction of the species. Hence, the environment can have contributed to create the morphological differences we observe today across the island and could sustain the genetic structure that has been previously observed using neutral molecular markers. We therefore searched for genomic signatures of local adaptation in a sample of Sardinian WB genotyped at almost 50 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic structure was observed in the population separating the northwest and southwest from the east of the island, where internal substructure also emerged. We identified 49 SNPs as candidate loci involved in adaptation and 61 genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed over-representation of terms related to cell localization, motility, and adhesion, but also related to anatomical development and immunity. According to our results, the environment seems to have played a role in shaping the genetic differentiation of the Sardinian wild boar in a limited evolutionary timescale.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E, an emerging public health infection which has an increasing incidence across Europe. Because of the apparent lack of species barriers, HEV was characterized as a zoonotic agent. Swine are recognized as the main reservoir, but HEV is also found in wild animals such as ungulates, lagomorphs, and bats. Our work aimed at detecting the HEV presence in wild fauna in two hunting areas of Northern Italy (Parma and Sondrio areas) with different environmental and anthropic characteristics to investigate its possible role as reservoir. Liver samples were collected from wild boars, red deer, roe deer and chamois, and viral identification was carried out by One-Step RT Real-time PCR. Positive samples were genotyped, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. The virus was found only in the wild boar population, with different prevalence and subtypes in the two areas (14% HEV3a and 1.2% close to HEV3f in Parma and Sondrio, respectively). Wild ruminants seem otherwise to pose a marginal risk. Given the high pig farm density in the Parma area, and expansion of the wild boar population, continuous monitoring of the strains circulating in wildlife is crucial.

AB  - We assessed the efficiency of camera trapping in monitoring bird and mammal species in the grasslands of Tandilia Mountains by calculating the naive occupancy, capture rate, and time to the first detection for each species. We compared the observed richness with the reported richness from online databases. We performed species accumulation curves to estimate the sampling effort necessary to detect bird and mammal species. We detected 50 bird and 15 mammal species. The top 5 bird species (Chalk-browed Mockingbird, Rufous-collared Sparrow, Rufous Hornero, Great Pampa-Finch, and Spotted Nothura) accounted for 48% of all detected individual birds, with naive occupancy of 21-25% and mean times for the first detection between 6 and 9 days. The top 5 mammal species (Pampas fox, large hairy armadillo, European hare, Molina's hog-nosed skunk, and Geoffroy's cat) accounted for 81% of all detected individual mammals, with naive occupancy of 32-77% and mean times for the first detection between 4 and 7 days. A sampling effort of 2 weeks was the optimal balance between effort and result qualities. We detected all the reported richness of mammals and half of the reported grassland-associated birds. We provide valuable information for future grassland species monitoring with camera trapping in Neotropical grasslands.

AB  - This study aimed at measuring the effect of vermicompost on soil physical and chemical properties and runoff quality and quantity in agro-ecosystems in Northern Iran. Thus, runoff measurement plots of 1 x 5 m were set up in sloping lands under natural rainfall during 5 months. Runoff quality and quantity, soil properties, and plant growth were measured. This study shows that the amount of runoff water and its quality (sediment yields, nitrate content, pH, and conductivity) were not influenced by the fertilization treatments (vermicompost alone, chemical fertilization alone, or their mixture), except for the first month of the experiment where a lower runoff amount was measured when vermicompost was applied alone. Although no difference in plant growth was found, our results showed a significant improvement of soil properties when vermicompost was used as a fertilizer. Consequently, this study shows that vermicompost can be considered as an alternative application for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and improving soil properties but its impact on plant growth and runoff is limited to the short term.

AB  - Rangifer tarandus, the northern species including both reindeer and caribou, is a pillar of northern ecosystems and the lives of northern peoples. As the only domestic cervid, reindeer are important not only to the herders and hunters who presently interact with them, but also to zooarchaeologists and palaeontologists tracing their histories. Unfortunately, limited anatomical information on Rangifer tarandus muscles is available beyond descriptions of the large muscle groups. The lower limb and hoof in particular is poorly documented. This is problematic, as this important body part has the potential to be informative in zooarchaeological analyses of habitual activity, especially in regards to historical animal health, movement, and habitual activity. Better understanding of the hoof can additionally be useful to herders and veterinarians seeking to provide veterinary care for living animals. This study has used dissections and comparisons of the reindeer hoof with other domestic ungulates to document both the common and unique structures in Rangifer tarandus hooves, including the presence and attachment points of these structures. As these structures have proved unique, especially in regards to the dewclaw, it is important that other ungulates not be used exclusively in the analysis of Rangifer tarandus remains.

AB  - There are numerous examples of phenological shifts that are recognized both as indicators of climate change and drivers of ecosystem change. A pressing challenge is to understand the causal mechanisms by which climate affects phenology. We combined annual population census data and individual longitudinal data (1992-2018) on grey seals, Halicheorus grypus, to quantify the relationship between pupping season phenology and sea surface temperature. A temperature increase of 2 degrees C was associated with a pupping season advance of approximately seven days at the population level. However, we found that maternal age, rather than sea temperature, accounted for changes in pupping date by individuals. Warmer years were associated with an older average age of mothers, allowing us to explain phenological observations in terms of a changing population age structure. Finally, we developed a matrix population model to test whether our observations were consistent with changes to the stable age distribution. This could not fully account for observed phenological shift, strongly suggesting transient modification of population age structure, for example owing to immigration. We demonstrate a novel mechanism for phenological shifts under climate change in long-lived, age- or stage-structured species with broad implications for dynamics and resilience, as well as population management.

AB  - The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to multiple threats such as habitat loss and human disturbance that have led to its population decline. This decline increases the risk of inbreeding, which could result in the reduction of genome-wide genetic variation and negatively affect the gene responsible for immune response i.e., MHC gene. Class I and II MHC genes are responsible for encoding MHC molecules in the cells that recognise pathogenic peptides and present them to T-Cells on the cell surface for adaptive immune response. However, at present there is no study related to the MHC gene in Malayan tapir yet. This study characterises the MHC class I and II genes from seven individuals, investigates evidence of balancing selection and their relationships with homologous genes of other species. We identified at least one class I gene and four class II genes. Five sequences of alpha1 (alpha 1) and four of alpha2 (alpha 2) domains of class I alleles, two DRA, two DQA, three DRB and three DQB of class II alleles were isolated. alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of class I and DRB domain of class II displayed evidence of selection with a higher rate of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions. Within the DRB gene, 24 codons were found to be under selection where 10 are part of the codons forming the Antigen Binding Site. Genes sequences show species-specific monophyletic group formation except for class I and DRB genes with intersperse relationship in their phylogenetic trees which may indicate occurrence of trans-species polymorphism of allelic lineage. More studies using RNA samples are needed to identify the gene's level of expression.

AB  - The last European wild equids -Equus ferus and Equus hydruntinus- were among the large mammals (or megafauna) that became extinct during the Late Quaternary Extinction Event disappearing from Europe during the Holocene. The role that the combined action of the major climatic changes of the Pleistocene/Holocene Transition and the human activities played in their extinction is not fully understood. The reduction of steppelike biomes in Europe following the increase of mean global temperatures during the Holocene is usually regarded as the main event that triggered their disappearance, as both equids display typical morphological adaptations for open grasslands and grass eating. However, E. ferus and E. hydruntinus are found, often even cooccurring, in both warm and cold phases of the Late Pleistocene. Thus, the investigation of their niche occupation can help decipher whether their ecology and specialised dietary adaptations were the main reason of their decline following the early Holocene global warming. Here we investigate the feeding strategies of the two equids by studying their long- and short-term dietary adaptations through examination of their patterns of dental wear. As expected, dental mesowear points to a highly abrasive diet concordant with a grazing feeding behaviour for both E. ferus and E. hydruntinus which is consistent with their specialised morphological adaptations for open habitats. In contrast, dental microwear suggests a somewhat degree of plasticity in diets, as both species display microscopic features commonly recorded in modern mixed feeders. Such a flexibility may be the reason for which they could have persisted even when open grasslands were not the dominant landscape. Our findings provide a new line of evidence supporting the idea that human activities (e.g., competition with the first domestic forms brought from Eurasia and Africa) may have played a larger role in the extinction of some megafauna groups than climate change per se.

AB  - Simple Summary The Mediterranean marine forests of canopy brown algae are important habitats that have been in decline in recent decades. This study examines the distribution and status of macroalgal communities in relation to the populations of the main herbivores (fish and sea urchins) in the eastern Mediterranean. In the warmer South Aegean and Levantine Sea, invasive herbivorous fish seem to drive canopy algae towards shallower waters, while native sea urchins have become rare, indicating population collapses. In the North Aegean, macroalgal forests were observed in intermediate depths, and native sea urchins still thrive and appear to exert grazing pressure on macroalgal forests in shallower waters. Our results provide useful information for policymakers and help guide future research and conservation efforts. Canopy-forming macroalgae, such as Cystoseira sensu lato, increase the three-dimensional complexity and spatial heterogeneity of rocky reefs, enhancing biodiversity and productivity in coastal areas. Extensive loss of canopy algae has been recorded in recent decades throughout the Mediterranean Sea due to various anthropogenic pressures. In this study, we assessed the biomass of fish assemblages, sea urchin density, and the vertical distribution of macroalgal communities in the Aegean and Levantine Seas. The herbivore fish biomass was significantly higher in the South Aegean and Levantine compared to the North Aegean. Very low sea urchin densities suggest local collapses in the South Aegean and the Levantine. In most sites in the South Aegean and the Levantine, the ecological status of macroalgal communities was low or very low at depths deeper than 2 m, with limited or no canopy algae. In many sites, canopy algae were restricted to a very narrow, shallow zone, where grazing pressure may be limited due to harsh hydrodynamic conditions. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, we demonstrated that the presence of canopy algae is negatively correlated with the biomass of the invasive Siganus spp. and sea urchins. The loss of Cystoseira s.l. forests is alarming, and urgent conservation actions are needed.

AB  - Since 2015, Brazilian legislation governing resource extraction in the Santos Basin has required daily monitoring of beaches (similar to 1490 km) in Rio de Janeiro (RJ), S & atilde;o Paulo (SP), Paran & aacute; (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC) for fauna strandings. All stranded specimens are necropsied or rehabilitated. Here, we investigate spatio-temporal variability among 5169 loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, stranded between 2015 and 2022, and discuss regional management implications. Weekly stranding rates among states ranged between 0.03 (RJ) and 0.54 (PR) C. caretta 100 km-1 and peaked during winter and spring-coinciding with concentrated regional penaeid-trawl effort. Almost all (99%) stranded C. caretta were dead and had advanced decomposition. Overall, there were biases towards female C. caretta (2:1), that increased during summer, and juveniles (2.2:1) across all states, especially in Paran & aacute;-encompassing an ecologically important and World Heritage-listed estuarine complex. Identified anthropogenic impacts among stranded C. caretta were low overall (14%) but biased towards fishing (8%) and greatest during winter and spring. Few (similar to 4%) C. caretta had ingested plastic or were entangled in marine debris. The data support prioritising the jurisdictional management of impacts across SP, PR, and SC during winter and spring, and in the presence of intensified regional trawling effort.

AB  - Arthropod species diversity enhances ecosystem productivity and sustainability by increasing pollination and biological control services. Although, it is declining rapidly due to conventional agricultural intensification, organic agriculture with reduced reliance on agronomic inputs can regenerate ecosystems' resilience and restore them. Here, we report whether hexapod communities differ on both types of farming systems in small-scale field plot experiments, wherein Maize variety AG-589 was grown organically and conventionally in the 2020 and 2021 seasons. Livestock manure was applied in organic fields, whereas nitrogen and phosphorous were used as synthetic fertilizers in conventional fields. Hexapods were sampled three weeks after sowing once a week from the middle rows of subplots from both organically and conventionally grown maize. Twelve species of herbivores and four species of predators were recorded. Hexapod abundance overall and that of herbivores only was higher in conventionally cultivated maize, while predator abundance was higher in organic maize. Herbivores species diversity and evenness were significantly higher in conventional maize. Predator species diversity and evenness were significantly higher in organic maize fields. We noted predator abundance, diversity, and evenness as strong predictors to lower herbivore populations. These findings suggest that organic farming conserves natural enemies' biodiversity and regulates herbivores with increased provision of suitable habitats and prey resources for natural enemies, leading to enhanced relative abundance in their specialized niches. Thus, organic agriculture can potentially mediate better ecosystem services.

AB  - The extinction of Neanderthal populations has been attributed to the onset of cold and dry climatic conditions during Marine Isotope Stage 3 or their competition with anatomically modern humans for large game resources. However, decoupling climate from competition has long proved difficult. Loess sequences and pollen cores provide regional-scale environmental information but are less well-suited to providing local-scale habitat information contemporaneous with hominin habitation of occupation sites. The relationship between climate and resource availability is particularly unknown in the Zagros mountain range where archaeological evidence for both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens occupation is documented. Here, we analyse carbon (& delta;C-13) and oxygen (& delta;O-18) stable isotopes measured from herbivore tooth enamel carbonates recovered from the Neanderthal and modern human occupation sites of Bawa Yawan Rockshelter and Shanidar Cave to trace local-scale floral biome dynamics and climate conditions that influence the distribution and availability of large prey targeted by both hominin species. Shared isotopic composition of herbivorous fauna, largely represented by wild goats, from both sites spanning Neanderthal and Homo sapiens occupation indicate both hominin species exploited similar habitats during climatically similar phases.

AB  - African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) are significant ecosystem engineers - having profound effects on the vegetation when at high population densities. To provide a context for modern conservation decisions it would be useful to know the 'natural' population densities prior to the arrival of firearms in Africa. Here, we use botanical and archaeological arguments to suggest a lower density of elephant populations than in some present protected areas over at least the last few millennia, and arguably much longer. This suggests that elephant population densities seen in some protected areas during the second half of the twentieth century are likely higher than those seen in the past and so have the potential to result in significant negative impacts on associated fauna and flora.

AB  - Humboldt Bay has the highest rate of sea level rise (SLR) in California (47.2 cm/century). Due to compaction and tectonic subsidence, former tidelands and pastures behind dikes surrounding Humboldt Bay are lower in elevation than bay waters at high tide. Adaptation to future climate change and SLR requires that resource managers understand vulnerability and risk to each wildlife area at a local level, because adaptation to SLR is a risk-based management strategy against an uncertain future requiring site-specific solutions. We conducted a vulnerability assessment of the shoreline of three State wildlife areas surrounding Humboldt Bay: Elk River (ERWA), Fay Slough (FSWA), and Mad River Slough (MRSWA). Breaching of shorelines that border each refuge has the potential to flood a diversity of wetland communities, wildlife habitats, and critical infrastructure within the historic tidal inundation footprint. The total length of diked 1-m shoreline segments potentially impacted by SLR was 6.2 km. The relationship between vulnerability and elevation of diked shoreline segments was significantly correlated for all wildlife areas. Vulnerability of diked shoreline was significantly affected by the type of surface covering. MRSWA had the highest percentage of shoreline fortified with concrete and rock (62.2% [2,876 m]), followed by ERWA (0.3% [2,815 m]). ERWA and FSWA had the greatest percentage of shoreline anchored by vegetation (99.3% [2,834 m] and 91.5% [3,385 m], respectively); FSWA had the highest percentage of unvegetated (i.e., exposed) shoreline (7.4% [252 m]); and ERWA had the highest percentage (86.6% [436 m]) of diked shoreline followed by FSWA (69.2% [633 m]) and MRSWA (33.0% [276 m]). The highest overall ratings of shoreline vulnerability were at ERWA (91.7%), followed by FSSWA (72,4%), and MRSWA (34.4%). Issues related to retention of unique characteristics of each wildlife area, natural resources and species at risk, and adaptive planning for future SLR are discussed.

AB  - Conservationists are raising concerns about escalating rates of illegal hunting and trading of wildlife resource for food (meat). Hunting of wild animals is associated with complex motivations and drivers that include the high demand for high-value luxury products or a preference for a particular wild animal that consumers consider nutritious over other commercial meat products. Despite the fact that the preference for animal meat from the wild could be a contributory factor hampering most conservation efforts, more studies are still focusing more on habitat destruction rather than bushmeat trade. We investigated the factors influencing preference for antelopes compared with other forms of meat (commercial and non-antelope bushmeat) sold at bushmeat retail centers of Enugu-Nigeria. Data was collected from retailers and a face-to-face interview of respondents at four different centers (selected by cluster probability sampling method) of the three rural areas over a 12-month period. A total of 283 bushbucks (Tragelaphus sylvaticus) and 211 common duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) were provided by hunters to the retail centers. Data from 1884 semi-structured questionnaires (administered by simple random sampling) indicate most respondents preferred to consume antelope meat because it is readily availability. The duiker was consumed for its morphology and resemblance to goat. In the absence of antelope, the non-antelope bushmeat (guinea fowl) and commercial meat (pork) were consumed due to affordability. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMMs) analyses indicated that respondent age, occupation and motives were significantly related to the number of consumers of antelopes and other sources of meat at the retail centers. The younger consumers of age range 18-35 years consumed antelope and other forms of meat at the retail centers due to health benefits, while businessmen, due to availability. The selection of antelopes by the younger consumers could be an indication of a push to healthier living which may be motivated by status-seeking attitude that could in turn affect future conservation of wildlife resources.

AB  - One of the consequences of climate change is an increase in the temperature of the oceans, which is considered to be one of the greatest impacts on biodiversity. Fish may respond to this impact in several ways, including shifts in their patterns of occurrence. The present study investigated the variation in the structure of a H. reidi population between 2015 and 2017 in the northern Guaiba Island area, highlighting a possible relationship to thermal anomaly associated with the El Nino phenomenon. The seahorse population monitoring was performed monthly, recording sex ratio, abundance, juvenile and adult proportion, depth of occurrence, total length and the holdfast which the seahorse were found attached. The influence of the El Nino event on the study population was evaluated by the correlation of the thermal anomaly data reported for the Tropical South Atlantic Index. Seahorse density on northern Guaiba island was positively and significantly correlated with water temperature, but the sex ratio and number of juveniles were not. The diversity of holdfasts used increased over the study period and was inversely proportional to the thermal anomaly. These results suggest that the thermal anomalies caused by the El Nino in the South Atlantic might trigger migration behaviour in the study species, providing a large aggregation during that period in Guaiba island.

AB  - The invasion of the land was a complex, protracted process, punctuated by mass extinctions, that involved multiple routes from marine environments. We integrate paleobiology, ichnology, sedimentology, and geomorphology to reconstruct Paleozoic terrestrialization. Cambrian landscapes were dominated by laterally mobile rivers with unstable banks in the absence of significant vegetation. Temporary incursions by arthropods and worm-like organisms into coastal environments apparently did not result in establishment of continental communities. Contemporaneous lacustrine faunas may have been inhibited by limited nutrient delivery and high sediment loads. The Ordovician appearance of early land plants triggered a shift in the primary locus of the global clay mineral factory, increasing the amount of mudrock on the continents. The Silurian-Devonian rise of vascular land plants, including the first forests and extensive root systems, was instrumental in further retaining fine sediment on alluvial plains. These innovations led to increased architectural complexity of braided and meandering rivers. Landscape changes were synchronous with establishment of freshwater and terrestrial arthropod faunas in overbank areas, abandoned fluvial channels, lake margins, ephemeral lakes, and inland deserts. Silurian-Devonian lakes experienced improved nutrient availability, due to increased phosphate weathering and terrestrial humic matter. All these changes favoured frequent invasions to permament establishment of jawless and jawed fishes in freshwater habitats and the subsequent tetrapod colonization of the land. The Carboniferous saw rapid diversification of tetrapods, mostly linked to aquatic reproduction, and land plants, including gymnosperms. Deeper root systems promoted further riverbank stabilization, contributing to the rise of anabranching rivers and braided systems with vegetated islands. New lineages of aquatic insects developed and expanded novel feeding modes, including herbivory. Late Paleozoic soils commonly contain pervasive root and millipede traces. Lacustrine animal communities diversified, accompanied by increased food-web complexity and improved food delivery which may have favored permanent colonization of offshore and deep-water lake environments. These trends continued in the Permian, but progressive aridification favored formation of hypersaline lakes, which were stressful for colonization. The Capitanian and end-Permian extinctions affected lacustrine and fluvial biotas, particularly the invertebrate infauna, although burrowing may have allowed some tetrapods to survive associated global warming and increased aridification.

AB  - Certain plant species have traits adapted for seed dispersal by megafauna, which may be absent in their current ranges. Characterizing the dispersal mechanism of such plant species can provide insights about their population dynamics and regeneration. We investigated the effectiveness of the extant fauna as seed dispersers of the Malagasy baobab, Adansonia grandidieri, which have megafaunal dispersal traits. We documented the animal species that interact with its fruits and seeds in the canopy and on the ground through direct observations, camera trapping, opportunistic search of feces with seeds, and dispersal experiments. We also estimated seed fate using a model parameterized with data obtained through experiments on seed removal and seed germination under and away from adult A. grandidieri trees. Further, we examined the impacts of seed dispersal in mitigating herbivore pressures on A. grandidieri seedling through an exclosure experiment. We did not find animals interacting with fruits in the canopy. However, we observed a native rodent species, Eliurus myoxinus, handling fruits/seeds on the ground, and found seeds in bush pig feces. Also, while the rates of germination for the dispersed A. grandidieri seeds were low, their probability of producing viable seedlings was higher than when the seeds stayed under adult trees. We also found that the seedlings of A. grandidieri had a high probability of surviving even when herbivores were present. Overall, our results provide insights into the regeneration of A. grandidieri and suggest that some extant local ground-dwelling fauna can provide seed dispersal services to this species.Abstract in Malagasy is available with online material.
   Misy ireo hazo manana voa sy vihy lehibe ka ireo biby lehibe ihany, izay efa lany tamingana amin'izao fotoana, no afaka manaparitaka ny vihin'izy ireo. Zava-dehibe ny fahafantaran'ny fomba hanaparitahan'ireo hazo ny vihin'ny mba hanomezana vahaol & agrave;na ho an'ny famerenana ny ala. Anisan'izany ohatra ny renala, fantatra amin'ny anarana siantifika hoe Adansonia grandidieri, baobaba tsy hita amin'ny toerana voajanahary raha tsy eto Madagasikaraka ihany. Mifandraika indrindra amin'ireo karazana voa tokony aparitaky ny biby lehibe izay efa lany tamingana teto Madagasikara ny voany noho izy ireo lehibe no sady misy hodiny mafy izay mety ho sarotra amin'ny ankabeazan'ny biby mpihinam-boa ankehitriny ny manokatra azy. Tsy fantatra anefa ny fahafahan'io karazan-kazo io mivelona raha tsy eo intsony ireo biby mpanaparitaka ny vihiny. Tsy fantatra mazava ihany koa ny anjara asan'ireo biby izay mbola misy ankehitriny amin'ny fanapariahana ireo vihin'ny renala. Nanao fikarohana mahakasika ireo fomba fanaparitahana vihy misy ankehitriny izay mety hanampy amin'ny fitsirian'io baobaba Malagasy io izahay tany Andranomena sy Andranopasy (faritra Menabe, andrefan'i Madagasikara). Nijery mivantana ireo biby mety hihinana ny voa sy hanaparitaka ny vihy izahay nandritra ny 71 andro ny volana Novambra 2021 ka hatramin'ny volana Febroary 2022. Nanatanteraka ihany koa andrana mahakasika ny fitsimohan'ny vihin-drenala ihany koa izahay. Ny valin'ny fikarohana dia naneho fa tsy nisy biby hita nikasika ireo voa sy vihy teny ambony hazo; fa ny karazam-boalavo antsoina amin'ny anarana siantifika hoe Eliurus myoxinus (na sokitralina) kosa no hita nikitika ny voa sy vihy teo amin'ny tany. Midika izany fa mety manana anjara asa amin'ny fanaparitaham-bihy io karazam-boalavo io. Hita ihany koa fa ambony ny tahan'ny fitsimohan'ireo vihy eo ambanin'ny foto-kazon-drenala fa rehefa avy mitsimoka ny vihy dia ambany ny taham-pahaveloman'ireo zana-kazo ireo. Ireto voka-pikarohana ireto dia mampiseho fa ny fanaparitahana vihin'ny renala lavitry ny fotony dia mety mampiakatra kokoa ny taham-pahavelomany ary mety handray anjara amin'ny fanaparitahan'ny vihy ireo biby kely tahaka ireo voalovo. Mila fikarohana hafa anefa izany mba ahitana marina ny anjara asan'izy ireo amin'ny fanaparitahana ny vihin'ny renala ka manampy azy amin'ny fahavelomany.

AB  - Domestic livestock grazing has caused dramatic changes in plant community composition across the globe. However, the response of plant species abundance in communities subject to grazing has not often been investigated through a functional lens, especially for belowground traits. Grazing directly impacts aboveground plant tissues, but the relationships between above- and belowground traits, and their influence on species abundance are also not well known. We collected plant trait and species relative abundance data in the grazed and nongrazed meadow plant communities in a species-rich subalpine ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We measured three aboveground traits (leaf photosynthesis rate, specific leaf area, and maximum height) and five belowground traits (root average diameter, root biomass, specific root length, root tissue density, and specific root area). We tested for shifts in the relationship between species relative abundance and among all measured traits under grazing compared with the nongrazed meadow. We also compared the power of above- and belowground traits to predict species relative abundance. We observed a significant shift from a resource conservation strategy to a resource acquisition strategy. Moreover, this resource conservation versus resource acquisition trade-off can also determine species relative abundance in the grazed and nongrazed plant communities. Specifically, abundant species in the nongrazed meadow had aboveground and belowground traits that are associated with high resource conservation, whereas aboveground and belowground traits that are correlated with high resource acquisition determined species relative abundance in the grazed meadow. However, belowground traits were found to explain more variances in species relative abundance than aboveground traits in the nongrazed meadow, while aboveground and belowground traits had comparable predictive power in the grazed meadow. We show that species relative abundance in both the grazed and the nongrazed meadows can be predicted by both aboveground traits and belowground traits associated with a resource acquisition versus conservation trade-off. More importantly, we show that belowground traits have higher predictive power of species relative abundance than aboveground traits in the nongrazed meadow, whereas in the grazed meadows, above- and belowground traits had comparable high predictive power.

AB  - The blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus; Burchell, 1823) is an African ungulate that is notoriously difficult to hand-rear and reintegrate into managed herds. The following case report is of a female wildebeest neonate that was orphaned, bottle-reared, and successfully reintroduced into a herd at a zoological facility. Since blue wildebeests are a highly precocial and herd-oriented species that calve synchronously in the wild as a reproductive strategy to maximize survival, early release of assist-reared neonates into managed herds before weaning may be an effective strategy for increasing the chance of acceptance. Wildebeest calves can also be easily trained for bottle-feedings in the field to facilitate early release. Due to a lack of literature on the assisted rearing and reintegration of wildebeest calves into managed herds, this case report provides useful techniques for the feeding, training, and releasing of bottle-reared wildebeests that may also be applicable to other assist-reared herd species at zoological facilities.

AB  - Aquatic organisms that consume resources from riparian vegetation or floodplain forests act as trophic links between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For instance, the pacu Piaractus mesopotamicus (Holmberg 1887), which is a migratory fish species, can play an important role in this interaction on Neotropical floodplains. We compared the stomach content of individuals from this species between two different parts of a large river floodplain during contrasting hydrological seasons to quantify the spatiotemporal contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous resources in their diet. Moreover, we performed a bipartite network approach to evaluate the sensitivity of these populations to a simulated loss of food resources through the potential deforestation of riparian vegetation. We found that in the upper catchment, individuals fed mainly on allochthonous items, but their identity depended on the season: fruits were the most abundant resource during the wet season, whereas leaves were more consumed during the dry season. In the lower catchment, the contribution of allochthonous resources was slightly lower in the dry season than in the wet season, when the pacu was able to explore the floodplain. Finally, the results from our consumer-resource network model indicated that this system is vulnerable to riparian deforestation since P. mesopotamicus is highly dependent on input from the riparian vegetation items to its feed.

AB  - Coastal urbanization has significantly degraded coral reef habitats worldwide, often driving shifts from coral to algal dominance. Quantifying fish herbivory, a key ecological process mitigating such transitions, is essential for understanding reef health, functioning, and resilience. This study examined herbivory rates (bites multiplied by fish biomass) across five fish functional groups (detritivores, croppers, browsers, scrapers, and excavators) in relation to coral reef conditions along a gradient of urban influence in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. Herbivory rates generally increased from inshore to offshore sites, with notable differences among functional groups. Cropper and scraper herbivory varied significantly across sites, while detritivore and excavator rates were consistent. Browser herbivory was only observed at the most offshore site, highlighting potential vulnerability of the browsing function near urban centers. Environmental factors influenced herbivory rates in distinct ways. Detritivore herbivory was higher on reefs with lower rugosity, likely due to increased sediment accumulation on flatter substrates. Herbivory rates of all herbivorous fish, and of croppers, scrapers and excavators individually, were strongly correlated with the organic matter content of turf algae sediments, underscoring the importance of food quality in shaping herbivory dynamics. Experimental manipulation of turf algae sediments (clearing vs. control) did not affect herbivory rates, suggesting that the effects of sediment accumulation are not the main driver of herbivory patterns at the studied sites. Preserving functional and taxonomic diversity among herbivorous fish is critical for maintaining reef resilience amidst increasing urbanization and local stressors.

AB  - Sustainable livestock management plays a crucial role in food production, climate change mitigation, and cultural preservation. Our study aimed to identify and analyse the diversity of social-ecological conditions that characterize extensive livestock systems in southern Patagonia. We integrated data collected from interviews and secondary sources and analysed data using hierarchical cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling to identify distinct ranching types. A qualitative analysis of key informant interviews identified key social-ecological changes for each type. The results emphasize the impact of administration, production, and biophysical factors on shaping different livestock ranching schemes. Further, we identified three significant social-ecological changes driving the dynamics of these systems, including shifts from (1) sheep to cattle ranching, (2) domestic to feral cattle ranching, and (3) landowners to tenant land managers. These findings have implications for policymakers seeking to develop strategies tailored to diverse realities, ensuring the sustainability of livestock systems in Tierra del Fuego.

AB  - The largest herbivore species are declining across the world, threatening the structure and function of ecosystems. While the effects of megaherbivores (herbivores with a body mass over 1000 kg) on vegetation structure and composition have been studied extensively, megaherbivores may also influence other taxa, including smaller herbivores with which they share dietary overlap. In African savannas, megaherbivores, particularly African elephants Loxodonta africana, may influence mesoherbivores in two different ways: 1) indirectly through changes in vegetation structure that shape forage availability and predation risk, and 2) directly through their presence, which may elicit fear responses due to a risk of antagonistic interactions from these dominant competitors. However, these mechanisms have yet to be isolated, and thus their relative impact on mesoherbivores is unknown. We conducted a field experiment to test the effects of both of these mechanisms on mesoherbivore activity by emulating elephant-induced habitat alterations and behavioral cues (vocalizations) related to their presence in a savanna in Mlawula Nature Reserve, Eswatini, a protected area where elephants are absent. We found that, overall, mesoherbivores limited their activity in areas with either type of elephant impact. However, individual species exhibited large variation in the magnitude and direction of their responses to elephant impacts, with smaller species typically exhibiting stronger avoidance of elephant-impacted areas. Furthermore, combination of both types of elephant impacts tended to influence mesoherbivores more strongly than habitat alterations or vocalizations alone, emphasizing the complex roles that megaherbivores play in these communities. These results provide new insights into the consequences of megaherbivore loss, an issue of high conservation concern, and can inform efforts to restore megaherbivores' roles in savannas. Such efforts could include both recreating the impacts of elephants on vegetation structure and behavioral cues like vocalizations to move mesoherbivores around the landscape, potentially altering the effects of herbivory on savanna vegetation.

AB  - Millions of wild animals are killed annually on roads worldwide. During spring 2020, the volume of road traffic was reduced globally as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We gathered data on wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) from Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Israel, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and for Scotland and England within the United Kingdom. In all studied countries WVC statistics tend to be dominated by large mammals (various deer species and wild boar), while information on smaller mammals as well as birds are less well recorded. The expected number of WVC for 2020 was predicted on the basis of 2015-2019 WVC time series representing expected WVC numbers under normal traffic conditions. Then, the forecasted and reported WVC data were compared.
   The results indicate varying levels of WVC decrease between countries during the COVID-19 related traffic flow reduction (CRTR). While no significant change was determined in Sweden, where the state-wide response to COVID-19 was the least intensive, a decrease as marked as 37.4% was identified in Estonia. The greatest WVC decrease, more than 40%, was determined during the first weeks of CRTR for Estonia, Spain, Israel, and Czechia.
   Measures taken during spring 2020 allowed the survival of large numbers of wild animals which would have been killed under normal traffic conditions. The significant effects of even just a few weeks of reduced traffic, help to highlight the negative impacts of roads on wildlife mortality and the need to boost global efforts of wildlife conservation, including systematic gathering of roadkill data.

AB  - The zai cropping system that involves precision manure placement in small excavated soil pits is designed to restore the productivity of encrusted and degraded soils of the Sahel. However, there is little information on the effectiveness of zai cropping to improve soil quality, particularly as to how it relates to manure sources. Therefore, our objective was to determine the effect of manure type on plant nutrient availability and soil microbial activity in relation to crop productivity. The experiment had a randomized block design with the following treatments with all manure amendments applied at 6 Mg ha(-1): 1) sheep (Ovis aries), 2) goats (Capra hircus), and 3) cattle (Bos indicus) manures; 4) an equal mix of all three manures; and 5) a control with no manure amendment - after which sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) was planted. Soil samples (0-20 cm) were taken from zai pits at the sorghum boot stage and analyzed for a suite of plant-available nutrients, microbial composition, and enzyme activities. The results showed that the zai system with manure amendments significantly increased soil pH, plant-available nitrogen by three-fold, and phosphorus by two-fold over the control. Goat or mixed manure amended soils had significantly higher enzyme activities than sheep or cattle manure. Manure type also shifted the EL-FAME biomarkers for bacteria, fungi, and protozoa indicating a more favorable copiotrophic environment in manure amended soils. zai cropping systems amended with the higher quality or the mixed manure had greater microbial responses, nutrient availability, and crop productivity than the lower quality manure.

AB  - Species-to-species and species-to-environment interactions are key drivers of community dynamics. Disentangling these drivers in species-rich assemblages is challenging due to the high number of potentially interacting species (the 'curse of dimensionality'). We develop a process-based model that quantifies how intraspecific and interspecific interactions, and species' covarying responses to environmental fluctuations, jointly drive community dynamics. We fit the model to reef fish abundance time series from 41 reefs of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We found that fluctuating relative abundances are driven by species' heterogenous responses to environmental fluctuations, whereas interspecific interactions are negligible. Species differences in long-term average abundances are driven by interspecific variation in the magnitudes of both conspecific density-dependence and density-independent growth rates. This study introduces a novel approach to overcoming the curse of dimensionality, which reveals highly individualistic dynamics in coral reef fish communities that imply a high level of niche structure.

AB  - Yak herding is one of the oldest market-based traditions, which is part of an integrated social-ecological system. But, it is at risk of extinction as yak herders are gradually shifting towards alternative occupations. The discontinuation of herding may have several implications such as loss of culture and degradation of the rangeland ecosystem. Though yak herding is not limited to the financial aspect of herding, this is considered a main cause of the discontinuation. Therefore, it is important to understand the economics of yak herding. A benefit-cost analysis of yak herding was carried out based on the interviews with 60 yak herders in the Kanchenjunga landscape, Nepal. The results indicate that yak herding is not financially attractive. High mortality of calves and adults is threatening this occupation, and degrading rangelands are increasing the costs. Yak herding generates substantial amount of social and ecological benefits in terms of preserving culture, maintaining rangeland ecosystems and curbing illegal activities. If these benefits are included, then the benefit-cost ratio and internal rate of return would be 1.32 and 10.44 respectively. Since yak herding generates low direct profits and requires herders to stay in remote areas, there is a high risk of discontinuation of this profession by successive generations of youth. This study suggests to improve rangeland management through prescribed burning and provisioning of health services, particularly in summer pastures and incentivize yak herders for generating positive externalities.

AB  - Kiwifruit, Actinidia spp., is an important crop worldwide and its cultivation has been increasing in Portugal. Kiwifruit plants are susceptible to plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs), including Meloidogyne spp. M. hapla and M. incognita have been reported to affect kiwifruit in major production regions worldwide, although information is lacking on the distribution and identity of PPNs associated with kiwifruit orchards in Portugal. Moreover, research is scarce on the drivers of PPN communities in this crop. Our primary objective was to investigate the diversity, density and distribution of PPNs within kiwifruit orchards of Portugal and to elucidate the influence of environmental factors on their community composition. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate population densities and identity of Meloidogyne spp. Nematodes were extracted from composite soil and root samples collected from orchards. Analysis of soil nematode communities suggested bacterial-driven decomposition and high nutrient enrichment in these soils. Sixteen different genera of PPNs were detected, with Meloidogyne spp. as the dominant genus, mostly represented by a single species, M. hapla. PPN communities exhibited low richness, and beta-diversity analysis indicated a high degree of similarity among them. Additionally, their composition was significantly influenced by soil and climatic parameters. We found that 37 out of 40 kiwifruit orchards in Portugal were infested by root-knot nematodes. The unexpectedly low species diversity, dominated by M. hapla, merits further research to establish underlying factors for its high incidence in this crop and to assess the impact of these nematodes on kiwifruit performance and productivity.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions are a widespread phenomenon that are influenced by species behavior, abundance, and road and landscape interactions. The mortality rate of different age and sex classes can buffer or exacerbate how the population responds to vehicle collisions. We evaluated the demographic-specific patterns of elk-vehicle collisions in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains. More females and adults were involved in collisions, but when compared to the sex and age of the population, males and subadults were more prone to collisions in the fall. The fat marrow content (condition) of elk was greater for road- and rail-kill than predator-killed elk indicating that vehicle collisions are an additive source of mortality. As traffic volumes increased elk collisions decreased because elk declined over the study period. Evaluation of long-term datasets can assist in designing mitigation that target the most vulnerable demographics of a population. For example, larger more open wildlife crossing structures have shown to be more suitable for vulnerable demographics such as female grizzly bears, male ungulates, and female ungulates traveling with young. When crossing structures are not practical, demographic-specific information can inform outreach and awareness programs that strive to elicit a favorable response from motorists ultimately avoiding collisions with animals on roads.

AB  - Simple Summary The mangrove ecosystem is an important resource for the survival of thousands of species of animals and plants. It has high ecological and economic value and has made great contributions to the protection and maintenance of marine and terrestrial ecological environment. However, due to climatic and human factors, the mangrove ecosystem has been destroyed and its ecological functions have been damaged. As an important indicator species, fishes have also been affected, with changes in their population and nutritional structure. This study summarized the mangrove fish in China and compiled a relatively complete list of mangrove fish. In addition, the biogeographic characteristics of Chinese mangrove fish were analyzed, filling the gap of national mangrove fish distribution data. Completion of this study contributed to a better understanding of the role of mangroves in maintaining the stability and diversity of fish communities, which was of great value for the management and conservation of regional and global biodiversity. Mangroves are among the most productive marine and coastal ecosystems and play an important role in maintaining the stability and diversity of fish communities. To explore the structure of mangrove fish communities in China, we compiled previous studies, monographs, and two databases on 54 mangrove areas published in the past 30 years. Mangrove fish communities in China comprised Osteichthys (597 species) and Chondrichthyes (14 species), representing 611 species in 344 genera, 117 families, and 28 orders. Perciformes were the predominant taxon, with 350 species in 52 families, accounting for 57% of the total species richness. Reef fish accounted for 29.62%. With regard to feeding groups, there were 328 carnivorous species (53.68%), 214 omnivorous species (35.02%), 41 herbivorous species (6.71%), and 28 detritivores species (4.58%). Classified by body size, 57.61% were small-sized, 24.22% medium-sized, and 18.17% were large-sized fishes. A total of 5.23% (32 species) of these mangrove fish are currently on IUCN red lists, i.e., 2 species are critically endangered, 4 are endangered, 12 are vulnerable, and 14 are near threatened. Cluster analyses shows that Chinese mangroves fish were divided into two categories, i.e., coastal mangrove and island mangrove type. This is closely related to the distribution of reef fish. Moreover, the number of fish species showed a strong positive correlation with mangrove area, but not with latitude. The main reasons may be the subtropical and tropical geographic locations, as well as the characteristics of the South China Sea and the Taiwan Warm Current. The size and integrity of mangrove area are crucial to the local ecosystems; thus, protecting and restoring mangroves is of great significance to large-scale ecosystem-stability and local biodiversity.

AB  - The diversity of plant water use patterns among species and ecosystems is a matter of widespread debate. In this study, Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis, CP) and Mongolian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, MP), which is co-exist in the shelterbelt plantations in the Horqin Sandyland in northern China, were chosen for comparison of water use traits by monitoring xylem sap flow alongside recordings of the associated environmental factors over four growing seasons. Continuous sap flux density measurements were converted into crown projected area transpiration intensity (T-r) and canopy stomatal conductance (G(s)). The results indicated that MP showed a higher canopy transpiration intensity than in CP, with T-r daily means (+/- standard deviation) of 0.84 +/- 0.36 and 0.79 +/- 0.43 mm.d(-1), respectively (p = 0.07). However, the inter-annual variability of daily T-r in MP was not significant, varying only approximately a 1.1-fold (p = 0.29), while inter-annual variation was significant for CP, with 1.24-fold variation (p < 0.01). In particular, the daily mean T-r value for CP was approximately 1.7-times higher than that of MP under favorable soil moisture conditions, with values for relative extractable soil water within the 0-1.0 m soil layer (REW) being above 0.4. However, as the soil dried out, the value of T-r for CP decreased more sharply, falling to only approximately 0.5-times the value for MP when REW fell to < 0.2. The stronger sensitivity of T-r and/or G(s) to REW, together with the more sensitive response of G(s) to VPD in CP, confirms that CP exhibits less conservation of soil water utilization but features a stronger ability to regulate water use. Compared with MP, CP can better adapt to the dry conditions associated with climate change.

AB  - In the marine environment, fish contribute to key ecological processes such as controlling food-webs through top-down impacts, especially on algae. To date, the assessment of fish grazing activity has mostly been performed using short-term (<1 h) censuses by divers or remote cameras which do not allow estimating the variability of grazing rate within and between days. However, understanding the temporal variation of fish activity and hence contribution of species to ecosystem functioning is of particular interest in the context of biological invasion. Here, using long-duration remote underwater cameras, we recorded fish abundance and grazing events over three consecutive days in October 2019 in a shallow Mediterranean ecosystem from northern Crete. This novel approach allowed us to assess temporal variation of abundance and grazing activity of the two native (Sarpa salpa and Sparisoma cretense) and the two non-indigenous fish species (Siganus rivulatus and Siganus luridus). Nonindigenous Siganus rivulatus was the most common species in the studied coastal habitat, followed by the two native species while the non-indigenous Siganus luridus was scarce. Overall, the non-indigenous S. rivulatus and the native S. salpa are responsible for more than 90% of the recorded grazing activity with similar bite rates between the two species. More than 70% of the grazing activity arose in grazing pulses in the afternoon, supporting the diel feeding hypothesis according to which feeding is greater in the afternoon when nutritive quality of macrophytes is the highest. In addition, some of the highest peaks in grazing activity were driven by a few individuals. Hence, surveys of only abundance could not provide accurate estimates of herbivory. Last, Siganus rivulatus presence did not significantly affect grazing activity of the native Sarpa salpa. Our results demonstrate that long-duration remote underwater videos are a useful tool to accurately assess the contribution of fishes to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Wolves (Canis lupus), a once widely distributed species, were systematically removed from many temperate zone ecosystems due to conflicts with humans. A change in human attitudes and cultural norms has brought about a recovery in some suitable areas, yet reintroductions are still controversial. Two notable reintroduction areas in the United States were Yellowstone and Isle Royale National Parks. Both proposals caused polarization and debate. In Yellowstone opposition focused on outside the park effects, mainly wolves killing livestock and wild game also desired by human hunters. At Isle Royale, opposition was mostly about human interventions into nature and impairment of wilderness values contrary to the spirit of 1964 Wilderness Act. Both locations had periods in the 20th century with and without wolves and the presence of wolves had a dampening effect on ungulate population fluctuations. Most outcomes of reintroduction at Yellowstone were predicted as the Environmental Impact Statement written beforehand correctly predicted 78% of the 51 outcomes that were examined. Wolves were too recently reintroduced to Isle Royale to make similar comparisons, but we conclude that intervention is not contrary to the Wilderness Act, nor author Howard Zahniser's vision, partially because wolf reintroduction was a mitigation for human actions. Also, not intervening, or inaction, often perceived as safer, would have had more damaging impacts to ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Pyric herbivory, the combination of controlled burning and targeted grazing, is an effective strategy for restoring abandoned, shrub-encroached rangelands to open ecosystems. This practice may impact soil nitrogen pools by altering soil nitrification and denitrification rates, and may lead to an increase of nitrogen losses through nitrate leaching and N-gas emissions. This research, located in the south-western Pyrenees, investigated the effects of pyric herbivory on soil nitrification and denitrification potentials and mineral nitrogen content in a gorseencroached temperate rangeland six months after the burning was implemented. The study included three treatments: high-severity burning plus grazing, low-severity burning plus grazing, and unburned and ungrazed areas (control). We measured soil nitrification and denitrification potentials (net and gross), the limitation of denitrifiers by nitrogen or organic carbon, and the abundance of nitrite- and nitrous oxide-reducing bacteria. Additional soil and vegetation data complemented these measurements. Results showed that pyric herbivory did not significantly affect nitrification potential, which was low and highly variable. However, it decreased gross denitrification potential and nitrous oxide reduction to dinitrogen in high-severely burned areas compared to the control. Denitrification rates directly correlated with microbial biomass nitrogen, soil organic carbon, soil water content and abundance of nirS-harbouring bacteria. Contrary to the expected, soil nitrate availability did not directly influence denitrification despite being highest in burned areas. Overall, the study suggests that pyric herbivory does not significantly affect mid-term nitrification rates in temperate open ecosystems, but may decrease denitrification rates in intensely burned areas. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the potential impacts of land management practices, such as pyric herbivory, on soil nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened by multiple stressors that have driven a decline in the cover of reef-building coral species, resulting in a loss of reef structure and function. Restoration reef science provides useful conservation tools to preserve and restore the key species and ecological functions of these ecosystems. However, gaps remain in restoration at large scales. This study provides a guide of how to invest and apply innovative solutions and immediate action strategies from the tourism-hotel sector in alliance with academia and key stakeholders, through the development and implementation of a multi-species restoration program at two sites in the Mexican Caribbean: Manchoncitos Reef, Riviera Maya and La Francesita Reef, Cozumel. We have identified effective propagation and outplanting techniques for key critically endangered species, as well as genotypes resistant to temperature stress and Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD), based on pre-restoration nursery trials. We include a comparative analysis over time (2020-2022) showing increased coral cover, structural complexity and fish biomass. Baseline assessment of the study areas will allow adaptation of repopulation techniques not only for hard corals, but also to advance in the comprehensive restoration of the ecosystem, incorporating new elements to the reef, such as fish, crab or sea urchin post larvae. These organisms could accelerate herbivory functions and in turn could improve the natural processes of the coral reefs. Our results improve the understanding of the use of restoration as a tool for climate change adaptation led by the private sector.

AB  - Dung beetles provide important ecosystem functions in semiarid environments, improving the physiochemical characteristics of the soil through tunnelling and burying nutrient-rich dung. In sub-Saharan Africa, diverse indigenous mammal communities support highly abundant dung beetle populations in savannah ecosystems. However, the conversion of landscapes to livestock agriculture may result in changes in the abundance and diversity of wild mammal species. This is likely to have significant impacts on dung beetle communities, particularly because domestic livestock dung may be contaminated with toxic residues of veterinary parasiticides. The environmental impact is likely to be affected by the degree of niche overlap between the beetle communities that colonize cattle dung and those that colonize the dung of wild mammals. We compared dung beetle communities between a pristine national park habitat dominated by large wild herbivores, and a pastoral farming community dominated by domestic livestock. Diurnal dung beetles were attracted to cattle dung in greater abundance and diversity compared to elephant, zebra or giraffe dung. Nocturnal/crepuscular dung beetles were attracted to non-ruminant dung (elephant and zebra) in higher abundance compared to ruminant dung (cattle and giraffe). Although there were no clear trophic specializations, three diurnal species showed an association with cattle dung, whereas eight nocturnal/crepuscular species showed an association with non-ruminant (elephant and zebra) dung. Diurnal species may be at greater risk from the toxic effects of residues of veterinary parasiticides in domestic livestock dung. Although many species showed trophic associations with wild herbivore dung, these beetles can utilize a wide range of dung and will readily colonize cattle dung in the absence of other options. As more land is converted to livestock agriculture, the contamination of dung with toxic residues from veterinary parasiticides could therefore negatively impact the majority of dung beetle species.

The qualities of these plants of bearing harsh environmental conditions makes it prime focus for native fodder plants for Arabian tahr and the priority plants for the Higher authorities in Fujairah.Methods: The following study has assessed the comparative nutritional values of Acacia tortilis and Acacia ehrenbergiana. The analyses have been determined by international standard procedures using Gravimetry, Soxhlet extraction, HPLC, and ICP-OES(AOAC 962.09, AOAC 941.12). The vegetation mapping for the blooming period has been done by NVDI using data from Sentinel-2 satellite. The statistics of agricultural and non-agriculture areas in kilometer square (km2) have been found to confirm the findings of the NDVI using the satellite images.Results: The study has highlighted the importance of these native plants as a fodder plant for Arabian tahr as potential source of potassium, calcium, and magnesium and phosphorus. Furthermore, the native plant's mapping showed Emirates of Fujairah's vegetation during March to May 2022. Conclusion: Results shows that the A. ehrenbergiana is comparatively healthier diet for Arabian Tahr than Acacia tortilis. Tahr can get on average 400 mg/100g of four important minerals including K, Ca, P and Mg while Acacia tortilis could provide 174 mg/100g. Moreover, the native plant's vegetation mapping can work as blueprint and will help identify plant dispersion and expansion planning.

AB  - Small semi-fossorial herbivores can affect plant aboveground biomass (AGB) in grasslands and possibly alter the allocation of AGB and belowground biomass (BGB). In this study, plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) was used to investigate such effects at three alpine meadow sites on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, where pairs of disturbed vs. undisturbed plots were randomly selected and sampled. We also explored the relationships between soil properties and BGB/AGB across the plots in the presence and absence of plateau pikas, respectively. We found that BGB and BGB/AGB were 11.40 and 8.20% lower in the presence of plateau pikas than in their absence, respectively. We also found that the BGB/AGB was positively related to soil moisture and soil total nitrogen (STN) in the absence of plateau pikas. In contrast, BGB/AGB was positively related to STN, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil carbon/nitrogen (C/N), and soil total phosphorus in the presence of plateau pikas. These factors indicated plateau pika disturbance increased AGB allocation. The relationship between AGB and BGB of alpine meadow plants to soil variables was also different between sites with and without plateau pika disturbance. In conclusion, small semi-fossorial herbivore disturbance is likely to alter grassland carbon stock and should be well controlled for sustainable conservation and management of alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The causes of Sahul's megafauna extinctions remain uncertain, although several interacting factors were likely responsible. To examine the relative support for hypotheses regarding plausible ecological mechanisms underlying these extinctions, we constructed the first stochastic, age-structured models for 13 extinct megafauna species from five functional/taxonomic groups, as well as 8 extant species within these groups for comparison. Perturbing specific demographic rates individually, we tested which species were more demographically susceptible to extinction, and then compared these relative sensitivities to the fossil-derived extinction chronology. Our models show that the macropodiformes were the least demographically susceptible to extinction, followed by carnivores, monotremes, vombatiform herbivores, and large birds. Five of the eight extant species were as or more susceptible than the extinct species. There was no clear relationship between extinction susceptibility and the extinction chronology for any perturbation scenario, while body mass and generation length explained much of the variation in relative risk. Our results reveal that the actual mechanisms leading to the observed extinction chronology were unlikely related to variation in demographic susceptibility per se, but were possibly driven instead by finer-scale variation in climate change and/or human prey choice and relative hunting success.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration have been determined to independently affect soil nematodes, a key component of soil biota. However, little is known about the long-term effects of these two global change factors and their interactive effects. Over three consecutive years, we cultivated invasive alien plant Xanthium strumarium and its two phylogenetically related natives under both ambient (aCO2) and elevated (eCO2) atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and determined the effects of the invader and natives on soil nematodes under different CO2 concentrations and the relevant mechanism. The abundance of total soil nematodes and that of the dominant trophic group (herbivores) were significantly affected by plant species and CO2 concentration, and these effects were dependent on the experimental duration, however, the Shannon-diversity of nematodes was not affected by these factors. Under aCO2, both invasive and native species significantly increased the total nematode abundance and that of the dominant trophic group with increasing experimental duration, and the amplitude of the increase was greater under the invader relative to the natives. The eCO2 increased total nematode abundance (second year) and that of the dominant trophic group (third year) under the invader, but not under the natives (or even decreased) with increasing experimental duration. Root litter had greater effects on soil nematode abundance than leaf litter and root exudates did. This study indicates that eCO2 would aggravate effects of invasive plants on soil nematodes by increasing abundance, and these effects would vary with the duration.

AB  - Many animals change feeding habits as they progress through life stages, exploiting resources that vary in space and time. However, complex life histories may bring new risks if rapid environmental change disrupts the timing of these switches. Here, we use abundance times series for a diverse group of herbivorous insects, aphids, to search for trait and environmental characteristics associated with declines. Our meta dataset spanned three world regions and >300 aphid species, tracked at 75 individual sites for 10-50 years. Abundances were generally falling, with median changes of -8.3%, -5.6%, and -0.1% per year in the central USA, northwestern USA, and United Kingdom, respectively. Aphids that obligately alternated between host plants annually and those that were agricultural pests exhibited the steepest declines, relative to species able to persist on the same host plant year-round or those in natural areas. This suggests that host alternation might expose aphids to climate-induced phenology mismatches with one or more of their host plant species, with additional risks from exposure to insecticides and other management efforts. Warming temperatures through time were associated with milder aphid declines or even abundance increases, particularly at higher latitudes. Altogether, while a warming world appeared to benefit some aphid species in some places, most aphid species that had time-sensitive movements among multiple host plants seemed to face greater risk of decline. More generally, this suggests that recent human-induced rapid environmental change is rebalancing the risks and rewards associated with complex life histories.

AB  - Within-species, biodiversity can be organized in units, ranging from subspecies to evolutionarily significant units (ESUs), populations and social groups. To define ESUs, researchers often focus on the concordant distribution of traits that exhibit likely adaptive significance, including genetic and ecological variation. Caribou is a Species at Risk in Canada, and are conserved at the level of both subspecies and designatable units (DUs), which are conceptually similar to ESUs. However, the use of genomics has been suggested to provide better delineation of units that are based upon variation of genes-not just neutral genetic markers. Here, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 190 caribou belonging to two recognized subspecies and four DUs found throughout western Canada. We confirmed two major genetic clusters, which we refer to as the Northern Caribou and Southern Caribou, characterized by divergence at numerous SNPs and genes with known functions in other mammals. Notably, the distribution of these two clusters did not fully overlap with currently recognized subspecies. A discrepancy with current classification was detected for Mountain DUs, which were thought to belong to the Woodland subspecies, but with significant northern-type ecological traits described in the literature, indicating more work is needed to refine our understanding of this transitional zone. We also detected genetic signals of male-biased dispersal, which may be natural or affected by habitat fragmentation effects on females. This work illustrates the value of genomics in rethinking subspecies and conservation unit designations and better conserve biodiversity within terrestrial species at risk.

AB  - Malignant Catarhal Fever (MCF), caused by a virus transmitted from asymptomatic wildebeest, is a lethal disease in cattle that threatens livestock-based livelihoods and food security in many areas of Africa. Many herd owners reduce transmission risks by moving cattle away from infection hot-spots, but this imposes considerable economic burdens on their households. The advent of a partially-protective vaccine for cattle opens up new options for disease prevention. In a study of pastoral households in northern Tanzania, we use stated preference choice modelling to investigate how pastoralists would likely respond to the availability of such a vaccine. We show a high probability of likely vaccine uptake by herd owners, declining at higher vaccine costs. Acceptance increases with more efficaceous vaccines, in situations where vaccinated cattle are ear-tagged, and where vaccine is delivered through private vets. Through analysis of Normalized Density Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, we show that the reported MCF incidence over 5 years is highest in areas where the mean and interannual varibility in vegetative greeness is relatively low and where herds sizes are smaller. Trends towards lower rainfall and greater landscape-level constraints on cattle movement suggest that MCF avoidance through traditional movement away from wildebeest will become more challenging and that demand for an MCF vaccine will likely increase.

AB  - Although winter in the temperate zone is considered to be the period of arthropod quiescence, some pests and their natural enemies remain active and interact in simplified food-webs. Limited information exists about the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up processes regulating arthropod food-webs and their spatio-temporal dynamics during winter. This information is essential for the development of effective conservation biocontrol methods. We investigated how the pest management of pear orchards (integrated [IPM] vs organic) and tree location within orchards (margin vs centre) influence the association between densities of winter-active spiders, insect herbivores and winter-inactive predators (spiders, insects) from October to April. We installed carboard bands on trunks and branches of pear trees in four organic and four IPM orchards to collect bark -dwelling arthropods. We then modelled relationships between the densities of four functional arthropod groups, namely winter-active spiders, winter-inactive spiders, winter-inactive insect predators, and herbivores. In early winter, we found a hump-shaped relationship between the densities of winter-active spiders and her-bivores. This agrees with the top-down model of the ecosystem exploitation hypothesis, predicting that predators are first bottom-up limited, then accumulate with prey densities, and exert top-down control when they become sufficiently abundant. The densities of herbivores strongly declined during winter, a phenomenon which may be partly, along with other causes of natural mortality, attributable to predation by winter active spiders. The as-sociation between winter-active spiders and winter-inactive arthropod predators switched from positive to none in organic orchards or even to a negative association in IPM orchards. Negative intraguild interactions seem to be intensified due to the declining availability of alternative prey. Overall, the investigated food-webs seem to be mostly top-down regulated during winter, and IPM seems to intensify intraguild interactions.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Viscum album L. (Mistletoe) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Viscum album is a widespread obligate hemiparasite on a wide range of angiosperm and gymnosperm trees. Once thought to take just water and nutrients from its host via a haustorium, it is now suggested to also take carbon. Heavy infestations can reduce host vitality through prolific water use and carbon removal. Flowers are highly reduced but are primarily pollinated by flies, ants and bees. Seeds are dispersed by birds. Removal of the epicarp is necessary for successful seedling establishment, and seeds have a sticky viscin coat, adhering it to the host bark. Vegetative spread also happens under the bark of its host resulting in densities of >700 Mistletoe plants per host. Viscum album is a lowland species, most frequent in open human-made habitats extending into woodlands in Europe. It has been widely planted for folklore use centred around Christmas. Despite conservation concerns following removal of Mistletoe-laden old orchards, the species is thriving and needs control in some areas. Viscotoxins and lectins in leaves and shoots have been widely used in herbal medicine and now potentially in complementary cancer therapy.

AB  - Omnivores are generally opportunistic foragers and have a flexible dietary response to resource abundance and availability. Their populations may consist of individuals that differ from each other in terms of their trophic positions, which implies that the dietary response to resource fluctuations differs within a population. We investigated how changes in the abundance of sika deer (Cervus nippon) affected dietary variation and body condition in the Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus). We used fecal analysis, nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15), and body measurements to determine whether the variation in dietary meat content of Asian black bears is positively related to variations in the density of the sika deer population, whether male bears have a higher trophic position compared to females, and whether dietary meat content is positively related with body mass or body condition of bears. We found a positive correlation between the occurrence of deer remains in bear feces and deer density, suggesting that bears change their diet in response to temporal changes in deer density. Male bears had higher delta N-15 values than females, and neither values varied when deer density decreased. Males selectively consumed deer after a reduction in deer density, whereas females consistently consumed more plant-based diet. The delta N-15 values were positively related with body mass of adult (>4 yr) bears but had no relationship with body condition of bears of either sex or any age class. Deer seem to be an important food source for large adult males, which have an advantage in mating. Thus, increasing herbivore abundance and availability altered the foraging strategy of Asian black bears, but the importance of herbivore on bear diet differs within a population.

AB  - BackgroundGrazing livestock emits methane through rumen intestinal activity, however, its impact on plant growth in grassland while grazing still has not been explored in detail. Therefore, the study examined the effects of methane pulse spray (MPS), according to grazing intensity, at four grazing intensities (0, 3.6, 5.0, and 6.5 sheep<middle dot>hm- 2 yr- 1) on seed germination and seedling growth of common vetch (Vicia sativa), while two irrigation rates (35 and 53 ml d- 1) were employed to simulate the precipitation.ResultsThe study revealed significant interactions between MPS and irrigation rate on seed germination and seedling growth parameters. Under moderate MPS intensities (0.74 and 1.04 mol m- 2), seed germination rate, potential, index, and vigor index improved, especially at higher irrigation rates (53 ml d- 1). Conversely, excessive MPS (1.33 mol m- 2) inhibited particularly at the germination rate and growth,. The seedling growth dynamics fitted a logistic model, with MPS advancing the rapid growth phase and increasing maximum growth rates.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that low to moderate levels of MPS from ruminants can promote seed germination and seedling growth of common vetch, while excessive MPS inhibits these processes. Irrigation enhances plant sensitivity to MPS, with wetter conditions (620 mm yr- 1) facilitating a more pronounced response. The findings introduce a new model elucidating plant responses to external perturbations, which can inform grazing management strategies in diverse ecosystems. In wetter regions, moderate grazing intensities may leverage MPS benefits, while arid regions require careful grazing regulation to maintain grassland-livestock balance.

AB  - Dramatic phenotypic differences between domestic pigs and wild boars (Sus scrofa) provide opportunities to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of complex traits, including morphology, physiology and behaviour. Most studies comparing domestic pigs and wild boars have focused on variations in DNA sequences and mRNA expression, but not on epigenetic changes. Here, we present a genome-wide comparative study on H3K27ac enhancer activities and the corresponding mRNA profiling in the brain and liver tissues of adult Bama Xiang pigs (BMXs) and Chinese wild boars (CWBs). We identified a total of 1,29,487 potential regulatory elements, among which 11,241 H3K27ac peaks showed differential activity between CWBs and BMXs in at least one tissue. These peaks were overrepresented by binding motifs of FOXA1, JunB, ATF3 and BATF, and overlapped with differentially expressed genes that are involved in female mating behaviour, response to growth factors and hormones, and lipid metabolism. We also identified 4118 nonredundant super-enhancers from ChIP-Seq data on H3K27ac. Notably, we identified differentially active peaks located close to or within candidate genes, including TBX19, MSTN, AHR and P2RY1, which were identified in DNA sequence-based population differentiation studies. This study generates a valuable dataset on H3K27ac profiles of the brain and liver from domestic pigs and wild boars, which helps gain insights into the changes in enhancer activities from wild boars to domestic pigs.

AB  - The allocation pattern of plant biomass presents the strategy of the plant community to adopt environmental changes, while the driver of biomass allocation is still unclear in degraded alpine grassland ecosystems. To explore the issue, this study investigated the shoot-to-root (R/S) ratio, plant aboveground traits, and root competition of three functional groups (i.e., grasses, sedges, and forbs) at three degradation levels (i.e., no obvious degradation, ND; moderate degradation, MD; and severe degradation, SD) in an alpine meadow in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The relationships among plant aboveground traits, root competition, and R/S ratio were tested using the structural equation model (SEM). The results showed that the shoot and root biomass tended to decrease, but the R/S ratio of the plant community did not change along the degradation gradient. Plant height, lateral spread, and leaf length of most plant functional groups reduced, while leaf width and leaf area of most plant functional groups did not change along the degradation gradients. The root competition ability (presented as the fraction of root biomass in total biomass) of sedges in MD was the lowest, while that of grasses was the highest. The effects of aboveground competition on the R/S ratio were non-linear because of the different roles of plant height, lateral spread, and leaf area in regulating the R/S ratio along the degradation gradient. In contrast, the effects of belowground competition on the R/S ratio were linear because belowground competition promoted the R/S ratio, and the strength of this effect reduced along the degradation gradient. These results indicate that plant competition might be a critical factor to maintain the high R/S ratio in degraded alpine meadows.

AB  - Proper management and genetic monitoring of the modern European bison (Bison bonasus) population is one of the most important responsibilities for this species' conservation. Up-to-date, complex genetic analysis performed using a consistent molecular method is needed for population management as a tool to further validate and maintain the genetic diversity of the species. The identification of the genetic line when pedigree data are missing, as well as the identification of parentage and individuals, are crucial for this purpose. The aim of our research was to create a small but informative panel of SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) markers that can be used for routine genotyping of the European bison at low cost. In our study, we used a custom-designed microarray to genotype a large number of European bison, totaling 455 samples from two genetic lines. The results of this analysis allowed us to select highly informative markers. In this paper, we present an effective single nucleotide polymorphism set, divided into separate panels to perform genetic analyses of European bison, which is needed for population monitoring and management. We proposed a total of 20 SNPs to detect hybridization with Bos taurus and Bison bison, a panel of 50 SNPs for individuals and parentage identification, as well as a panel of 30 SNPs for assessing membership of the genetic line. These panels can be used together or independently depending on the research goal and can be applied using various methods.

AB  - Background and Aims Not all plant-pollinator interactions are mutualistic, and in fact deceptive pollination systems are widespread in nature. The genus Arisaema has a pollination system known as lethal deceptive pollination, in which plants not only attract pollinating insects without providing any rewards, but also trap them until they die. Many Arisaema species are endangered from various disturbances, including reduction in forest habitat, modification of the forest understorey owing to increasing deer abundance, and plant theft for horticultural cultivation. We aimed to theoretically investigate how lethal deceptive pollination can be maintained from a demographic perspective and how plant and pollinator populations respond to different types of disturbance.Methods We developed and analysed a mathematical model to describe the population dynamics of a deceptive plant species and its victim pollinator. Calibrating the model based on empirical data, we assessed the conditions under which plants and pollinators could coexist, while manipulating relevant key parameters.Key Results The model exhibited qualitatively distinct behaviours depending on certain parameters. The plant becomes extinct when it has a low capability for vegetative reproduction and slow transition from male to female, and plant-insect co-extinction occurs especially when the plant is highly attractive to male insects. Increasing deer abundance has both positive and negative effects because of removal of other competitive plants and diminishing pollinators, respectively. Theft for horticultural cultivation can readily threaten plants whether male or female plants are frequently collected. The impact of forest habitat reduction may be limited compared with that of other disturbance types.Conclusions Our results have emphasized that the demographic vulnerability of lethal deceptive pollination systems would differ qualitatively from that of general mutualistic pollination systems. It is therefore important to consider the demographics of both victim pollinators and deceptive plants to estimate how endangered Arisaema populations respond to various disturbances.

AB  - Reintroducing locally extinct/extirpated species has been considered as an approach for restoring ecosystems. Although such projects share the same goals of rebuilding previously affected ecosystems, the overall impacts that such reintroductions generate on both ecosystems and human society, i.e., on the social -ecological system, are difficult to measure. We propose a system dynamics approach, a platform on which both natural and social scientists could collaborate to identify the social -ecological impacts of species reintroduction as well as factors that affect such decision making. We use cases in Japan to demonstrate the potential applicability of system dynamics in terms of (1) understanding the impacts of a previously reintroduced species, the Oriental Stork ( Ciconia boyciana ), and (2) predicting the impacts of reintroduction of wolves ( Canis lupus ). We present a causal loop diagram of the social and ecological effects of Oriental Stork reintroduction, and we discuss how the relationships between factors could be articulated based on empirical data and ongoing projects in Japan. The model demonstrates how local residents began to appreciate the rich biodiversity, including the Oriental Stork, following its reintroduction, and how public support toward such reintroduction enhanced further projects to reintroduce these species in different parts of Japan. A similar diagram, created to illustrate the social and ecological effects of the potential reintroduction of wolves to Japan, demonstrates how social factors such as environmental education and public attitudes could affect decision making as well as ecological factors such as predator -prey dynamics and overall biodiversity. Further, humanwolf conflicts could negatively affect the overall loop. Creating causal loop diagrams can help managers and stakeholders understand that species reintroduction projects need to be considered via an interdisciplinary approach. The models illustrate that these problems are dynamic and that the factors affecting or affected by such projects change over time, implying the importance of both the spatial and temporal scales in managing reintroduction projects.

AB  - There is growing evidence that prey perceive the risk of predation and alter their behavior in response, resulting in changes in spatial distribution and potential fitness consequences. Previous approaches to mapping predation risk across a landscape quantify predator space use to estimate potential predator-prey encounters, yet this approach does not account for successful predator attack resulting in prey mortality. An exception is a prey kill site that reflects an encounter resulting in mortality, but obtaining information on kill sites is expensive and requires time to accumulate adequate sample sizes. We illustrate an alternative approach using predator scat locations and their contents to quantify spatial predation risk for elk (Cervus canadensis) from multiple predators in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We surveyed over 1300 km to detect scats of bears (Ursus arctos/U. americanus), cougars (Puma concolor), coyotes (Canis latrans), and wolves (C. lupus). To derive spatial predation risk, we combined predictions of scat-based resource selection functions (RSFs) weighted by predator abundance with predictions that a predator-specific scat in a location contained elk. We evaluated the scat-based predictions of predation risk by correlating them to predictions based on elk kill sites. We also compared scat-based predation risk on summer ranges of elk following three migratory tactics for consistency with telemetry-based metrics of predation risk and cause-specific mortality of elk. We found a strong correlation between the scat-based approach presented here and predation risk predicted by kill sites and (r = .98, p < .001). Elk migrating east of the Ya Ha Tinda winter range were exposed to the highest predation risk from cougars, resident elk summering on the Ya Ha Tinda winter range were exposed to the highest predation risk from wolves and coyotes, and elk migrating west to summer in Banff National Park were exposed to highest risk of encountering bears, but it was less likely to find elk in bear scats than in other areas. These patterns were consistent with previous estimates of spatial risk based on telemetry of collared predators and recent cause-specific mortality patterns in elk. A scat-based approach can provide a cost-efficient alternative to kill sites of quantifying broad-scale, spatial patterns in risk of predation for prey particularly in multiple predator species systems.

AB  - Industrialized agriculture needs sustainable alternatives to pesticides to avoid negative impacts on the environment and human health. Crop diversification is known to decrease pest pressure in agricultural crops. Up till now, the effects of insect herbivores on crop yield are often assumed to be equal among cropping systems. We sampled the insect community and yield of cabbages in five distinct cropping systems characterized by increasing crop diversity. Using structural equation modelling, we assessed how herbivorous insects influence cabbage yield through direct consumptive effects and indirect effects via changes in the insect community. The most diverse cropping system synergistically increased cabbage yield and herbivorous insect abundance and richness, whereas the other cropping systems did not differ consistently from each other. Cropping systems alter the effect that herbivores have on cabbage crop yield, where more herbivores do not necessarily lead to reduced yields. Specific insects had cropping system-specific effects on yield, which reflect differences in the potential for distinct cropping systems to contribute to biological control of distinct herbivorous insects. In one of the cropping systems with cultivar mixtures, we observed negative impacts of herbivores on cabbage yield. This may result from a companioning cultivar drawing natural enemies away from the main cultivar, which would result in reduced biological control of herbivores on the main cultivar. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the design and characteristics of cropping systems should be considered when assessing insect herbivory effects on crop yield. As herbivorous insects have a smaller impact on yield in diverse cropping systems, crop diversification may synergize biodiversity conservation and food production.
   Ge & iuml;ndustrialiseerde landbouw heeft behoefte aan duurzame alternatieven om de negatieve effecten van pesticiden op het milieu en de menselijke gezondheid te voorkomen. Gewasdiversificatie biedt een veelbelovende strategie om de druk van plantenetende insecten op landbouwgewassen te verminderen. Tot nu toe werd aangenomen dat de effecten van deze insecten op de opbrengst van gewassen gelijk blijft tussen verschillende teeltsystemen. We hebben de insectengemeenschap en de opbrengst van kool gemeten in vijf verschillende teeltsystemen, gekarakteriseerd door toenemende gewasdiversiteit. Met behulp van zogenaamde "structural equation models" hebben we geanalyseerd hoe plantenetende insecten de koolopbrengst be & iuml;nvloeden, ofwel via vraat aan de koolplanten (direct effect op de plant), of door de gemeenschap van plantenetende insecten te veranderen (indirect effect). Het meest diverse teeltsysteem verhoogde zowel de koolopbrengst als de aantallen en soortenrijkdom van plantenetende insecten, terwijl de andere teeltsystemen onderling geen consistente verschillen vertoonden. De invloed van plantenetende insecten op de koolopbrengst werd be & iuml;nvloed door het teeltsysteem, waarbij meer insecten in een teeltsysteem niet noodzakelijkerwijs leidt tot lagere opbrengsten. Bepaalde insectensoorten hadden teeltsysteem-specifieke effecten op de opbrengst. Dit kan er op wijzen dat biologische bestrijding door natuurlijke vijanden van specifieke plantenetende insecten verschilt per teeltsysteem. In een van de teeltsystemen met rassenmengsel observeerden we negatieve effecten van plantenetende insecten op de koolopbrengst. Dit kan komen doordat het tweede koolras natuurlijke vijanden van het productieve koolras afleidt, wat resulteert in een verminderde biologische bestrijding van plantenetende insecten op het hoofdgewas. Synthese en toepassingen. Onze studie toont aan dat het ontwerp en de kenmerken van teeltsystemen in overweging moeten worden genomen bij het beoordelen van de impact van plantenetende insecten op gewasopbrengsten. Omdat de negatieve invloed van deze insecten afneemt in diverse teeltsystemen, kan gewasdiversificatie een effectieve manier zijn om zowel biodiversiteit als voedselproductie te bevorderen.

AB  - Parrotfishes are a functionally critical component of Caribbean reef fish assemblages, with large-bodied parrotfish species exerting particularly important top-down control on macroalgae. Despite their importance, low biomasses of large-bodied parrotfishes on many reefs hamper our ability to study and understand their ecology. Florida reefs, where most parrotfish fishing has been illegal since 1992, present a unique opportunity to explore covariates of their distribution. Using boosted regression tree models and 23 covariates, this study identified the major predictors of four species of Atlantic large-bodied parrotfishes. Maximum hard substrate relief, the area of the surrounding reef, and the availability of seagrass habitat were each positively related to parrotfish presence. Strong positive relationships between parrotfish presence and biomass and the biomass of other parrotfishes on a reef suggest that all four species responded to a similar subset of environmental conditions. However, relationships between parrotfish presence and biomass and depth, habitat type, coral cover, and the proximity of a reef to deepwater habitats differed among species, highlighting distinct habitat preferences. These results can improve managers' ability to target important biophysical correlates of large-bodied parrotfishes with appropriate management interventions and identify areas for protection.

AB  - The dioecious plant, Hippophae rhamnoides, is a pioneer species in community succession on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), plays great roles in various ecosystem services. However, the males and females of the species differ both in their morphology and physiology, resulting in a change in the ratio of male to female plants depending on the environment. To further explore the functional traits critical to this sex-based distinctive response in the alpine grassland, we have surveyed the sex ratios, measured their photosynthetic parameters, height, leaf area and biomass allocation. The results showed that (i) The males had higher Pn, light saturation point, apparent quantum efficiency, Amax and lower water-use efficiency (WUE), which exhibited higher utilization efficiency or tolerance to strong light, while the females indicated higher utilization efficiency for low light and water. And it showed sex-specific biomass allocation patterns. (ii) H. rhamnoides populations across the successional stages all showed a male-biased sexual allocation, which was closely related to sex-specific WUE, Pn, root biomass/total biomass and root-crown ratio. (iii) The leaf traits of H. rhamnoides changed from higher Narea, Parea and leaf mass per area in the early and late to lower in the middle, which meant they moved their growth strategy from resource rapid acquisition to conservation as the succession progressed. (iv) The increasing soil total phosphorus mostly contributed to regulating the sex bias of populations and variations of traits during the succession. The results are vital for the management of grassland degradation and restoration due to shrub encroachment on the QTP.

AB  - An industrial-scale experiment on dairy manure composting with the control group (Ctrl) and the membrane covering group (CM) was conducted to explore the effects of functional membrane covering on gas emissions, the conversion of carbon and nitrogen, and revealing the underlying mechanisms. Results indicated that CM achieved the synergistic effects on gas mitigation and improved compost product quality. CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions were reduced by 81.8%, 87.0%, 82.6%, and 82.2%, respectively. The micro-aerobic condition formed in membrane covering compost pile together with the covering inhibiting effect dominated the mitigation effect. CM significantly downregulated the mcrA gene copies and the value of mcrA/pmoA (p < 0.01), which reduced CH4 4 emission. CM decreased the nirS and nirK gene copies and increased the nosZ gene copies to reduce N2O emission. Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa showed that membrane covering effectively amended part of carbon and nitrogen cycles, which stimulated the degradation of organic matter, accelerated compost maturity and reduced the gaseous emissions.

AB  - Simple Summary The degree of relationship among livestock breeds can be quantified by the F-st statistic, which measures the extent of genetic differentiation between them. An F-st value of 0.1 has often been taken as indicating that two breeds are indeed genetically distinct, but this concept has not been evaluated critically. Here, F-st values have been collated for the six major livestock species: cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and chickens. These values are remarkably variable both within and between species, demonstrating that F-st > 0.1 is not a reliable criterion for breed distinctiveness. However, the large body of F-st data accumulated in the last 20-30 years represents an untapped database that could contribute to the development of interdisciplinary research involving livestock breeds. (1) Background: The F-st statistic is widely used to characterize between-breed relationships. F-st = 0.1 has frequently been taken as indicating genetic distinctiveness between breeds. This study investigates whether this is justified. (2) Methods: A database was created of 35,080 breed pairs and their corresponding F-st values, deduced from microsatellite and SNP studies covering cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and chickens. Overall, 6560 (19%) of breed pairs were between breeds located in the same country, 7395 (21%) between breeds of different countries within the same region, 20,563 (59%) between breeds located far apart, and 562 (1%) between a breed and the supposed wild ancestor of the species. (3) Results: General values for between-breed F-st were as follows, cattle: microsatellite 0.06-0.12, SNP 0.08-0.15; sheep: microsatellite 0.06-0.10, SNP 0.06-0.17; horses: microsatellite 0.04-0.11, SNP 0.08-0.12; goats: microsatellite 0.04-0.14, SNP 0.08-0.16; pigs: microsatellite 0.06-0.27, SNP 0.15-0.22; chickens: microsatellite 0.05-0.28, SNP 0.08-0.26. (4) Conclusions: (1) Large amounts of F-st data are available for a substantial proportion of the world's livestock breeds, (2) the value for between-breed F-st of 0.1 is not appropriate owing to its considerable variability, and (3) accumulated F-st data may have value for interdisciplinary research.

AB  - Understanding the factors that control decomposition is critical for predicting how the carbon cycle will alter with global change. Until recently, the accepted paradigm was that climate primarily drives decomposition rates, and interactions among decomposers only control variation at finer scales. Although it is now understood that biotic agents can play an important role, we know less about the importance of species interactions with a lack of field experiments at a large scale. Predation is a key ecological interaction that could influence decomposition by directly or indirectly regulating the abundances of decomposer organisms, but a comprehensive understanding of the cascading effects that predation can have on decomposition, particularly at large scales, is missing. Here we report on an experiment where we suppressed the abundance of ants, which are major predators of termites, at a hectare scale in a natural African savanna and examined how this affected the decomposition of three common substrates (wood, grass and dung). Our study revealed that ants exert considerable top-down control on decomposition via their predation of termites: decomposition of wood, grass and dung increased by 98%, 74% and 84% with ant suppression, respectively. Suppression of ants increased termite activity and consequently resulted in increased termite-mediated decomposition. Remarkably, for all substrates, the suppression of ants nearly doubled decomposition by termites. Additionally, for grass and dung substrates, the dominant agent of decomposition switched from microbes to termites with ant suppression. Our study highlights the critical importance of considering species interactions in decomposition studies, particularly given declines in predatory species in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Tracking the concentration of elements in the organs of endangered animal species can provide significant knowledge about environmental hazards and allows more targeted protective measures to be taken. In this paper the differences in concentrations of 27 elements in the livers of free-ranging European bison were studied. The ICP-OES method was applied to study the four main Polish populations, which live in lowland (Biatowieska, Knyszyhska and Borecka forests) and mountain (Bieszczady) habitats. The study was based on a unique and relatively large amount of comparative material. It was found that European bison populations that live in different locations differ from each other in terms of the hepatic concentrations of 17 of the elements studied in this work. The mountain population in Bieszczady was most distinctive due to the higher concentrations of Ba, Ca, Cd, Se, and the lower concentrations of Mo and V (compared to the other populations). Additionally, even geographically close lowland populations sometimes have different hepatic concentrations of particular elements. The sex and age of individuals have a weak effect on mineral status. Although the lithosphere is the primary factor that affects the availability of elements for the European bison, the soil parameters and biosphere can significantly affect the availability of elements, e.g. by accumulation. It was also shown that the anthroposphere plays a role, but this is mainly through agriculture as feeding on arable fields significantly changes the mineral status of European bison. The need for further research, especially on Cd, Se and Cu, was indicated. It was concluded that toxic elements or deficiencies in essential elements in the populations of the studied species should be considered locally as this would allow better understanding of the health condition of individual populations.

AB  - The current conventional paradigm of ocean food web structure inserts one full level or more of microzooplankton heterotrophic consumption, a substantial energy drop, between phytoplankton and mesozooplankton. Using a dataset with contemporaneous measurements of primary production (PP), size-fractioned mesozooplankton biomass, and micro- and mesozooplankton grazing rates from 10 tropical to temperate ocean ecosystems, we examined whether the structural inefficiencies in this paradigm allow sufficient energy transfer to support active metabolism and growth of observed zooplankton standing stocks. Zooplankton carbon requirements (ZCR) were determined from allometric equations that account for ecosystem differences in temperature and size structure. ZCRs were relatively low (similar to 30% of PP or less) for both oligotrophic systems and bloom biomass accumulation in eutrophic coastal waters. Higher relative ZCRs (>30% PP) were associated with elevated mesozooplankton grazing scenarios (bloom declines, abundant salps), advective subsidies, and open-ocean upwelling systems. Microzooplankton generally dominated as grazers of PP but were equal or secondary to direct herbivory as nutritional support for mesozooplankton in five of eight regional studies. All systems were able to satisfy ZCR within the conventional food-web interpretation, but balanced open-ocean upwelling systems required the most efficient alignments of contributions from microzooplankton grazing, direct herbivory, and carnivory to do so.

AB  - BackgroundBoreal forests cover vast areas of land in the northern hemisphere and store large amounts of carbon (C) both aboveground and belowground. Wildfires, which are a primary ecosystem disturbance of boreal forests, affect soil C via combustion and transformation of organic matter during the fire itself and via changes in plant growth and microbial activity post-fire. Wildfire regimes in many areas of the boreal forests of North America are shifting towards more frequent and severe fires driven by changing climate. As wildfire regimes shift and the effects of fire on belowground microbial community composition are becoming clearer, there is a need to link fire-induced changes in soil properties to changes in microbial functions, such as respiration, in order to better predict the impact of future fires on C cycling.ResultsWe used laboratory burns to simulate boreal crown fires on both organic-rich and sandy soil cores collected from Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada, to measure the effects of burning on soil properties including pH, total C, and total nitrogen (N). We used 70-day soil incubations and two-pool exponential decay models to characterize the impacts of burning and its resulting changes in soil properties on soil respiration. Laboratory burns successfully captured a range of soil temperatures that were realistic for natural wildfire events. We found that burning increased pH and caused small decreases in C:N in organic soil. Overall, respiration per gram total (post-burn) C in burned soil cores was 16% lower than in corresponding unburned control cores, indicating that soil C lost during a burn may be partially offset by burn-induced decreases in respiration rates. Simultaneously, burning altered how remaining C cycled, causing an increase in the proportion of C represented in the modeled slow-cycling vs. fast-cycling C pool as well as an increase in fast-cycling C decomposition rates.ConclusionsTogether, our findings imply that C storage in boreal forests following wildfires will be driven by the combination of C losses during the fire itself as well as fire-induced changes to the soil C pool that modulate post-fire respiration rates. Moving forward, we will pair these results with soil microbial community data to understand how fire-induced changes in microbial community composition may influence respiration.
   AntecedentesLos bosques boreales cubren vastas & aacute;reas de tierras en el Hemisferio Norte y almacenan grandes cantidades de Carbono (C), tanto en sus estructuras a & eacute;reas como subterr & aacute;neas. Los incendios, que representan el disturbio ecosist & eacute;mico primario en los bosques boreales, afectan el C del suelo v & iacute;a combusti & oacute;n y transformaci & oacute;n de la Materia Org & aacute;nica (MO) durante el mismo incendio, y v & iacute;a cambios en el crecimiento de las plantas y actividad microbiana en el post fuego. Los reg & iacute;menes de fuegos de vegetaci & oacute;n en muchas & aacute;reas de bosques boreales de Am & eacute;rica del Norte est & aacute;n cambiando hacia incendios m & aacute;s frecuentes y severos, conducidos por el Cambio Clim & aacute;tico. A medida que los reg & iacute;menes de incendios cambian y los efectos del fuego sobre la composici & oacute;n de las comunidades microbianas se van aclarando, hay una necesidad de ligar los cambios inducidos por el fuego en las propiedades del suelo con cambios en las funciones de los microbios, como en la respiraci & oacute;n, de manera de predecir mejor el impacto de fuegos futuros sobre el ciclo del C.ResultadosUsamos quemas en el laboratorio para simular fuegos de copas de bosques boreales sobre muestras cil & iacute;ndricas (soil cores) de suelos ricos en MO y arenosos colectados del sitio Wood Buffalo National Park, en Alberta, Canada, para medir los efectos de la quema sobre algunas propiedades de los suelos incluyendo pH, Carbono total (C) y nitr & oacute;geno total (N). Usamos incubaciones de esas muestras de suelo por 70 d & iacute;as y modelos de descomposici & oacute;n con dos reservas de C para caracterizar los impactos de la quema y los cambios resultantes en cuanto a propiedades y respiraci & oacute;n del suelo. Las quemas de laboratorio capturaron exitosamente un rango de temperaturas de suelo que fueron realistas para eventos de fuegos naturales. Encontramos que las quemas incrementaron el pH y causaron peque & ntilde;as disminuciones en la relaci & oacute;n C:N en el suelo org & aacute;nico. En general, la respiraci & oacute;n total por g de C en el post fuego en las muestras quemadas fue un 16% menor que en las muestras no quemadas, indicando que el C perdido durante la quema puede ser parcialmente compensado por decrecimientos en la respiraci & oacute;n inducida por la propia quema. Simult & aacute;neamente, la quema alter & oacute; el cu & aacute;nto C remanente se reciclaba, causando un incremento en la proporci & oacute;n de C representado en la reserva de C ciclo-lento vs ciclo-r & aacute;pido en el modelo, como as & iacute; tambi & eacute;n un incremento, en el caso del ciclo r & aacute;pido, en su tasa de descomposici & oacute;n.ConclusionesEn conjunto, nuestros resultados implican que el almacenamiento de C en bosques boreales va a ser conducido por la combinaci & oacute;n de p & eacute;rdidas de C durante el mismo fuego como as & iacute; tambi & eacute;n por cambios inducidos por el fuego en la reserva de C del suelo moduladas por las tasas de respiraci & oacute;n en el post fuego. Hacia el futuro, aparearemos estos resultados con datos de la comunidad microbi & oacute;tica del suelo para entender c & oacute;mo los cambios inducidos por el fuego en la comunidad microbiana pueden influenciar la respiraci & oacute;n.

AB  - Resource selection is fundamental to understanding the ecology of a species because it is directly related to its survival and reproduction. The scale-dependent process for the habitat use of Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) was investigated in temperate forest to determine their resource priorities. Since imperfect detectability of fecal pellet count method can lead to false zeroes and overdispersion issues, we accounted for these issues using a zero-inflated model. The abundance of roe deer was constant between the deciduous forest and larch plantation. This might be due to the high productivity of temperate forest in the study area. However, the microhabitat use by roe deer differed between the forest types because of resource availability. Roe deer exhibit consistent pattern of microhabitat use in the larch plantations, while they exploited higher food quality in deciduous forests. Due to high resource availability, including food and covers, in larch plantation, habitat use of deer may not be limited by spatial variation on the resources. Moreover, we confirmed that weather, forest type, and ground conditions affected spatiotemporal variation in fecal pellet detection on a habitat and microhabitat scale. The zero-inflated model could make the fecal pellet count method more efficient and reliable without additional field surveys by correcting the detectability of fecal pellets. This simple statistical model can facilitate future research on ungulate and lagomorph populations.

AB  - The recovery of carnivore populations in North American has consequences for trophic interactions and population dynamics of prey. In addition to direct effects on prey populations through killing, predators can influence prey behavior by imposing the risk of predation. The mechanisms through which patterns of space use by predators are linked to behavioral response by prey and nonconsumptive effects on prey population dynamics are poorly understood. Our goal was to characterize population- and individual-level patterns of resource selection by elk (Cervus canadensis) in response to risk of wolves (Canis lupus) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) and evaluate potential nonconsumptive effects of these behavioral patterns. We tested the hypothesis that individual elk risk-avoidance behavior during summer would result in exposure to lower-quality forage and reduced body fat and pregnancy rates. First, we evaluated individuals' second-order and third-order resource selection with a used-available sampling design. At the population level, we found evidence for a positive relationship between second- and third-order selection and forage, and an interaction between forage quality and mountain lion risk such that the relative probability of use at low mountain lion risk increased with forage quality but decreased at high risk at both orders of selection. We found no evidence of a population-level trade-off between forage quality and wolf risk. However, we found substantial among-individual heterogeneity in resource selection patterns such that population-level patterns were potentially misleading. We found no evidence that the diversity of individual resource selection patterns varied predictably with available resources, or that patterns of individual risk-related resource selection translated into biologically meaningful changes in body fat or pregnancy rates. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating individual responses to predation risk and predator hunting technique when assessing responses to predators and suggests nonconsumptive effects are not operating at a population scale in this system.

AB  - Knowledge of mechanisms by which large mammals select rubbing trees (RT) is a major challenge for the effective management of forests and wildlife resources. In this study, we investigated this issue regarding the wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the Moroccan forested site of Sidi Boughaba as a case study. We used data from four sets of variables, namely topography, forest type, landscape composition, and microhabitat, measured at 58 rub and control trees, to determine the factors associated with the occurrence of RT by means of generalized linear mixed models. Our results showed that the RT occurrence increased with a high density of red juniper trees and declined with a distance to the nearest footpath. The variation partitioning analysis revealed that the pure fraction of microhabitat was the most robust in explaining this occurrence (adj. R-2 = 0.17, P < 0.001), followed by that of forest type (adj. R-2 = 0.05, P < 0.05). A scientific monitoring system must be set up to strike a balance between the availability of forest trees on the one hand and the pressure exerted by wild boars in this internationally important site on the other. It is imperative to test the geographical generality of our results in other Mediterranean forests.

AB  - Subsistence hunting for obtaining wild meat is a common practice in rural neotropical communities. Like other peasant practices disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, subsistence hunting could exacerbate pressure on wild mammals whose greater size contributes to feeding the hunter and his family. Thus, in the context of the pandemic, we assessed the subsistence hunting of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), one of the main traditional game species in the Calakmul region, Campeche, Mexico, and compared this activity with its pre-pandemic levels of such vertebrate species. Based on ethnographic information and hunting records from three rural communities, we found that in one trimester (July-September 2020) of the rainy season, a total of 26 white-tailed deer (923 kg of game biomass) were obtained by local peasant-hunters carrying out hunting mostly alone. Most peasant-hunters interviewed (36 of 51) stated that they hunted daily, and only a few hunted once a week or once a month (8 and 3%, respectively). This hunting activity and modalities were carried out at night (68%) versus day, stalking (21%) and opportunist (11%) near their community. The game biomass and hunting frequency in the studied communities were twice as high during the pandemic, compared to similar pre-pandemic periods in the region. Our survey highlights the need to expand monitoring and evaluation (during and after the pandemic) of subsistence hunting on key species, such as white-tailed deer, in order to ensure conservation and sustainable use of wildlife in this important Mesoamerican region.

AB  - Diel partitioning of animals within ecological communities is widely acknowledged, yet rarely quantified. Investigation of most ecological patterns and processes involves convenient daylight sampling, with little consideration of the contributions of nocturnal taxa, particularly in marine environments. Here we assess diel partitioning of reef faunal assemblages at a continental scale utilizing paired day and night visual census across 54 shallow tropical and temperate reefs around Australia. Day-night differences were most pronounced in the tropics, with fishes and invertebrates displaying distinct and opposing diel occupancy on coral reefs. Tropical reefs in daytime were occupied primarily by fishes not observed at night (64% of all species sighted across day and night, and 71% of all individuals). By night, substantial emergence of invertebrates not otherwise detected during sunlit hours occurred (56% of all species, and 45% of individuals). Nocturnal emergence of tropical invertebrates corresponded with significant declines in the richness and biomass of predatory and herbivorous diurnal fishes. In contrast, relatively small diel changes in fishes active on temperate reefs corresponded to limited nocturnal emergence of temperate invertebrates. This reduced partitioning may, at least in part, be a result of strong top-down pressures from fishes on invertebrate communities, either by predation or competitive interference. For shallow reefs, the diel cycle triggers distinct emergence and retreat of faunal assemblages and associated trophic patterns and processes, which otherwise go unnoticed during hours of regular scientific monitoring. Improved understanding of reef ecology, and management of reef ecosystems, requires greater consideration of nocturnal interactions. Without explicit sampling of nocturnal patterns and processes, we may be missing up to half of the story when assessing ecological interactions.

AB  - Biotic and abiotic changes induced by urbanization can highly affect the ecology and evolution of plant species. Indeed, urban development can have a major impact on plant population genomics, reproductive success and phenotypic traits hence influencing the adaptive strategies and the ecological functions of plant species within ecosystems. Through a holistic study of the impact of urbanization on the genetic and ecological dynamics of a Mediterranean plant species, we shed light on the mechanisms driving plant responses to urban environments. By focusing on 15 populations of the Mediterranean cliff species Brassica incana distributed along an urbanization gradient, we first analyzed the potential drivers of among-population genomic differentiation using a landscape genomics approach. Then, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay among ecological factors (climate, herbivore damage, pollinator community), reproductive (relative fruit set and seed- ovule ratio) and phenotypic (glucosinolate content, flower number) traits involved in the response of B. incana populations to urban pressures using complementary Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and correlative approaches. Our results show that urbanization reduces among-population connectivity by influencing the genomic differentiation among populations. Also, according to SEM analysis, urbanization showed direct and indirect (mediated by mean annual temperature) effects on both pollinator community and herbivory levels, and direct and indirect (mediated by honeybees and long-tongued bees) effects on plant reproductive success. Additionally, urban populations showed higher contents of a glucosinolate compound (glucobrassicin). Taken together, our findings suggest that urbanization can shape genomic differentiation, reproductive success and phenotypic variation. We showed that the impact of urbanization is rather complex and is likely mediated by the interplay between direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic conditions on B. incana. Overall, we documented how urban development can shape eco-evolutionary dynamics of a cliff species located in a densely inhabited Mediterranean area.

AB  - Climate change and global warming have effects on every ecosystem and have caused huge losses in global biodiversity. This study identified that currently, the study area explored in this work provides a good quantity (around 35%) of suitable habitat for the Demoiselle Crane. The most influential factors determining Demoiselle Crane habitat suitability included the temperature seasonality, annual mean temperature, terrain ruggedness index, and human population density as significant contributors. Under changing climate scenarios, the study predicted a major loss of species current suitable habitat, with shrinkage and movement towards western-central areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan boarder. The inevitable impacts of climate change have reverberated across ecosystems and caused substantial global biodiversity loss. Climate-induced habitat loss has contributed to range shifts at both species and community levels. Given the importance of identifying suitable habitats for at-risk species, it is imperative to assess potential current and future distributions, and to understand influential environmental factors. Like many species, the Demoiselle crane is not immune to climatic pressures. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan are known wintering grounds for this species. Given that Pakistan is among the top five countries facing devastating effects of climate change, this study sought to conduct species distribution modeling under climate change using data collected during 4 years of field surveys. We developed a Maximum Entropy distribution model to predict the current and projected future distribution of the species across the study area. Future habitat projections for 2050 and 2070 were carried out using two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) under three global circulation models, including HADGEM2-AO, BCC-CSM1-1, and CCSM4. The most influential factors shaping Demoiselle Crane habitat suitability included the temperature seasonality, annual mean temperature, terrain ruggedness index, and human population density, all of which contributed significantly to the suitability (81.3%). The model identified 35% of the study area as moderately suitable (134,068 km(2)) and highly suitable (27,911 km(2)) habitat for the species under current climatic conditions. Under changing climate scenarios, our model predicted a major loss of the species' current suitable habitat, with shrinkage and shift towards western-central areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan boarder. The RCP 8.5, which is the extreme climate change scenario, portrays particularly severe consequences, with habitat losses reaching 65% in 2050 and 85% in 2070. This comprehensive study provides useful insights into the Demoiselle Crane habitat's current and future dynamics in Pakistan.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples around the northern hemisphere have long relied on caribou for subsistence and for ceremonial and community purposes. Unfortunately, despite recovery efforts by federal and provincial agencies, caribou are currently in decline in many areas across Canada. In response to recent and dramatic declines of mountain caribou populations within their traditional territory, West Moberly First Nations and Saulteau First Nations (collectively, the "Nations") came together to create a new vision for caribou recovery on the lands they have long stewarded and shared. The Nations focused on the Klinse-Za subpopulation, which had once encompassed so many caribou that West Moberly Elders remarked that they were "like bugs on the landscape." The Klinse-Za caribou declined from similar to 250 in the 1990s to only 38 in 2013, rendering Indigenous harvest of caribou nonviable and infringing on treaty rights to a subsistence livelihood. In collaboration with many groups and governments, this Indigenous-led conservation initiative paired short-term population recovery actions, predator reduction and maternal penning, with long-term habitat protection in an effort to create a self-sustaining caribou population. Here, we review these recovery actions and the promising evidence that the abundance of Klinse-Za caribou has more than doubled from 38 animals in 2013 to 101 in 2021, representing rapid population growth in response to recovery actions. With looming extirpation averted, the Nations focused efforts on securing a landmark conservation agreement in 2020 that protects caribou habitat over a 7986-km(2) area. The Agreement provides habitat protection for >85% of the Klinse-Za subpopulation (up from only 1.8% protected pre-conservation agreement) and affords moderate protection for neighboring caribou subpopulations (29%-47% of subpopulation areas, up from 0%-20%). This Indigenous-led conservation initiative has set both the Indigenous and Canadian governments on the path to recover the Klinse-Za subpopulation and reinstate a culturally meaningful caribou hunt. This effort highlights how Indigenous governance and leadership can be the catalyst needed to establish meaningful conservation actions, enhance endangered species recovery, and honor cultural connections to now imperiled wildlife.

AB  - 1. One of the major concerns of ecological and evolutionary research is the prediction of community function in relation to the degree of biodiversity. To clarify the relationship between biodiversity and the expression of plant defence traits, we investigated ant-plant defensive mutualism in the pioneer plant Mallotus japonicus at several sites across Japan. The plant bears ant-attracting extrafloral nectar (EFN) and food bodies (FBs) as indirect defence traits.
   2. To reveal variations in ant-plant interactions in the field, we measured species richness of nectar-feeding ants and interaction strength between each ant species and the plant (visiting frequency of each ant species to the plant). We also investigated the expression of EFNs and FBs in natural plant populations at the study sites. To assess the defensive quality of each ant species, we then experimentally estimated the aggressiveness of the dominant ant species. To examine the link between ant species richness and the defensive function of ants, we conducted an ant-exclusion experiment and a common garden experiment to clarify whether the defence efficacy of ants varied in relation to ant species richness.
   3. Ant species richness differed among the study sites. We found negative relationships between ant species richness and the mean interaction strength of ant species, the interaction strength of aggressive ant species and the number of EFNs per leaf. The effectiveness of indirect defence by ants was poor at sites where ant species richness was high. When cultivated in the same environment, plants from sites with low ant species richness developed a larger number of EFNs per leaf than those from sites with high ant species richness.
   4. Our results suggest that facultative ant-plant defensive mutualism is weakened at sites where ant species richness is high, resulting in a decrease in the number of EFNs per leaf. Such a link between species richness and an indirect trait function may help us to understand the evolutionary patterns of various species traits in complex biological communities.

Previous studies evaluating the efficacy of attractants at improving wild pig visitations have yielded mixed results, which are likely to be a reflection of the generalist foraging strategies of wild pigs as well as their fine-scale variability in space use.RESULTSWe conducted experimental trials at 743 sites in South Carolina, USA, to quantify differences in wild pig visitation among a suite of bait, scent lures and bait + scent lure combinations to identify which maximized visitation. We monitored sites using a remote camera for 7 days and quantified visitation rates and time to visitation. Additionally, to identify habitat attributes that maximized wild pig visitation, we characterized a suite of habitat attributes at each location. Wild pigs visited more sites and had shorter times to visitation at sites with bait present (bait: 42.85%, 61.35 h; bait + scent: 47.99%, 60.98 h) than sites with scent lures alone (24.40%, 82.03 h), with similar results for groups of wild pigs and individuals, emphasizing the effectiveness of bait in increasing visitation. Our habitat modeling results suggest that wild pigs are more likely to locate bait sites in areas closer to water sources and in thick understory.CONCLUSIONWe recommend that managers maximize visitation of wild pigs by using high-value baits, not relying on scent lures, and intentionally selecting sites based on habitat attributes where wild pigs have nearby access to water and cover.

AB  - Ocean Acidification (OA) and Ocean Warming (OW) represent major climate stressors that may disrupt species interactions. However, despite the knowledge about the impacts of OA and OW on the performance of individual species, it is still unclear how biological interactions can be modified by the combined effects of these stressors. Consequently, in this study, we assess the effects of changes in temperature (12 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and pCO(2) (500 and 1600 mu atm) levels in seawater, along with the presence/absence of waterborne cues from the predator crab Homalaspis plana on the physiological and behavioural performance of the snail Tegula atra. Snail consumption rate was positively affected by OW and negatively by predator cues whereas absorption efficiency (AE) was positively affected by OW without interactions among these stressors. Oxygen uptake of snails reared in OW conditions was greater than those in control conditions, but only at control pCO(2) levels. When pCO(2) level was also raised, the positive effect of warmer temperature on oxygen uptake was reduced. While biomass was negatively affected by OW, OA and predator cues, without interactions. In the presence of predator cues the self-righting times of snails were significantly slower in individuals reared at OW conditions. Additionally, OA and OW conditions do not affect the prey hunting, efficiency (consumption) and preference, and claw strength of the predatory crab. These results indicate that OA and OW affect physiological and behavioral traits of snails but no the predatory behavior of crab. This environmentally-induced decoupling of co-evolutionary predator-prey dynamics may have important consequences on the structure and stability of coastal communities and ecosystems under the influence of climate change.

AB  - Genetic mechanisms determining habitat selection and specialization of individuals within species have been hypothesized, but not tested at the appropriate individual level in nature. In this work, we analyzed habitat selection for 139 GPS-collared caribou belonging to 3 declining ecotypes sampled throughout Northwestern Canada. We used Resource Selection Functions comparing resources at used and available locations. We found that the 3 caribou ecotypes differed in their use of habitat suggesting specialization. On expected grounds, we also found differences in habitat selection between summer and winter, but also, originally, among the individuals within an ecotype. We next obtained Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for the same caribou individuals, we detected those associated to habitat selection, and then identified genes linked to these SNPs. These genes had functions related in other organisms to habitat and dietary specializations, and climatic adaptations. We therefore suggest that individual variation in habitat selection was based on genotypic variation in the SNPs of individual caribou, indicating that genetic forces underlie habitat and diet selection in the species. We also suggest that the associations between habitat and genes that we detected may lead to lack of resilience in the species, thus contributing to caribou endangerment. Our work emphasizes that similar mechanisms may exist for other specialized, endangered species.

AB  - Remains of the steppe bison Bison priscus Bojanus, 1827 from the Upper Pleistocene layers of Bisnik Cave were morphometrically analysed and compared to those from other localities in Eurasia. The remains occurred in accumulations with archaeological artefacts. They bore traces of gnawing by carnivores. Morphometric analyses of the skull and post-cranial skeleton point to the small form of bison. The skull belonged to a small male while the bones of post-cranial skeleton indicate the occurrence of both males and females. Here we present all available and newly obtained calibrated C-14 dates of the bison remains from this site, supplemented with new data for five specimens from Bisnik Cave, thus confirming the presence of the species during MIS 3 in Poland. The results are relevant to tracing the migration paths of the bison in the Upper Pleistocene during MIS 4-3.

TI  - Herbivorous Crabs Reverse the Seaweed Dilemma on Coral Reefs
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Coral reefs are on a steep trajectory of decline, with natural recovery in many areas unlikely.(1-3) Eutrophication, overfishing, climate change, and disease have fueled the supremacy of seaweeds on reefs,(4,5) particularly in the Caribbean, where many reefs have undergone an ecological phase shift so that seaweeds now dominate previously coral-rich reefs.(6-8) Discovery of the powerful grazing capability of the Caribbean's largest herbivorous crab (Maguimithrax spinosissimus)(9) led us to test the effectiveness of their grazing on seaweed removal and coral reef recovery in two experiments conducted sequentially at separate locations 15 km apart in the Florida Keys (USA). In those experiments, we transplanted crabs onto several patch reefs, leaving others as controls (n = 24 reefs total; each 10-20 m(2) in area) and then monitored benthic cover, coral recruitment, and fish community structure on each patch reef for a year. We also compared the effectiveness of crab herbivory to scrubbing reefs by hand to remove algae. Crabs reduced the cover of seaweeds by 50%-80%, resulting in a commensurate 3-5-fold increase in coral recruitment and reef fish community abundance and diversity. Although laborious hand scrubbing of reefs also reduced algal cover, that effect was transitory unless maintained by the addition of herbivorous crabs. With the persistence of Caribbean coral reefs in the balance, our findings demonstrate that large-scale restoration that includes enhancement of invertebrate herbivores can reverse the ecological phase shift on coral reefs away from seaweed dominance.

AB  - Nitrogen pollution in rivers has long been a significant ecological and environmental concern, and research on nitrogen pollution source tracking serves as the foundation for pollution control, playing a crucial role in quantifying different pollution sources and formulating effective mitigation strategies. This study proposes a technical framework for pollution source resolution based on the export coefficient model and microbial source tracking model. Initially, key environmental factors and their spatiotemporal characteristics were analyzed to preliminarily identify potential nitrogen pollution sources, including wastewater treatment plants, stainless steel plants, electroplating factories, chemical plants, pig farms, poultry farms, rice fields, vegetable farms, and tea plantations. Subsequently, hydrochemical and microbial metagenomic analyses were conducted to further refine the identification of nitrogen pollution sources. NMDS analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community structures among different pollution sources, facilitating effective discrimination. Additionally, co-occurrence network analysis was employed to construct microbial fingerprint maps specific to each pollution source. Finally, a Bayesian community-wide non-culture microbial source tracking method (SourceTracker) was used for quantitative pollution source apportionment. The export coefficient model estimated that point-source nitrogen loads were primarily derived from domestic wastewater, whereas non-point source nitrogen loads predominantly originated from rural domestic wastewater and agricultural cultivation. By integrating the microbial source tracking model, the primary sources of nitrogen pollution were accurately identified. During the dry season, domestic wastewater (47.3%) was the dominant contributor, including wastewater treatment plants, rural domestic sewage, stainless steel plants, and electroplating factories, with fecal and agricultural sources mainly stemming from pig farms and rice fields. In contrast, during the wet season, agricultural cultivation (20.5%) and natural soil (27.8%) were the predominant contributors, encompassing rice fields, vegetable farms, and tea plantations. This source-tracking approach provides a valuable tool for guiding precise regional pollution control and is particularly applicable in complex pollution environments.

AB  - In braided rivers, networks of groundwater-fed and surface-water dominated channels cause a high variability in stream water temperature in space and time. Water temperature of groundwater-fed channels is cooler than that of surface-water dominated channels in summer, and vice versa in winter. Fishes in braided channels may exploit such spatiotemporal thermal heterogeneity through seasonal movements. In this study, we examined seasonal habitat use by two warmwater fishes, pale chub (Opsariichthys platypus) and freshwater goby (Rhinogobius nagoyae), in a braided river in southwestern Japan. We used two connecting channels having contrasting thermal regimes (groundwater-fed vs. surface-water dominated channels), and conducted bimonthly surveys over a year on spatial variations of the two species' densities and characteristics of their habitat across the two channels. Pale chub density was higher in the groundwater channel than in the surface-water channel in winter and vice versa in summer. These spatial variations of pale chub density were related to water temperature both in winter and summer, suggesting their seasonal movement between the two channels to seek better thermal conditions. Freshwater goby density was also higher in the groundwater channel than in the surface-water channel in winter, and positively related to water temperature. Our results suggest that groundwater seeps can provide important winter habitats for warmwater fishes and the close proximity of channels having contrasting thermal regimes is an important aspect of braided rivers for persistence of diverse fish assemblages.

AB  - Context: Climate change has reduced rangeland production and constrained sheep production in Chile's Mediterranean region. This article presents a simulation model to evaluate new forage alternatives and their effects on current small-farm sheep systems. Objective: The objective was to determine how the inclusion of new forage alternatives and associated management modifications affect the carbon footprint (CF), productivity, and profitability of sheep production systems. Methods: Survey and field data were used to develop a simulation model that seeks to balance energy and protein nutrition in response to variations in stocking rates, supplementation rates, and pasture management in comparison with the base scenario. Outputs include sheep production, CF, and economic analyses of various factorial combinations. Results and conclusions: In the basal scenario, the carbon footprint (CF) was 9.57 +/- 0.45 kg CO2-eq/kg live weight (LW) when soil carbon (C) sequestration was not considered. However, it decreased to 6.7 +/- 0.49 when accounting for soil C sequestration. Although financial income was negative, operational income was positive due to the undervaluation of the grassland contribution. The use of triticale grain resulted in the lowest CF, but in economic terms, alfalfa hay outperformed all supplements. It is important to recognize the value of native grasslands if traditional systems are to persist. Significance: In the context of current land use practices and economic conditions, the simulation model revealed a limited range of available tools to increase technical efficiency and minimize carbon footprint (CF) when the native grasslands are not valued. The model is well-suited to explore alternative scenarios under variable economic conditions and can provide valuable insights to inform policy decisions.

AB  - Shrub species are used in restoration projects on dryland for their facilitation effects, which include environmental improvements and protection from herbivore feeding. Facilitation effects on forage grasses are potentially important in improving grazing capacity on rangelands. However, the morphology-dependent performance of benefactor plants in facilitating forage species growth and supplementation under moderate grazing intensity remains unclear. Here, our main purpose was to measure facilitation performance in terms of the survival of a native forage grass, Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (Gramineae)., in accordance with the growth conditions of a sand-fixing benefactor shrub, Caragana microphylla Lam., in the Hulun Buir Grassland, northern China. Six study sites with patches of A. cristatum and C. microphylla were established at the foot of fixed sand dunes. At each site, five quadrats were set in places where C. microphylla coverage was 100% and A. cristatum grew among the shrubs (shrub quadrats), and another five were set where A. cristatum grew alone without C. microphylla (grass quadrats). We measured the morphological traits of C. microphylla and A. cristatum in all 60 quadrats, along with the soil water content and soil temperature. The data were compared between the shrub and grass quadrats by generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess the shrub's facilitation effects. We also used such models to elucidate the relationship between the average height of C. microphylla and the morphological traits of A. cristatum in the shrub quadrats. The maximum height, average grazed height, and the number of seed heads of A. cristatum were greater in the shrub quadrats than in the grass quadrats. The soil surface temperature was lower in the shrub quadrats. The maximum height and seed head number of A. cristatum were positively associated with the average height of C. microphylla. These results suggest that the grazing impact and heat stress were smaller in shrub quadrats than in grass quadrats, and that the degree of this protective effect depended on the shrub height. The shrub canopy seemed to reduce the increase in soil temperature and keep the grass vigorous. Livestock likely avoided grazing grasses in the C. microphylla patches because of the shrub's spiny leaves; only the upper parts of the grass stems (including the seed heads) protruding from the shrub canopy were grazed. The sand-fixing shrub thus moderates the grazing impact and soil temperature, and contributes to vegetation restoration and grazing system sustainability.

AB  - Transports of people and goods contribute to the ongoing 6 th mass extinction of species. They impact species viability by reducing the availability of suitable habitat, by limiting connectivity between suitable patches, and by increasing direct mortality due to collisions with vehicles. Not only does it represent a threat for some species conservation capabilities, but animal vehicle collisions (AVC) is also a threat for human safety and security in transport and has a massive cost for transport infrastructure (TI) managers and users. Using the opportunities offered by the increasing number of sensors embedded into TI and the development of their digital twins, we developed a framework aiming at managing AVC by mapping the collision risk between trains and ungulates (roe deer and wild boar) thanks to the deployment of a camera trap network. The proposed framework uses population dynamic simulations to identify collision hotspots and assist with the design of sensors deployment. Once sensors are deployed, the data collected, here photos, are processed through deep learning to detect and identify species at the TI vicinity. Then, the processed data are fed to an abundance model able to map species relative abundance around the TI as a proxy of the collision risk. We implement the framework on an actual section of railway in south-western France benefiting from a mitigation and monitoring strategy. The implementation thus highlighted the technical and fundamental requirements to effectively mainstream biodiversity concerns in the TI digital twins. This would contribute to the AVC management in autonomous vehicles thanks to connected TI.

AB  - Simple Summary: Common eland are currently underutilized regarding their meat production potential, despite their nutritious meat. Due to their temperament and adaptability, they are well-represented in commercial farms internationally, for both consumptive and ecotourism purposes. Immunocastration has been utilized as a management strategy in mixed-sex eland herds but its effects on the slaughter performance and cutting yields of common eland males have not yet been described. Furthermore, the ideal age of slaughter for eland males culled out of breeding herds relative to edible carcass product yields has not yet been explored, as it is almost impossible to control the confounding factors under current extensive production conditions within southern Africa. The Common Eland Research Facilities at The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague allows for studies under controlled conditions, with animals which have extensive records. The results indicated that while immunocastration had no influence, age affected the offal yields, primal cut, and dissection yields, as well as the high-value: low-value meat of the carcass, with the latter being in favor of juveniles. However, sub-adult males generated higher individual muscle yields.
   This study investigated the effects of immunocastration and slaughter age on the carcass yield performance of intensively farmed common eland males. Eighteen male eland (five immunocastrated juveniles, three intact juveniles, five immunocastrated sub-adults, and five intact sub-adults) were finished for four months, after which their carcass, offal, primal cut, and individual muscle yields were determined. Juveniles were similar to 6 months of age at the start of the experiment, while sub-adults were similar to 1.5 years old. Primal cuts were dissected to determine the percentage yields of meat, bones (with tendons), separable fat, and trimmings. Immunocastration had no effect on offal or carcass yields. While sub-adults had increased individual muscle yields, juveniles had greater proportionate yields of primal cuts and a greater total high-value: low-value meat ratio. Whilst slaughtering younger male eland could provide additional economic advantages, this should be considered being against changing marketing trends.

AB  - Understanding the spatial dynamics of landscape use by free-ranging herbivores is essential for species management and conservation in its natural environment. We used Ivelv's selection index, binary logistic regression analyses and stepwise regression to understand how environmental factors shape habitat selection by the Grevy's zebra (Equus greyvi). We measured biotic, abiotic and human factors that may influence presence or absence of Grevy's zebra in Samburu-Laikipia landscape and showed: (1) during wet periods, percentage perennial grasses, livestock density and grass quality had the greatest effect on Grevy's zebra presence; but (2) during dry weather periods a different suite of factors determined their landscape distribution, namely, the percentage of tree and bush density, distance to water and overall grass abundance. In addition, different Grevy's zebra demographic and reproductive classes varied in their response to environmental selective forces, thus demonstrating flexibility in their patterns of habitat selection. While we recommend more detailed studies on how abiotic and biotic interact to shape habitat selection patterns, our findings underscored the need of maintaining both dry and wet season habitats to ensure essential grazing area refugia. Our findings show that 'soft' development with controlled livestock stocking rates within the landscape will enhance Grevy's zebra conservation.

AB  - Cabo Verde is a well-known marine megafauna biodiversity hotspot in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. As a Small Island Developing State, fishing is one of its most important economic activities and a major source of animal protein. Yet, the interaction and impacts of the artisanal fisheries on shark species are poorly known in this region. To fill this gap, between April and June 2024, we conducted 152 face-to-face interviews with fishers from the 10 main fishing communities on Santiago Island, Cabo Verde. Most respondents (95%) reported the presence of sharks in their fishing grounds all year round (59%) and at certain times of the year (41%). Eighty-five percent indicated that they catch sharks, but the majority (63%) said they do so unintentionally. The catch is made up of at least 18 species of sharks, almost all of which are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Most fishers (80%) had noticed a reduction in the number of sharks over the last 15 years, attributing the cause almost unanimously to fishing (96%) mainly by the international fleet. Around half (51%) believed that it will continue to reduce over the next 15 years. Nevertheless, 33% of the fishers interviewed declared that they do not support shark conservation. Although fishers are valuable sources of information, the present results also show the need to improve fisher's perceptions of sharks and involve them in decision-making processes and management measures to reduce the impacts of artisanal fishing on endangered species.

AB  - In 1980 and 1981, eight and nine individual sika deer Cervus nippon were reintroduced in southern Hokkaido, Japan, respectively, to address population declines in this species during 1900s. As recent population growth has led to human-wildlife conflicts, this study investigated the responses of sika deer to resource availability and geomorphic factors during the summer and winter seasons in southern Hokkaido. Global positioning system-collared data collected from 2016 to 2018 were used to assess the home range patterns and habitat selection of 14 female sika deer located in Mount Esan and Shiriuchi. The core home range size was defined using a 50% kernel density estimation that indicated a larger home range in winter than summer for all deer. Habitat selection was assessed using generalized linear mixed models. The results showed variation in habitat selection between resident deer of Mount Esan and Shiriuchi, as well as migratory deer in Shiriuchi during summer. Resident deer in Mount Esan and Shriuchi preferred areas closer to crops during summer. Interaction effects revealed that migratory deer utilized natural grassland close to forest edge habitat in Shiriuchi. By contrast, resident deer in Shiriuchi selected forest edge habitat and natural grasslands close to crops. In winter, low elevation was the most important habitat factor for all deer across the study area. Thus, sika deer habitat selection depends on resource availability in summer and topographic factors in the winter.

AB  - Estimating plant biomass in rangeland ecosystems is essential to understanding carbon cycling, impacts on natural resources, and ecological functioning or structure-all of which inform sustainable land management. However, biomass estimation has been relatively understudied for the sagebrush steppe of North America, one of the continent's most widespread ecosystems. As a nondestructive alternative to direct biomass measurements, allometric models may be used to estimate aboveground plant biomass using predictor variables once models are developed. With this as our aim, we developed species-specific and multispecies models for eight common bunchgrass species in Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) plant communities. As codominant perennials, these bunchgrass species provide much of the forage for large herbivores while contributing to soil stability and carbon storage. To develop allometric models for these bunchgrass species, we used individual height, basal diameter, and tiller count as predictor variables. On average, multiple-predictor models (RMSE CV = 61%) were more effective (i.e., exhibited more agreement between predicted and actual biomass) than single-predictor models (RMSE CV = 79%). Power models (RMSE CV = 66%) were slightly more effective than exponential models (RMSE CV = 72%). Applying models to each species demonstrated that the effectiveness of multispecies (RMSE CV = 65%) versus species-specific (RMSE CV = 67%) models largely depended on the species being modeled. Combining our models with plant density resulted in an area-based biomass estimate range (2.3-26.7 g/m(2)) that generally agreed with previous studies (0.2-19 g/m(2)). It is our hope that the allometric models developed in this study will be tested on various locations and ultimately inform rangeland management throughout the big sagebrush region.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems are continuously exposed to exogenous phages, including those introduced via animal manure fertilization, yet their colonization dynamics and ecological impacts remain unclear. Using a microcosm experiment, we investigated how pig manure-derived nanosized microbiome (NSM; <0.22 mu m) influences phage-bacterial interactions, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) dissemination, and microbial evolution in paddy soil. NSM addition transiently elevated high-risk ARG abundance, particularly linked to Acinetobacter proliferation from manure. These dynamics were driven by manure-derived Acinetobacter and their associated phages/plasmids, which dominated soil phage communities despite their low initial abundance. Both Acinetobacter and their phages exhibited microdiversity shifts under environmental fluctuations, with strong native soil phage-bacterial correlations disrupted post-NSM introduction. Our findings highlight the environmental risks of pig manure-derived NSM, emphasizing Acinetobacter and their phages as key drivers of high-risk ARG spread and microbial community evolution. This underscores the need for manure pretreatment strategies to mitigate soil resistome hazards.

AB  - The Galician coast, with 1498 km of shoreline, is located in the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula. This area is the northern boundary of the Canary upwelling system, at the transition between the subtropical and subpolar regimes of the North Atlantic, which makes it of particular interest for the detection of marine ecosystem changes. Relationships between the occurrence of non-native marine fishes in this coastal area and sea surface temperature fluctuations are investigated. Information about fish species were collected from published and unpublished material recorded since 1945, and with regular monitoring data since 1983. A total of 50 new additions to the Galician marine ichthyofauna were recorded over the period 1945-2022. One of these species, Cynoscion regalis (Sciaenidae), is considered an introduced species. Most of the remaining 49 species are the result of latitudinal range expansions, including 15 species that have reached the northern limit of their distribution in the north-east Atlantic. This evidence points towards the tropicalization of the Galician fish fauna. Satellite sea-surface temperatures over the period 1982-2020 showed that Galician oceanic and coastal waters are, respectively, 0.78 +/- 0.01 degrees C and 0.32 +/- 0.01 degrees C warmer than 40 years ago. This ocean warming, added to the high productivity of the area and the oceanographic features, support the different ranges of expansion found in marine fishes, reinforcing the process of tropicalization. The increasing presence of new marine fishes in Galician waters could lead to relevant impacts on this ecosystem, like the emergence of new fish parasites and the increase of top predators and herbivorous fish among others.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the dietary habits of carnivores is essential to get ecological insights into their role in the ecosystem, potential competition with other carnivorous species, and their effect on prey populations. Genetic analysis of non-invasive samples, such as scats, can supplement behavioural or microscopic diet investigations. The objective of this study was to employ DNA metabarcoding to accurately determine the prey species in grey wolf (Canis lupus) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) scat samples collected in the Julian Alps and the Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. The primary prey of wolves were red deer (Cervus elaphus) (detected in 96% scat samples), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (68%), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) (45%). A smaller portion of their diet consisted of mesocarnivores, small mammals, and domestic animals. In contrast, the lynx diet mostly consisted of European roe deer (82%) and red deer (64%). However, small mammals and domestic animals were also present in lynx diet, albeit to a lesser extent. Our findings indicate that the dietary habits of wolves and lynx are influenced by geographical location. Snapshot dietary analyses using metabarcoding are valuable for comprehending the behaviour and ecology of predators, and for devising conservation measures aimed at sustainable management of both their natural habitats and prey populations. However, to gain a more detailed understanding of wolf and lynx dietary habits and ecological impact, it would be essential to conduct long-term genetic monitoring of their diet.

AB  - After the Last Glacial Maximum, after 20 Kya ago, in the Alpine area the environmental and climatic conditions began to change, and humans returned to the valleys. North-eastern Italy - east of Lake Garda - has provided numerous traces of these early recolonisations, but the same cannot be said for the areas to the west of Lake Garda (Lombardy and Piedmont) where only a few faint traces of Late Pleistocene and early Holocene human presence are known. The deeply stratified site at Cividate Camuno (Valle Camonica - Brescia), on the valley floor at an altitude of 275 m asl, is datable to the Late Glacial and early Holocene and is unique in the whole of north-western Italy. At the site were found an inhabited area with a Palaeolithic "hut" and an Early Mesolithic level. The archaeozoological analyses of the Palaeolithic (Late Epigravettian) levels (18.1-15.6 Kya cal BP) show different hunting strategies from those of the early Mesolithic (Sauvetterian) level (10.2-9.6 Kya cal BP), reflecting environmental variation and, hence, changes in locally available prey. The Late Palaeolithic occupation thus represents the first trace of a human presence in the western Alps since the glaciers reached the Po Plain, at least 10.000 years earlier. The members of these human groups were pioneers in an uninhabited and hostile environment who, thanks to their technical knowledge, were able to adapt to such difficult environmental conditions. They hunted ibex, which lived on the valley floor, and the deer that returned to the areas from which the glaciers receded. The Mesolithic occupation provides evidence of the subsequent adaptation of human groups to an environment that had changed thanks to the retreat of the glaciers to higher elevations and, on the valley floors, had left room for the spread of wooded areas that hosted deer, roe deer and wild boar - the favoured prey of these Mesolithic hunters.

AB  - When the Swiss National Park was founded, taking stock of the fauna and flora was a major goal. Various efforts were made to investigate insectivores and rodents, but little was published about the findings. In this article I will analyse the existing data in terms of how the small mammal fauna has developed over the last 100 years. The data reveal that species that are rare today were rare then and the common ones were quite numerous then too. The protection status has meant that former pasturing animals, mainly sheep, were replaced by wild animals like the red deer, so that the environment of the small mammals in this distinctly dry area has changed little.

AB  - Under climate change, heavy precipitation is predicted to trigger frequent shallow landslides. To accelerate vegetation recovery after landslides, planting nitrogen (N)-fixing trees is a promising technique. However, a comparison of the performance of non-legume and legume N-fixing species planted across a wide range of environments after landslides has not been conducted, which is problematic for determining the most efficient tree species for restoration. We planted the seedlings of a native legume (Lespedeza bicolor) and a native non-legume (Alnus hirsuta) tree species and monitored their survival in 15 landslide forests artificially established across a variety of environments in northern Japan. The landslides were mimicked by removing standing trees and surface soil with heavy machinery from the sites. There was a significant difference in the survival rate of seedlings between the two species. The survival rate was significantly higher for L. bicolor than for A. hirsuta. Furthermore, the performance of the two species differed along the environmental gradient of post-landslide forests. Interestingly, L. bicolor seedlings survived better in the steeper post-landslide forests, probably due to less exposure to ungulate herbivory. On the other hand, the warmer air temperature and serpentine soil negatively influenced the survival of A. hirsuta, which indicates different environmental preferences of N-fixing plants in post-landslide forests. Our results suggest that for efficient forest restoration after landslides, careful selection of N-fixing plants based on slope conditions is essential.

AB  - Aims Plants with a history of overgrazing show trait-mediated legacy effects. These legacy effects strongly influence the growth dynamics and stress tolerance of plants, thus affecting ecosystem functioning. Long-term overgrazing has dramatic effects on plant growth and carbon assimilation via asexual propagation. However, the link between nitrogen (N) absorbability and assimilation with grazing-induced plant legacy effects remains largely unknown. Methods We investigated the strength of legacy effects induced by long-term overgrazing on N uptake and metabolism in the clonal plant Leymus chinensis, and its associated changes at the physiological and molecular levels. These tests were conducted in both field and greenhouse experiments. Results The clonal offspring of overgrazed L. chinensis were significantly smaller than the control offspring, with lower individual N uptake and utilisation efficiency, indicating that the N dynamics were affected by plant legacy effects. The response ratios of root length and biomass to N patches in the clonal offspring of overgrazed L. chinensis were significantly higher than those of the control, indicating that root nutrient foraging plasticity increased in response to grazing-induced N heterogeneity. Moreover, the observed plant legacy effects decreased N acquirement but significantly increased N assimilation by increasing N resorption efficiency, with biotic stress memory activated at the enzymatic and transcriptional levels. Conclusions We propose that multigenerational exposure of perennial plants to herbivore foraging can produce a legacy effect on N uptake, which offers insights into the potential resilience of grasslands to overgrazing.

AB  - Shallow coastal waters are commonly used in shellfish aquaculture for 'grow-out' of bivalves like the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. These locations have substantially higher clam densities than the surrounding environment and attract molluscivores, requiring clammers to incorporate anti-predator materials into their grow-out gear to protect their product. However, the effectiveness of these materials against larger predators like rays remains untested. Inspired by clammer reports of predator-inflicted damage to grow-out gear, we assessed the capacity of the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari to interact with clams housed within a suite of industry standard anti-predator materials. Mesocosm experiments were conducted where rays were exposed to unprotected clams (control), clams inside polyester mesh clam bags (dipped in a latex net coating and non-dipped), and under high density polyethylene (HDPE) or chicken wire cover netting. Gear interactions were quantified from video footage throughout the course of the experiment (5 h), and clam mortality was assessed after the completion of each trial. While rays were capable of consuming clams through bags, anti-predator treatments reduced clam mortality 4- to 10-fold compared to control plots. Double-layered (i.e. bags with cover netting) treatments had the lowest clam mortality (0.6 +/- 0.1%; mean +/- SE), highlighting the utility of this type of protection in limiting ray impacts. Though not significantly greater, we noted relatively high levels of interactions with HDPE netting over other materials, which was facilitated by the material ensnaring the lower dental plate of the rays. Clammers should consider adopting multi-layered anti-predator gear; however, resecuring materials periodically remains imperative at reducing ray interactions.

AB  - The use of organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers can improve soil pH, help to maintain soil health and enable landowners to achieve organic or ecological-status agriculture. Rapeseed cake, sheep manure, and biofungal fertilizer are considered to be effective amendments to improve soil quality. However, there have been few studies on the effects of the three fertilizers on strawberry production, soil physicochemical properties, and inter-root soil microbial community structure. In this study, field experiments were conducted to investigate the differences in strawberry growth, quality, yield, and the structure and diversity of strawberry soil bacterial and fungal communities under four treatments: no organic fertilizer (CK), rapeseed cake organic fertilizer (T1), sheep manure organic fertilizer (T2) and bio-organic fertilizer (algae-optimized bacteria) (T3), the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial diversity were analyzed. Our results have shown that these three amendments promoted the growth of strawberry to some extent. The effects of available phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, sucrase, protease and urease under T2 treatment were significantly increased by 50.62%, 54.14%, 276.50%, 129.47%, 232.61%, and 232.00%, respectively, compared with the control. The soil bacterial and fungi community were the most abundant and diversified under the T2 treatment. Soil physicochemical properties and soil key enzyme activities varied significantly under different fertilizer treatments, with the soil nutrient content and soil carbon and nitrogen metabolizing enzyme activities being highest under T2 treatment. A Pearson correlation analysis showed that soil organic matter was closely related to the diversity of soil microbial communities. A redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the main variables of the bacterial community included nitrate nitrogen (NN) and rapidly available potassium (RAP), while the main variables of the fungal community included alkaline dissolved nitrogen (ADN) and ammonium nitrogen (AN). Overall, different fertilizers promoted the release and transformation of soil nutrients by affecting the structure and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in strawberry soils, which was beneficial to the supply of soil nutrients and the improvement of soil quality. The application of sheep manure organic fertilizer had the best soil improvement effect.

AB  - Insectivorous bird populations are declining globally, as are the insects upon which they depend. Furthermore, many of the plants on which those herbivorous insects depend are being displaced by the spread of agriculture and invasion by exotic species. We discuss the consequences of these declines for changes in trophic control of herbivorous insects by insectivorous birds, and the indirect effects on host plants. We first briefly review the evidence for and causes of bird and insect decline, and the current evidence for trophic control by insectivorous birds. We then hypothesize how trophic control may change under three scenarios: reduced bird populations alone, invasion by exotic insect species and conversion of native habitat to agriculture. We hypothesize that trophic control will decrease under all three scenarios, resulting in higher abundance of herbivorous insects and more frequent outbreaks, higher chronic levels of herbivory and reduced primary productivity. Because birds often specialize to some degree on certain insect species and forage preferentially in certain plant species, reduced trophic control may in turn reduce plant diversity in more native vegetation. Similarly, reduced trophic control in agriculture will require greater reliance on pesticides and, with it, the negative consequences of increased pesticide use.

AB  - Tropical forest mammal communities, especially those in ecological transition zones, are under constant threat from human activities, but in most cases there is a lack of knowledge about their status, and baseline information on their diversity is lacking in many parts of the world. The Mpem and Djim National Park in central Cameroon is a degraded forest savannah mosaic known to host several globally threatened species. As little is known about the diversity and ecology of the species there, we undertook a rapid assessment using line transects, opportunistic surveys (recce), and camera trapping from September 2021 to December 2021. Our aim was to collect information on species diversity, population status, relative abundance, activity patterns and potential threats to inform conservation priorities for park managers. After 1700 trapping days, we obtained 915 camera events (mean per location = 29.5). The species richness was 32 large, medium-sized and small mammals. The mammal species monitored belonged to 18 families and 10 orders. The family Antilopinae obtained the highest relative abundance index (RAI, 26.24) and relative frequency (RF, 0.49), and the members of this family were the most active (6392 individuals). The Blue Duiker (Philantomba monticola, Thunberg, 1789) had the highest relative abundance index (RAI, 16.47) and relative frequency (RF, 0.31). No significant difference was found between RAI, RF, and the number of events between habitat classes. Human tracks and snares were the most abundant human activity recorded (ER, 0.42 and 0.22 signs per km). The alpha diversity suggests a high diversity within the community with an almost even distribution of species and no dominance of one species over another. We estimated a lower richness but a very low probability of recording new taxa (Q = 0.99). Our results also suggest a spatio-temporal niche partitioning and niche overlap between some duikers, with the highest overlap coefficient obtained between Cephalophus callipygus, Peters, 1876, and Cephalophus dorsalis, Grey, 1846 (Delta = 0.81) and Genetta maculata, Grey, 930 vs. Genetta servalina, Pucheran, 1855 (Delta = 0.82). Our observations provide a baseline for long-term monitoring of terrestrial vertebrates in MDNP.

AB  - Fire is central to the Cape Floristic Region's highly biodiverse and disturbance-adapted Fynbos Biome. However, prehistoric fire regimes, their ecological consequences, and their relationships with large-scale climate drivers and human activities remain poorly understood. Here, we use a high-resolution sedimentary charcoal record from Verlorenvlei, a coastal lake situated on the west coast, to interrogate links between fire, climate, and pastoralism in the Fynbos Biome. Our record has a robust chronology supported by 24 radiocarbon dates and provides a continuous sedimentary sequence spanning the last 4200 years, documenting fire activity before and after the local arrival of pastoralists in the Verlorenvlei area similar to 1500 cal years BP. Fire at Verlorenvlei over the last 4200 years is variable, with relatively low activity until similar to 2000 cal years BP, after which variable but generally higher fire activity occurs until the highest period of fire activity from similar to 1450 to 1800 CE (similar to 500-150 cal years BP). The increase in fire activity similar to 2000 years ago corresponds with a shift in the diatom assemblage at Verlorenvlei from marine towards brackish and freshwater species, reflecting increased precipitation derived from a strengthening of the southern westerly winds. The peak in fire activity beginning similar to 1450 CE (similar to 500 cal years BP), near the onset of the Little Ice Age, tracks a second diatom-inferred strengthening of the westerly winds. Other southern hemisphere and Antarctic records further corroborate this increased westerly influence after similar to 2000 years. Linear regression modeling on the fire record indicates that moisture availability is the primary driver of fire at Verlorenvlei, with little evidence that human populations influenced fire. Our reconstruction suggests that fire activity at Verlorenvlei is limited by moisture availability and that wetter conditions facilitate increased vegetation (i.e., fuel) and intensified fire at this otherwise fuel-limited site. This work has implications for management and conservation decisions in response to future predictions of a warmer and drier climate along South Africa's west coast.

AB  - Biocrusts play an essential role in maintaining ecosystem stability, which is common in arid and semi-arid areas. Although there have been some previous studies on the stoichiometry of biocrust subsoil in grazing systems, further research is needed to assess the effects of varying grazing intensities. Four grazing gradients were established to investigate the change mechanism of biocrust subsoil stoichiometry under grazing conditions, considering its seasonal response. These findings revealed that biocrusts' coverage and their chlorophyll content showed a parabolic trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase in grazing intensity. At the same time, their standard response thresholds to grazing intensity ranged from 2.67 to 5.33 sheep/ha. Moreover, the premise that the biocrust is damaged by grazing trampling has become a consensus; our study found that the biocrust still played an important role, although its structure was destroyed because of its greenness (BG) increased. The influence of grazing intensity on the biocrust subsoil stoichiometry is unquestionable; in addition, they are influenced by a combination of vegetation (10% and 19%) and environmental influences (6% and 18%). Furthermore, it was observed that these changes did not compensate for the reproduction and development of biocrusts in grazing-induced trampling damage. In this study, the integrated consideration of biocrusts into the grazing system fully affirmed its essential role. Additionally, it clarified the pathways and effect of grazing on biocrusts subsoil stoichiometry, providing a new perspective and reference for developing grazing strategy on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Global fungal diversity is estimated at about 6.2 million species, but only 150 000 are currently described. Molecular studies reveal that this diversity is often underestimated, especially in less-studied regions. Phaeoclavulina, a genus of ramarioid fungi, has a wide distribution in areas with temperate and tropical climates. However, in southern South America, research on Phaeoclavulina species has been scarce, with only a few studies conducted in Argentina covering the morphology of a few species. This research aims to analyze Phaeoclavulina species in Argentina, exploring their morphology, ecological roles, and distribution. Four different ecological regions across Argentina were sampled. Molecular data (Sanger and next-generation sequencing [NGS] technology) were obtained to construct their phylogenetic relationships. Our results show a greater diversity of Phaeoclavulina than previously known. Eight taxa are described here, four of which are new species to science (Phaeoclavulina aena, P. angularis, P. prasina, and P. stelligera). Additionally, a neotypification is proposed for Phaeoclavulina camellia. For the other three species (P. articulotela, P. campoi, and P. minutispora), we provide new molecular data and elucidate their phylogenetic relationships with other previously described species. In addition, a key to species of Phaeoclavulina from Argentina and Chile is included to facilitate identification of known taxa. Finally, most Phaeoclavulina species richness is associated with tropical and subtropical forests.

AB  - Sea urchins are keystone herbivores in many marine benthic habitats and can significantly influence coral-algae phase shifts and reef carbonate budgets. Hall Bank Reef in Western Australia is a unique high latitude reef with high hermatypic coral cover but lacking macroalgae and soft corals. Since the reef status is thought to result from grazing of the urchin Centrostephanus tenuispinus, this study was focused on evaluating bio-erosion by C. tenuispinus with respect to size structure and seasonality. Monthly samples of urchins were collected during 2014-2016 and gut composition was analysed. Gut evacuation rates were calculated using urchins dissected at time intervals up to 96 h. Reworked CaCO3 was calculated using caged urchins in a nearby seagrass bed. Mean percentages of organic, CaCO3, and siliceous components in C. tenuispinus gut contents were 86.3 +/- 3.2, 10.3 +/- 2.8, and 3.4 +/- 1.5%, respectively. Gut evacuation rates for autumn, winter, spring, and summer were 0.70, 0.24, 0.48, and 0.72 day (-1). Bio-erosion rates were significantly higher in summer (3.5 g CaCO3 m(-2) day(-1)) than in winter (1.3 g CaCO3 m(-2) day(-1)) and higher rates recorded for large urchins. Urchin bio-erosion was 1 kg CaCO3 m(-2) annum(-1). Variation in food ingestion rates in response to seawater temperature changes was found to be the main driver for differences in seasonal bio-erosion rates, which likely contribute to the absence of macroalgae and the maintenance of high coral cover on Hall Bank Reef. This study provides baseline data on bio-erosion by a sea urchin at Hall Bank Reef, which will be essential in monitoring and managing reefs in this region, especially under current trends in climate change.

AB  - Domestication is an intriguing evolutionary process. Many domestic populations are subjected to strong human-mediated selection, and when some individuals return to the wild, they are again subjected to selective forces associated with new environments. Generally, these feral populations evolve into something different from their wild predecessors and their members typically possess a combination of both wild and human selected traits. Feralisation can manifest in different forms on a spectrum from a wild to a domestic phenotype. This depends on how the rewilded domesticated populations can readapt to natural environments based on how much potential and flexibility the ancestral genome retains after its domestication signature. Whether feralisation leads to the evolution of new traits that do not exist in the wild or to convergence with wild forms, however, remains unclear. To address this question, we performed population genomic, olfactory, dietary, and gut microbiota analyses on different populations of Sus scrofa (wild boar, hybrid, feral and several domestic pig breeds). Porcine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis shows that the feral population represents a cluster distinctly separate from all others. Its members display signatures of past artificial selection, as demonstrated by values of F-ST in specific regions of the genome and bottleneck signature, such as the number and length of runs of homozygosity. Generalised F-ST values, reacquired olfactory abilities, diet, and gut microbiota variation show current responses to natural selection. Our results suggest that feral pigs are an independent evolutionary unit which can persist so long as levels of human intervention remain unchanged.

AB  - Interactions between people and large carnivores on shared landscapes can have harmful social and ecological consequences. Human-carnivore coexistence depends on an assemblage of sociological factors including effective management institutions that address the social costs of carnivore conservation and promote tolerance toward wildlife. In East Africa, large carnivores are particularly troublesome for herders who depend on livestock for subsistence and wellbeing. This paper provides an overview of human-hyena conflict in the Tarangire ecosystem of northern Tanzania. It presents descriptive results from a questionnaire survey (n = 1076) administered as part of an anthropological study (2019-2020; 2022; 2023) of human-wildlife interactions across twelve villages inhabited by Maasai agropastoralists. The survey instrument was designed through community-based participatory research methods to convey herder concerns about the impacts of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) on the livestock economy. Based on the perceptions and local ecological knowledge of Maasai interlocutors, the paper provides an overview of the spatial and temporal patterns of human-hyena interactions. Perceived frequencies of hyena attacks on kraaled livestock were unevenly distributed geographically, with those homesteads surrounding Manyara Ranch most heavily affected. Based on herder-reported livestock losses, the costs of depredation by spotted hyenas across the study area were estimated at approximately USD 904.84 per household per year. Most homesteads lacked fortified bomas and would benefit from the provision of lights and fencing materials to improve kraal structures. The paper's central finding is that spotted hyenas represent a pressing, everyday concern for local pastoralists. Unsurprisingly, herders despise hyenas and are intolerant of sharing landscapes with them. For carnivore conservation outside protected areas to thrive in Tanzania, conservationists and policy makers must engage more meaningfully with the lived experiences of local herders who bear the brunt of conservation costs on their livelihoods.

AB  - 1. Reintroduction projects, which are an important tool in threatened species conservation, are becoming more complex, often involving the translocation of multiple species. Ecological theory predicts that the sequence and timing of reintroductions will play an important role in their success or failure. Following the removal of sheep, goats and feral cats, the Western Australian government is sequentially reintroducing 13 native fauna species to restore the globally important natural and cultural values of Dirk Hartog Island (DHI).
   2. We use ensembles of ecosystem models to compare 23 alternative reintroduction strategies on DHI, in Western Australia. The reintroduction strategies differ in the order, timing and location of releases on the island. Expert elicitation informed the model structure, allowing for use of different presumed species interaction networks which explicitly incorporated uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics.
   3. Our model ensembles predict that almost all of the species (similar to 12.5 of 13, on average) will successfully establish in the ecosystem studied, regardless of which reintroduction strategy is undertaken. The project can therefore proceed with greater confidence and flexibility regarding the reintroduction strategy. However, the identity of the at-risk species varies between strategies, and depends on the structure of the species interaction network, which is quite uncertain. The model ensembles also offer insights into why some species fail to establish on DHI, predicting that most unsuccessful reintroductions will be the result of competitive interactions with extant species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our model ensembles allow for the comparison of outcomes between reintroduction strategies and between different species interaction networks. This framework allows for inclusion of high uncertainty in dynamics. Finally, an ensemble modelling approach also creates a foundation for formal adaptive management as reintroduction projects proceed.

AB  - A 6-week laboratory experiment exposed juvenile Ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis to visual and chemical cues of either a predator, a herbivore or a null control (sea water) and found no effect of predator cues on prey morphology (proportion of ocellus to eye diameter, body depth, standard length and fin area). Nonetheless, behaviour was significantly affected by predator presence, with prey less active and taking half as many feeding strikes when exposed to predators compared to fish from the null control. The presence of a herbivore also affected prey behaviour similar to that of the predator, suggesting that the presence of a non-predator may have important effects on development.

AB  - Ongoing climatic changes are one of the most serious environmental problems in Mongolia. Although research on the effect of heat stress on livestock was carried out in a barn or laboratory, the grazing behavior of livestock in rangeland is not well investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of climatic conditions on sheep grazing behavior in the Mongolian rangeland. We used climatic data on air temperature and precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a vegetation factor. A bite counter and global positioning system were attached to the sheep to measure bite rate and moving distance as factors of sheep grazing behavior. To examine the effect of climatic conditions on the grazing behavior of sheep on a daily scale, we used generalized linear mixed models of daily bite rate, walking velocity, and bite rate/walking velocity with daily NDVI, temperature, precipitation, and the interaction of temperature and precipitation as fixed factors, and individual sheep as a random explanatory factor. We also conducted a regression analysis of each behavior with a mean temperature every 3 h for the within-day scale analysis. We observed a statistically insignificant effect of temperature on the bite rate of grazing sheep on a between-day scale and a positive effect on bite rate within a day scale, whereas temperature significantly decreased the walking velocity on both between-day and within-day scales. Precipitation did not affect mean bite rate or walking velocity values on either scale. The air temperature was the major climatic factor influencing the grazing behavior of sheep in semi-arid environments.

AB  - California, USA, is home to 3 subspecies of North American elk (Cervus canadensis): Roosevelt (C. c. roosevelti), Rocky Mountain (C. c. nelsoni), and tule (C. c. nannodes). Effective management requires a baseline understanding of each subspecies' range, admixture zones, and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. To address these questions, we genotyped 1,271 individual elk from California (n = 1,204) and reference populations of Rocky Mountain and Roosevelt elk from Nevada (n = 32) and Oregon (n = 35), USA. Using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we detected admixture between Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk at a contact zone in northern California, and between Roosevelt and tule elk in north-coastal California and central-coastal California. We identified a genetically distinct population of Roosevelt elk in northwestern California, likely reflecting the remnant population that survived a large demographic decline from overhunting during the 1800s. Tule elk exhibited lower levels of heterozygosity (0.44 +/- 0.03 [SD]) and allelic richness (2.9 +/- 0.2) than Rocky Mountain (0.58 +/- 0.05, 4.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and Roosevelt (0.50 +/- 0.06, 4.4 +/- 0.6, respectively) elk. Among tule elk populations, heterozygosity varied, with the lowest heterozygosity (0.23 +/- 0.05) corresponding to the oldest enclosed herd used over the past century as a source of translocations. Among tule elk populations, genetic structure revealed several cases of successful and unsuccessful reintroduction or augmentation attempts. Results provide an essential baseline for future monitoring and decisions about harvest management, translocations to preserve genetic diversity, and landscape-level conservation planning to maintain, enhance, or obstruct connectivity of elk populations. Genome-wide sequencing and analyses are needed to quantify inbreeding absolutely and assess genetic load and the age of admixture where subspecies currently exchange genes.

AB  - Quantification of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) is a popular non-invasive technique for monitoring wildlife's response to stressors, demanding an understanding of the stability of fGCM concentrations post-defaecation to ensure comparability of determined fGCM values across samples. To provide species-specific recommendations for the duration within which sampling can take place, we measured the rate at which the fGCM concentrations of nine different species changed throughout a 7-day period post-defaecation. In this study, we explored the temporal dynamics of fGCM concentrations in nine species across three feeding classes (ruminants, hindgut fermenters and carnivores): impala (Aepyceros melampus), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), plains zebra (Equus quagga), African elephant (Loxodonta africana), white rhino (Ceratotherium simum), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) and leopard (Panthera pardus). Utilizing enzyme immunoassays already established for each of the focal species, we identified broader feeding class-specific patterns. All herbivores exhibited a significant decrease in fGCM concentrations over time, starting from 6 h (impala) to 48 h (giraffe, blue wildebeest, white rhino and African elephant) post-defaecation. For carnivores, concentrations remained fairly comparable for 12-24 h, after which fGCM concentrations either decreased (spotted hyena), increased (leopard) or remained stable (cheetah), with notable variation in triplicate concentrations (cheetah and leopard). These findings offer insights into scheduling faecal sampling for endocrine monitoring, particularly from free-roaming wildlife, to ensure comparability of determined hormone metabolite concentrations. Furthermore, the species-specific variation in fGCM concentration post-defaecation demonstrated in this study underlines the necessity to investigate every new species to ensure accurate and comparable results. Future studies ought to investigate how the mass of collected material, sex and drying methodologies affect the measurement of fGCMs post-defaecation.

AB  - Polystyrene micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are increasingly found in terrestrial environments, posing risks across the food web. However, the potential impacts of MNPs transfer on plant-insect interactions remains largely unknown. In this study, consumption of willow plants (Salix maizhokunggarensis) exposed to 10.0 mg/L MNPs for 21 days inhibited survival and reduced body weight in Plagiodera versicolora larvae unlike those exposed to lower concentrations or shorter durations (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/L MNPs for 7 or 14 days). MNPs exposure increased lignin content and leaf thickness in willows, leading to decreased leaf consumption and increased mouthpart wear in P. versicolora larvae. Transcriptome and gut microbiota analyses revealed significant downregulation of genes related to digestion, intestinal homoeostasis, immunity, and growth/development along with profound alterations in gut microbiota composition. Notably, the abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas increased significantly. The gut barrier was disrupted, allowing gut bacteria to translocate into the haemolymph, accelerating larval mortality. Overall, MNPs altered plant physiology, making willow plants unsuitable for herbivore consumption and indirectly influenced herbivore survival by modulating gut bacteria. These findings offer novel insights into the cascading ecological effects and risks of MNPs, highlighting potential impacts on plant-herbivore interactions, biodiversity, and ecosystem health in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Simple Summary Embryos can be produced from prepubertal animals using laparoscopic ovum pickup combined with in vitro embryo production technologies. However, due to their young age and unique reproductive physiology, there is currently very limited knowledge about what factors may affect the success of these programs in Mediterranean water buffalo. Here, we assessed how results are affected by season, age, individual variation and choice of sire used for fertilization. Specifically, we found that season and age only had limited impacts, but there were large variations between individual donors and sires. In addition, we assessed what factors can affect pregnancy rates after transferring the resulting embryos into recipient animals and found that regardless of number of embryos transferred, fresh or vitrified, all variables assessed were compatible with the establishment of pregnancies. Embryos from prepubertal water buffalo can be produced using laparoscopic ovum pickup (LOPU) and in vitro embryo production (IVEP). However, to date, it is unclear what factors and environmental conditions can affect LOPU-IVEP efficiency in prepubertal animals, especially buffalo. In this study, we explored the impact of season, age and individual variation among female donor animals, as well as the effect of the sire used for in vitro fertilization. Donor animals between 2 and 6 months of age were stimulated using gonadotropins prior to LOPU, which was performed at two-week intervals. Following in vitro maturation and fertilization, the resulting embryos were then cultured to the blastocyst stage until they were either vitrified or transferred into recipient animals. The number of follicles available for aspiration and embryo development rates was stable throughout the year. As animals became older, there was a slight trend for fewer COCs recovered from LOPU and better embryo development. There was a large individual variation in both ovarian response and the developmental competence of oocytes among donors. The bull used for fertilization also had a significant impact on embryo development. Upon embryo transfer, pregnancy rates were not affected by the number of embryos transferred per recipient. The best pregnancy rates were achieved when transferring blastocysts, compared to compact morula or hatched blastocysts. Finally, vitrification had no effect on pregnancy rate compared to fresh embryos.

AB  - Livestock grazing strongly influences the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in grasslands. However, whether the changes occurring in SOC content under different intensities of continuous summer long grazing are associated with the changes in microbially-derived necromass C remains unclear. Here, we established a sheep grazing experiment in northern China in 2004 with four different stocking rates. Soil samples were collected after 17 years of grazing and analyzed for physical, chemical, and microbial characteristics. Grazing decreased SOC and microbial necromass carbon (MNC). Notably, grazing also diminished contributions of MNC to SOC. MNC declined with decreasing plant carbon inputs with degradation of the soil environment. Direct reductions in microbial necromass C, which indirectly reduced SOC, resulted from reduced in plant C inputs and microbial abundance and diversity. Our study highlights the key role of stocking rate in governing microbial necromass C and SOC and the complex relationships these variables.

AB  - Predicting species interactions (links) within ecological networks is crucial for advancing our understanding of ecosystem functioning and responses of communities to environmental changes. Transductive link prediction models are often used but are constrained by sparse, incomplete data and are limited to single networks. We addressed these issues using an inductive link prediction (ILP) approach to predict interactions within and between ecological networks by pooling data across communities and applying transfer learning. We evaluated the performance of our ILP model on 538 networks across four community types: plant-seed disperser, plant-pollinator, host-parasite and plant-herbivore, and found that it achieved higher precision and F1 scores than transductive models. However, cross-community prediction efficacy varied, with better performance when plant-seed disperser and host-parasite networks were used as training and test sets, compared with when plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore networks were used. Finally, leveraging the generalizability of ILP, we developed a pretrained model that ecologists could readily use to make instant predictions for their networks. This Article highlights the potential of ILP to improve prediction of ecological interactions, enabling generalization across diverse ecological contexts and bridging critical data gaps.

AB  - Galled leaves are very frequent in southern beech (Nothofagus pumilio) forests. We compared the consumption of leaves (galled and ungalled) by two detritivores and the effect of this consumption on detritivore nutrient content. The amphipod Hyalella curvispina and larvae of the caddisfly Monocosmoecus hyadesi were fed with two diet treatments for 30 days: (1) ungalled leaves and (2) galled leaves. Fungal biomass, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) content were measured in leaves and detritivores, and C:N:P molar ratios were calculated. We hypothesized that galls produce changes in litter nutrient content, affecting invertebrate consumption and nutrient content. Galled leaves had higher N and ergosterol content, and lower C:N ratios than ungalled leaves. Galled leaf consumption was higher than the ungalled for both detritivores. The two species differed in the content of N and C (caddisfly > amphipod) and P (caddisfly < amphipod). The N:P ratio of the amphipods was similar to the ungalled leaf ratio and increased when fed on galled leaves. In contrast, the N:P ratio of the caddisflies was considerably higher than the ungalled leaves and decreased when fed on galled leaves. Galls alter nutrient content in leaves and increase fungal biomass. Both detritivore species were highly homeostatic with regard to C:N ratio, but caddisflies could overcome the limited P content by increasing consumption. We highlight the impact of galls on aquatic detritivores, which in turn are relevant in forested streams for recycling organic matter and cascading effects through brown detritus-based aquatic food webs.

AB  - Simple Summary Pollination and biological pest control by insects are crucial ecosystem services for agriculture. The activity of pollinators and natural enemies (natural pest control providers), is influenced by land-use and by interactions among these organisms. However, little is known about the combined effects of such factors on the activity of these beneficial organisms and on their ultimate effects on crop yield. We studied how the characteristics of natural habitats, nearby vegetation and the presence of herbivorous pests affect pollination, natural pest control and seed set by model plants. The study was conducted in a Mediterranean agro-ecosystem, where we placed caged and uncaged potted model plants that were either aphid-infested or aphid-free. We quantified the activity of pollinators on model plant flowers, aphid predation and parasitism by natural enemies, as well as fruit and seed set. Our findings revealed a notably stronger positive effect of natural areas on pollinator activity when plants were infested with aphids compared to aphid-free plants. This suggests a potentially crucial role of natural habitats in lessening the negative impact of aphid infestation on pollination services. These results highlight the complex effects of land-use on pollinators, natural enemies and plant productivity.Abstract Pollinators and natural enemies are essential ecosystem service providers influenced by land-use and by interactions between them. However, the understanding of the combined impacts of these factors on pollinator and natural enemy activities and their ultimate effects on plant productivity remains limited. We investigated the effects of local and landscape vegetation characteristics and the presence of herbivorous pests on pollination and biological control services and their combined influence on phytometer seed set. The study was conducted in a Mediterranean agro-ecosystem, encompassing ten shrubland plots spanning a land-use gradient. Within each plot, we placed caged and uncaged potted phytometer plants that were either aphid-infested or aphid-free. We quantified insect flower visitation, aphid predation and parasitism rates, and fruit and seed set. We found scale-dependent responses of pollinators and natural enemies to land-use characteristics. Flower species richness had a positive impact on aphid parasitism rates but a negative effect on pollinator activity. Notably, we found a more pronounced positive effect of natural areas on pollinator activity in aphid-infested compared to aphid-free plants, indicating a potentially critical role of natural habitats in mitigating the adverse effects of aphid infestation on pollination services. These results highlight the complex and interactive effects of land-use on pollinators and natural enemies, with significant implications for plant productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary Tillandsia recurvata is an epiphyte that contains adequate protein and energy levels regardless of the season and can be used as forage for small ruminants. We evaluated the effects of substituting sorghum stubble for T. recurvata in adult goats for 89 d, including an adaptation period of 14 d, at three different levels: 0% (control), 30%, and 60%. At the last phase of the trial, control goats gained more weight than goats consuming T. recurvata. Overall, the metabolic status was similar among treatments, whereas some variables tested of the complete blood count differed among treatments. Interestingly, the inclusion of T. recurvata in goats' diets at 30% gained or at 60% decreased 1% live weight; without signs of health disturbance. Using up to 60% T. recurvata in the diet did not negatively affect animal health; however, under the conditions of this study, supplemental protein would be required when T. recurvata completely replaced sorghum stubble. The use of T. recurvata as a supplement for goats would improve the nutrition of grazing goats in the dry season compared to the current diet obtained from arid rangelands and would alleviate host trees invaded by this aggressive epiphyte. Tillandsia recurvata is an epiphyte that grows on the canopy of many trees in tropical and subtropical areas of America. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of partial or complete substitution of sorghum stubble with T. recurvata on liveweight change, metabolic profile, and complete blood count of goats fed increasing levels (0, 30, and 60%, dry matter basis) of T. recurvata. Thirty non-pregnant three-year-old, non-lactating, healthy mixed-breed goats, ten animals per treatment (T0, T30, and T60), were adapted to diets and facilities for 14 days (d-14). Blood samples were collected at d-15, 28, and 56. At the last phase of the trial (from days 67 on), control goats tended to gain more (p = 0.09) weight than their counterparts consuming T. recurvata. Plasma protein, glucose, triglycerides, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations did not differ among dietary treatments (p > 0.05). Dietary treatment influenced red blood cells (higher for T60; p < 0.01), white blood cells (higher for T30; p < 0.05), mean corpuscular volume (higher for T0; p < 0.001), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (higher for T0; p < 0.01), although not the rest of the blood variables (p > 0.05). The hematocrit percentage tended to be higher (p = 0.06) in T30 than T0 and T60. It was concluded that replacing sorghum stubble with T. recurvata did not modify the metabolic status and maintained live weight of goats. Nevertheless, the use of T. recurvata as feed for goats would improve the nutrition of these animals in the dry season compared to the current diet obtained from an arid rangeland, reducing production costs, and would alleviate the damage caused by this aggressive epiphyte to host trees.

AB  - Rewilding can play a vital role in safeguarding biodiversity, with the grazing pressure exerted by large ungulates and controlled by their predators being a significant factor, particularly in European contexts. Domestic horses are becoming integral to such ungulates' biomass, but they may differ from truly wild species due to their domesticated origin. This raises concerns about whether feral horses retain adequate antipredator behaviours, especially in the presence of expanding, large predators like wolves. The field of antipredator behaviour research is hampered by inconsistent results and a lack of standardisation, and the behaviour of free-ranging horses remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a playback experiment on semi-feral Exmoor ponies (n = 97) in the Czech Republic, exposing them to wolf howls, deer rut calls, and static noise as a control. We assessed alert behaviour and herd grouping while accounting for variables such as herd size, sex, time of day, weather conditions, environment type, presence of other ungulates, and habituation effects. Over 70% of the ponies exhibited alert behaviour in response to both wolf and deer calls. Although the magnitude of responses did not differ significantly between wolf and deer calls, both elicited distinct reactions compared to the control. Most of the studied external factors significantly affected the observed alert responses, highlighting that they must be carefully considered in such studies since these may explain the conflicting results observed in previous studies. The significant behavioural differences in reaction to the sounds indicate that the horses can differentiate them and likely still possess some innate memory, as reported in other ungulates. This is a positive sign towards reintroduction. Future research should carefully consider the validity of the testing environment, habituation effects, and other external factors to ensure robust results.

AB  - Trophic cascades - indirect effects of predators that propagate down through food webs - have been extensively documented in many ecosystem types. It has also been shown that predator diversity can mediate these trophic cascades and, separately, that herbivore biomass can influence the stability of primary producers. However, whether predator diversity can cause cascading effects on the stability of lower trophic levels has not yet been studied. We conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment and a field mesocosm experiment manipulating the presence and coexistence of two heteropteran predators and measuring their effects on zooplankton herbivores and phytoplankton basal resources. We predicted that if the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, for example by size, then the co-presence of the predators would reduce zooplankton prey mass and lead to (1) increased biomass of, and (2) decreased temporal variability of phytoplankton basal resources. We present evidence that the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, leading to a synergistic suppression of zooplankton. In turn, this enhanced zooplankton suppression led to only a weak, non-significant increase in the central tendency of phytoplankton biomass, but significantly reduced its variability. Our results demonstrate that predator diversity may indirectly stabilize basal resource biomass via a "diversity-stability trophic cascade," seemingly dependent on predator complementarity, even when there is no significant classic trophic cascade altering the central tendency of biomass. Therefore predator diversity, especially if correlated with diversity of prey use, could play a role in regulating ecosystem stability. This link between predator diversity and producer stability has implications for conservation and for potential biological control methods to improve crop yield reliability.

AB  - Exploring the processes of interspecific relationships is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance. Visually detecting interspecies relationships of large mammals is limited by the reconstruction accuracy of the environmental structure and the timely detection of animal behavior. Hence, we used backpack laser scanning (BLS) to reconstruct the high-resolution three-dimensional environmental structure to simulate the process of a predator approaching its prey, indicating that predator tigers would reduce their visibility by changing their behavior. Wild boars will nibble off about 5m of branches around the nest in order to create better visibility around the nest, adopting an anti-predation strategy to detect possible predators in advance. Our study not only points out how predator-prey relationships are affected by visibility as the environment mediates it, but also provides an operable framework for exploring interspecific relationships from a more complex dimension. Finally, this study provides a new perspective for exploring the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - The sustainable development of the hog industry has significant implications for agricultural development, farmers' income, and the daily lives of residents. Precise hog supply forecasts are essential for both government to ensure food security and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions. This study proposes an integrated framework for hog supply forecast. Granger causality analysis is utilized to simultaneously investigate the causal relationships among piglet, breeding sow, and hog supply, as well as to ascertain the uncertain time lags associated with these variables, facilitating the extraction of valuable time lag features. The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is leveraged to decompose hog supply into three components, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are utilized to forecast the trends, i.e., seasonality and residuals, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted using monthly data from all the large-scale pig farms in Chongqing, China, covering the period from July 2019 to November 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the other five baseline models with more than 90% reduction in Mean Squared Logarithm (MSL) loss. The inclusion of the piglet feature can enhance the accuracy of hog supply forecasts by 42.1% MSL loss reduction. Additionally, the findings reveal statistical time lag periods of 4-6 months for piglet and 11-13 months for breeding sow, with significance levels of 99%. Finally, policy recommendations are proposed to promote the sustainability of the pig industry, thereby driving the sustainable development of both upstream and downstream sectors of the swine industry and ensuring food security.

AB  - Heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous contaminants that frequently cooccur in coastal environments. These contaminants can have negative impacts on the health and stability of marine and coastal ecosystems, affecting both the organisms themselves and the humans who consume them. A coastal industrial park in central Chile, housing a coal thermal power plant and other industrial activities, contributes to such pollution of coastal waters; however, neither the spatial alongshore distribution of heavy metals and PAHs, nor an assessment of their ecological effects on the biota have been systematically documented to date. In this paper, we present evidence regarding the direct negative effect of contamination by heavy metals and PAHs on the early life stages of kelps-being extremely harmful to their population persistence near highly polluted sites-as well as the indirect effects of their transference through the food web to higher trophic levels, leading to negative consequences for the feeding intake, growth, fertility, and larval development of marine herbivores that consume the contaminated seaweed. Likewise, the dispersion of contaminants by ocean currents can exacerbate the effects of pollution, having an adverse influence on marine ecosystem health even at sites far from the pollution source. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the distribution patterns and extent of pollution along the coast to understand the impact of heavy metals and PAHs pollution on seaweed populations and the food web. It is considered critical for the development of effective environmental policies and regulations to protect these ecosystems and the people who depend on them.

AB  - Measurements of reproductive and stress-related hormones in keratinous tissues (e.g. hair, claws, hooves, baleen) can provide a record of stress and reproductive response in wildlife. We evaluated a method to collect keratin tissue from hooves of immobilized moose (Alces alces) and validated enzyme immunoassays for measuring cortisol and progesterone in hooves and hair. We also measured the annual growth and wear rates of moose hooves. Progesterone (range: 1.0-43.7 pg/mg) and cortisol (range: 0.05-2.9 pg/mg) were measurable and showed variation among hoof samples and moose. Pregnant females had twice as high progesterone concentrations (18.00 +/- 3.73 pg/mg) from hoof sample locations post breeding compared to non-pregnant moose (9.40 +/- 0.25 pg/mg). Annual hoof growth differed between the front (5.58 +/- 0.12 cm) and rear (4.73 +/- 0.13 cm) hooves and varied by season with higher growth rates during summer which decreased into autumn and winter. Adult female hooves represented between 1.6 and 2.1 years of growth and included up to two reproductive cycles. We established a method to estimate hoof growth rate and applied this to postmortem samples and were able to detect previous pregnancies. Shoulder guard hairs grew between August and March including during late gestation; however, hair progesterone concentrations (range: 2-107.1 pg/mg) were not related to reproductive state. Hair cortisol concentrations in our study (range: 0.2-15.9 pg/mg) were within the range of values previously reported for cervids. Our study supports the use of hooves for longitudinal sampling and measuring reproductive and stress-related hormones, providing a new tool for tracking reproductive events and understanding what variables may contribute to population level changes in reproduction.

AB  - The structure of forest mammal communities appears surprisingly consistent across the continental tropics, presumably due to convergent evolution in similar environments. Whether such consistency extends to mammal occupancy, despite variation in species characteristics and context, remains unclear. Here we ask whether we can predict occupancy patterns and, if so, whether these relationships are consistent across biogeographic regions. Specifically, we assessed how mammal feeding guild, body mass and ecological specialization relate to occupancy in protected forests across the tropics. We used standardized camera-trap data (1002 camera-trap locations and 2-10 years of data) and a hierarchical Bayesian occupancy model. We found that occupancy varied by regions, and certain species characteristics explained much of this variation. Herbivores consistently had the highest occupancy. However, only in the Neotropics did we detect a significant effect of body mass on occupancy: large mammals had lowest occupancy. Importantly, habitat specialists generally had higher occupancy than generalists, though this was reversed in the Indo-Malayan sites. We conclude that habitat specialization is key for understanding variation in mammal occupancy across regions, and that habitat specialists often benefit more from protected areas, than do generalists. The contrasting examples seen in the Indo-Malayan region probably reflect distinct anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Mitigating exotic species invasions requires reliable information on abundance and source-sink dynamics to evaluate effectiveness of control efforts. Despite being present in the southeastern United States for centuries, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) continue to invade new areas, including the Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge (NNWR) in Mississippi, a forested landscape with an emerging wild pig population. Considering the early stage of invasion, we designed and implemented a non-invasive hair sampling technique to estimate abundance and relatedness of wild pigs within the NNWR. Following 8-week sampling periods in 2021 (n = 160 samples) and 2022 (n = 159 samples), we identified 38 and 26 unique individuals, respectively, although recapture rates were too low to yield precise abundance estimates. We also identified low heterozygosity indicating high relatedness among our population which likely reflected lack of barrier features to gene flow and/or a limited number of external source populations. Finally, we observed positive trends in viable samples collected relative to sampling week, suggesting more optimal sampling period(s) may exist (e.g., autumn). We also acknowledge that use of grain in more accessible areas rather than our remote approach using scent-only attractants may increase hair snare attractiveness and wild pig encounters, while permitting increased sampling frequency. Collectively, these modifications (i.e., altered season, bait type, and access) provide viable pathways to increase precision for abundance estimates. When used concomitantly with ongoing monitoring and control efforts, non-invasive hair sampling will contribute to a more holistic understanding of this exotic species and better inform management actions.

AB  - Fish are the key groups for maintaining the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. However, due to limitations in existing fish survey techniques, there has been insufficient systematic research on fish resources and community structures in the context of Yangtze River fish conservation. Given this, taking the upstream area of the Taihu Lake Basin, a region with a developed freshwater fishery in China, as a case study, this research adopted environmental DNA (eDNA) technology to monitor the structural characteristics, diversity, and spatial distribution of fish communities in different water body types. The research findings showed that a total of 88 fish species were detected at 127 monitoring sites, with 79 species in rivers, 71 species in lakes, 73 species in reservoirs, and 57 species in streams. Among them, the fish composition in rivers and lakes presented homogenisation, with pollution-tolerant fish such as Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpio, and Aristichthys nobilis being the dominant species. Although the fish communities in some reservoirs and streams also showed a slight trend of homogenisation, more fish species with higher water quality requirements, like the Rhinogobius giurinus and Odontobutis potamophila were retained. In areas with a high degree of human aggregation, namely the Yangtze River-the Grand Canal (CY), the Tao Lake-Ge Lake area (TG), and the area flowing into Lake Taihu (RT), the fish communities were dominated by tolerant fish species. In the Maoshan-Tianmu Mountain area (MT), where human activities were sparsely dispersed, the fish communities were relatively richer in clear-water fish species. TN, EC, pH, WT, and the natural shoreline retention rate (NSR) were the key environmental influencing factors for the composition of fish communities in the study area. The fish communities in rivers and lakes were more significantly affected by water environmental quality factors such as TN, EC, pH, and WT, while the fish communities in reservoirs and streams were more influenced by the aquatic habitat factor NSR. There was a significantly positive correlation between NSR and the fish diversity in rivers and lakes, and a significantly negative correlation between NSR and that in reservoirs and streams. This study has completed the inventory of fish species resources in the upper reaches of the Taihu Lake Basin, laid a scientific foundation for the restoration and protection of fish resources in the Taihu Lake Basin, and contributed to the sustainable protection and restoration of the aquatic ecosystem in the Taihu Lake Basin.

AB  - Hunting is an important threat to tropical wildlife, yet many people are dependent on forest fauna for protein provisioning. We analyzed abundances of terrestrial mammal and bird species around four indigenous villages in the south of Suriname, using camera trap data and the Royle-Nichols abundance model. We hypothesized that hunting pressure increases with decreasing distance to a village and with increasing village size (expressed as cropland area). We detected 24 animal species in all villages combined, including several rare species. For 11 of the 24 species, we were able to examine if and how distance to a village and village size related to local abundances and found a positive effect of distance to village on local abundances in five species, and a negative effect of village size in one species. Because villages, and thus hunting, affect local abundances of terrestrial bird and mammal species in our study, we recommend monitoring forest fauna in areas where people are highly dependent on animals for food provisioning.

AB  - Unsustainable hunting practices can alter population dynamics, driving biodiversity declines, which leads to 'empty forests'. Understanding hunting behaviour, including motivations for hunting and relationships with market drivers, and access to hunting grounds are important to develop affirmative policies to stem biodiversity loss. Here, we investigate community hunting behaviour and motivations in the context of road network expansion.<br /> We focus on the Temburong District, Brunei Darussalam, which retains large tracts of undegraded rainforests. Cultural hunting has a long history in the region, which few studies have investigated. In 2022, following preliminary research that suggested widespread hunting across Brunei's forests, we conducted household surveys (n = 32) and in-depth interviews (n = 3) with Temburong residents from multiple ethnic backgrounds to characterise hunting behaviours. We contextualised these surveys and interviews within the recently completed construction of Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien (SOAS) Bridge, which we expected would increase human mobility and thus hunting access.<br /> Applying a thematic analysis, we characterised hunting in Temburong. Hunting motivations varied greatly, but the primary motivation for hunting was non-market wild meat consumption, with target species including bearded pig, muntjac and mousedeer, which were primarily snare caught. Hunting had a high level of cultural importance in the region. While hunting is still present in the region, its cultural importance appears to be waning. Our data also present perceptions that the SOAS Bridge may be facilitating access to Temburong's forests for novel hunters, potentially increasing hunting pressure.<br /> Policy implications. In Southeast Asia, narratives around hunting often centre on overexploitation and trade. We show that in Brunei, hunting has cultural importance, particularly among Indigenous communities, requiring more careful planning for mitigation strategies aiming to conserve biodiversity to avoid marginalisation of vulnerable communities. Road network expansion may attract new and distant hunters, while complex factors linked to generational changes may reduce hunting pressure in Brunei's forests. Our research thus highlights that local, context-specific research is required for effective decision-making surrounding both hunting and development.

AB  - Aim: To predict the distribution of suitable habitats for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) at a highly fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia and to identify the potential connectivity between suitable habitat patches.
   Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4.
   Results: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks.
   Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning in conservation, management and development.

AB  - Accurate estimation of forest biomass and its growth potential could be important in assessing the mitigation potential of forest for climate change. However, severe mechanical disturbance such as stem breakage imposed significant changes to tree individuals in biomass structure, which could bring new inaccuracy to biomass estimation. In order to investigate the influence of severe mechanical disturbance on tree biomass accumulation and to construct accurate models for biomass and carbon storage estimation, this paper analyzed the relationship between tree size and biomass for China fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) which suffered stem breakage from, and survived, an ice storm. The performance of independent variables diameter (D) and height (H) of China fir, were also compared in biomass estimation. The results showed that D as an independent variable was adequate in biomass estimation for China fir, and tree height was not necessary in this case. Root growth was faster in China fir which had suffered breakage in the main stem by the ice storm, than China fir which were undamaged for at least 7 years after the mechanical disturbance, which, in addition to biomass loss in stem, caused changes in the allocation pattern of the damaged trees. This suggests biomass models constructed before severe mechanical disturbance would be less suitable in application for a subsequent period, and accurate estimations of biomass and forest carbon storage would take more effort.

AB  - Agroforestry has a potentially important role in helping agriculture address both the climate and biodiversity crises. It provides a means of producing additional marketable goods from agricultural land and enhancing biodiversity at the same time as increasing carbon sequestration and, in silvo-pastural systems, reducing carbon emissions if livestock stocking rates are reduced. However, the uptake of agroforestry in the UK has been limited. This paper adopts Real Options techniques to explore how the decision to adopt agroforestry is influenced by the relative levels of returns from agriculture, forestry and the price of carbon under the scenario where there are financial penalties from livestock Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, financial benefits from carbon sequestration in trees and reversibility in land use decisions. The results are compared to the equivalent findings from a Land Equivalent Value capital budgeting approach to agroforestry adoption. Analysis is based on data from a case study upland livestock farm in Scotland, comparing the impacts of introducing agroforestry into the hill sheep enterprise or the low ground cattle and sheep enterprise. The results suggest that the adoption of agroforestry is far less likely than would be suggested by standard budgeting approaches, especially in more extensive upland enterprises (hill area) where sequestration benefits are low relative to more productive farmland areas (low ground area). Upfront support payments are shown to increase the likelihood of agroforestry adoption. They also have the effect of reducing the rotation length of forestry in such systems.

AB  - Introduction: Polylepis forest is an ecosystem stated with conservation priority and threatened by anthropogenic effects; extensive livestock is one of the most frequent disturbances.
   Objective: To study the effect of livestock on the early stages of regeneration of a quenoa (Polylepis australis Bitt.) forest.
   Materials and methods: Within a pure forest of P. australis at Parque Provincial Potrero de Yala, Jujuy, Argentina, densities of seedlings (<1 year) and saplings (>1 year and <30 cm) were measured in the presence (0.23 heads.ha(-1)) and absence of livestock, for a year. Linear mixed models (normal distribution) were adjusted for density of seedlings and saplings. Data was analyzed with a Chi-square test (X-2).
   Results and discussion: Presence of livestock had no impact on seedling density, but significantly decreased density of saplings (P < 0.001); in areas without livestock (10.58 +/- 6.64 individuals.m(-2)) was three times higher than with presence of livestock (3.17 +/- 3.86 individuals.m(-2)). Difference in density of seedlings and saplings was significantly (P < 0.001) over time. This indicates that there is potential for natural regeneration, but livestock would affect stages after seedling emergence, representing a threat to the forest.
   Conclusion: This study provides important information on livestock management in mountain forests of P. australis. A long-term study of the effect of livestock on seedling and sapling density, and over the entire distribution range, is needed.

AB  - Vegetation restoration on purple soil (Eutric Leptic Regosols) slopes aiming at reducing soil erosion in the Rainy Zone of Western China has significantly altered soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and distribution. A better understanding of the effects of different vegetation restoration types on SOC dynamics and fractions is critical in devising better policy to protect or enhance SOC stocks to improve soil quality and ecosystem function. In the present study, total, labile, and non-labile organic carbon (TOC, LC, and NLC), and carbon management index (CMI) of Cryptomeria fortunei (CF), mixed C. fortunei and Betula luminifera (MF), Neosinocalamus affinis (NA), and Camellia sinensis (CS) were compared with those of Zea mays field (ZM) on purple soil slopes in the Rainy Zone of Western China in order to develop more effective ways to implement vegetation restoration in the future. Different vegetation restoration types (CF, MF, NA and CS) increased TOC stock by 47.79%-118.31% and NLC stock by 56.61%-129.52% in the 0-50 cm soil layer compared with that of ZM. The direction and magnitude of changes in LC stock and CMI, however, depended strongly on the vegetation restoration type. Compared with ZM, CF had the largest increase of LC stock and CMI, whereas NA had the largest decrease of LC stock and CMI in the 0-50 cm soil layer. The LC:TOC ratio in four reforested species all declined significantly compared with that of ZM (p < 0.01), indicating decreased SOC activity after afforestation. The vegetation type and soil depth together explained more than 90% of the changes of TOC and its fractions in the plantations on purple soil slopes. Our study demonstrates that transforming the ZM into the CS is optimal to achieve the sustainable development goal, whereas transforming the ZM into the NA reduces the SOC activity and availability.
